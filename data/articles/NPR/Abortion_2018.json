Doug Ford, the brother of the late controversial mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, has been elected premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province. His center-right Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario won the election Thursday night from the Liberal Party of Canada with 41 percent of the vote, taking 76 of 124 seats in the province, according to local media. \"A new day has dawned in Ontario \u2014 a day of opportunity, a day of prosperity and a day of growth,\" Ford told a jubilant crowd cheering his victory. The election is a surprising upset for the Liberal Party; 53-year-old Ford is a political rookie, having assumed leadership of the Progressive Conservative party just three months ago. A former businessman, Ford ran a populist campaign with promises to alleviate voters' economic anxiety. He'll lead a province that is home to nearly a third of Canada's total population of 36 million people, and the country's manufacturing and financial sectors. \"This victory belongs to the people,\" Ford said to supporters after his win, \"Together we made history. We have taken back Ontario. We have delivered a government that is for the people.\" During the campaign, Ford attacked Canada's elites and the media, saying they drink \"champagne with their pinkies in the air.\" He said he supported President Trump's policies, and promised to stand up \"for the little guy.\" Many of Ford's campaign promises aimed to make life in Ontario more affordable \u2014 slashing income taxes and gasoline prices, while vowing to increase spending on health care and public transit. Ford also supported doing away with the Liberal Party's sex-ed curriculum, safe injection sites and protest-free zones outside of abortion clinics.

He has been elected premier of Ontario.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford campaigns in Northern Ontario last April. He has been elected premier of Ontario. Ford's election comes two years after the passing of his brother, Rob Ford, who served as mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014. \"I know my brother Rob is looking down from heaven. I'm just getting chills talking about him right now,\" Ford said during his victory speech, \"I know Rob is celebrating with us tonight. We owe so much to Rob's legacy.\" Rob Ford's term as mayor was plagued with scandals, and erratic behavior that culminated with his admission that he had smoked crack cocaine. He had won the mayoral election with a core of support in suburban Toronto, called \"Ford Nation.\" Ford passed away from a rare form of cancer in 2016. Just days before his brother's election, Rob Ford's widow Renata filed a $12.3 million lawsuit against Doug Ford, accusing him of mismanaging the family business, and her late husband's estate. Ford has denied the allegations, which have not been tested in court. Ford's election swept aside the Liberal Party, which had been in charge for nearly 15 years. The Guardian reports that the Liberal Party may have lost support by trying to change too much, too quickly: Some of the deep clamour for change emerged simply from the fact that the Liberals had governed for 15 years \u2013 a lengthy stretch for any political party,\" said Cristine de Clercy, a political science professor at Western University in southern Ontario. But the dizzying pace of initiatives rolled out by Wynne's government might have also played a role, said de Clercy, citing a rise in the minimum wage and reforms in workplace legislation and education. \"She asked Ontarians to embrace many initiatives very quickly and I think certainly in some sectors people pushed back. Kathleen Wynne, the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party and the first openly gay premier in Canada, will step down from her post. \"There is another generation, and I am passing the torch to that generation,\" she said. The New Democratic Party, led by Andrea Horwath, won 34 percent of the vote, and will now form the official opposition in Ontario.",

Anthony List's 11th annual Campaign for Life Gala at the National Building Museum on Tuesday. President Trump addressed the annual gala of the anti-abortion group and urged people to vote in the midterm election. In need of strong turnout from the GOP base in the midterm elections, President Trump rallied anti-abortion activists at a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday night, telling voters that failing to turn out for the November midterms would risk undoing the victories they've won during the Trump administration. The speech came just as his administration unveiled a new rule to restrict federal funding to groups that provide or refer patients for abortions. Speaking to donors and other guests at the annual Susan B. Anthony List gala, Trump warned anti-abortion activists against complacency. \"What if Democrats gained power? They will try to reverse these incredible gains, these historic gains,\" Trump said. From the front of a packed ballroom, Trump called out several vulnerable Democrats who've supported abortion rights and face tough Senate races this fall. He told the audience their votes this year are \"every bit as important as your vote in 2016,\" before quickly adding, \"Although I'm not sure I really believe that,\" eliciting laughter from the audience. He went on, joking, \"I don't know who the hell wrote that line,\" before returning to the GOP talking points and promising that the party will campaign for \"every last vote\" this fall. Just a couple of years ago, such a speech would have been unimaginable \u2013 not least of all for the group's president Marjorie Dannenfelser. In January 2016, Dannenfelser was among a group of conservative women who signed on to a letter urging Iowa voters to support \"anyone but Trump\" in their upcoming caucuses. In the letter, the signers said \"we are disgusted\" by Trump's treatment of women, and said that on the issue of abortion, Trump \"cannot be trusted.\" But speaking to the crowd, Dannenfelser called Trump the \"most pro-life President in history\" and a \"man of his word,\" highlighting a list of promises Trump had made and kept to anti-abortion rights voters, including appointing conservative judges and taking steps to cut federal funding to abortion providers. Like Trump, Dannenfelser stressed the importance of voting in the 2018 elections, reminding supporters that the outcome of Senate races this fall could, in turn, determine the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court if there's another vacancy. \"This is an historic moment,\" Dannenfelser said. \"And dear friends and people of good conscience, we are at the cusp of changing history.\" Trump's appearance before the group came on the same evening his Health and Human Services department unveiled a detailed version of a proposed revision to the rules for Title X, the federal government's family planning program. As announced last week, the proposal would block organizations like Planned Parenthood, which perform or refer patients for abortions, from receiving Title X funds to cover services like contraception and STD screenings. Federal funding for abortions already is illegal in most circumstances, but abortion rights opponents have long pushed to cut all public funds to organizations that provide abortions. Critics call the proposal a \"gag rule,\" and warn that the change would make it harder for low-income people to get access to reproductive health services. The document released on Tuesday removes a requirement that birth control methods offered through Title X recipients be \"medically approved.\" It also says that organizations which receive the funds don't have to provide all effective forms of contraception, which reproductive rights advocates describe as a major departure from the way the program has traditionally been run. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens called the proposal \"the worst attack on women's health and rights we've seen from the Trump-Pence administration\" and described the policy as \"straight out of the Handmaid's Tale\" \u2013 a reference to the Margaret Atwood novel and Hulu series about a fictional oppressive regime that forces young women to bear children against their will.",

Just five months ago, almost no one in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District knew Conor Lamb's name. But since quitting his job as a federal prosecutor to run for a vacant House seat, the 33-year-old has spent a lot of time introducing himself to people. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald says that's exactly what he had to do \u2014 particularly as a Democrat in Trump country. \"You gotta show up and talk to people. Conor's been to every fish fry, every VFW, every American Legion, senior center, doors,\" Fitzgerald told NPR's Scott Detrow. \"He's been relating to people. And that's really what it takes for Democrats to get away from just urban areas and get out into the smaller towns and compete.\" And compete he did. Lamb is the apparent winner of the contest for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, according to an analysis by public radio station WESA. The race has not been officially called, but a review of the votes indicates that Lamb has an insurmountable lead over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone. Lamb's victory would be a huge win for Democrats, and a major blow to President Trump. Trump won this district by 20 points in 2016, and Republican Tim Murphy \u2014 who resigned in October after a report that he had encouraged a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion \u2014 won his last eight elections easily. But Lamb seems to have overcome that Republican advantage in this largely white, working-class district by touting his bio \u2014 a Marine Corps veteran, former prosecutor, Catholic; and his more conservative positions \u2014 on guns, abortion, crime. His first TV ad highlights the fact that he grew up in the district. In the same town, in fact, where he now lives \u2014 Mount Lebanon, a suburb south of Pittsburgh. He graduated from Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 2002, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Pennsylvania, and worked as a prosecutor in the Marine Corps \u2014 first in Okinawa, Japan, and then for the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals. After leaving active duty in 2013 and joining the Reserves, Lamb was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh. There, his bio says, he \"led prosecutions against drug dealers and violent criminals and helped establish the Justice Department's Pittsburgh office as a national leader in the fight against the heroin epidemic, working to build partnerships between law enforcement and community members in places that have been hit hardest by the crisis.\" Lamb stepped down from the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall, shortly after Murphy resigned his seat. Though this is his first run for office, Lamb comes from a family that has been active in state and local politics. His uncle is Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb; and his grandfather Thomas Lamb was a state representative, the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate in the 1970s and secretary of legislative affairs for Gov. Robert Casey. Unlike his Republican opponent \u2014 who billed himself as \"Trump before Trump was Trump\" \u2014 Lamb stayed away from making the race about the president or partisan politics. \"The biggest issues facing the 18th Congressional District aren't partisan,\" his campaign website reads. \"Heroin kills both Democrats and Republicans. Health care is too expensive. The roads and bridges we all use are crumbling. But the people we send to Washington aren't solving these problems. I'm running for Congress because it's time for that to change.\" On the campaign trail, Lamb highlighted his work fighting the opioid crisis \u2014 which has hit the region hard \u2014 as well as his support for unions. In a district with 86,000 union households, union endorsement was key to his success. At a rally Sunday night, United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts came out hard for Lamb, calling him \"a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, Social Security-believing, health care-creating and sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat.\" If certified as the winner, Lamb will serve out the rest of the year in the House, representing PA-18. But the district as it is now will cease to exist at the end of the year because of court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania. So if Lamb wants to stay in the House after 2018, he will have to run again \u2014 in a district that is likely to look different from the one he just won.

Saccone has needed millions of dollars in spending from Republican allies to stave off a strong challenge from the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb. At least for one more day, the hills of southwestern Pennsylvania are alive with the sound of campaign cash. Voters in the state's 18th Congressional District on Tuesday elect a new member of Congress. It's a surprisingly close race in this reliably Republican district between Democratic former prosecutor Conor Lamb and Republican state legislator Rick Saccone. GOP and conservative groups are shoveling in dollars to overcome Saccone's lackluster fundraising \u2014 this despite his claim that he \"was Trump before Trump was Trump.\" The Center for Responsive Politics reported Friday the two sides had spent a total of $15.6 million \u2014 slightly more than the most costly House races in 2016, although far less than the maelstrom of a special election in Georgia last year, which cost $69.2 million. Loading... Republicans have poured more than twice as much as Democrats into the Pennsylvania race. That flood of spending comes even though the district won't exist after this November's election, following the state Supreme Court's decision to redraw Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts. Neither Lamb nor Saccone will reside in the redrawn district. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the 18th, but it votes Republican. Trump carried the 18th in 2016 with 58 percent of the vote. Republican Rep. Tim Murphy represented the district from 2003 until this year. He resigned because of an extramarital affair in which he suggested his partner get an abortion. Tuesday's election is to choose his successor. Republicans fear that a loss will chill their hopes of holding control of the House this fall. There's anxiety that if Lamb wins, more Republican incumbents will join the record-setting 37 of their colleagues already headed for the Capitol Hill exit ramp. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway campaigned for Saccone last week, and President Trump flew in for a rally Saturday. Donald Trump Jr. is expected to campaign for Saccone on Monday. Vice President Pence campaigned with  Saccone in February. High-level administration officials, including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Ivanka Trump, also held well-publicized official events with Saccone. Among the luminaries who have stumped for Lamb is former Vice President Joe Biden, who visited the district last week. Saccone's small-town style of campaigning has put him nearly on the sidelines of the campaign. As of last week, he had spent $613,000 to Lamb's $3 million. \"Rick Saccone has had difficulty raising money, to be candid,\" a Republican political operative familiar with the race told NPR. He said Saccone \"doesn't have a natural fundraising base [and] has never really had to do it\" in his campaigns for the state Legislature. So the energy behind the Saccone effort is brought in from Washington, D.C.: the National Republican Congressional Committee and Republican National Committee, plus superPACs Congressional Leadership Fund and America First Action. They and their allies have spent $10.3 million, versus $1.7 million by pro-Lamb entities. \"Normally this would be a bad strategy [for Republicans], but it's clearly the way to stay competitive,\" said political scientist Michael Franz, with the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks campaign advertising and spending. He said that ordinarily, \"it could lead to repeat messages or competitive messages,\" which would hurt, not help, the candidate. In the 2016 elections, Murphy ran unopposed and spent $1.5 million. No outside groups got involved.",

Add Planned Parenthood to the list of organizations looking to take advantage of President Trump's low approval ratings in the 2018 midterm elections. The organization is not new to the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics \u2014 and has often itself become a top issue for Republicans looking to slash federal funding for the organization \u2014 but this year Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action Fund will launch their biggest-ever push to try to tip the balance in Congress and in key states. Planned Parenthood sees the Trump administration as a threat and, with a Republican-controlled Congress, sees the danger to abortion rights as great as it has been in decades. But the upside for progressive groups is that Trump has also inspired a newly energized movement in protest of his policies. The best example of this so far is the massive Women's March on Washington, D.C., a year ago, a day after Trump's inauguration, and the hundreds of smaller marches across the country on that day and since. Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, which along with Planned Parenthood Action Fund constitutes Planned Parenthood's political operation, says the group has committed an initial investment of $20 million to be used mostly on Senate and gubernatorial contests in eight states. \"We will be supporting candidates who support reproductive rights,\" Schifeling says, adding that such rights are \"really at stake in the country, especially this year.\" She says \"we support candidates who support access to Planned Parenthood and who support women and all people making their own health care decisions without interference from politicians.\" Federal funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 which is not an actual line item in the budget, but rather reimbursement for health care services provided to patients \u2014 has become a perpetual political battle in Washington. Republicans in Congress have long made ending any federal dollars for the organization a campaign issue. But so far, the funding survives. Planned Parenthood's target list of states includes Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which were instrumental in Trump's 2016 victory. The others where Planned Parenthood will pour in money and resources are Arizona, Florida, Minnesota and Nevada \u2014 each of which has hotly contested races. Notably, states so far not on the Planned Parenthood target list are two of the more conservative states, each of which has an incumbent Democratic senator on the ballot this year: Missouri and North Dakota. Both are states Trump won easily and where protecting abortion rights is a more difficult case to make with a more conservative populace. This year's Planned Parenthood spending will mostly fund a network of grass-roots volunteers to reach out to voters where health care and the right to an abortion are considered important. That likely means a focus on suburbs and female voters. Schifeling says there will be a \"robust door-to-door canvassing operation,\" but she adds that \"we will also be investing in paid digital and some paid TV [advertising] in key races.\" Voter turnout will be the key. The money being committed this year is already $5 million greater than the $15 million Planned Parenthood spent on the 2014 midterm elections. Meanwhile, groups that oppose abortion rights are also expected to be active in many of the same states. The Susan B. Anthony List is one such organization. It has not released a dollar amount for its 2018 political operations, but it too will fund an aggressive door-to-door campaign in key states including Ohio, Florida and Missouri. Part of the argument these groups will use is that Trump has been their friend, that he named a solid conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch, to the Supreme Court and that such gains need to be protected. For Planned Parenthood, a lesson of 2017 \u2014 when voter discontent over the Trump presidency helped fuel a swing of 16 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats and a near Democratic takeover \u2014 is that there are opportunities.",

Abortion supporters are preparing for a fight. The end of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination sets up a new battleground over abortion rights, and activists on both sides of the issue are gearing up for what's likely to be a series of contentious battles from the high court to state legislatures. Planned Parenthood is unveiling a new strategy designed to prepare for the possibility of a nation without the federal protections for abortion rights outlined in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. In an exclusive interview with NPR, Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said the reproductive rights group is preparing to \"super-size\" its efforts to connect women with abortion services in what could become an increasingly difficult environment. Already, she said, women in many states with restrictive abortion laws have difficulty obtaining the procedure. \"Over the last years, obviously, there has been a great retraction of access for women in this country in many, many states,\" Laguens said. Abortion rights opponents have been working for decades to pass new restrictions at the state and national levels, with their eyes the ultimate prize: overturning Roe and other Supreme Court decisions that have affirmed the right to an abortion. Both sides see that possibility as far more likely with Justice Kavanaugh on the court. He replaced retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had often been the court's swing vote on abortion and other controversial matters. Life After Roe? Planned Parenthood's new strategy to fight back includes three major components: expanding access in states with laws favorable to reproductive rights; policy work aimed at strengthening reproductive rights; and efforts to reduce stigma surrounding abortion. If Roe were overturned or substantially weakened, state legislatures would become the front lines of the fight. Officials at Planned Parenthood and other groups are preparing to lobby state lawmakers and other elected officials to strengthen protections for abortion and remove restrictions already on the books. In states with more liberal laws, abortion rights advocates see an opportunity to shore up and expand access, with an eye toward serving women from other states. That could include expanding access to medicated abortion through telemedicine and using technology to inform women about how and where they can access services, Planned Parenthood officials said. \"Already women across this country have to access funding; they have to access transportation; they have to access housing; they have to access support networks,\" Laguens said. \"That is gonna be a greater need if there are further restrictions when Roe is attacked by this court.\" In Illinois, the organization has expanded its surgical abortion services from two to five locations over the past two years, said Dr. Amy Whitaker, medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois. Whitaker said she already serves women from throughout the Midwest, and she expects to do that \"on overdrive\" if Roe is overturned and surrounding states pass increasingly restrictive laws. \"With Kavanaugh on the court we know that we're gonna need an ironclad network of states and providers across the country where abortion will still be legal and accessible, no matter what happens on the Supreme Court,\" Whitaker said. Cultural influencers As a final step, Planned Parenthood's Vice President of Communications, Kevin Griffis, said the organization recently restructured its communications division to create a team focused on working with \"cultural influencers\" like television writers and producers to tell stories about abortion and reproductive health. The organization has been consulted on shows including CW's Jane the Virgin, HBO's Girls and Fox's Glee, he said. \"[Stigma] truly is at the heart of the attacks that we're seeing,\" Griffis said. \"And I think the key to reducing that is really being able to change people's perception of abortion so that they see it for what it is \u2014 which is a really safe medical procedure and a typical, standard part of healthcare.\" Courts and statehouses Abortion rights opponents also are preparing for the next phase of this fight, said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance. As soon as Kavanaugh was sworn in, Nance said, abortion rights opponents \"were talking about, starting to get together and think about the best cases to move forward, to put in front of the court.\" Several states have passed abortion restrictions that are currently being litigated and could eventually come before the Supreme Court. Iowa, for example, passed one of the most restrictive laws earlier this year. That law, banning abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat could be detected, was blocked by a county judge before it could take effect. Nance said abortion opponents also will be preparing to continue to push for new abortion restrictions at the state level. \"The state legislature for the past 10 years have been very fertile ground for moving the ball down the field on the issue of life,\" Nance said. \"And so we will continue those efforts, and I think we will continue to see success.\" But first, the mid-terms While advocates on both sides of the abortion debate are looking ahead to legal battles in the coming months and legislative sessions next year, neither side is losing sight of another opportunity to rally each base \u2014 the mid-term elections, now less than a month away. The abortion rights group NARAL is launching a $750,000 direct mail and digital ad campaign aimed at suburban female voters in eight cities. The group has also launched a $1 million ad campaign targeting Republican candidates and urging abortion rights supporters to \"vote them out.\" The group is running ads spring-boarding off Kavanaugh's confirmation and warning that the Republican Party \"harms and silences\" women. NARAL, the abortion rights group, has launched a series of digital ads urging abortion rights supporters to vote on the issue. Fresh off their victory in the Kavanaugh fight, abortion opponents are also running mid-term get-out-the-vote campaigns. Mallory Quigley, Vice President of Communications for the abortion opponent group Susan B. Anthony List, said her group's primary focus now is on voter canvassing and other efforts leading up to the mid-term elections next month. \"The Kavanaugh confirmation battle kind of exemplified...why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer,\" she said. \"And that's precisely because the Senate is where Supreme Court justices are confirmed.\"",

Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in a 2007 photo, issued a ruling last week striking down a FEC regulation on anonymous gifts to \"dark money\" groups.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen J. Boitano /AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in a 2007 photo, issued a ruling last week striking down a FEC regulation on anonymous gifts to \"dark money\" groups. Updated at 9:30 p.m. ET A widely used loophole for funneling secret \"dark money\" into political ads closed quietly last weekend, as a federal judge concluded it thwarted Congress' intent to have broad disclosure of political money. Chief Judge Beryl Howell, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, threw out a regulation adopted by the Federal Election Commission in 1980. The rule said that \"non-political\" groups, such as 501(c) nonprofit organizations, could ignore a disclosure law if donors' contributions were not earmarked for specific advertisements \u2014 an exception that wasn't in the law passed by Congress. Howell's decision was issued Friday evening. She listed ways in which the regulation undercut the transparency principles of campaign finance law: \"including informing the electorate, deterring corruption, and enforcing bans on foreign contributions being used to buy access and influence to American political officials.\" At Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, Executive Director Noah Bookbinder, said, \"This case closes one of the loopholes that has allowed the system to get out of control, and gets you back a little bit closer to a system of much more significant public information about who's influencing politics.\" Practically speaking, Howell turned off a conduit through which some $180 million flowed in the 2016 campaign. The use of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations has proliferated in recent elections, especially since 2010, when the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling relaxed the limits on corporate, union and wealthy individual donors. Just-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, who authored the Citizens United opinion, wrote that transparency \"enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.\" But meanwhile, social welfare entities such as the Koch network's Americans For Prosperity and the liberal League of Conservation Voters recruited wealthy donors to finance their ad campaigns anonymously. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics identified 19 501(c) groups that each spent $1 million or more on overtly political \"independent expenditure\" ads in 2016 and would now be affected by Howell's ruling. But the decision does not affect \"issue ads,\" which, unlike independent expenditure ads, avoid explicit vote-for, vote-against messages. It also leaves question marks for 501(c) groups active in the midterm elections, using money raised under the old rules. \"The thing I'd be most concerned about is protecting the donors who gave in good faith,\" said David Keating, president of the conservative Institute for Free Speech. Howell set a 45-day deadline for the FEC to replace the invalid regulation. FEC commissioners had no comment Monday on how they would respond and whether they would seek to appeal the ruling. An appeal is considered unlikely because it would require all four votes on the commission, a six-member panel with two vacancies. The commission is evenly divided, with two Republicans, a Democrat and a Democratic-leaning independent. CREW's lawsuit focused on FEC treatment of spending by the 501(c)(4) group Crossroads GPS, and Crossroads intervened as a defendant. Spokesman Chris Pack said Monday evening, \"This was wrongly decided and we will proceed accordingly after reviewing an array of legal options.\" Crossroads GPS spent $71 million on independent expenditures in 2012, the cycle examined in the lawsuit. It was dormant in the 2016 elections.",

Trump sided against his intelligence officials, who have said Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Updated at 7:13 p.m. ET President Trump's effort to reset relations with Russia backfired at home after he failed to side with the U.S. intelligence community over Moscow's interference in the 2016 election. The president's equivocation drew bipartisan condemnation, capping a week in which Trump alienated allies and cozied up to adversaries. Trump himself declared his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in Helsinki a success, in what he called the \"proud tradition of bold American diplomacy.\" The president said he pressed Putin about Moscow's interference in the election, but he appeared to take Putin's denial at face value, just days after a grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence agents on election-related charges. U.S. intelligence officials are in agreement that Russia interfered in the 2016 election using a wide array of methods, including but not limited to hacking the Democratic National Committee's emails, breaking into American voting infrastructure and launching a sprawling misinformation campaign. But asked directly whether he believed that assessment, Trump was noncommittal. \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,\" Trump said. \"Dan Coats [the director of national intelligence] came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.\" Lawmakers from both parties expressed no such doubts, and some were scathing in their criticism of the president. \"Today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivet\u00e9, egotism, false equivalence and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.\" Presidents Trump and Vladimir Putin hold a joint news conference after a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Yuri Kadobnov/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidents Trump and Vladimir Putin hold a joint news conference after a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki on Monday. House Speaker Paul Ryan also took issue with the president's approach. \"The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,\" Ryan said. \"There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals. The United States must be focused on holding Russia accountable and putting an end to its vile attacks on democracy.\" After last week's indictments, congressional Democrats had urged Trump to cancel the summit with Putin or at least not to meet privately with the Russian leader with no advisers present. Trump ignored those warnings. His one-on-one meeting with Putin lasted almost two hours. \"For the president to side with Putin over his own intelligence officials and blame the United States for Russia's attack on our democracy is a complete disgrace,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. Democrats also wondered aloud whether Russia has some sort of compromising information, or kompromat, on Trump that would allow Putin to control the relationship. Putin dismissed the idea during a post-summit news conference, though he did not explicitly deny it. \"Please disregard this issue and don't think about it again,\" Putin said. Trump quickly added, \"If they had it, it would've been out by now.\" Later in an interview with Fox News's Chris Wallace, Putin said \"we don't have anything on [Trump].\" Hours after the summit had ended, Trump responded to some of the criticism with a tweet from Air Force One saying, \"As I said today and many times before, 'I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.' However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past \u2013 as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along!\" As I said today and many times before, \u201cI have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.\u201d However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past \u2013 as the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018 The meeting in Finland was the first stand-alone summit between the two leaders. They met previously on the sidelines of international gatherings in Germany and Vietnam. Trump said that in addition to the 2016 election, they discussed North Korea, Iran, nuclear proliferation and terrorism. \"I really think the world wants to see us get along,\" Trump said at the meeting's outset. \"I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that frankly we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years.\" In a tweet before the meeting, Trump blamed \"U.S. foolishness and stupidity\" for strained relations, ignoring Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in the United Kingdom and Russian interference in the U.S. presidential race. Conciliatory with Russia, combative with NATO and EU Trump's conciliatory tone toward Putin is a stark contrast to his combative attitude at last week's NATO summit, highlighting once again the president's transactional approach to foreign policy. In a CBS interview over the weekend, Trump drew little distinction between Western democracies that share history and values with the United States and authoritarian regimes in Moscow and Beijing. \"I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,\" Trump said. \"Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump brought an air of congeniality to their one-on-one meeting, which lasted about two hours, and the subsequent news conference.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump brought an air of congeniality to their one-on-one meeting, which lasted about two hours, and the subsequent news conference. McCain found the juxtaposition jarring. \"Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today's press conference marks a recent low point in the history of the American presidency,\" McCain said. \"That the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisers makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable.\" The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, also rejected Trump's description of the EU as a \"foe\" of the United States. \"America and the EU are best friends,\" Tusk tweeted. \"Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news.\" While Putin acknowledged Monday that he wanted Trump to win in 2016, Trump insists he hasn't done Moscow's bidding as president. He has pointed to his efforts to boost U.S. oil exports and increase military spending as measures that would not win any points with Putin. Trump also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats earlier this year in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K. And he agreed to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons, a step that former President Barack Obama had resisted. \"I guarantee whoever is in Russia, they're saying, 'Oh, gee, do we wish that Trump was not the victor in that election,' \" Trump said last week. \"We have been far tougher on Russia than anybody.\" At the same time, Trump has floated the idea of allowing Russia back into the G-7, making it the G-8 once again. Russia was suspended from the group in 2014 in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea. It's not clear what if any agreements the leaders may have reached on Ukraine, Syria, or military exercises in the Baltic states \u2014 all issues Trump said he was willing to discuss with Putin. Aides had warned before the meeting that it might not produce big \"deliverables.\" \"You can't solve problems if you're not talking about them,\" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, in a briefing before the meeting. \"The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,\" he said. After the summit, Huntsman's daughter Abby \u2014 a Fox News host \u2014 was less charitable about the president's diplomatic efforts. \"No negotiation is worth throwing your own people and country under the bus,\" she tweeted.",

While the Supreme Court ultimately punted on deciding whether partisan gerrymandering was legal, the issue took on a political life of its own this year. The issue of gerrymandering \u2014 the ability of politicians to draw legislative districts to benefit their own party \u2014 burst into view as a major political issue in 2018. Even as voters and courts vigorously rejected the practice this year, politicians in some states are doing their best to remain in control of the redistricting process. Critics argue that amounts to letting politicians pick their own voters. \"It's an indication of how desperate legislators are to cling to power that they're willing to give the middle finger to voters in their state,\" said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who researches redistricting. In Missouri, one of the four states where voters approved ballot measures in the fall to rein in gerrymandering, Republican Gov. Mike Parson said lawmakers should repeal the state's new nonpartisan redistricting law, dubbed \"Clean Missouri,\" arguing that it is unconstitutional. Meanwhile, North Carolina's GOP-dominated Legislature is attempting to move a major lawsuit against its redistricting plans from state court \u2014 where it's likely to lose \u2014 to federal court, which could be a friendlier venue. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court considered \u2014 and ultimately punted on \u2014 whether to outlaw the practice. Federal and state courts rejected multiple congressional maps around the country, declaring they were unfairly drawn to handicap political opponents. Pennsylvania's Supreme Court even redrew all 18 of the state's congressional districts after finding the Republican Legislature had tilted the map too far in the GOP's favor. Voters in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah approved limits on partisan redistricting via ballot questions this fall, while lawmakers in Ohio overhauled that state's process to reduce political influence over it. During Michigan's lame-duck session, lawmakers considered but did not pass a bill that would have weakened the independence of the recently approved independent redistricting commission. The focus on redistricting and gerrymandering this year is driven by the calendar. After the 2020 census, congressional seats will be reapportioned among the states, and new legislative and congressional maps will be drawn in time for the 2022 midterms. \"2021 is around the corner,\" said Levitt. Although Democrats have benefited from gerrymanders in states they control (most notably in Maryland), the party has generally begun to embrace nonpartisan redistricting proposals as good policy and good politics. Earlier this month, Democrats in New Jersey's Legislature attempted to change the redistricting process in ways that would have cemented the party's power, only to see grassroots Democratic activists scuttle the effort. \"How can we say Republicans can't do it but we can as Democrats? Shame on us,\" said Marcia Marley, president of Blue Wave New Jersey and a Democratic National Committee member, during a recent rally against the redistricting effort. Both parties are gearing up for the next round of redistricting. Democrats have launched a high-profile effort: the National Democratic Redistricting Project, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. Republicans have their National Republican Redistricting Trust. Outside groups, such as Democratic superPAC Forward Majority, are also strategically targeting statehouse races in the hopes of influencing the next set of political boundaries. The power of gerrymandering The 2018 election results are a powerful demonstration of why politicians want to keep control of redistricting to themselves. Following major Republican gains in the 2010 elections, GOP lawmakers around the country used their control of the redistricting process to cement statehouse and congressional majorities in states such as Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. In addition to increasing the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, GOP control in those states also led to a decisive policy shift in favor of lower taxes, deregulation, weakened labor unions and making access to abortion more difficult. Democrats' share of the midterm vote this year was at a 44-year high, but the Republican-drawn maps in those states mostly protected House Republican incumbents from defeat (two Republican U.S. House members from Michigan lost, and one extremely close race in North Carolina remains undecided pending an investigation into election fraud). Successful partisan gerrymandering rests on one major concept: distributing the votes for your political party more evenly among districts than your opponent. One way to measure how successfully a party is distributing its votes is through what political scientists and legal scholars call \"wasted votes.\" The idea is that any vote for the winner in excess of one more than the loser got is \"wasted,\" as would be the votes for a losing candidate of the same party in another district. This isn't, of course, to say the voters who cast them don't matter \u2014 but these votes didn't directly decide the races. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here As a party that is increasingly dependent on votes from urban areas, Democratic voters are often less efficiently distributed across most states than Republican voters are. But even with population distribution in mind, being in control of the line-drawing process confers enormous advantages to a party. Consider North Carolina, where Republicans were able to keep at least nine of the 10 seats they hold in the House \u2014 in spite of the fact that Democrats received more House votes in the state than Republicans. Democrats held the other three seats. (The outcome of the state's 9th District remains up in the air pending an investigation into possible fraud.) Most of the votes for Democrats would be considered \"wasted\" by being packed into heavily Democratic districts rather than being distributed throughout the state. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here It's a similar story in Ohio, where Republicans statewide beat Democrats 52 percent to 48 percent, but the GOP won 10 of the state's 14 congressional districts \u2014 over 70 percent of the seats. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here This slow-moving political chess game will keep playing out over the next three years (and perhaps longer depending on litigation). But Levitt, the redistricting expert, believes voters are becoming increasingly savvy about the issue. \"This process ... can seem like the sort of thing political scientists care about and eggheads care about but real people don't necessarily reflect on, but I think that is also changing,\" he says.

Bush accepts the Republican nomination for president in 1988. In that speech, he laid out a promise that he would later break, hurting his chance at re-election and changing his party. Rarely have six words meant so much, and so many different things, to so many. They rang out in the Superdome in New Orleans in August 1988 as the vice president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, accepted the Republican nomination for president: \"Read my lips: no new taxes.\" And the crowd, as they say, went wild. A roar had been building, even in that vast and airy stadium, as Bush built up to his payoff line: \"My opponent won't rule out raising taxes. But I will. And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no. And they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again, and I'll say, to them, 'Read my lips: no new taxes.' \" There were other memorable moments in that address, drafted by a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan named Peggy Noonan. The soon-to-be-famous \"thousand points of light\" were mentioned, along with a reference to a \"kinder and gentler nation.\" Both would follow George H.W. Bush for the rest of his life. But it was the \"read my lips\" quip that ignited the convention and caught the attention of the media. Tough-guy talk was not Bush's usual m\u00e9tier. It was far more associated with Reagan, the movie actor, who, as a politician, borrowed from film scripts from time to time. A few years earlier, Reagan had delighted his fans by quoting from a Clint Eastwood movie, where a cop with a very large gun taunted a criminal crawling toward a weapon nearby: \"Go ahead,\" said Dirty Harry. \"Make my day.\" So when Reagan was confronting Democrats and other \"tax increasers\" in Congress, he lifted that line to dramatize his veto threat. Where the phrase came from \"Read my lips\" sounded like a movie, but it wasn't from one of Clint's. William Safire researched the phrase for his column for the New York Times Sunday Magazine. Safire was a lexicographer as well as a political columnist and former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon. He found the first widely public use of the phrase in a song title in 1957 (by Joe Greene) and later in a 1978 album title (by singer Tim Curry) and several song titles in the 1980s. It then migrated into the world of sports and sports clich\u00e9s, from which it was a short leap to political speech. A Reagan aide used it in 1981 about the release of American hostages held by Iran, and even by Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee used it in congressional questioning. Safire concluded, the phrase simply meant \"Listen closely\" or \"Get this straight.\" What was important, though, was that it sounded tough. Bush, all too often, did not. In fact, his campaign had suffered from a perception problem regarding his virility. Newsweek had pictured the former World War II fighter pilot and college baseball player on a boat on its cover with the headline, \"Fighting the 'Wimp Factor.' \" That's something the editor of that article now says he was wrong about, but in the 1988 campaign, it was a narrative that stuck \u2014 and Bush's principal task of his New Orleans convention speech was to dispel that image tout suite. George Bush wades through a crowd in Houston after his victory speech in the 1988 presidential election.\n                \n                    \n                    Mike Spague/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption George Bush wades through a crowd in Houston after his victory speech in the 1988 presidential election. It helped ... then probably hurt \"Read my lips\" succeeded, probably beyond their fondest dreams. Polls showed that after the convention, Bush had a lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis. But if it improved Bush's chances of being elected that year, it may also have ruined his chances of being re-elected in 1992. That was because less than two years after making the no-tax pledge, Bush found himself in circumstances in which he no longer felt he could keep it. Locked in budget negotiations with the majority Democrats in the House and Senate, Bush felt he had to allow higher rates on some existing taxes or the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction bill would shut down important services of the government. So he signed off on a compromise involving revenues as well as spending restraints. Democrats exulted at having forced him to renege. Conservatives seethed. A young Newt Gingrich, elevated to the No. 2 spot in the House Republican leadership the previous year, made no secret of his displeasure. He insisted any option was preferable to any new revenue. That position helped inspire a major Republican challenger to Bush's renomination in 1992. He was Patrick Buchanan, a former communications director for Reagan and a familiar commentator on TV. He announced his campaign for president in December 1991, saying he was running \"because, we Republicans, can no longer say it is all the liberals' fault. It was not some liberal Democrat who said, 'Read my lips: no new taxes,' then broke his word to cut a seedy backroom budget deal with the big spenders on Capitol Hill.\" Reagan and Bush had won two landslides on a platform that was anti-communist, anti-abortion and anti-tax. Global events had greatly diminished the communist threat by 1990, and Bush devoted little of his time and energy to the abortion issue. That left taxes, and for Bush to abandon that citadel as well was an outrage to many on the right. Buchanan gave Bush enough heartburn in the early primaries that the president actually apologized for his tax shift in several interviews in the spring of 1992. But whether he would have done differently in retrospect is another question. In July 1990, the federal government was taking on a new obligation to bail out those harmed in the collapse of the savings and loan industry. The annual budget deficit was already $200 billion a year, and the cumulative national debt had grown from $1 trillion in 1980 (when Reagan and Bush were first elected) to $2.7 trillion. In that same month, the economy was slipping into a recession that was sure to reduce revenues. And Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was about to invade neighboring Kuwait, which would trigger the first Persian Gulf War. Bush knew the time had come to get the nation's fiscal house in order, or something like it. His 1990 compromise began a decade of relatively responsible budgeting that, combined with moves made by the Clinton administration in 1993, enabled the federal government to harvest considerable revenue from the personal computer boom of that decade. As the year 2000 approached, the stock market was booming and the annual budget deficit was nearing zero. Nonetheless, the risk Bush knowingly took with the budget deal turned out to be worse than he realized. He fought off the Gingrich critique and the Buchanan challenge and was renominated in 1992. But he received less than 38 percent of the popular vote in November. The winner was Clinton, who profited from depressed GOP turnout with nearly one-fifth of the popular vote going to a third-party candidate, businessman H. Ross Perot, who ran against the budget deficit and the national debt.",

She's one of 10 Democratic non-incumbent women running in toss-up districts. Democratic non-incumbent women are more than two-and-a-half times as likely as Republican non-incumbent women to be in House races where their chances are toss-up or better. That's according to an NPR analysis of candidate data from Daily Kos and race ratings from Cook Political Report. A record number of women ran for and were nominated for office this year \u2014 that's true among House, Senate, state legislature and governor candidates \u2014 and the overwhelming majority of them have been Democrats. But these data show that even among those women still in the running, those Democratic women on the whole also have a much better chance of being elected as Election Day approaches. Only around 1 in 10 Republican women who are non-incumbent nominees in House races are in contests that the Cook Political Report rates as a \"toss-up\" or better, while the same is true for nearly 3 in 10 Democratic women. Republican and Democratic men fall in the middle. (Throughout this article, numbers will not include Louisiana, which has primaries on Election Day and therefore has not yet nominated House candidates.) Loading... It's not surprising for non-incumbents on the whole to have tough chances of getting elected, especially when facing off against sitting Congress members, who often have name recognition and fundraising advantages. Of the 127 Democratic non-incumbent women candidates remaining in House races, about 1 in 10 are in \"likely\" or \"solid\" Democratic districts. The share is similar for Democratic men. On the Republican side, men do a little better \u2014 more than 1 in 7 are in \"solid\" or \"likely\" Republican districts. None of those are huge numbers, but they are also  \u2014 literally \u2014 infinitely better than the playing field for GOP women. Zero Republican non-incumbent women are in such races. Loading... Why the gender and partisan gaps? In part, the gap between Democratic and Republican women in their chances of winning may be the result of a year in which Democrats are looking particularly strong. In a recent NPR poll, Democrats led Republicans by 9 points among likely voters on the question of whom people wanted to elect to the House in their districts. But, on top of that, it is possible that voters are particularly excited about Democratic women this year. In open primaries this year, female Democratic candidates enjoyed a 10-point advantage over men, as an August analysis from FiveThirtyEight found. It's also possible that the particular women in these Democratic races were well-suited to running in this particular election year. As NPR reported earlier this year, Democratic female veterans may be uniquely effective foils to President Trump, who received multiple military service deferments and works to craft a heavily masculine persona. Some political scientists have also theorized that there is a \"Jill Robinson\" effect among female politicians. The effect is named after legendary African-American baseball player Jackie Robinson, and refers to the possibility that women candidates, expecting gender discrimination or underestimating their own abilities, will only run for office if they are supremely qualified. (However, that wouldn't explain why one party's female candidates are faring better than the other party's.) A dearth of GOP women Just looking at percentages, as we've done here, obscures one very important point in these data: When it comes to raw numbers, men far outnumber women, especially on the Republican side. Here's how the race ratings look in terms of numbers of candidates, rather than shares of candidates. Loading... This year, nearly half of non-incumbent Democratic candidates are women. Meanwhile, women account for roughly 1 in 5 non-incumbent Republican candidates. And this holds true well beyond just this year's crop of candidates. Women account for less than 1 in 5 members of the House and less than 1 in 4 members of the Senate right now, according to data from Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. In both houses, Democratic women outnumber Republicans by approaching 3 to 1. There are many reasons for this. For one, women simply are less likely to be Republican than Democratic (a phenomenon whose causes are far too complicated to get into here). On top of that, Republican women lack a massive, well-established, women-focused juggernaut like EMILY's List \u2014 a group that supports Democratic women who support abortion rights \u2014 to train candidates and raise money. There is the anti-abortion rights Susan B. Anthony List, but it also supports many men candidates. And the conservative group Maggie's List doesn't raise nearly as much money as EMILY's list. In addition, Republican voters are far less likely than Democratic voters to believe there should be more women in office \u2014 which could also contribute to Republican women not having been nominated in many competitive races.",

Bill Walker, announced he was suspending his re-election bid and supporting Democrat Mark Begich. He has been far behind in the polls, and his lieutenant governor resigned for an \"inappropriate overture\" three days earlier. The nation's only independent governor \u2014 Alaska's Bill Walker \u2014 ended his re-election campaign Friday. Walker threw his support to the Democratic candidate, former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich. The Republican candidate, former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy, has been far ahead in polls, but Begich will likely draw closer now. \"Alaskans deserve a competitive race, and Alaskans deserve a choice other than Mike Dunleavy,\" Walker said. It's too late to remove Walker's name from the ballot, so it will take work by Begich's campaign to inform voters about Walker's campaign suspension. Walker's decision comes three days after his lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, resigned over what Walker says was an \"inappropriate overture\" toward an unnamed woman. Walker has declined to provide more details, citing the woman's privacy. Alaska also had a race with three major candidates for governor narrowing down to two candidates in 2014. Mallott, an Alaska Native leader, was the Democratic nominee for governor that year. But he agreed to join Walker's ticket after polls suggested that they would lose in a three-way race against then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican who had succeeded Sarah Palin in 2009. The Alaska Democratic Party backed the Walker-Mallott ticket, which narrowly defeated Parnell. Walker had one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country early in his term. But that approval fell steadily after his veto cut the amount of money the state sends every Alaska man, woman and child from its oil wealth. Money from oil allowed Alaska to be the only state without either an income tax or a sales tax while having the country's highest level of state and local government spending. Walker argued that his proposals were fiscally responsible, but they weren't popular. The Alaska Legislature voted twice to reduce the oil-wealth payments, but many Alaskans continued to blame Walker. He now has one of the lowest approval ratings of any governor. Many Alaska Democrats abandoned Walker, encouraging Begich to run. Begich built a reputation as a moderate in the Senate. But he's run to the left of Walker. He has highlighted his support for abortion rights and his opposition to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Begich applauded Walker's decision. \"I do want to acknowledge the amazing, courageous action that the governor did,\" Begich said. \"He was about Alaska.\" The state is one of the Republican Party's top targets to pick up a governorship, and Dunleavy has built the largest lead in polls of any Republican seeking to pick up a governorship. Dunleavy was one of Alaska's most conservative lawmakers. He left the state Senate over his concerns about the reductions to oil-wealth payments. He's the only Alaska state senator of a majority party who in the past 30 years never was the primary sponsor of a law. But his conservative positions resonated with Republican voters. He defeated businessman and former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell in the primary. Dunleavy said Walker's campaign had a problem after Mallott resigned. \"I think it was a surprise \u2014 not a shock, a surprise \u2014 given what happened with the lieutenant governor,\" he said of Walker suspending his campaign. \"But we've always been focused ... on our race, what we stand for, getting the message out. So we're going to keep forging ahead.\" Walker announced his decision at the convention of the largest Alaska Native organization, the Alaska Federation of Natives. Libertarian Billy Toien also is running. Alaska's Energy Desk's Elizabeth Harball contributed to this report.",

Wade could have a chance of passing now that he is confirmed.\n                \n                    \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters on both sides of the abortion debate demonstrated in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in July concerning Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. It is thought that a challenge to Roe v. Wade could have a chance of passing now that he is confirmed. When Angela Huntington arrived at work on a Wednesday morning in early October, she had to do something she dreaded: turn patients away. Huntington is the manager at the Columbia Health Center in Columbia, Mo., a Planned Parenthood site that recently had to halt its abortion services in the midst of a highly publicized legal fight in the state. Since another Missouri law requires a 72-hour waiting period between counseling about abortion and having the actual procedure, Huntington needed to call every patient on the day's schedule. She told them they could come to her clinic for the counseling but would have to go elsewhere for the abortion. The only other place in the state that they could turn to for an abortion was in St. Louis, a two-hour-drive away. Many patients didn't pick up the phone. When they arrived, Huntington says, some were in tears after learning they had driven hours to Columbia to find that the clinic would no longer be able to perform the procedure. \"They're already in a tough spot, and then you go and have to tell them this information. It's just heartbreaking,\" Huntington says. \"This is their health. This is their well-being. It's an emotional thing for them.\" The battle over abortion rights in Missouri has drawn national attention in recent weeks, after a federal court ruled that two state laws limiting abortion access should stand. One law requires abortion providers to obtain privileges to admit patients to nearby hospitals. The other requires clinics to meet criteria that designate them as outpatient surgical centers. Together, these rules have forced all but one Planned Parenthood health center in the state \u2014 the one in St. Louis \u2014 to stop offering both medical and surgical abortions, according to Emily Miller, a spokesperson for the organization. And, abortion-rights supporters in Missouri say, their state is an example of the kind of \"abortion desert\" that could become more widespread if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. \"Columbia is a microcosm of what is happening [nationwide],\" says Kristin Metcalf-Wilson, the lead clinician for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, a group of clinics that includes the Columbia facility. Similar laws \u2014 which abortion-rights advocates call \"targeted regulation of abortion providers,\" or TRAP laws \u2014 are in place in 24 states. If Roe is overturned, Metcalf-Wilson says, they are likely to proliferate, since Roe is the legal precedent that many judges turn to when invalidating the TRAP laws. For instance, a 2016 Supreme Court decision overturned a TRAP law in Texas on the basis of the rights established in Roe. \"People don't just create their own legislative ideas,\" Metcalf-Wilson says. \"If we allow this to happen in Missouri, it will happen other places.\" And that means continued legal battles and on-the-ground activism for advocates on both sides of the abortion debate. Emily Wales, the general counsel at Planned Parenthood Great Plains, says her team has ongoing litigation against the federal court's ruling in addition to several other laws that make it harder for Planned Parenthood to provide abortions in the state \u2014 and is awaiting the court's response. Wales says neither the admitting privileges requirement nor the ambulatory surgical center requirements are necessary, since abortion is widely considered a safe procedure. \"Providing abortion care in Missouri really is complex and it involves so many different restrictions,\" Wales says. \"The science remains the same no matter what the restrictions are, and the need for care also remains the same no matter what the restrictions are.\" Abortion-rights opponents say the rules help ensure patients have an adequate safety net in place in the case of an emergency. The state's attorney general's office said in a written statement it plans to \"continue to vigorously defend Missouri's commonsense regulations that protect women's health and safety.\" Anti-abortion-rights leaders in Columbia are feeling galvanized by the latest legal ruling, after working for years for this outcome, but they also say their work in the city isn't done. \"As long as Planned Parenthood is open in Columbia, we'll still be there offering our services,\" says Kathy Forck, a director of the Columbia chapter of the 40 Days for Life campaign. \"We started praying there, and we were starting to see that we were helping women to choose life.\" Forck and her fellow activists have been holding daily prayer vigils on the sidewalk in front of the clinic. She says her group suggests to people walking into Planned Parenthood that they instead go across the street to the My Life Clinic, a prenatal clinic affiliated with the anti-abortion-rights Life Network of Central Missouri. The My Life Clinic did not respond to requests for comment. Grassroots organizing is central to the anti-abortion-rights cause, Forck says. She says sympathetic people often approach her when she is wearing shirts or pins around Columbia supporting her cause. And she maintains a local email list with 12,000 names on it. During the 40 Days for Life protests, Forck says, \"people go by and give us thumbs up, they honk, they give us hot chocolate if it's cold.\" Planned Parenthood of Great Plains Votes \u2014 a political organization affiliated with the Columbia clinic \u2014 is also focusing on local activism. Cortney Bouse, a community organizer there, says she is working with University of Missouri students in Columbia to speak out about contraception issues on campus. \"Our role is not to tell them what to do but to help and harness their energy,\" Bouse says, explaining that their focus is \"to try and engage more Planned Parenthood patients and younger people.\" Bouse says right now, she is working on getting supporters to the polls for the November midterm election. Her team in Columbia is working on what she calls a \"relational voter program,\" where activists encourage their friends and family to vote. \"We're in full election mode,\" she says. As grassroots and legal battles continue, the clinic in Columbia remains open for primary care and family planning. Huntington, the clinic manager, says her staffers felt frustrated when they had to stop offering abortions, but they see this latest setback as nothing new. The clinic has been the subject of several years of legal battles, protests and counterprotests. \"We're warriors together,\" Huntington says. \"We're here to fight the fight and keep these doors open.\" Mara Gordon is a family physician in Washington, D.C., and a health and media fellow at NPR and Georgetown University School of Medicine.",

            "article_content": "The battle for the Senate is being fought on Republican-friendly turf, and with three weeks until Election Day the GOP is increasingly optimistic that the chamber will remain in the party's grasp. Fears that a fiery Democratic opposition could turn the map upside down have abated some, now that the GOP base is more tuned in following the confirmation fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But the charged political dynamics of 2018 leave open the potential for drama when results come in on Nov. 6, particularly in 10 close races that will determine whether Republican Mitch McConnell or Democrat Chuck Schumer will be running the Senate next year. After last year's upset in the Alabama special election, Republicans have a slim 51-49 edge in the Senate. Given that and other factors, Democrats have an outside chance to win back control of the Senate if they end up with a net gain of two seats \u2014 something that is unlikely but not completely outside the realm of possibility. Republicans currently have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with two independents caucusing with Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Renee Klahr/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republicans currently have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, with two independents caucusing with Democrats. Republicans have their most favorable battleground in a generation as Democrats are playing almost entirely defense, with 10 incumbents up for re-election in states that President Trump won in 2016. Some in the GOP were salivating at a five- or even six-seat gain at the outset of the cycle. But even the hugely favorable map hasn't been entirely immune to political gravity. Sensing a poor climate this year with Democrats energized against President Trump, several top GOP recruits passed on running, leaving Republicans with second- or third-tier candidates in many targeted races. Overall, only around half of those 10 Democratic seats are now considered truly competitive. Republican leaders have thanked Democratic activists for their intense protest tactics over Kavanaugh's confirmation. Polling and campaign donations suggested that it awoke a dormant GOP base. The question is whether they can sustain that energy for the next month, but even a slightly more invested Republican electorate would ease concerns about the party's grip on Senate control. Here's how the races stand with less than a month until Election Day, including battleground states North Dakota, Nevada, Missouri, Arizona, Indiana, Florida, Tennessee, Montana, West Virginia, Texas \u2014 and four states that have dropped off the GOP target list: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Both Republicans and Democrats pinpoint Sen. Heidi Heitkamp as the most likely to lose on Election Day. As a Democrat in a state that Trump carried by 36 points, Heitkamp may have sealed her fate with her vote against Kavanaugh. She filmed a video explaining her vote, pointing out that she voted for Trump's first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, but it may not matter. The state's at-large GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer hasn't run a stellar campaign to unseat her \u2014 especially with some questionable comments about Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and the #MeToo movement. Such remarks have derailed campaigns before, but in the polarized climate of 2018 it may not matter in such a GOP-heavy state. Sen. Dean Heller is the only Republican running for re-election this year in a state that Hillary Clinton carried, so he was always going to be highly vulnerable. At first, he looked like he could lose a primary after antagonizing Trump in the 2016 election. But the two mended their relationship, and the White House even persuaded Heller's chief primary challenger to run for the House instead. However, Heller has had to move to the right and cozy up to Trump in return, which could hurt him in the general election against freshman Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Republicans feel better about Heller's chances than they did earlier this year, and Rosen will need strong Hispanic turnout and union support from former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's vaunted political machine to win. An NBC News/Marist poll last week showed Heller with a 2-point lead but noted that the undecideds leaned Democratic and were anti-Trump, so Heller may have hit his ceiling. Voters don't seem overly enthused by Rosen, but the lean of the state could win out in this environment. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri lucked out in 2012, after her opponent made controversial comments about rape and abortion that derailed his campaign. Her 2018 opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has avoided any major gaffes, though Republicans early on were grumbling about the state of his campaign and fears that he would be closely linked to the disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned over a massive sex scandal in June. Polls show this race is a dead heat. McCaskill voted against Kavanaugh, giving Hawley a fresh opening in the final weeks. It's also a state that has become a lesser battleground at the presidential level, where Democrats haven't won since 1996, and with Republicans also taking back the governorship when Greitens won in 2016. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was sure to lose his GOP primary after refusing to fall in line with Trump, so he chose retirement instead. Luckily for Republicans, they still got their preferred nominee in Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel who was the first woman in U.S. history to fly a fighter jet in combat and command a fighter squadron. She still had to survive a bitter \u2014 and late \u2014 primary that forced her to the right to win, particularly on immigration issues. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who would make history as the first openly bisexual senator if elected, had a clear path. Sinema has positioned herself as a centrist Democrat, but McSally and Republicans have tried to chip away at her more liberal past when she was a state legislator, including her anti-war activism and calling herself a \"Prada socialist.\" This will be a close fight until the end. Arizona has been changing demographically. Trump carried the state by only 3 points in 2016, but he still dashed growing Democratic hopes of winning statewide, with the governorship and both Senate seats won by the GOP consistently for a decade. Trump may have branded Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly as \"Sleepy Joe,\" but the fact that he has been able to hang on in a state Trump won by nearly 20 points speaks to his political skills, which Republicans privately admit they underestimated. Also, GOP strategists have grumbled that their nominee, Mike Braun, a wealthy businessman who defeated two congressmen to win the nomination, took his foot off the gas pedal after the primary and has been underwhelming. The result is a closer-than-expected contest where Donnelly just might hang on, despite his \"no\" vote against Kavanaugh. While other Democratic incumbents were long preparing for their tough re-election challenges, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson was seen as the most sluggish. Strategists say they're now happy with the state of his campaign, but wealthy GOP Gov. Rick Scott immediately made this a top-tier contest when he jumped in. Republican optimism about a possible slam-dunk has faded since, and Democrats point out that Scott only narrowly won statewide twice in very good GOP years \u2014 which this year may not be. Florida is the ultimate swing state, and the governor's race, with the more energizing Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum, could help boost Nelson. This one may still end up being very close, just given the closely divided nature of the state, but Democrats feel a lot better about this race than they did earlier this year, while Republicans are more pessimistic. Tennessee's Senate race is competitive solely because Democrats were able to land a quality candidate in former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who carried all 95 counties when he was re-elected in 2006. He is a pragmatist more in the way previous Tennessee senators have been \u2014 including retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker. But Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the GOP nominee, is a firebrand conservative, and this race is a test of whether candidates can trump party tribalism that has only grown in recent years. Blackburn and the GOP have hammered home that electing Bredesen \u2014 even if you may have liked him as governor \u2014 could mean handing control of the Senate over to Democrats. Bredesen is still popular, but his numbers appear to be coming back down after leading for much of the race. This is a place where the Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 even though Bredesen put out a statement saying he would have supported his nomination, too \u2014 may have have energized the Republican base at just the right time. Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is one of the incumbents who have proved their mettle repeatedly, and 2018 may be no different. Most Republicans are underwhelmed by their nominee, state auditor Matt Rosendale. But Trump is still very popular here, and he has a personal vendetta against Tester for having helped torpedo the nomination of Trump's personal physician, Ronny Jackson, to be veterans affairs secretary. However, Tester has a good brand in the state and a good record, especially on veterans' issues, so that message may ultimately fall short. Of the Democratic incumbents in states Trump won, the president carried West Virginia by the largest margin \u2014 43 points. But the established maverick brand of Sen. Joe Manchin, who previously served as governor, may still be able to overcome that. Republicans are increasingly pessimistic about their chances here, especially after Manchin became the sole Democrat to support Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans say his re-election was probably a done deal before that, but his crossover only further solidified it for strategists, as they privately grumble that state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has been a lackluster candidate. At first, Republicans were just happy the polarizing former coal executive Don Blankenship didn't grab the GOP nomination, but in hindsight now they wish they had put in more manpower to get a third candidate, Rep. Evan Jenkins, through the primary. In Texas, Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke has generated plenty of grass-roots enthusiasm, eye-popping fundraising numbers and national attention with his unconventional campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. And while Texas is a rapidly changing state, it may not have changed enough this year for an upset. It's still worth watching, though, because O'Rourke could help pull Democrats across the finish line in key House races in places like the Dallas and Houston suburbs by boosting turnout in more liberal areas. Cruz is a polarizing figure, including within the GOP, but O'Rourke may find that getting those final few points to topple him is still too big a challenge, blue wave or not. Four states with Democratic incumbents that voted for Trump \u2014 Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 have largely dropped off the target list for the GOP. In Wisconsin, Sen. Tammy Baldwin's numbers are somewhat weak, but Republican nominee Leah Vukmir still remains far behind her in polling. In Michigan, Republicans have been unimpressed with their nominee, John James, against Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Republican challengers in both Ohio and Pennsylvania haven't been able to truly put either Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey or Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown on notice. There is one more Democratic incumbent to watch, though. In New Jersey, Sen. Bob Menendez finds himself in a tougher-than-expected contest after a corruption trial last year. That resulted in a hung jury and an admonishment from the Senate Ethics Committee, and it dented his usually comfortable edge with voters back home. Still, it will take a lot for a Democrat to lose in New Jersey in the political environment of 2018.",

Women Democratic House candidates like Eastman are generally being significantly outraised by their male Democratic counterparts.\n                \n                    \n                    Nati Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic House candidate Kara Eastman participates in a 4th of July parade in Ralston, Neb. Women Democratic House candidates like Eastman are generally being significantly outraised by their male Democratic counterparts. Gender gaps aren't just for the workplace, and the midterm elections are proving it. An NPR analysis of campaign finance records shows that Democratic women candidates face a fundraising gap, compared to Democratic men, in the party's toughest House races. In Federal Election Commission filings, the women running for Congress have raised an average of $500,000 less than the men, in the 67 most competitive districts as rated by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The analysis found that the 34 Democratic women challenging Republicans in those districts raised a combined $34.5 million from out-of-state donors, compared to $48.3 million raised by the Democratic 33 men. Out-of-state money is a growing, and critical, building block in House races. Loading... In Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, first-time Democratic candidate Kara Eastman reported raising $783,953 in her most recent filing June 30. Republican incumbent Don Bacon had raised $1.8 million. \"I mean look, we anticipate that we will be outspent in this race,\" said Eastman, a social worker and nonprofit executive who won the party primary in an upset. The district includes Omaha and its suburbs \u2014 a single media market, which saves candidates many thousands of dollars for TV advertising. Eastman's fundraising was still below the million-dollar mark at her latest disclosure deadline, June 30. Small donors \u2014 those who gave $200 or less \u2014 account for 44 percent of her funds. Conversely, Bacon raised 44 percent of his money from political action committees, which gave just 5 percent of Eastman's funds. \"We continue to raise money. Actually over 90 percent of my money has come from individuals,\" Eastman told NPR. The small-dollar contributions are \"something I'm really proud of.\" If the lopsided fundraising numbers for women candidates are a surprise, it's only because the numbers of women candidates have surged this year. \"For the last 20 years for sure they just have always trailed behind,\" said Taryn Rosenkranz, founder of New Blue Digital Strategies, a liberal consulting firm in Washington, D.C., \"and I'm sure it's for the last 100, or however long we've been tracking financial contributions.\" There are structural reasons for the gap. The fundamentals: many women earn less than men, and have less wealth to share. \"Men giving money to politics tend to give more money than women,\" said Kira Sanbonmatsu, senior scholar at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. In the long run, she said, \"Women have not had that same giving tradition in politics.\" But a new tradition is emerging. EMILY's List, founded in 1985 to elect pro-abortion rights Democratic women, now claims 5 million supporters. Its various affiliated committees have raised $91 million this election cycle. Angie Craig a Democrat running in a House district outside of the Twin Cities, is getting fundraising help from a network of donors who give to Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Mone/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Angie Craig a Democrat running in a House district outside of the Twin Cities, is getting fundraising help from a network of donors who give to Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass. And there are other, smaller fundraising networks, including the one helping Angie Craig, a Democratic challenger in Minnesota. A health-care industry executive, Craig is in a rematch with Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, who edged her out by two percentage points in 2016. The fundraising network helping her is based half a continent away, in Massachusetts and was established by Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass. Craig told NPR that she was one of several candidates running in swing districts who Clark wanted her donors to help. Clark said the network was there for her five years ago: \"When I ran for Congress back in 2013, I had the exceedingly rare donors that were majority women.\" So now, with a safe seat, she's sharing the donors with other Democratic women. \"What I have tried to do in this effort to flip the House and elect more women to Congress is tap that network of donors,\" she said. The fundraising picture for the Democratic women will become clearer, and perhaps brighter, when the next reports are filed in mid-October.

Running a tight re-election race in a conservative state, Manchin has faced pressure to support Kavanaugh.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., listens to Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 6. Running a tight re-election race in a conservative state, Manchin has faced pressure to support Kavanaugh. Updated at 7:30 p.m. ET As the confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh neared, both parties had seen potential political benefits for them in the upcoming midterm elections. For Republicans, it was a chance to energize the base by putting another conservative justice on the court, potentially reshaping it for a generation. For Democrats, the specter of rolling back abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act and more was a way to further energize an already engaged liberal base to go to the polls. But with Kavanaugh now facing decades-old allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman while in high school, his once-assured confirmation has been upended and the process is being pushed back with little time \u2014 just seven weeks \u2014 before Election Day. Both Republicans and Democrats in high-profile Senate contests are calling for more investigation into the matter, with an open hearing featuring Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, now scheduled for next Monday. However, some candidates have cast doubt on the timing and motivation of the allegations. Republicans only have a slim 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Democrats are largely playing defense this cycle, but they now have a narrow but not completely implausible path to reclaiming a majority, which would hamper the massive reshaping of the federal judiciary that President Trump has been able to execute with a GOP-controlled chamber. NPR sought out comment from every major candidate in competitive Senate contests being decided in November. In some of the tightest races there was a cautious tone. For instance, in the open Arizona Senate contests, where two women will face off \u2014 Republican Rep. Martha McSally versus Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema \u2014 both said the allegations against Kavanaugh were serious and merited further investigation. McSally said that hearing testimony from both Kavanaugh and Ford was a \"sensible way forward.\" Sinema said that judicial nominees \"should be carefully vetted and judged without partisanship.\" Democratic incumbents in states that Trump carried are already top GOP targets and were under pressure to cross the aisle and vote for Kavanaugh. All of them said that the accusations merited further investigation. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp underscored that it takes \"courage for any woman to speak up about sexaul assault,\" while Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said she was \"deeply troubled by these allegations.\" West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said that \"Professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name.\" But some GOP challengers suggested that there were partisan motivations behind Ford's accusations. Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is challenging Heitkamp, said that \"it is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations\" and that while it should be taken seriously, \"absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation process should proceed.\" Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is running against McCaskill, said in statement that while he believes both Ford and Kavanaugh should \"be heard immediately and under oath,\" the timing of the \"30-year-old allegation\" was suspect. \"The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don't care about the truth,\" Hawley said. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Manchin, said that the \"allegations should absolutely be taken seriously, but Senate Democrats have done a disservice to the accused, the accuser, and the American people, by politically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these allegations.\" In the Tennessee Senate race, GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a fierce Trump defender, took one of the hardest lines. She pointed out that Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has known about these allegations since this summer (although Ford only came forward publicly this weekend), and called it a \"delay tactic\" and that Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, \"should proceed with the vote.\" Her Democratic opponent, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, responded that \"Ford should be heard. If U.S senators are not going to give a careful and thorough consideration of Supreme Court nominees, then I don't know what they think their job is.\" Both parties are already running ads about the allegations. The conservative Judicial Crisis Network announced a $1.5 million ad blitz with an ad featuring Louisa Garry, who has been friends with Kavanaugh for 35 years. \"He's dedicated to his work. He's dedicated to his family. He is of the highest integrity as a person and I believe that he would be a great Supreme Court Justice,\" she says in a direct-to-camera ad. Meanwhile, the liberal group Demand Justice is launching a $700,000 digital and TV campaign targeting Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who's the most endangered GOP incumbent up for re-election in 2018; Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, who is up for re-election in 2020; and moderate swing votes Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Below are full statements, tweets or other public comments from Senate candidates in competitive races, along with their ratings by the Cook Political Report. If a candidate has not responded to a request for comment, it is noted, and we will update if they make a statement. Republican Rep. Martha McSally: \"This is a very serious allegation. Senator Grassley said he's reaching out to both parties for more information, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford have said they are willing to provide testimony on this matter. That is a sensible way forward.\" Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema: \"The allegation is concerning and the Senate should conduct a thorough investigation before voting. Judicial nominations, especially to the highest court in the U.S., should be carefully vetted and judged without partisanship.\" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, via Twitter: \"I'm still waiting for a meeting with Judge Kavanaugh I've requested four times. I have a number of questions for him. Meantime, I agree there should be an investigation of the new allegations against him. I believe the people involved should appear before the Judiciary committee.\" Republican Gov. Rick Scott: No response yet Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, via Twitter: \"The allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh are serious and merit further review. Given the nature of these allegations, and the number of outstanding questions, I believe the Judiciary Committee should hold off on Thursday's scheduled vote. - Joe\" Republican nominee Mike Braun:  \"I support Senator Grassley's decision to have these 11th hour allegations thoroughly reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and weighed against Judge Kavanaugh's decades of public service, sterling record on the bench, outstanding personal reputation, and his unequivocal denial of the allegations.\" Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, via Twitter: \"This is serious. Christine Ford should be heard before the Judiciary Committee moves forward on a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" Republican nominee John James: No response yet Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, via Twitter: \"These are very serious allegations. Both Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford have agreed to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee and that needs to happen. And we must have a full and thorough investigation before anything else can happen with this nomination.\" Republican nominee Karin Housley: My thoughts.... pic.twitter.com/YKHmBqdxx3 Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith: \"Having met with Judge Kavanaugh, I found him to be imminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and remain confident of his confirmation.  I have serious reservations regarding the questionable timing and handling of this last-minute allegation.  The Democrats knew about this months ago and chose to wait until now to release it.  The Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the allegation.  This process should go forward so both sides can be heard.\" GOP challenger Chris McDaniel, via Twitter: \"The same talking heads who protected Bill Clinton are the very ones destroying Brett Kavanaugh. Let that sink in.\" Democratic former Rep. Mike Espy: \"I agree with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee that these allegations are serious and troubling. This matter must be fully investigated before the Senate moves forward with the lifetime appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\" Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, via Twitter: \"On Judge Kavanaugh: I am deeply troubled by these allegations. They should be examined thoroughly and fairly by the Judiciary Committee without any artificial timeline.\" Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley:  \"I'm concerned that Senator Feinstein and the Democrats waited until the last hour to bring this 30-year old allegation to light. The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don't care about the truth. I believe allegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded. That's why it's important that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh be heard immediately and under oath.\" Democratic Sen. Jon Tester: \"I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we need to get the facts about these serious allegations. I take my Constitutional duty to screen Supreme Court nominees very seriously, and I'll keep trying to get a meeting with Judge Kavanaugh to ask him tough questions about this lifetime appointment.\" State Auditor Matt Rosendale: Rosendale spokesman Shane Scanlon: \"Matt agrees with President Trump that we should have a full process and hear from both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. This is a serious accusation, which is why it remains deeply concerning that Dianne Feinstein and Senate Democrats sat on this information for so long and then leaked it at their convenience, right before an important vote.\" Republican Sen. Dean Heller: No response yet Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen: \"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's account is credible, it should be taken seriously, and I agree with the bipartisan calls for an immediate and thorough investigation before the Judiciary Committee moves forward. If Senator Heller still has \"no reservations\" about confirming Judge Kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment on the nation's highest court, then he isn't listening to Nevadans.\" Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, via Twitter: \"This is exactly why we can't rush nominations. How can we vote on Kavanaugh when disturbing, credible allegations of sexual assault have been made? Even Republican Senators Jeff Flake & Bob Corker want to delay the vote. I agree. #DelayTheVote.\" Republican nominee Bob Hugin, via Twitter: \"An allegation this serious in nature should be fully investigated. I am hopeful that Senators in both parties will ensure that happens immediately.\" Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp: My statement on the allegation about Judge Kavanaugh: pic.twitter.com/0mSnGvtEbL Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer: \"It is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations. Of course any allegation of this nature should be taken seriously, but absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation process should proceed.\" Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown: \"I agree with Senators on both sides of the aisle that the Judiciary Committee should take the time it needs to investigate.\" Republican Rep. Jim Renacci: \"The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are serious and should be thoroughly examined, and by the same standard, anyone who calls on Kavanaugh to step aside based on these allegations must also call on Sherrod Brown to resign given the substantial evidence and affidavits detailing Brown's history of domestic violence.\" (Note: The Columbus Dispatch has more on the decades-old allegations against Brown, which his ex-wife refutes) Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, via Twitter: \"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford has bravely come forward and deserves to be heard. What she describes in her interview is a violent sexual assault, which should be disqualifying for a nominee to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Committee should postpone Thursday's vote and conduct a full review of this matter.\" Republican Rep. Lou Barletta: \"We should take allegations of this nature seriously. It is unfortunate that Senate Democrats waited until the 11th hour to bring to light information they have had in their possession for months, leaving little option for giving Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser a fair hearing. Ranking Member Feinstein and her colleagues have played politics with both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser on one of the most sensitive issues our society deals with. That is unacceptable and beneath the jobs they were elected to do. In light of the recent allegation, it would be best for Judge Kavanaugh, his accuser, and the American people to hear testimony immediately from both sides in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\" Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, on the Hugh Hewitt radio show Monday morning: \"I have to tell you, after all the vetting that Judge Kavanaugh has been through to be a judge, a federal judge, and then the fact that this letter is something that Sen. Feinstein has had since July, I think that this is a delay tactic, and I think that Sen. Grassley should proceed with a vote.\" Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, via Twitter: \"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford should be heard. If U.S senators are not going to give a careful and thorough consideration of Supreme Court nominees, then I don't know what they think their job is.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz: \"These allegations are serious and deserve to be treated with respect. Professor Ford should have a full opportunity to tell her story before the Judiciary Committee, and Judge Kavanaugh should have a full opportunity to defend himself. That hearing should be sooner, rather than later, so the committee can make the best assessment possible of the allegations.\" Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke: No response yet Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, via Twitter: \"Professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name. Both have said they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and I hope they will be given the opportunity to do that as quickly as possible.\" Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey: \"I have full confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committee and President Trump's team to handle these allegations in an appropriate and timely manner, allowing both sides to be heard. It is disappointing, however, that Senate Democrats held this information for weeks only to drop it on the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote. The allegations should absolutely be taken seriously, but Senate Democrats have done a disservice to the accused, the accuser, and the American people, by politically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these allegations.\" Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, via Twitter: \"I have read Dr. Ford's letter and I find the allegations deeply disturbing, serious and credible. There should be no vote on this lifetime nomination for our highest court until this matter is fully investigated and Dr. Ford and the nominee appear before the Senate Judiciary Cmte\" Republican nominee Leah Vukmir:  \"These are serious allegations and both the accuser and Judge Kavanaugh should have an opportunity to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Additionally, while the Senate continues to evaluate Judge Kavanaugh, it's disappointing Senator Baldwin has been unable to do her job and meet with him.\"",

Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., laughs with an attendee at an event sponsored by the West Fargo Police Department on Aug. 7. Heitkamp is one of 10 Senate Democrats facing re-election in November in states President Donald Trump won in 2016. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable Democrats running for re-election in this year's midterm elections. Her future may depend on how closely she can align herself with President Trump without angering members of her own party. Heitkamp must walk that fine line because she's campaigning in a state that went for Trump by more than 35 points in 2016. That pressure was on display this week after she became one of the first Democrats to meet privately with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's pick to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. It is a tricky strategy. But Heitkamp believes her personal warmth, energy and independent credentials are better qualities for a U.S. senator than a record of voting 100 percent with Trump. \"You know I can only be who I am,\" Heitkamp said in an interview on the campaign trail in North Dakota. \"I think why people like me is that I only am who I am, and that I've only been out there fighting for North Dakotans. I don't have a tribe that I'm representing except the state.\" That seems to come naturally for Heitkamp. She's the kind of politician who lives for parades and county fairs, who exudes the energy of a football coach and has an affable, neighborly greeting for everyone she meets. It's something she's famous for across the state. Her opponent, Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, says personality and independence aren't enough to win in a state like North Dakota, where Trump remains hugely popular. \"If you were to ask me what her biggest challenge is, it's damn near insurmountable without changing parties,\" Cramer said in an interview. \"She is a Democrat, and that is a \u2014 that is nearly a fatal political flaw in North Dakota right now.\" Heitkamp sees it as a feature of her campaign, not a flaw. \"I say if you want someone who is going to vote with the president 100 percent of the time then I'm probably not your candidate,\" Heitkamp said. \"I don't think the president is 100 percent right. I don't think anyone's 100 percent right. My vote belongs to you and not to a political party.\" She says that kind of honesty is a key to her appeal. It doesn't hurt that many people here just seem to like her. Her straight-talk approach and ease with retail politics was on full display on a recent night in West Fargo, where she and Cramer were both out meeting voters at an event sponsored by the police department. From the moment Heitkamp arrived, she appeared in her element. She was shouting greetings to volunteers, taking selfies and joking about taking a turn in the dunk tank. \"No I'm not going in there,\" she said, laughing. \"I did that once \u2014 people were having way too much fun ... even if they don't hit it right, they still go over and press the button!\" Just a few yards away Cramer was waiting for a flag ceremony to begin. Cramer and Heitkamp often cross paths back home while they campaign, and on this night their differences couldn't have been clearer. Where Heitkamp is buoyant, Cramer is subdued. It's a contrast highlighted in the first five seconds of his latest campaign ad. It opens with retired Air Force Lt. Col. Patricia Traynor, sitting around a table in a pool hall with a group of mostly older, male veterans. \"I like Heidi,\" she says. \"Who doesn't like Heidi? But I don't like the way she votes in Washington.\" Aides for Cramer say they spent \"six figures\" to air the ad on TV and radio for two weeks \u2014 a fairly hefty sum in a state without the expensive media markets of major cities. Cramer openly admits Heitkamp is popular, but says her politics are out of step with the state today. Cramer likes to point out that he and Heitkamp were both elected to Congress on the same day in 2012; she won by less than one percent, while he won by more than 13 points The incumbent congressman's margin of victory grew to 45 points in 2016 as the state shifted even further to the political right. His pitch this year is that he is a reliable Republican in an increasingly red state, voting with the party on everything from abortion to taxes. And he has Trump to help him undercut Heitkamp's centrist message. Trump came to North Dakota, telling voters at a rally that Cramer's vote was necessary to enact the full Trump agenda \u2014 like moving the Supreme Court further to the right. \"We need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate,\" he said. \"Heidi will vote 'no' to any pick we make to the Supreme Court \u2014 she will be told to do so.\" That message resonates deeply with voters here, particularly as Democrats are fighting to block Kavanaugh's confirmation. Heitkamp broke with party leaders to be one of the first Democrats to meet with Kavanaugh on Wednesday \u2014 and she also has taken to openly embracing Trump in her own ads, including one that aired across the state this summer. \"I'm Heidi Heitkamp, and when I ran for the Senate six years ago I said I wouldn't vote the party line, because I don't think either party has all of the right answers,\" she says, looking directly into the camera. \"That's why I voted over half the time with President Trump.\" Heitkamp is staking her future on the belief that North Dakotans want a tough, dealmaking moderate, not a rubber stamp. \"I think the easiest thing in the world is to pick a team and run to that side and jump up and down and say, 'Look at me,' \" Heitkamp said. \"The hardest thing in the world is to try and figure out how you can bridge the differences.\" North Dakota's relationship with Trump is complicated. For one thing, farmers are anxious about Trump's aggressive tariffs and a looming trade war with China. Angy Bartlett is mayor of the tiny town of Courtenay, in the middle of miles of farmland about two hours west of Fargo. While she's not a farmer herself, Bartlett says the tariffs are on everyone's minds. \"My livelihood comes from the farmers, so yeah \u2014 yeah, we're concerned about all of that,\" she said in an interview. \"The farmers are our bread and butter in these small towns in North Dakota. So we need to take care of them.\" Bartlett doesn't call herself a Democrat, but she's voting Heitkamp this year. The tariff message helps, but Bartlett says she likes that Heitkamp is from a small town, cares about farmers and is personable. People also seem to like that Heitkamp is an independent voice. The question is if enough people like that. \"I think Kevin Cramer's whole history in service has been running to one side and not trying to bridge the gaps,\" she said. \"And if someone like me can't get elected to the United States Senate because I'm too moderate, you know, I don't know what happens for governing later on.\"",

            "article_content": "Heidi Heitkamp is running an uphill battle in the increasingly red state of North Dakota. She's trying to defeat GOP challenger Rep. Kevin Cramer by emphasizing bipartisanship.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: So what do you do if you're a Democrat running for re-election in a state that President Trump won by more than 35 points? That is the challenge facing Heidi Heitkamp, Democratic senator from North Dakota. She's being challenged by a Republican, Kevin Cramer. In that state, she's considered one of this year's most vulnerable Democrats. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports that in this campaign, Heitkamp is betting on bipartisanship. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Heidi Heitkamp is the kind of politician who lives for parades and county fairs. But she draws a line at the dunk tank. HEIDI HEITKAMP: No, I'm not going in there. I did that once. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah? SNELL: From the moment Heitkamp arrived at a festival sponsored by the West Fargo Police Department, she was shouting greetings to volunteers and taking selfies. But she wasn't going in the tank. HEITKAMP: People were having way too much fun. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Every time, you're going down. Right? HEITKAMP: I know. Oh, yeah. Add even if they don't hit it right, they still go over and press the button. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Right. SNELL: Just a few yards away, her opponent in this year's Senate race, Kevin Cramer, was waiting for a flag ceremony to begin. Cramer and Heitkamp often cross paths back at home while they campaign. And on this night, their differences could not have been clearer. Heitkamp is at home at events like these. Her charm and relatability are a kind of universal truth here. Cramer is subdued, a contrast confronted in the first five seconds of his latest ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"VOTE CRAMER\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I like Heidi. Who doesn't like Heidi? But I don't like the way she votes in Washington. SNELL: They were both elected to Congress on the same day in 2012, and Cramer likes to say there are voters out there who walked into a voting booth and checked the boxes next to both of their names that day. Now they're being forced to choose. Cramer's pitch is that he is a reliable Republican in an increasingly Republican state. He votes with the party on everything from abortion to taxes, and Heitkamp doesn't. And Cramer has President Trump to help him undercut Heitkamp's centrist message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we need Kevin Cramer to replace liberal Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in the Senate. Got to have him. Got to have him. SNELL: Trump came to North Dakota to make the pitch that Cramer would provide a critical vote for the Trump agenda, including shifting the Supreme Court further to the right. And Cramer says voters know innately that he will do just that. KEVIN CRAMER: It's certainly not a campaign theme. It's just something that, among our 300,000 voters and me and the intimacy that we have with each other, you know, they know I support President Trump and he supports me. SNELL: That message resonates deeply with voters here, particularly as Democrats are fighting to prevent Trump's latest pick for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, from being confirmed. That may be why Heitkamp voted for his last pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and she's defying party leaders to meet with Kavanaugh today. And sometimes, she directly embraces Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"HEIDI HEITKAMP\") HEITKAMP: I'm Heidi Heitkamp. And when I ran for the Senate six years ago, I said I wouldn't vote the party line because I don't think either party has all the right answers. That's why I voted over half the time with President Trump. SNELL: Heitkamp knows there's a lot of support for Trump here. Still, she's staking her future on the belief that North Dakotans want a moderate, not a rubber stamp. HEITKAMP: I guess if people want somebody who's going to vote for Trump a hundred percent of the time and the majority of people of North Dakota think that then, you know, that doesn't bode well for my re-election. SNELL: But North Dakota's relationship with Trump is complicated. For one thing, farmers are anxious about Trump's aggressive tariffs and a looming trade war with China. Angy Bartlett is mayor of the small town of Courtenay. It's in the middle of miles of farmland, about two hours west of Fargo. While she is not a farmer herself, Bartlett says the tariffs are on everyone's minds. ANGY BARTLETT: My livelihood comes from the farmers, so yeah. Yeah, we're concerned about all of that. The farmers are our bread and butter in these small towns in North Dakota. So we need to take care of them. SNELL: Bartlett doesn't call herself a Democrat, but she is voting for Heitkamp this year. The tariff message helps. But Bartlett says she likes that Heitkamp is from a small town, cares about farmers and she's personable. The question is if enough people like that. HEITKAMP: If someone like me can't get elected to the United States Senate because I'm too moderate, you know, I don't know what happens for governing later on. SNELL: But Cramer thinks that the D after Heitkamp's name on the ballot will mean more in the voting booth than the warm feelings people have about her personality. CRAMER: If you were to ask me what her biggest challenge is, it's damn near insurmountable without changing parties. She is a Democrat, and that is a nearly fatal political flaw in North Dakota right now. SNELL: And this year's race will test whether the old-school style of county fair campaigning can defy the tribalism of politics in 2018. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, West Fargo, N.D.

Joe Donnelly is facing pressure from the right as he prepares to vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh just weeks before Election Day. Updated at 9:57 a.m. ET It's not every midterm election year that a Supreme Court seat is vacant \u2014 much less the court's swing vote \u2014 and the senators whose re-election bids could swing control of the U.S. Senate next year are well aware. Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly is running to hold on to his seat in a state President Trump won by nearly 20 points. He and another vulnerable Democrat, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, are meeting with President Trump's nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, on Wednesday. Their re-election campaigns are being complicated by the Supreme Court fight, which has brought millions of dollars in ads and activists to their home states, as well as those of other moderate senators trying to save their jobs in November. On a sunny afternoon last week in Indianapolis, a bus bearing a giant picture of Kavanaugh's face pulled up in front of the state Capitol. After climbing off the bus, Janae Stracke, national field director with Concerned Women for America, told local activists she wants them to put pressure on Donnelly to support Kavanaugh, whom she calls \"the next great justice.\" With Kavanaugh's appointment, Stracke said, \"President Trump is following through on his word.\" Stracke noted that many Republican voters said they were motivated to turn out for Trump in 2016 because of concerns about the balance of the Supreme Court. She wants to send a similar message to their senators ahead of the November election. \"That's why we want to continue to rally support and talk to some of the senators like Sen. Donnelly,\" Stracke said. Donnelly voted to confirm President Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. In a statement, his re-election campaign press secretary Kate Oehl said in part, \"He'll take the same meticulous and thoughtful approach that he has taken throughout his career. That includes listening to the opinions of Hoosiers on both sides of the aisle as he thoroughly reviews the record and qualifications of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.\" Concerned Women for America is working with local activists like Susie Moore, a volunteer who is asking friends and neighbors to call or write Donnelly's office and ask him to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. Moore said she's opposed to abortion rights and concerned about what she sees as an erosion of religious freedom. She said the well-being of \"future generations\" is at stake in this fight. On the other side of the country, Republican Sen. Dean Heller is running for re-election in Nevada, where Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Last week, a group of women dressed in matching purple NARAL Pro-Choice America shirts stopped by Heller's Reno office to express their opposition to Kavanaugh's nomination. Activists from NARAL Pro-Choice America stand outside the office of GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Reno, Nev. Heller is facing a tough re-election bid in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and activists on the left are putting pressure on him to oppose President Trump's Supreme Court nominee.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Activists from NARAL Pro-Choice America stand outside the office of GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Reno, Nev. Heller is facing a tough re-election bid in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and activists on the left are putting pressure on him to oppose President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. As the women gathered around the front desk, Sandy Miller, 54, told a staff member she worries Kavanaugh would vote to roll back abortion rights. \"I am the last year of the baby boomers, and people in my age did this already. We've already fought this [fight] based on what people wanted \u2014 what women wanted,\" Miller said. \"And Sen. Heller needs to stand up for us.\" Heller communications director Megan Taylor said, \"Sen. Heller always appreciates the opportunity to receive input on important policy issues from his constituents, and that's why he spent last week traveling around the state to meet with Nevadans from Reno to Boulder City.\" She added that Kavanaugh's record shows he's a \"well-qualified, mainstream jurist,\" and therefore Heller has \"no reservations about supporting his nomination.\" Ads, letters, phone calls Kavanaugh's opponents are taking a similar message to the airwaves and online in other states, including those with Republican senators considered potentially persuadable, even if they aren't on the ballot this year. Planned Parenthood has a six-figure ad campaign in Maine and Alaska, focused on Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who've supported abortion rights in the past. Abortion is a major focus of the fight over Kavanaugh. But other issues are also part of grass-roots lobbying efforts, like letter-writing drives, phone banks and ad campaigns. The health care advocacy group Protect Our Care is investing $250,000 so far on ads opposing Kavanaugh in Alaska, Maine, Nevada and Washington, D.C. The League of Conservation Voters has ads criticizing Kavanaugh's environmental record. Millions are also going into ads to support him. One of the biggest campaigns, valued at more than $4 million, is being led by the Judicial Crisis Network, with a heavy focus on more conservative states including Indiana that have Democratic senators. Another big spender is the National Rifle Association, which is behind a seven-figure ad buy in support of Kavanaugh. The Senate will hold hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination starting Sept. 4, just after the Labor Day holiday as voters' attention starts turning toward the midterms, with a floor vote expected weeks after.",

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: I have a 14-year-old. I would not want him to be governor of Vermont (laughter) or any other state. But let me turn us to the balance of the U.S. Supreme Court, which is of course a big issue for senators up for re-election this year. President Trump's nominee for the court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, will be on Capitol Hill tomorrow meeting with two of them - Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. These are both Democrats trying to get elected again in states that Trump won, so they are seen as vulnerable and as potentially persuadable.

Only 17 percent of Americans say they want the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling overturned, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Three-quarters of Americans think the Supreme Court should not overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal nationwide, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. But that result includes a degree of nuance. Loading... Just 17 percent say they support overturning Roe outright. Another 24 percent say they want Roe kept in place, but they want to see more restrictions on abortion. Just 17 percent want to keep Roe the way it is; 1 in 5 (21 percent) say they want abortion rights expanded to any circumstance and another 15 percent want Roe kept in place and want some restrictions reduced. In all, that means 41 percent want Roe either overturned or want to see more restrictions on abortion rights, while 53 percent want Roe either kept as is or have abortion rights expanded. The poll comes as the U.S. Senate is set to consider President Trump's nomination of federal Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh would replace Anthony Kennedy and would almost certainly be more conservative. On the top of the minds of both liberals and conservatives is the fate of Roe v. Wade and abortion rights. Legal experts familiar with Kavanaugh's writing believe he might not vote to outright overturn Roe but could use a scalpel to winnow abortion rights. Abortion rights is often seen as a women's issue, but they view abortion very differently depending on their party. Democratic women largely want to expand abortion rights, with 54 percent wanting to either make abortion legal under any circumstance or to reduce some of the restrictions put in place. Democratic men are actually, according to the poll, the most likely to say they want to make abortion legal under any circumstance (35 percent). The group most ardently in support of outright overturning Roe, according to the poll, is Republican women, who often fuel anti-abortion-rights activism. More than 4 in 10 (43 percent) of Republican women want Roe overturned. Another 36 percent of Republican women want restrictions added to abortion rights. Kavanaugh was not much of a factor in people's voting at this point, except among activists. The poll shows a real lack of consensus on Kavanaugh, with Americans split on whether they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports him (31 percent) or opposes him (33 percent). He does seem to fire up conservatives slightly more than Democrats \u2014 68 percent of Republicans say they're more likely to vote for a candidate who supports Kavanaugh, compared with 63 percent of Democrats who say they would vote someone who opposes him. \"Americans don't see it [abortion] as a binary choice,\" said Barbara Carvalho, director of The Marist Poll. \"Most people are somewhere in the middle with the level of disagreement being on the level of restrictions that are also included. ... These middle positions are where most people are.\"",

Marsha Blackburn gave a speech during the Republican National Convention in 2016. Blackburn is running against former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in one of the year's most critical and competitive Senate races. In an election year shaping up to be a good one for Democratic women candidates, Republican women could see their numbers drop after November. But one state where GOP women might find success is in Tennessee. Rep. Marsha Blackburn will go up against former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen in one of the year's most critical and competitive Senate races. Rep. Diane Black is running for governor, though she first has to win a very competitive primary next week. A win by either woman this fall would be historic for Tennessee, which is one of only seven states that's never had a female senator or governor. But as both women crisscross the state, their gender rarely comes up with voters \u2014 and unlike many female Democratic candidates, it's definitely not something they're emphasizing. \"When I'm talking with Tennesseans, I say I'm the most well-qualified person for this position,\" Blackburn told NPR after a campaign event earlier this month at a bank in Portland, Tenn. Later that day, at a truck stop near Greeneville, Black relayed the same sentiment. \"People talk about that more than I do. I rarely talk about it,\" Black said about any potentially groundbreaking win. Breaking gender barriers But both women have broken gender barriers. During college, Blackburn became one of the first female saleswomen for Southwestern Company, a door-to-door book company that attracted many conservatives. She was rejected when she first applied because she was a woman, but the company finally hired her, though with a catch \u2014 she had to live at home in Mississippi with her parents, while the male salesmen were allowed to travel between cities. Blackburn married and moved to Tennessee, where she would rise through local and state politics. Then in 2002, she became the first woman elected to Congress in Tennessee who hadn't followed her husband in the position. She jumped in the Senate race last year after Sen. Bob Corker announced his retirement. But when Corker was urged by some to reconsider that move amid concerns the more conservative Blackburn would jeopardize the GOP's hold on the seat, a spokeswoman for Blackburn forcefully pushed back that, \"Anyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can't win a general election is just a plain sexist pig.\" Black grew up in public housing and was a single mother who worked the night shift as a nurse. She later remarried and with her husband founded a multimillion dollar drug testing company. Black eventually ran for the state legislature and then Congress, which led to her own historic milestones. Rep.

Diane Black is running for governor of Tennessee, which is one of only seven states that has never had a female senator or governor. \"I was the first female caucus chairman here in the state Senate. I'm the first female to have served as a budget chair for our country. But that's not when I'm running as. I'm running on my credentials,\" Black recalled. \"And I would be very proud to be the first female. I think it does say to young women that females can serve in higher office and serve in leadership positions, and so I'm proud about that part of it. But I don't run my campaign as a female. I run my campaign as a qualified candidate.\" Both women have taken that approach in Washington. Blackburn has famously said she prefers to go by congressman instead of congresswoman because she thinks it's more gender neutral, and Black has adopted that same title. Tennessee gave women the right to vote ... then fell behind Back in Tennessee, female political observers say it's past time for the state to elect a woman to its top positions. After all, nearly a century ago, it was Tennessee that gave women nationally the right to vote, as the final state needed to ratify the 19th Amendment. \"It's about time, wouldn't you say?\" laughs Barbara Trautman, president of the Tennessee Federation of Republican Women. She's sitting in the headquarters of the Shelby County Republican Party, surrounded by campaign signs and several volunteers, many of whom are wearing red \"Marsha, Marsha, Marsha\" shirts from Blackburn's campaign.

Diane Black and Marsha Blackburn is on display at the Shelby County Republican Party headquarters. Trautman has to remain neutral until after the primary, but if Blackburn, who faces only nominal opposition, and Black in her much more competitive contest, advance, Trautman says it would be a good thing for the party and could help other women win at the local level across the board. \"It's part of the paving the way for the younger generation to want to achieve that too,\" Trautman said. There have been other women who've achieved firsts statewide. In 2011, Republican Beth Harwell became the first female speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Harwell is also running for governor, but in most polling she has lagged far behind Black and the other two frontrunners, businessmen Bill Lee and Randy Boyd. In 1980, Democrat Jane Eskind became the first woman ever elected to office statewide, winning a seat on Tennessee's Public Service Commission, though that's no longer an elected board. Now, governor and senator are Tennessee's only statewide elected offices. Eskind was also the first woman to be nominated by a major party statewide in 1978, unsuccessfully challenging Republican Sen. Howard Baker for his seat. Back then, she faced a lot of pushback because of her gender. \"During the campaigns, there were many people who thought that I should go home and have a baby, as improbable as it was at the time,\" the late Eskind recalled in a video for the Tennessee Women's Hall of Fame. In 1982, Susan Richardson Williams became the first female chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party. She said times have changed since she was party chair \u2014 for the better for women. \"I think the stigma of being a woman running for office is fortunately gone. I've heard some discussion about Republicans having two women running statewide and whether we've arrived enough to elect two women statewide, and I actually do,\" Williams said. \"I think we're to the point in the South, in and around the country, where gender doesn't matter so much. Yes, it will be historic. But both of those women are qualified to serve in the offices that they seek.\" National conservatives look to Tennessee in \"year of the woman\" Nationally, a win by either Blackburn or Black would be important for conservative causes, according to Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. Her group promotes anti-abortion rights candidates and has endorsed both women in their races. \"Tennessee stands out as a place that is really answering the call for women to run, and especially in the uniquely important way that these two women are very strongly pro-life women running for the highest level offices that Tennessee or any state can can offer,\" said Dannenfelser. She said it's important for more conservative women to run, but the difference is that Republicans don't talk about their gender in the same way Democrats do. \"I think that the Democrats are far more invested in identity politics \u2014 so, 'Vote for me because of how I look and what my gender is.' I think that those reasons are legitimate as a supporting role, but not as the only reason, and so that is different,\" said Dannenfelser. \"This is a moment where the experience of women needs to be heard,\" Dannenfelser added about conservative women, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement, \"To put an R beside their name or a D or an I or whatever ... and exclude any women in this conversation, really does not serve women.\" Blackburn's race could well be pivotal to Senate control this fall, and polling has shown she's neck-and-neck with Bredesen. In that contest, despite being a woman, she could struggle to keep women voters. A Mason-Dixon poll from April, which gave Bredesen a three-point lead overall, found that he wins women voters by 11 points. Both Black and Blackburn have heavily underscored their support of President Trump in their races, and while the president's approval ratings have fallen \u2014 especially among women \u2014 nationwide, they're banking that he can still help them in a state he carried by 26 points, even if Trump has a history of controversial comments about women and has fought off allegations of sexual misconduct. \"Women know that their economic security, their national security is in better shape\" because of President Trump \"and they are grateful for that \u2014 and that is primarily what they're talking about right now,\" Blackburn countered after her Portland event.",

            "article_content": "Federal agencies are moving ahead to stop foreign interference in the midterm elections. But without direction from the White House, they are limited in what they can do.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week has raised the question, what is the U.S. government doing to protect our elections from foreign interference? We take a look in this week's All Tech Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF ULRICH SCHNAUSS' \"NOTHING HAPPENS IN JUNE\") CORNISH: Preventing Russia and other countries from trying to hack election systems or spread false information on social media is a Herculean task. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has warned that we could see a repeat of what happened in 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAN COATS: We fully realize that we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself. CORNISH: To hear more about the government's efforts to prevent that we're joined by NPR's Greg Myre. Hey there, Greg. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So are we actually looking at the same threats in 2018 as in 2016? MYRE: Same threats, but there are some really important differences. 2016 was this kind of perfect storm. The U.S. as a whole just really wasn't paying attention, was extremely vulnerable. The White House even when they learned of the potential threats didn't want to say too much. It was a very close race. We know that the Russian president Vladimir Putin wanted to help Donald Trump and had this long-standing grudge against Hillary Clinton. It's such a different election this time with 435 House races, 35 Senate races. You don't have that one big race that would potentially define U.S. policy. CORNISH: So not on the same scale. What have you learned about what the government is doing to stop foreign interference this year? MYRE: So the kind of phrasing you hear is that it requires a whole of government effort involving multiple agencies. But let's try to break it down into two key parts here. One is Department of Homeland Security, which is working with all the states to do security for voter rolls and the actual election machinery, the real nuts and bolts of it. But this is still a relatively new process. You've got 50 different states to work with. So it takes a lot of coordination. Even if everybody has goodwill, it - the coordination part is pretty difficult. CORNISH: And the other part? MYRE: Well, this is what the Justice Department has raised in the past week or so. They've talked about looking at a range of threats. They've mentioned five different things. But perhaps the most important of them is attempts, which the Russians did previously and will presumably try to do again, of sowing division on these issues that are really divisive - immigration and gun - gun control and abortion. The Justice Department also says it's going to alert the public when it finds evidence of this. So this would be a real break from what we saw two years ago. CORNISH: And where's the White House on all of this? MYRE: Really not saying very much. You know, we have a president who's extremely sensitive to the notion that his electoral victory might have been tainted by Russian involvement. But the president gets a security briefing every day. If he wants to stress and ask for increased focus on election security, he'll get it. CORNISH: How are the leaders of these government agencies feeling right now about their actual ability to stop threats? MYRE: Well, you know, we just heard from Dan Coats, director of national intelligence. He was one of the leaders out at the Aspen Security Forum last week. And this was a recurring theme. What is the level of threat? How are you addressing it? And they gave pretty similar answers. A lot of bad actors are cropping up, particularly Russia, and they're very concerned about this. But they were also - there was a real consensus that they're just not seeing anything, at least not so far, on the same scale as 2016. CORNISH: And for voters, what can we do? MYRE: Be informed consumers. All those who are involved and dropped the ball last time said they're going to do better this time - the government, the media, social media companies. But at the end of the day, it's up to the voters to be alert and have a good judgment about what they're seeing. CORNISH: That's NPR's Greg Myre. Thank you. MYRE: Thank you.

Abortion will be a key issue in the confirmation process.\n                \n                    \n                    Cliff Owen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry is confronted by a supporter of abortion rights in front of the Supreme Court on Monday as President Trump announced his nomination or Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Abortion will be a key issue in the confirmation process. President Trump's nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was met with swift partisan response from many in Congress, emphasizing the power of a narrow group of uncommitted senators. A large number of Senate Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., immediately announced that they plan to vote against Kavanaugh. \"I will oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"The stakes are simply too high for anything less.\" Republicans called the choice a triumph and rallied behind Kavanaugh. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called him a \"superb choice\" who is well-qualified for the job. \"Judge Kavanaugh has sterling academic credentials. He is widely admired for his intellect, experience and exemplary judicial temperament,\" he said. \"This is an opportunity for senators to put partisanship aside and consider his legal qualifications with the fairness, respect and seriousness that a Supreme Court nomination ought to command.\" But Schumer and other Democrats based their opposition in large part on fears that Kavanaugh would band together with the court's four conservative justices to restrict abortion rights and further undermine the Affordable Care Act. Those issues will be central to a heated fight among Democrats to persuade moderate Republicans and moderates in their own party to oppose Kavanaugh. The pressure will be most intense on Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., all of whom are running for re-election in states Trump won in 2016. Trump polls highly among voters in those states, and the closely watched Democratic trio will be under tremendous pressure to back the president. All three have reputations for working with Republicans on some policy issues and appearing at events at the White House when their politics align with Trump. But a controversial Supreme Court pick could test the boundaries of their willingness to buck the rest of the Democratic Party. All three released statements that focused on their willingness to fully vet the nominee. \"Part of my job as Senator includes thoroughly considering judicial nominations, including to the Supreme Court,\" Donnelly said in his statement. \"I will take the same approach as I have previously for a Supreme Court vacancy.\" Heitkamp issued a lengthy statement that, in part, highlighted her vote for Trump's previous Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"An exhaustive and fair process took place for Justice Gorsuch, who I supported,\" Heitkamp said. \"It should and must take place again now.\" Outside groups on both sides of the debate over abortion rights immediately issued predictions about what the nomination would mean for the future of Roe v. Wade. Dana Singiser, the vice president for public policy and government relations at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told reporters Monday night, \"The right to access abortion safely and legally in this country is clearly on the line.\" Anti-abortion-rights activists do not disagree. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the conservative Susan B. Anthony List, told reporters on a press call that the nomination of a fifth conservative justice is the culmination of years of work getting Republicans elected to all branches of government. \"We have known this moment was coming, and so over a year we have been organizing in these Senate battleground states,\" she said, \"knowing that these senators would be key to a confirmation battle.\" That confirmation process is set to begin immediately on Tuesday, when Kavanaugh is expected to come to Capitol Hill to begin meetings with senators. He will be accompanied by former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who will be helping the nominee through the arduous confirmation process. Kyl is well-liked in the Senate and was personally recommended by McConnell as a good choice for the job. He is a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he participated in the confirmation of four justices. Kyl's job, known as the \"Sherpa,\" is to usher the nominee to one-on-one meetings with senators and to help him prepare for the types of questions he may face. Kyl may also be asked to sit in on the meetings or help guide the conversations behind closed doors. Those meetings are an opportunity for senators to ask questions of the potential justice in a private setting before public hearings begin. Once that is done and Kavanaugh has completed a questionnaire from the Judiciary Committee, formal hearings can begin. Committee members will question Kavanaugh over the course of several days of hearings. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Monday that he hopes to use that time to learn more about Kavanaugh's legal mind. \"I'm not looking for an ideologue,\" Kennedy said. \"I'm looking for someone who has a sound, well thought out judicial philosophy.\" Republican aides said Monday that they expect the whole process could take about two months. The last two Supreme Court nominees \u2014 Justices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 were approved after about 66 days. NPR's Sarah McCammon contributed to this report.",

Interviews with over 50 Republican voters show satisfaction with the president's accomplishments and enthusiasm about this year's election.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters cheer for President Trump during a campaign rally last week in Great Falls, Mont. Interviews with over 50 Republican voters show satisfaction with the president's accomplishments and enthusiasm about this year's election. Mike Davis didn't think Donald Trump could get elected. Davis is the kind of Republican who backed Ohio governor John Kasich in the 2016 primaries, the kind of Republican who subscribes to the Wall Street Journal. Davis, 64, is the former mayor of Dunwoody, Ga., a small city in the state's 6th Congressional District, one of the most highly-educated districts in the country. Ultimately Davis voted for Trump, mainly because he was worried about the tilt of the Supreme Court. With the nomination of another conservative justice expected on Monday, following the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and a large reshaping of the federal judiciary overall, Davis is getting what he had hoped for. So with time, his tepid support has morphed into a wholehearted embrace of the president. \"I love what he's doing with international relations. I love what he's done with the tax code. I love what he's done with the appointment of judges,\" said Davis. \"And to be honest, those three things trump everything in my mind, no pun intended.\" There is no doubt Democrats are highly engaged this year. A recent study from the Pew Research Center found they are more enthusiastic about the midterms than Republicans. But that same survey also showed that Republicans are more enthusiastic this year than they were in the 2014 midterms, when they won control of the Senate and expanded their majority in the House. Despite other clear signs of Democratic enthusiasm, in the form of high voter turnout in the primaries and large-scale protests of the president, there are increasing indications that Trump's powerful base might offset some of that energy and protect the GOP's power in Washington by denying Democrats the 23 additional House seats or 2 additional Senate seats needed to win control of either chamber. Trump is a bigger factor in midterm preferences \u2014 positive or negative \u2014 than any other president in the last three decades, according to Pew's research. The president has a near 90 percent approval rating among Republicans. His popularity near the 500-day mark among his own party is higher than any other president since World War II, with the exception of George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Republican strategists and even party leaders say the GOP has morphed into \"Trump's party,\" where the litmus test for admission is loyalty to the president, derided by retiring GOP Sen. Bob Corker as \"a cultish thing.\" But with Trump's name not on the midterm ballot, the question is whether the coalition he built will stay together in November. In interviews with over 50 Republican base voters across Ohio, West Virginia and Georgia in recent months, NPR found widespread enthusiasm for the president that could fuel voters in November. Between immigration, trade, tax cuts and Supreme Court picks, Trump has satisfied distinct parts of his coalition and given them each a reason to come back for more in November. Reactions from voters in four discreet blocs of Trump supporters show why. Evangelicals Jason Loudermilk, a mission strategist with the West Metro Baptist Association in Georgia, wrote in a candidate in 2016 because he didn't feel comfortable voting for Trump. \"I wasn't sure he was as pro-life as he said he was,\" said Loudermilk. But he said the appointment of Gorsuch proved Trump's conservative principles. \"Knowing what I know now, if I had it do over again, and nothing changes in the next two years, I'm planning to vote for him for re-election,\" said Loudermilk. In fact, the balance of the Supreme Court largely solidified white evangelical support behind Trump during the 2016 campaign. And so despite ongoing stories about Trump's personal lifestyle, these days even initial skeptics like Loudermilk have become convinced Trump is on their side. White evangelicals support the president far more than the general public. An April poll from the Public Religion Research Institute showed 75 percent of white evangelicals have a positive opinion of Trump. In comparison, the president's overall approval rating is currently around 42 percent. \"I've been amazed at his accomplishments, particularly as you consider all the opposition that he has had from Republicans as well as Democrats, the man is just fighting battles, one battle after another of opposition,\" said Donald Voyles, 83, a pastor at Unity Baptist Church. And while some evangelicals continue to have reservations about Trump's morality and character, many say now they agree with his policies. \"As an individual, there are certain things about him that I don't love, but, I really do believe he is genuine in that he is trying to better America for the future,\" said Kristen Cohran, 22, a political science major at Cedarville University, a Christian college east of Dayton, Ohio. Kristen Cochran, a senior at Cedarville University, a christian college in Ohio, said the president can sometimes be \"crass,\" but she likes how he's governing.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid /NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption Kristen Cochran, a senior at Cedarville University, a christian college in Ohio, said the president can sometimes be \"crass,\" but she likes how he's governing. She still worries that the president is sometimes \"crass,\" and she wishes he would start acting more presidential, but she said her Christian faith is the most important factor in her politics. And, thus far, Trump has delivered. \"I think there's things he's working toward, especially crack down on Planned Parenthood, and potentially revert to some of the past prohibitions on abortion,\" said Cochran. White, working-class men White working-class voters supported Trump over Hillary Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin. In particular, white working class men were among the president's strongest supporters. But their concerns were not solely economic. Polling has shown that blue-collar voters who supported Trump had deep anxiety more about cultural displacement than economic volatility. \"Pretty soon it's going to cost us more and more and more to live here in this country because we're keeping them people and feeding them,\" said James Weekley, referring to immigrants. Weekley, 89, is a retired baker NPR met in Ohio while following Working America, a labor group affiliated with the AFL-CIO, as it canvassed a Columbus neighborhood. Part of Trump's strategy for maintaining power is to give each plank of voters in his coalition something they want, in the hopes they'll keep coming back for more. Widespread deportations may not be popular among the general public, but they are incredibly popular among a core group of Trump's supporters. Before he's even asked about the president, Weekley begins praising Trump's hardline immigration policy. \"He's sending some of the foreigners back to where they belong,\" said Weekley. Over a fifth of Ohio voters are white, working-class men, and while trade and tariffs matter to some, the cultural grievances Trump has tapped into resonate just as deeply. Billy Neibler, a welder in Grove City, Ohio, didn't go to college, but he gets riled up when he hears stories of college campuses creating so-called \"safe spaces\" for minorities to talk about their feelings of marginalization. \"You got to have a safe space?\" he asked incredulously. \"You know, I get burned all day long. I get burns, I get cuts. I've been called names, and you just say something back or maybe you got into a fist fight over it.\" \"I'm going to say if he keeps doing what he's doing, he'll be the best president of my lifetime,\" said Billy Neibler, a welder in Grove City, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I'm going to say if he keeps doing what he's doing, he'll be the best president of my lifetime,\" said Billy Neibler, a welder in Grove City, Ohio. Neibler is from Kentucky, but he's lived in Ohio for years. Still, he has at least three Confederate flags in his garage; one giant one hangs on the wall, proclaiming, \"The South Will Rise Again.\" Neibler says the country has gotten soft, and he blames Democrats. Part of Neibler's frustration is tied to entitlement programs. He feels like Democrats want to give stuff away to lazy people for free. And he says that's unnecessary because there are plenty of jobs in Ohio. \"Everywhere you go, you see a sign. If you don't want to work in Columbus, it's because you don't want a job,\" said Neibler. \"That's a fact.\" Like many GOP voters, he credits Trump for a healthy economy, and he insists he's got more business than he's ever had. But his admiration for Trump isn't just about taxes and jobs, it's about power and personality. \"I'm going to say if he keeps doing what he's doing, he'll be the best president of my lifetime,\" said Neibler. Veterans Another key part of the Trump coalition are veterans. They broadly supported the president in 2016, and many remain thoroughly satisfied with his job performance. Interviews with about a dozen veterans in West Virginia \u2014 a state with one of the highest proportions of veterans in the country, at 9 percent of the population \u2014  uncovered widespread support for the president's policies. \"I think he's done a great job,\" said Rudy Varney, a Vietnam War veteran in Logan County. \"He got the [budget] increase for the military. And our soldiers.\" Troy \"Rudy\" Varney, a Vietnam War veteran from southern West Virginia, says he thinks the president's proposal for a military parade on Veterans Day is a \"great idea\" and that Trump has \"the heart\" of veterans.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Troy \"Rudy\" Varney, a Vietnam War veteran from southern West Virginia, says he thinks the president's proposal for a military parade on Veterans Day is a \"great idea\" and that Trump has \"the heart\" of veterans. But Varney's appreciation of Trump is not just about money \u2014 it's about prestige. He loves the president's idea of a military parade on Veterans Day. \"All the other countries do that,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean we went plum crazy and ready to raid people's homes or nothing. That's just showing our military force. And letting the public know what the military is all about and their weapons.\" The parade idea is popular, in part, because it seems to demonstrate how Trump feels about the military. \"President Trump seems to have the heart of veterans,\" said Donnie Wells, another Vietnam veteran. \"He's done more in the short time he's been in office than any of the other presidents ... as far as being up front and vocal about the veterans.\" But the question of how this will translate to the midterms is unclear. Multiple Trump voters also praised Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., for fighting for veterans issues. Manchin is a well-known retail politician, and one GOP voter specifically cited a health issue that he said Manchin helped him resolve. Establishment Republicans The president performed worse than many of his GOP predecessors with one traditionally Republican demographic \u2014 white, college-educated voters. But those who did vote for him have found a reason to love him more than before. \"He's done a great job for the economy,\" said Sam Ehlers, a tech worker in Cobb County, Ga. \"Unemployment is low, taxes have been reduced, businesses are investing and hiring.\" The tax cuts are almost universally popular among Republicans in the affluent suburbs of Atlanta, with manicured lawns and luxury cars. But there is evidence that, while Trump is solidifying his support with his base, perhaps, he is not broadening it. \"I did vote for Trump, and now, it's like I think, 'What did I do?'\" said Charlene Kratz, a teacher who was having an early dinner with a liberal friend in Marietta Square. \"I'm not happy with the way things have gone with him ... he's said so many racist things.\" Kratz says that, in hindsight, she thinks the country would have been better off with Hillary Clinton. But Kratz is the exception \u2014 the only Republican voter in more than 50 interviews to express regret about voting for the president. Trump has given each of his core constituencies at least a dose of satisfaction, enough that they're willing to overlook what they don't like. Davis, the former Dunwoody mayor, for example, says he doesn't like the president's behavior on Twitter. But he's found a way to justify it. \"I think (it's) an excellent way for him to deal with a news media that is hellbent on destroying him,\" said Davis. \"So many reporters have made it clear that their mission is to impeach him, get him declared mentally deficient, whatever they're trying to do.\" This frustration with media coverage wasn't unique to Davis. In multiple interviews, GOP voters insisted \"the media\" were on a mission to destroy the president, not giving him credit for a healthy economy or negotiations with North Korea. And the more criticism Trump receives, the more fiercely his defenders protect him, the more loyal they become, and the more eager they are to interpret the midterms as a referendum on the president \u2014 that they want to answer with a vote for Republicans.",

Rep. Conor Lamb's special election victory was built on a low-key centrist platform. Despite all the Democrats' special election wins, high voter turnout in primaries and polls showing strong party enthusiasm heading into the midterms, the fact remains that Democrats are still stuck at their lowest level of power in nearly a century. Even though President Trump's poll numbers have stabilized, party leaders see 2018 as a chance to seize back one key lever of government: the House of Representatives. But Democrats and their core voters can't seem to agree on the best direction to take. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to be minority leader in 2017, said the party is stuck in a feedback loop: \"Democrats don't have the power,\" he said. \"We've got to start learning how to win elections, and until you learn how to win elections, you can't get the power. And I think we're in the process of figuring that out.\" Party leaders had settled on a moderate message of outreach and competent governing as the best way to net the 23 seats needed to win the House in November. But that pragmatic and cautious game plan was scrambled last week in a shocking upset. A Democratic Socialist newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in the New York Democratic stronghold of Queens and the Bronx. Crowley is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House and was widely viewed as a potential speaker of the House. Ocasio-Cortez's victory is the latest example of the energy and enthusiasm of a growing activist arm of the party. However, in interviews with more than a dozen Democrats running in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas, California, Nebraska and Washington state, as well as with party strategists, campaign managers and elected Democrats, NPR found that pragmatism is winning out over progressivism in the key races that will decide control of Congress. Pelosi made that point clear last week when she was asked whether Democratic Socialists like Ocasio-Cortez were ascendant in the party in general. \"It is ascendant in that district perhaps,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"Our districts are very different, one from another.\" Pelosi and her deputies say they want a \"big tent\" party that welcomes the far left and center-left, united by goals like universal health care and access to a free or affordable college education. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives disagree. They say the left is energized and turning out to vote. \"That movement is going to happen from the bottom up,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview on CNN. \"That movement is going to come from voters.\" But winning power in Washington is the only way to achieve policy goals, and national Democrats insist that progressive activism alone won't get them there. Party leaders like Pelosi have data to back them up. Democrats need to win at least 23 seats to regain a majority in the House and moderate Democrats beat progressives in primaries in all but two of the most competitive GOP-held districts in the country. Progressives are primarily winning in districts that are already controlled by Democrats \u2014 or in GOP districts where national Democrats don't expect to compete. Still, progressive pickups in the liberal bastions of the country like New York and California could have a significant impact if Democrats succeed in winning control of the House. Those candidates are promising to push for sweeping change \u2014 like Medicare for all, free public college tuition and the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 that would be hard to achieve with full control in Washington and nearly impossible with a Republican in the White House. The primary war that wasn't But for all the very real ways the Democratic Party is drifting left, the fact is that victories like Ocasio-Cortez's have been rare this year. Crowley was the first Democratic incumbent to lose. In many cases, particularly in the Senate, primary challengers never emerged. That outcome would have been hard to believe in January 2017, when Democratic senators were drawing heckles and protests for not doing enough to challenge the Trump administration. When the entire Senate Democratic Caucus stood outside the Supreme Court to protest Trump's first travel ban, they weren't greeted with cheers, but rather heckles of \"do your job\" and \"walk the walk,\" because they weren't voting en masse to oppose every single Trump Cabinet nominee. At one point, protesters swarmed the Brooklyn home of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, chanting, \"What the f***, Chuck?\" With several moderate \u2014 even conservative \u2014 Democrats up for re-election this year, the prospect of primary challenges from the left seemed high. And yet, no incumbent Senate Democrat faced a serious primary test this year. Not Joe Donnelly, Joe Manchin or Heidi Heitkamp, who all voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; not Claire McCaskill, who has repeatedly criticized the Medicare-for-all approach so many Democrats are endorsing; and not Bob Casey, who sometimes opposes abortion rights. Democrats credit a rare outbreak of grass-roots pragmatism for the lack of Senate-side infighting. \"These are people with proven track records. They have been fighting for the people in their states,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \"I think it's very clear to Democratic primary voters that it did not make sense to have a challenge in those races.\" \"There's just a lot of work to do, and so I think you're seeing a progressive movement that is being extremely smart in where it chooses to put its resources and where it's choosing to direct its power,\" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"We have a chance to flip the House and do it with great progressive candidates who are on the field, who need our support and resources.\" Progressives have notched key wins in several high-profile House primaries. In addition to last week's New York upset, Kara Eastman won a surprise victory in an Omaha-area Nebraska district. But in most House primaries, pragmatism has ruled the day \u2014 including in the northern suburbs of Los Angeles, where a young moderate named Katie Hill beat progressive Bryan Caforio. Hill is the former head of California's largest anti-homelessness organization and the daughter of a local nurse and a local police officer. She is a lifelong gun owner who backs some gun control measures and has a plan to protect the Affordable Care Act as a transition to a single-payer health care system. Party leaders rejoiced when she won, in part because the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted before the primary that a victory for Hill would give Democrats their best shot at beating incumbent Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., in November. That was good news for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which, for the most part, has viewed more moderate \u2014 or at a minimum, less confrontational \u2014 candidates as the best chance to flip the Republican-held districts needed to win back the House majority. Looking back at the party's key electoral victories over the past year, many Democratic leaders see a theme: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb are all low-key centrists who campaigned on local issues and an overall message of competence and outreach. Joe Trippi, a top strategist on the Jones campaign, sees that approach as the best way for Democrats to take back the House. \"When you get that confrontational tone, what you do is drive people to their corners,\" he said. \"These districts are gerrymandered, or they're red states like Alabama. If you drive people to their [partisan] corners, then you're going to lose. People are looking at the chaos and division and bitterness in Washington and they're looking at these two candidates from either party and they're asking [are they] going to add to that chaos and division?\" A gracious insurgency But while moderates are advancing in this year's most critical House districts and Senate races, there is no question that Democratic energy overall is shifting to the left. \"We have had real success in moving the ideology of the Democratic Party to be a pro-worker party to stand up to the billionaire class,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Surveying the political landscape, the independent senator, who caucuses with the Democrats, and his political advisers see a much different party than the one whose nomination Sanders ran for in 2016. \"The ideas that he was talking about \u2014 Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, radical criminal justice reform, immigration reform \u2014 many of these issues were considered fringe issues, and now they are mainstream issues that we take for granted that, of course, there are legions of Democratic candidates running on these platforms,\" said Sanders' 2016 campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. When Sanders rolled out his latest Medicare-for-all legislation in 2017, the list of co-sponsors was a who's who of likely 2020 Democratic presidential contenders: California Sen. Kamala Harris, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, among others. Weaver credited an \"alphabet soup of progressive organizations\" for boosting 2018 primary candidates campaigning on these policies. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has run candidate boot camps, conducted fundraising and run ads for progressive candidates. \"The way for Democrats to win is not to be tepid and conservative,\" said Taylor. \"The best way to win is to be out there campaigning boldly on economic issues like Medicare for all.\" But when progressives have lost primaries this cycle, they've by and large endorsed the establishment victors. Take one of the higher-profile establishment-vs.-grass-roots proxy wars of the 2018 primary season: Texas's 7th Congressional District in the Houston suburbs. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made candidate Laura Moser the poster woman of squeezed-out activists when it publicly dropped a broadside of damaging opposition research about her background and writing career. Moser ultimately lost to party-backed Lizzie Fletcher in the suburban Houston seat \u2014 an archetype of the high-income, high-education district that Democrats are targeting as their most direct path to a House majority. But unlike many insurgent candidates during the peak of the Tea Party era, Moser was quick to join ranks with Fletcher after the primary ended. \"Huge congratulations to [Fletcher],\" she tweeted in the hours after the race was called. \"You ran a great race and I look forward to helping you flip #TX07 in November.\" Can Democrats come together after November? Whether or not Democrats take control of the House, it may not be as easy to govern the country \u2014 or simply their own caucus \u2014 as it is to coalesce around a general election candidate. The number of progressives in Congress is expected to grow over time as liberal enclaves shift further to the left. That could pose a serious problem for Democratic leaders who are already being criticized by candidates on both sides of the political spectrum for being out of touch with the direction of the party. Candidates across the country have been hounded with questions about whether they will support Pelosi as leader. A growing number, including Ocasio-Cortez and Lamb, have been unwilling to commit. They say they'll wait to see who actually runs for those top leadership spots, but there is already a tension brewing over what kind of policies the party should pursue next year. Progressives want leaders who are younger and more in touch with the activist class. Ocasio-Cortez started a nationwide push among activists to abolish ICE, while others are demanding a move to single-payer health care. Rep. Tim Ryan and many of his supporters say future party leaders need to heed those demands carefully. \"It's a balance between saying what your values are and what your ambitions are, and the reality of governing,\" Ryan said. \"You do that in a campaign, and then hopefully you get enough people help you to get [to Washington] so you can get as close to those goals as you possibly can.\" But even some members of Pelosi's core leadership team say there could be benefits to holding votes on progressive policies that Trump and Senate Republicans would inevitably block. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., one of three top messaging gurus elected by House Democrats, said that strategy could motivate voters to elect a Democrat to replace Trump in 2020. \"They're going to see, if we're not successful, what stood in the way,\" Cicilline said in an interview. \"They are going to have an opportunity to change that in the election.\"",

            "article_content": "The president says he won't ask about specific legal cases, including Roe v. Wade. But he doesn't have to, because everyone on his short list is a pre-vetted conservative.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: President Trump says he plans to announce his pick for the Supreme Court next Monday. And as he meets with potential nominees, he has vowed not to ask them about their views on Roe v. Wade. That's the 1973 landmark ruling that made abortion legal nationwide. It's a stark contrast from what Trump promised back in 2016 on the campaign trail. Here's a clip from the third debate. Chris Wallace of Fox News asked this question. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS WALLACE: Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be - that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. CHANG: So why the disconnect between then and now? To talk about President Trump's strategy in the coming Supreme Court confirmation battle we're joined by NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. Hey, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Hello, Ailsa. CHANG: So just to be clear we're not seeing some kind of evolution of President Trump's personal views on abortion, right? We're seeing tactics on how to get a Supreme Court nominee through. ELVING: That is right. The word evolution would be appropriate here. You remember that when he switched from many years of support for abortion rights to total opposition as a candidate for the Republican nomination... CHANG: Right. ELVING: ...President Trump back then said his views had evolved. But that does not appear to be what's happening here. You're right to speak of it his tactics. The strategy that they're serving is to unite all flavors of republicanism and get to at least 50 votes and confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court. Remember, they took away the filibuster option last year... CHANG: Right. ELVING: ...For Supreme Court nominees. So 50 would be enough to confirm whomever the president nominates. CHANG: But everyone knows that President Trump is picking from a list that was compiled by conservative organizations - organizations that very deliberately chose people they think would want to overturn Roe v. Wade. So why is he tiptoeing? Why the delicate theater here? ELVING: Because there are two senators who are Republicans, who are women in the Senate, who have been supporters of abortion rights in the past and are worried about seeing Roe vs. Wade overturned. Now, that's Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. So they are the audience of two for what the president is doing with this particular kind of tactic, even though, at the same time, the president is counting on support from the rest of the Senate Republicans, the overwhelming number of whom, of course, are opponents of abortion rights. CHANG: Susan Collins of Maine seemed to give a nod to the precarious politics. I mean, just last weekend, she said that she would not vote for any nominee with a demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade. That sounds like she's threading the needle, too, doesn't it? ELVING: Yes, and perhaps sending a message with respect to a couple of the people on the list. There is one William Pryor, who is currently an appellate court judge for the 11th Circuit, who in the past has called Roe v. Wade the worst abomination in constitutional history. You could interpret that as hostility. So if that particular person were to be nominated by the president, he would be apparently willing to sacrifice the vote of Susan Collins. CHANG: OK. So there is the politics of the individual senators to consider as we head towards the confirmation battle. But then there's also the politics of voters at large as we head into midterm elections this year. A majority of Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. This is an election where we're seeing a lot of energy among female voters, female candidates. Could a Supreme Court nominee whom conservatives fall in love with backfire in this election? ELVING: We have seen something like that before. In 1992, a record number of women were elected to the Senate, particularly Democratic women. And that was right after the confirmation of Clarence Thomas and his controversial confirmation hearings, where he was challenged on a - what we would today call #MeToo basis by Anita Hill, a previous colleague. That was a highly controversial moment in the history not only of judicial politics in America but sexual politics in America. We'll have to see if that happens again in the circumstances of 2018 and 2020. CHANG: That's NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks very much, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Ailsa. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Trump plans to announce his next Supreme Court nominee on July 9.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump at the White House on Thursday. Trump plans to announce his next Supreme Court nominee on July 9. With little more than a week before President Trump announces his nominee to the highest court in the land, Trump sought to downplay some of his past comments about making opposition to legalized abortion a litmus test for his Supreme Court picks. In an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, Trump said his advisers have told him he should not ask anyone on his list of potential nominees whether they would overturn Roe v Wade,  the 1973 decision that effectively legalized abortion in the United States. \"They're all saying, don't do that, you don't do that, you shouldn't do that. But I'm putting conservative people on,\" said Trump. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement last week, was often the swing vote on the Supreme Court and voted to uphold Roe in multiple instances. Trump's comments come as a crucial moderate Republican senator said any nominee to the court who said they would vote to overturn Roe would not be \"acceptable.\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, one of only two Republican senators who supports abortion rights, told ABC's This Week she's looking for a nominee who would demonstrate a respect for precedent and that she sees Roe as settled law. \"A candidate for this important position who would overturn Roe v. Wade would not be acceptable to me, because that would indicate an activist agenda that I don't want to see a judge have,\" said Collins, who has voted to confirm every Supreme Court nominee that has come up for a vote during her tenure in the Senate. With the Senate divided 51-49 in favor of Republicans, (and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. absent due to medical issues) the fate of whoever Trump nominates will rest with Collins and a handful of other Republican and Democratic senators. Democrats have begun to mobilize their supporters around the abortion issue while Republicans have begun to to downplay the significance of replacing Kennedy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on NBC's Meet The Press that he's \"pro-life\" but that \"one of the concepts that really means a lot in America is stare decisis. That means you don't overturn precedent unless there's a good reason.\" Trump's past comments about abortion and the Supreme Court When Trump campaigned for the presidency, he was adamant about his stance on abortion rights. In the third presidential debate, in October of 2016, Trump was asked by moderator Chris Wallace if he wanted to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe. Trump responded by saying he assumed overturning Roe would happen \"automatically\" if he was able to appoint two or three justices to the bench as president. After he won the election, Trump continued to say the judges he would appoint would be \"pro-life\" judges and that if Roe was overturned, the question of abortion would be settled by individual states. On Sunday, Trump seemed to reaffirm that belief, telling Fox News that abortion \"could very well end up with states at some point.\" Trump's initial short list of 25 names of potential nominees was largely handpicked by the Federalist Society, an influential group of conservative lawyers. On Friday, he told reporters that short list had been further pared down to five candidates.",

Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin; GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to move swiftly to confirm the justice to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy before the court reconvenes on October 1. With Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain's continued absence, due to ongoing brain cancer treatment, McConnell has a functional 50-vote majority and little room for error in what is shaping up to be a partisan fight over the ideological makeup of the court for the next generation. With only 99 senators currently voting, the nominee can be approved by a 50-49 margin. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Vice President Pence would cast the deciding vote. There is no nominee yet, but Trump indicated on Friday he will likely pick from a short list of roughly five candidates, all of which have bona fides among conservatives and align ideologically with Justice Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch cleared the Senate \u2014 only after McConnell pushed through a rules change to end the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees and lower the threshold for confirmation from 60 to a simple majority \u2014 with 54 votes. Senate Democrats are calling to delay the vote until after the midterm elections, but McConnell has rejected their call and there is little Democrats can do to ultimately delay a vote. Already the confirmation process is becoming a debate about the future of abortion rights in America and whether the nominee would uphold the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, along with subsequent challenges that have upheld a woman's right to abortion access. The opening of Kennedy's seat has been a moment abortion rights opponents and supporters alike have been anticipating for years, because Kennedy historically sided with the liberals on the court in favor of protecting abortion rights. It's no secret in Washington, D.C., who the critical senators will be in the months ahead. Trump invited all five to the White House for a private meeting the day after Kennedy announced his retirement. Two moderate Republican women Few senators are as familiar with \u2014 and as cool at handling \u2014 the hot seat than Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The swing-vote senators, along with McCain, were the trio who derailed the GOP's 2017 effort to repeal most of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. They are also the only two Republican women who support abortion rights \u2014 with some caveats \u2014 and they could ultimately be the deciding votes on the Supreme Court nomination if all 49 members of the Senate Democratic caucus (including two independents) band together and oppose the nominee as a unified block. Collins has a more reliable record in favor of abortion rights, and boasts a 70-percent vote rating in 2018 from Planned Parenthood's political arm. Collins wasted no time following Kennedy's announcement to reiterate that she believes Roe v. Wade is \"settled law,\" but a spokeswoman told the Portland Press Herald that Collins \"does not apply ideological litmus tests to nominees.\" Collins is inclined to support nominees \u2014 she has voted to confirm every Supreme Court pick that has come up for a Senate vote during her time in the Senate \u2014 but none may be as consequential as Kennedy's replacement. \"No matter how I vote there are going to be people who are furious at me,\" Collins told POLITICO. Murkowski isn't rated as favorably among abortion rights groups, she has a 58-percent vote rating in 2018 from Planned Parenthood, but arguably there is no one in the Senate more independent than the Alaska Republican, and prouder of her reputation among women in her state. Murkowski lost her 2010 GOP primary, but ultimately won re-election with a historic write-in campaign. The strength of her victory was fueled by support among Alaska women, which has become part of Murkowski's brand. She has also been a reliable defender of federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides health care services to thousands of Alaskans. In a statement, Murkowski noted her standards for the Supreme Court are \"extremely high\" and that she will cast an \"independent vote\" when the eventual nominee comes before the Senate. Neither senator is known for telegraphing how they will cast their votes until right before the vote is called, so the spotlight will likely be on them in the months ahead.

When it comes to the Supreme Court fight, that list is quickly culled to just three for one reason: They are the only Democrats who voted to confirm Gorsuch in 2017 \u2014 Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Each of the three has a complex, frenemy-style relationship with the president, and each is trying to find the right political balance of working with a president most of their constituents strongly support, and opposing him where it matters most to their own voters. For Republicans' part, they need to balance actively campaigning against the trio in 2018, while courting their votes for the Supreme Court nominee. If either or both Collins and Murkowski end up opposing the nominee, support from some combination of this Democratic trio will be necessary to achieve a simple majority in the Senate. President Trump initially bashed Heitkamp at a rally in North Dakota this week in which he urged voters to support her GOP opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer. \"Heidi will vote 'no' for any pick we make for the Supreme Court,\" Trump said. However, he invited her, Donnelly and Manchin to the White House the next day to discuss the nomination process. \"Political speeches are just that, but the next day, I'm ready to get to work,\" Heitkamp said in a statement following a private meeting with the president. \"I stressed the importance of nominating someone to the Supreme Court who is pragmatic, fair, compassionate, committed to justice, and above politics.\" Heitkamp broadly supports abortion rights, but North Dakota is one of the most restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion access. Red-state Democrats are generally loathe to make their campaigns about social issues, and Heitkamp has preferred to work with the Trump administration on economic and energy grounds. Unlike Heitkamp, Donnelly and Manchin are Democrats who generally oppose abortion rights and are endorsed by Democrats for Life, the \"pro-life voice of the Democratic Party.\" The two men have also, at times, had warm relations with the president. Donnelly has traveled with Trump on Air Force One, and appeared alongside the president at a recent bill-signing ceremony at the White House. Manchin might be Trump's closest ally across the aisle \u2014 the president even considered him for a Cabinet job \u2014 and Manchin left open the possibility of supporting Trump for re-election in 2020. Like Collins and Murkowski, these Democrats are unlikely to reveal how they will vote until the nomination comes to the Senate floor. McConnell told Fox News that Republicans believe some combination of Democratic support is possible. \"We're hoping there will be some Democratic support,\" he said, \"We're not assuming this is just going to be a straight party-line vote. I think there will be some Democrats who find the nominee attractive.\"",

Trump will announce his pick to replace Kennedy on July 9. President Trump said on Friday that he plans to announce his nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on July 9. \"I've got it down to about five\" candidates, including two women, Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he traveled to his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. He indicated that he may interview one or two candidates there this weekend. \"It is a group of very highly talented, very brilliant, mostly conservative judges,\" Trump added. The president also said he wouldn't ask potential justices about their position on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion rights. Many who favor the decision fear that a more conservative replacement for Kennedy, often a swing vote on social issues, could endanger such rights, while Trump's base has hoped he would appoint someone to overturn the decision. Trump made clear during the presidential campaign that he would appoint justices who would oppose abortion. \"If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be, that's what will happen,\" Trump said of overturning Roe at the final presidential debate in October 2016. \"And that will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.\" Of potential justices who are on his shortlist, Trump pointed earlier this week to the 20 names he first listed during the 2016 campaign as possible candidates, with five additional names recently added. Trump's first Supreme Court appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, came from that initial list. One person on that list of names is Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Trump said that the GOP lawmaker \"said he'd like the job; usually they don't say that.\" The 81-year-old Kennedy announced his retirement on Wednesday, giving Trump his second seat on the court to fill since he took office in January 2017. \"From Day 1, I've heard, outside of war and peace of course, the most important decision you make is the selection of a Supreme Court judge, if you get it,\" Trump said on Friday. \"And as you know there have been many presidents that never got a choice. You know, they went four years, they went eight years and they never got a choice, and here we are at two already.\" Trump nominated Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, citing the coming presidential election later that year. That infuriated Democrats, who say that McConnell's push to confirm Trump's nominee now before the November midterms reeks of hypocrisy.",

Almost as soon as Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement was announced, several anti-abortion-rights groups began their campaigns to influence the pick for his successor. Updated June 29 at 12:28 p.m. ET The process of replacing retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is underway, and the prospect of filling the seat held by the court's swing vote is setting the stage for what is likely to be a battle over abortion rights unlike any in a generation. On Thursday evening, President Trump met with six key senators likely to be targeted by intense lobbying efforts from both sides of the abortion debate. Among them were Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have supported abortion rights in the past and will face heavy pressure from reproductive-rights advocates to vote against the confirmation of any nominee seen as likely to roll back abortion rights. Trump also met with Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana; all three are red-state Democrats seeking re-election this fall and likely to face pressure to side with Republicans. As the 2016 presidential campaign wound down, then-candidate Donald Trump made clear that if elected, he would work to see an end to the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision on his watch. \"If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be, that's what will happen,\" Trump said at the final presidential debate in October 2016. \"And that will happen automatically in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.\" But the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide won't be overturned automatically, nor without a fight. High stakes for reproductive rights Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the president \"has begun\" the process of finding Kennedy's replacement and that he will choose a nominee from one of the lists of potential justices he has previously released. Trump initially released the names of his potential Supreme Court picks during the 2016 campaign in an effort to firm up support among social and religious conservatives and added additional names last year. Walters told NPR's Scott Horsley that Trump will announce a pick \"within a few weeks.\" Kennedy's departure will usher in a fight for the future of the Supreme Court that many social and religious conservatives anticipated and hoped for during the 2016 campaign. Trump's promise to appoint conservative, anti-abortion justices helped turn out the base voters he needed to secure his surprise victory. Exit polls suggested the makeup of the Supreme Court played a major role for many voters on both sides, but more for Republicans. Almost as soon as Kennedy's retirement was announced, several anti-abortion-rights groups seized the moment. \"We're the closest we've ever been to overturning Roe v. Wade,\" a woman says in a video released online by the group Students for Life of America shortly after the news broke. In an interview with NPR, Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins called the retirement of the court's swing vote \"a day that we've been waiting for.\" \"Our goal in the pro-life movement has always been to make abortion illegal and unthinkable,\" Hawkins said. \"So we want Roe to be overturned ... and we expect that.\" Hawkins noted that Kennedy has voted to uphold abortion rights in several cases, including the landmark 1992 ruling Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and more recently, in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which overturned a Texas law that placed additional health regulations on clinics that perform abortions. Meanwhile, abortion-rights supporters, like Nancy Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights, called Kennedy's retirement devastating news. \"He has been a crucial vote in landmark reproductive rights cases,\" Northup said. \"[I'm] extremely concerned,\" said Helene Krasnoff, vice president of public policy, litigation and law at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \"President Trump has been making good on his threat to stack the courts with those who are opposed to safe, legal abortion, and we can only expect that he'll nominate another extreme opponent.\" Abortion-rights proponents protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy set the stage for a battle over abortion rights unlike any in a generation. A fight for Kennedy's replacement Both sides are gearing up for a confirmation battle in the Senate after Trump names his nominee. Republicans have a narrow, 51-seat majority, and all eyes will be on a handful of Republican senators who have been supportive of abortion rights and on red-state Democrats facing re-election in November. Senators in each group will be under pressure to come over to the other side of the aisle. \"It's gonna be epic,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, which works to elect candidates who oppose abortion rights. \"It will be cast as a pretty pivotal vote on the court on this issue and many, many others. ... We've been preparing for this fight for a very long time.\" Hawkins said her group has more than 1,200 chapters around the country, and organizers will encourage members to lobby their senators during the confirmation process. Krasnoff, of Planned Parenthood, said abortion-rights advocates also will be lobbying senators to vote against any nominee seen as likely to overturn Roe. \"President Trump and Mitch McConnell hold the balance of the court in their hands right now. And with it, they hold the right to safe and legal abortion,\" Krasnoff said. \"So we're going to be getting that message out and making sure that the Senate rejects any nominee that opposes Roe v. Wade and the right to safe, legal abortion.\" Speaking outside the Supreme Court on Thursday, Ilyse Hogue of NARAL Pro-Choice America urged abortion-rights supporters to reach out to lawmakers. \"This is about all 100 senators hearing from people on a daily basis that they do not want people, women, families, criminalized,\" Hogue said. While polling on abortion is difficult and yields mixed results depending on how the questions are asked, multiple polls suggest a majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in at least some cases, particularly in early pregnancy. A battle for the courts \u2014 and in the courts If Trump is successful in pushing through a nominee who is likely to overturn or erode Roe, the fight over the future of the decision could play out in several ways. Northup, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said restrictive laws recently passed by several states could work their way to the Supreme Court. She points to what is known as a \"heartbeat bill\" in Iowa, where state lawmakers recently approved one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. The law, which is being challenged in the courts, bans the procedure after a heartbeat can be detected, which is often before a woman knows she is pregnant. Other states, including Mississippi and Louisiana, have banned abortion at 15 weeks' gestation, and others have prohibited specific methods. \"I think it's going to be the early cutoff dates for abortion that you're gonna be seeing going up to the court that could challenge Roe v. Wade, because Roe v. Wade and its cases that have followed have made clear that before the time of fetal viability it's for the woman and her doctor to make the decision,\" Northup said. \"And these states have been passing laws trying to radically change that.\" Back to the states At the final presidential debate in Las Vegas, Trump promised that if Roe is overturned, \"It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.\" That's true, and it's the goal of many abortion-rights opponents, some of whom downplay the idea that abortion could become illegal nationwide. \"Without question, our goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade so that states are allowed to enact their own wills into law,\" said Dannenfelser, of the Susan B. Anthony List. But states have a patchwork of laws, with red states tending to pass more restrictive abortion ones. Alexis Cole, an attorney and policy director at Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, said 17 states already have laws on the books that would heavily restrict or ban abortion if Roe were overturned. She notes that because of restrictive laws and limited access to abortion, women in many states already struggle to obtain the procedure, even under Roe. \"It would no longer be a matter of traveling across your state; it would be a matter of traveling multiple states that would actually allow you to get an abortion,\" Cole said.",

During a rally in North Dakota Wednesday night, President Trump underscored the importance of protecting the GOP's Senate majority this fall, deeming it especially critical in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement. \"Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time \u2014 the most important thing we can do,\" Trump told a crowd in Fargo. The president was there to campaign for Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who's challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in one of the GOP's top opportunities to pick up a Senate seat. North Dakota is one of 10 states that Trump carried in 2016 in which Democratic incumbents are up for re-election \u2014 and he won North Dakota by about 36 points. Trump argued that Cramer would support his agenda and, most importantly, his court picks, while Heitkamp will not. \"Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court. She will be told to do so,\" Trump said. Heitkamp, however, was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. Trump didn't directly mention that vote, but did later claim that sometimes Heitkamp would give Republicans and the White House a \"quickie vote\" but that \"the day after that election, she's voting party line, 100 percent.\" In a statement after the rally, Heitkamp pushed back, saying she would continue to be her own person in the Senate, election year or not. \"Anytime the president comes to North Dakota, that's a good thing for our state. While we saw election-year politics today, I'm always willing to work with the president if he's helping North Dakota \u2014 and if he's not, I'll speak up,\" Heitkamp said. \"I don't answer to a political party or president, I only answer to North Dakotans, who deserve an independent voice in the Senate. That's why I've always been eager to work across the aisle \u2014 including with the president \u2014 to get results for our state, and today's rally hasn't changed that.\" Trump continued to tie Heitkamp to the national party throughout the rally nonetheless. \"When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota. Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck \u2014 you know who Chuck is,\" Trump said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., \"and Nancy,\" that is, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Trump also railed on Democrats' \"new leader,\" Maxine Waters, hitting the liberal California congresswoman who came under fire even from her own leadership in her call for public confrontations against Trump administration officials. Trump hit on many of his favorite subjects during the freewheeling rally \u2014 immigration, tax cuts, trade, the economy, reveling in his 2016 victory, boasting about the size of the crowd and more. But the Kennedy retirement hung over the night, and Trump also took time in his remarks to honor the retiring justice \u2014 an unpredictable swing vote who hasn't always been a favorite of conservatives despite being nominated by President Ronald Reagan. Trump called Kennedy a \"very special guy\" and promised that he would pick someone with \"intellect\" as his successor, someone he suggested could serve on the court for 40 or more years. \"I'm very honored that he chose to [retire] during my term in office. He felt confident in me to make the right choice to carry on his great legacy,\" Trump said. Heitkamp and other red state Democrats will play a crucial role in determining how much resistance a new Supreme Court nominee is met with. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 who controversially blocked President Obama's nominee to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 election, allowing Trump to fill the seat with Gorsuch \u2014 has indicated he wants a vote ahead of the 2018 midterms. But Democrats have called such a decision hypocrisy, given McConnell's insistence against holding a confirmation hearing during an election year. The Senate is currently split 51-49 for Republicans, but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been absent for months battling brain cancer, so the margin for error is even smaller. There are some GOP wildcard votes too \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski support abortion rights, and one reason Trump supporters are cheering a Kennedy replacement \u2014 and Democrats are so fearful \u2014 is the belief that a new justice could help overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion. Along with Heitkamp, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also voted to confirm Gorsuch last year \u2014 and the trio of often centrist Democrats are considered some of the most endangered Senate incumbents in November's elections. Given their re-election concerns, they could be under pressure to do so again with Trump's new Supreme Court nominee. Even so, Trump made it clear with Heitkamp on Wednesday night, that won't earn them a pass ahead of the November elections from him or Republicans.",

Updated at 11:26 a.m. The U.S. Supreme Court has reversed a lower court decision upholding a California law requiring anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to more fully disclose what they are. The case pitted the right to know against the right of free speech. On one side are self-identified \"crisis pregnancy centers\" that seek to prevent abortions and on the other side is the state of California, which enacted a 2015 law to ensure that these centers do not intentionally or unintentionally mislead the women who walk through their doors. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the centers are likely to succeed in their claim that the law violates the First Amendment. That overturns an earlier decision by the Ninth Circuit upholding the law and sends the case back for further consideration. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said the law \"targets speakers, not speech, and imposes an unduly burdensome disclosure requirement that will chill their protected speech.\" Supporters of the California law called the state's effort nothing more than seeking \"truth in advertising.\" But anti-abortion pregnancy centers saw the law as unconstitutional, compelling speech that turns them into mouthpieces for a government message they disagree with. Passions run high when it comes to abortion. Add the fact that most anti-abortion pregnancy centers have a firm Christian perspective, and you have quite a volatile mix. It was a galvanizing issue for social conservatives in 2016. Many supported then-candidate Donald Trump,  despite concerns about his character and temperament, in an effort to fill the court with conservative justices. Trump delivered on that goal with his appointment of Neil Gorsuch soon after taking office. Reacting to the high court ruling, NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement that the court \"turned its back on women\" and highlighted the high stakes for future decisions. \"One vote made all the difference today, and it could also be the only thing between upholding Roe or outlawing legal abortion in America,\" Hogue said. \"Fake women's health centers, with the rest of the well-funded and well-connected anti-choice movement, have been working towards this moment for decades. They have carefully put the pieces together \u2014 passing radical and unconstitutional abortion bans, stacking the lower courts \u2014 because they are counting on Trump's Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade. Roe is at greater risk than ever before.\" Abortion-rights opponents praised the decision as a victory for free speech. Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America, said in a statement, \"To be clear, this case was not about abortion. Malicious abortion politics definitely were the motivation behind it, but the case centered on the inappropriate mandate of the state compelling pro-life clinics to promote abortion in violation of their consciences.  The case was about forced speech.\" The case began in 2015 when California passed a law known as the Reproductive FACT Act. (It stands for Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency.) The impetus was twofold \u2014 first, allegations that pregnancy centers opposed to abortion were using deceptive practices; and second, concern that lower-income women, in particular, weren't aware of the free pregnancy-related services California provides, from prenatal and delivery care to birth control and abortion. The FACT Act requires unlicensed crisis pregnancy centers to post a sign or otherwise disclose to their clients in writing that the center is not a licensed medical facility and has no licensed medical provider who supervises the provision of services. The disclosure requirement extends to advertising, which anti-abortion pregnancy centers objected to as an attempt to \"drown out\" their message. The second provision of the law, dealing with licensed centers, requires clinics that do not provide a full range of reproductive care, including services covered by Medicaid, to post a sign that says the state provides free or low-cost access to prenatal care, birth control and other reproductive care, including abortions. In recent years, the number of pregnancy centers that counsel against abortion has dramatically increased. There are about 2,700 of them across the country, more than three times the number of clinics that provide abortions. And just as some states provide taxpayer funds for abortions, 14 states directly fund anti-abortion pregnancy centers. From 2001 to 2006, the centers received an estimated $30 million in federal funding. There is no data on how many of the 2,700 anti-abortion pregnancy centers are unlicensed. But unlicensed clinics offer pregnancy tests and limited ultrasounds, and, to an unskeptical eye, they can look very much like a licensed medical facility. The personnel wear surgical scrubs or white coats and ask clients to fill out medical history questionnaires. Indeed, many clinics locate next to or across the street from a full-service women's reproductive health center and some use similar-sounding names. NPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.",

Ultimately, Irish voters backed repeal of the ban \u2014 but, as evidenced by their signs, those in favor of repeal were already thinking of what may happen next in Northern Ireland. Before Ireland voted Friday on whether to repeal its constitutional ban on abortion, many observers in the predominantly Catholic, traditionally conservative country expected a close result on the hotly contested question. Then, the Irish actually voted \u2014 and it was a blowout. More than 66 percent of the country voted to roll back its strict prohibition against abortion in nearly all cases, opening the door for possible legislation allowing abortion in certain situations. Now, resounding victory in hand, abortion rights advocates are turning their attentions north of the border. There, in the U.K. province of Northern Ireland, authorities maintain an abortion ban as strict as in the Republic. Unlike other parts of the U.K., which allows abortion before 24 weeks of pregnancy and in some other cases, Northern Ireland allows terminations only if a mother's life or long-term health is at risk. Monday, activists outside the city hall in Belfast, the seat of the regional government, demanded: What about us? The answer to that question, though, is not so simple as it may appear. One day before the Belfast demonstrations, the U.K.'s conservative prime minister, Theresa May, congratulated Irish voters on delivering \"a clear and unambiguous result\" \u2014 while, at the same time, remaining a little ambiguous herself on whether Northern Ireland would ever weigh a similar question. \u201cThe Irish Referendum yesterday was an impressive show of democracy which delivered a clear and unambiguous result. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision and all of #Together4Yes on their successful campaign.\u201d \u2013 PM @theresa_may #repealedthe8th On Tuesday, her spokesperson clarified why. \"It's important to recognize that the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to their own process which is run by locally elected politicians,\" James Slack told reporters in London. \"We are of the view that this is a devolved matter.\" May has a convincing political reason, above and beyond any broad theories she may hold on proper governance, to leave the matter entirely with regional lawmakers: It was only with the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party that May was able to form a governing coalition after her Conservative Party suffered painful losses in last year's parliamentary elections \u2014 and the DUP is one of the region's staunchest abortion opponents. \"Friday's referendum has no impact upon the law in Northern Ireland, but we obviously take note of issues impacting upon our nearest neighbour,\" the party's leader, Arlene Foster, said in a statement released after the referendum's official results were announced. She said the Irish referendum had been held because the country's ban had been enshrined in its constitution, whereas \"no such constitutional bar exists in Northern Ireland.\" So, Foster asserted, the matter then falls to Northern Ireland's devolved assembly to decide \u2014 which would a bit difficult to do, given that the stark partisan divide between the region's two major parties has left it effectively without a functioning government for about a year and a half. And anyway, Foster and her party are content to let the ban stand. \"The DUP is a pro-life party and we will continue to articulate our position,\" she added in her statement. \"It is an extremely sensitive issue and not one that should have people taking to the streets in celebration.\" Still, that did little to dissuade the demonstrators who took to Belfast's streets on Monday, fresh off the news of the vote. At a rally Monday in Belfast, some demonstrators took aim specifically at the Democratic Unionist Party, which reiterated its support over the weekend for Northern Ireland's strict laws on abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles McQuillan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At a rally Monday in Belfast, some demonstrators took aim specifically at the Democratic Unionist Party, which reiterated its support over the weekend for Northern Ireland's strict laws on abortion. \"It is completely crazy abortion is not available here, especially when you see the DUP saying they are part of the UK and have solidarity with England,\" one Belfast resident told the Irish Times. \"But we don't have the same rights as England and now Ireland is changing the law. Everyone should have the choice.\" And Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, appears prepared indirectly to offer the Northern Irish that choice even if lawmakers in Belfast don't. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports that his health minister, Simon Harris, says the government is working on a draft bill that would allow elective abortion before 12 weeks of pregnancy, with limited access through 23 weeks. And Varadkar himself, a vocal supporter of the repeal efforts, said it is possible the eventual law would allow Northern Irish women to come south and undergo abortion procedures in the Republic of Ireland. \"We do have people who already come to our hospitals from Northern Ireland for healthcare,\" he said, according to The Guardian, \"so I imagine it will be treated as a normal part of our health service.\"",

The planned revival of a policy dating to Ronald Reagan's presidency that was slightly retooled and quietly submitted for federal budget review Friday may finally present a way for President Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to \"defund\" Planned Parenthood. Or at least to evict it from the federal family planning program, where it provides care to more than 40 percent of that program's 4 million patients. Congress last year failed to wipe out funding for Planned Parenthood, because the bill faced overwhelming Democratic objections and would not have received the 60 votes needed to pass in the Senate. But Trump's move Friday could potentially accomplish what Congress could not. According to administration officials, the proposed rules they have submitted to the Office of Management and Budget would require facilities receiving federal family planning funds to be physically separate from those that perform abortion; would eliminate the requirement that women with unintended pregnancies be counseled on their full range of reproductive options; and would ban abortion referrals. All those changes would particularly affect Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood, which provides a broad array of reproductive health services to women and men, also provides abortion services using nonfederal funds. Cutting off funding has been the top priority for anti-abortion-rights groups, which supported candidate Trump. \"A win like this would immediately disentangle taxpayers from the abortion business and energize the grassroots as we head into the critical midterm elections,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that opposes abortion, said in a written statement. In a conference call with reporters, Planned Parenthood officials said they would fight the new rules. \"We've been very clear, Planned Parenthood has an unwavering commitment to ensuring everyone has access to the full range of reproductive health care, and that includes abortion,\" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Here is a guide to what the proposal could do and what it could mean for Planned Parenthood and the family planning program: What is Title X? The federal family planning program, known as \"Title X,\" is named for its section in the federal Public Health Service Act. It became law in 1970, three years before the Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade. The original bill was sponsored by then-Rep. George H.W. Bush, R-Texas, and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The program provides wellness exams and comprehensive contraceptive services, as well as screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases for both women and men. In 2016, the most recent year for which statistics have been published, Title X served 4 million patients at just under 4,000 sites. Title X patients are overwhelmingly young, female and low-income. An estimated 11 percent of Title X patients in 2016 were male; two-thirds of patients were under age 30; and nearly two-thirds had income below the federal poverty line. What is Planned Parenthood's relationship to Title X and Medicaid? Planned Parenthood's affiliates account for about 13 percent of all Title X sites but serve an estimated 40 percent of its patients. Only about half of Planned Parenthood affiliates perform abortions, although the organization in its entirety is the nation's leading abortion provider. Planned Parenthood also gets much more federal funding for services provided to patients on the Medicaid program (although not for abortion) than it does through Title X. Eliminating Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood has proved more difficult for lawmakers opposed to the organization because the federal Medicaid law includes the right for patients to select their providers. Changing that also would require a 60-vote majority in the Senate. So that particular line of funding likely is not at risk. While opponents of federal funding for Planned Parenthood have said that other safety-net clinics could make up the difference if Planned Parenthood no longer participates in Title X, several studies have suggested that in many remote areas Planned Parenthood is the only provider of family planning services and the only provider that regularly stocks all methods of birth control. Texas, Iowa and Missouri in recent years have stopped offering family planning services through a special Medicaid program to keep from funding Planned Parenthood. Texas is seeking a waiver from the Trump administration so that its program banning abortion providers could still receive federal funding. No decision has been made yet, federal officials say. Why is Planned Parenthood's involvement with Title X controversial? Even though Planned Parenthood cannot use federal funding for abortions, opponents of abortion rights claim that federal funding is \"fungible\" and there is no way to ensure that some of the funding provided for other services does not cross-subsidize abortion services. Planned Parenthood has also been a longtime public target for forces that oppose abortion rights because it is such a visible provider and vocal proponent of legal abortion services. In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration tried to separate the program from its federal funding by requiring parental permission for teens to obtain birth control. That was followed by efforts to eliminate abortion counseling. Starting in 2011, in an effort to get the organization defunded, undercover groups accused the organization of ignoring sex traffickers and selling fetal body parts. Planned Parenthood denied the allegations, which were proved false in court. What happened the last time an administration tried to move Planned Parenthood out of Title X? In 1987, the Reagan administration proposed what came to be known as the \"gag rule.\" Though the Trump administration's new proposal is not yet public, because the details are still under review by the federal Office of Management and Budget, the White House released a summary, saying the new rule will be similar although not identical to the Reagan-era proposal. The original gag rule would have forbidden Title X providers to offer abortion counseling or refer patients for abortions. It would have required physical separation of Title X facilities from those that provide abortions and would have forbidden recipients to use nonfederal funds for lobbying, distributing information or in any way advocating or encouraging abortion. (The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the umbrella group for local affiliates, has a separate political and advocacy arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.) Those rules were the subject of heated congressional debate through most of the George H.W. Bush administration and were upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in 1991, Rust v. Sullivan. Even then, the gag rule did not go into effect because subsequent efforts to relax the rules somewhat to allow doctors (but not other health professionals) to counsel people about the availability of abortion created another round of legal fights. Eventually the rule was in effect for only about a month before it was again blocked by a U.S. appeals court. President Bill Clinton canceled the rules by executive order on his second day in office, and no other president has tried to revive them until now. How is the Trump administration's proposal different from earlier rules? According to the summary of the new proposal, released Friday, it will require physical separation of family planning facilities from those that provide abortions, will repeal current counseling requirements, and will ban abortion referrals. One of the biggest differences, however, is that the new rules will not explicitly forbid abortion counseling by Title X providers. But Planned Parenthood officials say that allowing counseling while banning referrals is a distinction without a difference. \"Blocking doctors from telling a patient where they can get safe and legal care in this country is the definition of a gag rule,\" said Kashif Syed, a senior policy analyst for Planned Parenthood. What happens next? All proposed rules are reviewed by the OMB. Sometimes they emerge and are published in a few days; sometimes they are rewritten, and it takes months. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood officials say they will not know whether they will take legal action until they see the final language of the rule. But they say they do plan to use the regulatory process to fight the proposed changes that have been made public so far.

Federal prosecutors have gone where the Federal Election Commission can't find its way, charging two Arizona brothers with using bogus political action committees to scam gullible small-dollar donors. A criminal complaint alleges that William and Robert Tierney raised more than $23 million between 2014 and 2017. It says William Tierney's share was more than $3 million; Robert Tierney's was more than $600,000; the candidates they claimed to be supporting got about $109,000. The brothers allegedly paid an unnamed co-conspirator more than $250,000, with the rest going for fundraising expenses and other overhead. FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. called the Tierneys' network of PACs \"nothing more than a front for an extensive personal fundraising campaign.\" He said it was \"lacking in ethical oversight and laden with greed.\" The Tierneys were charged by federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and were arraigned Thursday at federal district court in Phoenix. Lawyers for the brothers didn't respond to NPR's requests for comment. The Tierneys' PACs solicited loyal conservatives who made contributions of $200 or less. Small donors' names aren't made public in campaign finance reports. The PACs cited in the case against the Tierneys were apparently named by plucking from the salad bowl of conservative buzzwords: Grassroots Awareness PAC, Americans for Law Enforcement PAC,  National Campaign PAC, Protect Our Future PAC, Voter Education PAC and Action Coalition PAC. The complaint says the Tierneys managed three others: Life and Liberty PAC, Republican Majority Campaign PAC and RightMarch.com PAC. The PACs claimed to be raising money for causes such as autism awareness, a law enforcement coalition, an anti-abortion-rights committee, a Republican victory committee and a campaign to stop illegal immigration. Scam PACs have long been identified as a problem in the loosely regulated world of independent political money. Two journalists, Casey Tolan and Paul Jossey, separately investigated the network in 2016 and 2017 and published articles. The Federal Election Commission has found itself unable to shut down scam PACs. Five years ago it took up complaints against five alleged scam PACs and wound up finding no \"reason to believe\" wrongdoing had occurred. In 2015, Virginia conservative politician Ken Cuccinelli sued a PAC for allegedly using his name to raise money. The case ended with a negotiated settlement.",

In last week's primaries, Republican internal divisions were highlighted. But Tuesday night, it was the Democrats' turn \u2014 and in some of the very places the party needs to win to take back the House. In a handful of competitive congressional districts, progressive candidates defeated more moderate Democrats, signaling a primary season fought at the polls and the poles. Midterms are driven by activists, and the enthusiasm is overwhelmingly with liberals. The question is whether that energy will be enough to win general elections in moderate places, like in the redrawn districts in Pennsylvania, where Democrats hoped to have half a dozen new targets, and in the Omaha, Neb., area, where a former Democratic congressman was defeated Tuesday. It was again, though, not a great night for Republican congressmen either, with one denied a job promotion by voters and another with an underwhelming primary win for higher office. Progressives push back A big message out of Tuesday night \u2014 and one that has been brewing since Trump was elected \u2014 is that Democratic establishment efforts to hold back liberals are unlikely to be successful. Democrats need to net 23 seats to take back the House in November. But in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, in particular, a seat Democrats hoped to put high on the target list may have come off the board. Kara Eastman, a nonprofit director who campaigned on Medicare-for-all, upset the more centrist former Rep. Brad Ashford. This is a district Barack Obama carried in 2008 but lost in 2012. Trump won the district in 2016 by about 2 points. Washington Democrats were hoping in this environment that Ashford could win in a rematch with incumbent GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who defeated Ashford in 2016. A similar dynamic played out in Pennsylvania's 1st and 7th congressional districts, where it was an equally bad night for moderates. In the 7th District, John Morganelli, a district attorney, got caught tweeting something nice about President Trump, and that was it. He drew the ire of national liberal outside groups, and it cost him. He lost in this blue-collar Pennsylvania district \u2014 that went from 8 points pro-Trump to plus-1 for Clinton after court-ordered redistricting \u2014 by fewer than 1,500 votes to Susan Wild. Wild supports a $15 minimum wage, is pro-abortion rights and is in favor of legalizing marijuana. But she wasn't the most liberal candidate in the race. That was Greg Edwards, a black pastor with the backing of Bernie Sanders. In the 1st District, which has gone from a district Trump won to plus-2 Clinton turf after redistricting, moderate Rachel Reddick lost to Scott Wallace, a wealthy populist, who has dubbed himself a \"Patriotic Millionaire.\" And as with Wild, Democrats might not be all that unhappy with Wallace's win given his willingness to spend his own money. But there is a changing dynamic with the energy on the left. It used to be that the party establishments could influence, if not outright pick, who the primary winner would be \u2014 with a surprise here or there. But this year, in the age of the Resistance, no one appears to be falling in line. And that is just what progressives want. After all, conservatives made the argument \u2014 and won it \u2014 that they shouldn't have RINOs (Republicans in name only) because it watered down conservative enthusiasm. But even though conservatives were able to ride that kind of energy in the Tea Party-wave year of 2010, the districts have become even more structurally favorable to the GOP since. So it's going to be tested if candidates with a D next to their name can try the same thing this fall, and whether more liberal candidates win competitive seats on election night will be a key measure of whether the Democrats' blue wave is crashing ashore. Not a great night for Republican congressmen again In Idaho, GOP Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, who ran to be \"a governor who will get government out of the way,\" had released internal polling in January showing him ahead. But on Tuesday, he lost to Lt. Gov. Brad Little by about 5 points. Labrador is yet another GOP congressman to be denied a job promotion by voters, following colleagues in Indiana and West Virginia who fell short in Senate bids last week. And in Pennsylvania, Rep. Lou Barletta, an immigration hard-liner, won his GOP primary to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, but by an underwhelming margin against an underfunded candidate. Trump congratulated Barletta on Wednesday morning. Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven\u2019t been represented in many years. Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Barletta, though, developed a reputation for not working as hard as he could in the primary. That will have to change in the general election if Republicans are to have a real shot at upsetting Casey. Last week, four GOP congressmen went down to defeat \u2014 three looking to win Senate primaries and one outright beaten in a primary as he sought re-election.",

Updated at 11:17 a.m. ET Wednesday Democratic women again finished strong in primaries on Tuesday night, with Pennsylvania poised to send as many as four to Congress next year to break up the state's all-male congressional delegation. There are more than a half-dozen competitive congressional seats on the table in Pennsylvania, one of four states that voted on Tuesday. Pennsylvania is a critical part of the Democrats' calculus for getting the 23 seats they need to win back control of the House, but the party will still have to move past some messy ideological fights following the primary. Democratic Party leaders have seen the candidates they think are strongest win out in earlier primary states like Illinois, North Carolina and Ohio. Pennsylvania was their next major test after a court-ordered congressional redistricting gave the Democrats much more favorable positioning in the state. But things may not go their way in Nebraska, where the more progressive candidate is ahead of a former Democratic congressman by only 1,126 votes. If that result stands, a district President Trump narrowly won could fall off Democrats' wish list. Idaho and Oregon also voted Tuesday. The Idaho GOP gubernatorial primary was another nasty fight, with the Republican candidates trying to establish their outsider credentials. Pennsylvania: Women top Democratic primary contests At least one of the women Pennsylvania might send to Congress could be in the top-targeted 7th Congressional District, where former Allentown solicitor Susan Wild won the Democratic primary. This district morphed from one Trump carried by 8 points to an area that Hillary Clinton won by 1 point, and GOP Rep. Charlie Dent has resigned, leaving the Lehigh Valley seat vacant. The messy Democratic primary showcased the competing factions the party had to overcome as it tries to flip such districts. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli attracted attention as the most conservative Democrat on the ballot. An immigration hard-liner who opposes abortion in most cases, Morganelli had deleted tweets slamming progressive groups and praising President Trump, CNN reported. EMILY's List, which backed Wild, and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer's NextGen America both went on the attack against Morganelli. The Rev. Greg Edwards had the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and claimed the progressive mantle, but he finished in third place.

After a tough primary, Wild will still have to work to get the party fully behind her to face the GOP nominee. The GOP race between Lehigh County Commission Chair Marty Nothstein, a former Olympic gold medalist in cycling, and former Lehigh County Commissioner Dean Browning is too close to call. In the 1st District, it's wealthy philanthropist Scott Wallace who will face off against GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. After redistricting, this district shifted from territory that President Trump narrowly carried to an area that Clinton won by 2 points, giving Democrats a prime pickup opportunity. Wallace spent heavily to win the contest, putting $2.5 million into his campaign to beat Navy veteran Rachel Reddick in the primary. Some Democrats may see his ability to self-fund as a good thing, but as Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman pointed out, \"Wallace's elite pedigree could backfire with regular voters in November.\" Wallace hasn't lived full time in the Bucks County-based district in decades, and he has more ties to suburban Washington, D.C., and South Africa as of late. Expect his wealth and time outside the area to be a prime GOP attack line in this blue-collar district, which could help Republicans defend it. In a statement after Wallace's win, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n emphasized that Wallace was \"born and bred in Bucks County ... and as president of a global charity, Scott has spent his life making a difference in [people's] lives.\" A former school board member named Mary Gay Scanlon won the crowded Democratic primary in the vacant 5th District, which includes the southern Philadelphia suburbs. Former GOP Rep. Pat Meehan \u2014 who resigned last month amid a sexual harassment scandal \u2014 would have had to run in solidly Democratic turf under the new lines. Scanlon has the backing of much of the state's political establishment, and she'll be heavily favored to win this November, too.

State Rep. Madeleine Dean will also be a front-runner, competing in the open Pennsylvania 4th District, which Clinton carried by 20 points. Former Air Force officer Chrissy Houlahan is the Democratic nominee in the open 6th District, which Clinton won by 10 points. Republican Rick Saccone \u2014 who lost a high-profile special election earlier this year in the old 18th District to Democrat Conor Lamb \u2014 lost again on Tuesday. He was defeated in the GOP primary for the new 15th District by state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler. Politico reported that former Rep. Tim Murphy \u2014 whose resignation last year amid a sex scandal prompted the March special election in the first place \u2014 worked to undermine Saccone's campaign. Murphy has directed funds from his old campaign account to a group backing Reschenthaler, saying he would be the stronger general election candidate. Rep. Lou Barletta also won the GOP Senate primary, but in a closer-than-expected win over state Rep. Jim Christiana. Even with Barletta's victory, GOP hopes to take out Democratic Sen. Bob Casey have faded recently. Nebraska:  Progressive vs. centrist fight comes down to a photo finish Progressive nonprofit director Kara Eastman pulled off a nail-biter upset over former Democratic Rep. Brad Ashford in the Omaha-based 2nd District in Nebraska. With all precincts reporting, she led by only 1,126 votes. That margin is just ouside the trigger for an automatic recount, which according to state law happens if the final total is within 1 percentage point. Ashford's centrist reputation would have put this seat in play, but if the more liberal Eastman's lead does hold the race could now be out of reach for Democrats in this district that Trump carried by just 2 points in 2016. If Ashford had won, it would have set up a rematch with GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who narrowly defeated Ashford in 2016 after the Democrat had served one term. During the primary, Eastman assailed Ashford for not being liberal enough, campaigning on a Medicare-for-all pledge and arguing she would push for tougher gun laws. Ashford once opposed banning assault weapons, but he has since changed his mind and had been endorsed by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords' gun control group, Americans for Responsible Solutions. Republicans were quick to paint Eastman as too liberal for the district and didn't hide their glee about the Democratic civil war there. \"Far-left progressives are winning the war for the soul of the Democratic Party, and it appears they have their first scalp in former Congressman Brad Ashford. If these results hold, all of Nancy Pelosi and the DCCC's efforts to put their thumb on the scale couldn't save Ashford \u2014 now every establishment Democrat in a contested primary has reason to be very nervous,\" National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jack Pandol said in a statement. Idaho governor: Battle to be the most non-establishment Outgoing Republican Gov. Butch Otter's seat is almost assured to stay in GOP hands in November, and Lt. Gov. Brad Little won the Republican primary to replace him. Former state Rep. Paulette Jordan became the first woman to win the state's Democratic nomination for governor, and if she won would be Idaho's first female governor and the nation's first Native American governor, though the odds are long for a Democrat to take that post in Boise. Little defeated Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador and Tommy Ahlquist, a real estate developer and former physician who argued he is the outsider most like Trump. Labrador, one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus that has often clashed with GOP leadership, joins a list of Republican lawmakers who have lost primary bids for statewide office this year, including House members who failed to advance in GOP Senate bids from Indiana and West Virginia last week.",

            "article_content": "It's been nearly two months since Republican Congressman Rick Saccone narrowly lost a special election to Democrat Conor Lamb. On Tuesday, Saccone will make another attempt to win a seat in Congress.  LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST: Pennsylvania holds its primaries on Tuesday. And we're going to hear now about one of those races. You may remember the name Rick Saccone. He's the Republican who narrowly lost a special House election to Democrat Connor Lamb in March. The loss was embarrassing for Saccone and the GOP in what's been a Republican-friendly district. But as An-li Herring of member station WESA explains, Saccone is not letting that loss deter him. In fact, he's running again for another House seat. AN-LI HERRING, BYLINE: Saccone sits at his campaign headquarters with one staffer. It's a big difference from before the special election when dozens of volunteers were bustling around the office. But Saccone says he's happy to be free from the national media attention and outside groups that he says distorted his message. RICK SACCONE: Remember those outside groups spent that money not on me. They spent it on their own message - mostly Nancy - anti-Nancy Pelosi message. It wasn't on Rick Saccone. It wasn't helping Rick Saccone to tell Rick Saccone's story. HERRING: Saccone's loss in the special election may well haunt him in the May 15 primary. GUY RESCHENTHALER: We are all there to support Rick's account. The president was within the district twice. His children came on several occasions. The vice president came. HERRING: That's Saccone's primary opponent, State Senator Guy Reschenthaler. Reschenthaler says the special election was such a debacle that many in his party urged him to run against Saccone. RESCHENTHALER: So I think that voters deserve another choice, and it's time to put a new candidate forward who has a history of winning, like myself. HERRING: Reschenthaler appears to have the backing of the state's Republican establishment. He's raised lots of money. And at age 35, says he's a fresh face. RESCHENTHALER: I think Republican voters want somebody who's new. HERRING: Saccone, who's 60, has the support of anti-abortion and pro-gun rights activists. That may work to his advantage because the district will become much more Conservative due to court-ordered redistricting. But in terms of policy, Republican strategist Charlie Gerow says little separates the two candidates. CHARLIE GEROW: You've got two conservative Republicans, so it becomes much more of a personality-driven race. HERRING: So far, the candidates have attacked each other's resumes. Saccone has said he served as a diplomat in North Korea in the early-2000s, but Reschenthaler's campaign says he exaggerated his work there. Meanwhile, Saccone says Reschenthaler is little more than an ambitious career politician. SACCONE: He's jumped and hopped from one job to another, never finishing a term in any one position that he's been in. HERRING: Saccone's loss in the special election has energized some of his supporters, including Kim Stolfer who's a local gun-rights activist. KIM STOLFER: If anything, it's brought a sense of saltiness because of some in the national media who have criticized him. HERRING: Given the district's new, more Conservative complexion, whoever prevails in this primary stands a good chance of winning the seat this fall. For NPR News, I'm An-li Herring.

Wendy Vitter is now nominated for a judgeship.\n                \n                    \n                    Patrick Semansky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wendy Vitter, with her husband, David Vitter, after he was reelected to the Senate in 2010 despite being linked to the \"D.C. Madam\" scandal. Wendy Vitter is now nominated for a judgeship. Updated at 4:10 p.m. ET Wendy Vitter, nominated by President Trump for a federal judgeship, tried Wednesday to walk back several controversial comments she made about abortion and birth control. Questioned by skeptical Democrats at her confirmation hearing, she maintained she could \"put aside\" her long-held \"pro-life\" advocacy, and as a judge enforce the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision on abortion rights. In particular, Vitter sought to distance herself from a brochure she had appeared to endorse while leading a panel at a pro-life conference in 2013. The panel was called \"Abortion Hurts Women,\" and the brochure promoted a variety of unsubstantiated claims linking birth control pills to breast cancer, cervical and liver cancers, and \"violent death.\" On this last point \u2014 violent death \u2014 the brochure alleged that women who take oral contraceptives prefer men with similar DNA, and that women in these partnerships have fewer sexual relations, leading to more adultery, and \"understandably ... violence.\" All of these claims have been debunked by leading medical and scientific organizations, as Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii observed. \"You urged the audience to distribute the materials making these dangerous claims. ... Do you believe the claims that Dr. Lanfranchi makes that abortion causes breast cancer and that birth control causes women to be assaulted and murdered?\" she asked. Vitter asserted she had \"no background,\" was \"not a medical professional\" and \"had never heard those opinions before.\" \"You called them facts,\" Hirono countered. \"I did say 'facts,' and then I stopped myself and said 'brochure,' \" replied Vitter. In fact, what she said was, \"Go to Dr. Angela's website, Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, download it, and at your next physical, you walk into your pro-life doctor and say, 'Have you thought about putting these facts or this brochure in your waiting room?' Each one of you can be the pro-life advocate to take that next step. That's what you do with it.\" Hirono persisted: \"Judges have to apply common sense. Does it even make sense to you that people who use birth control pills would be more likely to be assaulted or murdered?\" After a pause, Vitter conceded that it did not make sense. Planned Parenthood rally Other Democratic senators pointed to remarks that Vitter made at a rally protesting the construction of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Baton Rouge, La., where she accused Planned Parenthood of \"killing over 150,000 females a year.\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked Vitter pointedly, \"Do you stand by the statement that Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 women a year?\" When Vitter replied that she was \"pro-life\" and would \"set aside\" her own religious or personal views, Sen. Blumenthal was unsatisfied. \"I'm really not asking you about setting aside your personal views,\" he said. \"I'm asking you very simply. You said Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 females. Do you stand by that statement? It's a yes or no question.\" \"My pro-life stance has been made very clear,\" replied Vitter. Omissions Vitter became the subject of particular scrutiny not just because of her strong advocacy, but because she initially failed to disclose to the Senate Judiciary Committee public appearances at which she made some of her most controversial statements. \"Did you omit these materials because they would cause you to face difficult questions, like the ones I'm asking, about your judgement and temperament at this confirmation hearing?\" asked Hirono. \"My life has been an open book,\" Vitter said. \"It was always my intent to provide this committee with a full background and explanation of both my personal and professional life.\" Leading up to Wednesday's hearing, Democrats pointed out that Republicans had a zero-tolerance policy for such omissions during the Obama years. When law professor Goodwin Liu, a prolific speaker and writer, left out dozens of his often-repetitious speeches, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were so outraged that they blocked his nomination. Indeed, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general, suggested Liu's failure to disclose could be a felony. \"Title 18, Section 1001 makes it a criminal offense to make a false statement to the government. Two years in jail. A felony,\" Sessions said at an April 15, 2010, hearing. Vitter's failure to disclose, though fewer in number, was, in the eyes of her critics, more serious than Liu's. They see her omissions not only as an attempt to hide her most controversial statements, but they also argue that some of those statements go to the heart of what a trial judge is supposed to do \u2014 evaluate evidence. \"Pro-life\" judge Vitter repeated throughout the hearing, \"I am pro-life,\" but continued to assert that she would set aside her \"personal and religious\" beliefs when serving as a judge. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., pointing to President Trump's frequently repeated pledge to appoint \"pro-life judges,\" asked Vitter, \"From your perspective what does it mean to be a pro-life judge?\" Vitter said she could \"not comment on that,\" but that she would be bound by the precedent of Roe v. Wade. However, at the 2013 \"Abortion Hurts Women\" panel, Vitter spoke admiringly about laws adopted in Texas regulating abortion that were then being challenged in the courts. At the time, Texas argued that the laws were enacted to protect women's health, but Vitter appeared to understand the real purpose behind the laws. She praised Texas for \"making great strides in making it very difficult to get abortions.\" \"And we're going to be right there,\" Vitter proclaimed, \"because pro-life forces are there.\" The Supreme Court ultimately struck down the Texas laws because the court said they interfered with a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy and, in fact, made the procedure less safe. Is she fit? Vitter is well known in Louisiana. She is the wife of former Sen. David Vitter, R-La., implicated in the \"D.C. Madam\" sex scandal in 2007. He accompanied his wife to Wednesday's hearing. Wendy Vitter has been a significant presence in Louisiana politics, sticking with her husband when the sex scandal became public. Then-Sen. David Vitter, R-La., speaks to the media with his wife Wendy in 2007. It was his first public appearance since his phone number was linked to a Washington escort service.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Sen. David Vitter, R-La., speaks to the media with his wife Wendy in 2007. It was his first public appearance since his phone number was linked to a Washington escort service. After graduating from Tulane Law School in 1986, she joined the New Orleans District Attorney's Office, which for years has been plagued with charges of misconduct. In 1990, she became chief of trials. But after 1993, she left the practice of law for 19 years, instead helping to run her husband's political campaigns. In 2012, she became general counsel for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans. The American Bar Association gave Vitter's nomination its lowest qualified rating, with a minority of those reviewing her record rating her \"unqualified.\" That said, Vitter received a boost on Monday when New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat, backed her nomination. He wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee that he \"can personally attest to her strong moral character,\" and said, \"I trust that Wendy will uphold the law in a fair and honest manner and would be an asset to the Federal bench of the Eastern District of Louisiana.\" And with the filibuster rule now abolished for all judicial nominees, all Vitter needs is 51 votes to win confirmation. Republicans, so far, have not bucked the president on any judicial nomination that's come to a vote. Three nominees have withdrawn their names from consideration, including Brett Talley, who continues to supervise judicial nominations at the Justice Department. Neither Talley nor Matthew Petersen, a former member of the Federal Election Commission, had any significant trial experience, and withdrew when Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican, made clear he would not support their nominations. Kennedy has proved a skillful questioner of judicial nominees, but his questions of Vitter were all supportive. He succeeded David Vitter, the nominee's husband, in 2017. Lee Sheehan is an NPR Supreme Court intern.",

With her is Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. Mississippi's new senator is making a name for herself in the state's history books as the first woman to represent the Magnolia State on the Hill. Cindy Hyde-Smith landed the spot as Mississippi's junior senator last month, when Gov. Phil Bryant, also a Republican, appointed her to fill the vacancy left by Sen. Thad Cochran's retirement. The appointment came in spite of calls from GOP leaders, including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for Bryant to appoint himself, according to The Washington Post. Cochran retired after a 40-year career for health reasons and officially left on April 1. Hyde-Smith was sworn in Monday by Vice President Pence. The Senate Hyde-Smith is joining has more women than ever before. She brings the count to 23 \u2014 a record. The former Democrat enters office and steps onto the campaign trail at the same time as she will be fighting to maintain her appointed Senate seat in November. In fact, she got a campaign website before an official Senate site. The 58-year-old presents herself as a strong, \"unwavering\" Trump supporter who is committed to putting the needs of her fellow Mississippians first. Her campaign website touts Hyde-Smith as someone with a \"strong social conservative voting record with a 100 percent pro-life rating [who is] a lifetime member of the NRA.\" In a video tweeted Monday, she calls her first day a \"great morning\" that is \"pretty historic in my life, for sure, and for the state of Mississippi\" and tells constituents how ready she is to be their senator. I couldn\u2019t be more honored to serve the people of Mississippi. Thank you for all your prayers and kind words as I get sworn in today. #Cindy2018 pic.twitter.com/xDGPW7D9cf According to her website, her family has farmed for generations and she has raised cattle with her husband for years. Hyde-Smith and her family live in Brookhaven, Miss., a town of just over 12,300 people, and belong to a Baptist church there. With Hyde-Smith's swearing-in, Vermont is now the only state that has never sent a woman to represent it on Capitol Hill. (That said, Mississippi still has yet to elect a woman to the House or Senate.) Mississippi has been an outlier among Southern states in terms of women in Congress. Georgia sent Democrat Rebecca Latimer Felton to the Senate for one day in 1922. Arkansas was represented in the Senate by Hattie Wyatt Caraway for 13 years starting in 1931, Louisiana followed with Rose McConnell Long in 1936 and Alabama with Dixie Bibb Graves in 1937. Hyde-Smith served as a state senator from 2000-2012, but in 2011 she ran for Mississippi commissioner of agriculture and commerce and won \u2014 the first woman to ever be elected to that state position. She was elected again in 2015. Hyde-Smith has had to forge a new path as a woman in Mississippi politics. But being a woman won't necessarily hold her back in the next election \u2014 voters will choose the the candidate most closely associated with their party, says Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a lecturer at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. She says that when it comes to voters, \"partisanship is the dominant factor.\" Gender may play a role later, but party is the trump card. And with the Republican Party, it might come down to the Trump card. Despite her professed dedication to the president, Hyde-Smith's appointment hasn't been endorsed by Trump. Mississippi will hold a special election for the seat on Nov. 6, the same day as the general election. But there's no primary for the special election and if no candidate wins a majority, the two front-runners will advance to a second runoff vote on Nov. 27.",

Updated at 10:18 a.m. ET As allegations continue to swirl about the president and a payout to a porn star to cover up a sexual encounter, evangelical leaders are organizing a sit-down with President Trump in June, four sources with knowledge of the planned meeting tell NPR. \"We're very concerned\" about the allegations, said a leader of a faith-based ministry. The leader is involved in hosting the gathering, which organizers are aiming to take place June 19 at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The source said the combination of the Stormy Daniels sex-scandal allegations and Trump's continued reputation for divisive rhetoric could suppress evangelical turnout in the November midterm elections. \"It is a concern of ours that 2018 could be very detrimental to some of the other issues that we hold dear,\" like preserving religious liberty and restricting abortion rights, the source noted. The source, like the others with knowledge of the event, spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity so as to not jeopardize the meeting. Trump has denied Daniels' allegations. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, he also denied knowing about the payment that his attorney, Michael Cohen, made to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, days before the 2016 presidential election. She alleges she was paid $130,000 not to talk about the alleged affair. Sources say organizers are working to firm up planning for the daylong event with the White House before sending invitations to hundreds of conservative Christian pastors and political leaders in the coming days. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Thursday. Trump has been invited to take questions from the evangelical leaders for roughly 90 minutes during the meeting. It's not clear whether the allegations from Daniels \u2014 or another woman who alleges she had an affair with Trump, former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 are likely to come up while the president is on stage in a more open session. But a source said the president is likely to be asked about the women during private discussions in at least a \"sidebar conversation.\" The ministry leader said Trump's tone and personal life remain a concern for many evangelicals. \"There's things that are like fingernails on the chalkboard to people of faith. That's not who we are; that's not a 'fruit of the Spirit'; that's not leading with humility,\" the source said, referencing a passage in the New Testament book of Galatians that describes the character traits Christians exhibit. The meeting is part of an effort to rally and reassure conservative voters, especially white evangelicals who fueled Trump's run to the White House, ahead of this year's midterms. But it also could raise questions about the ethics of holding such events, organized through the White House, at Trump's hotel just a few blocks from the White House. That prospect did not seem to concern the evangelical leaders involved with booking the event. \"That doesn't even cross our mind,\" said one person with knowledge of the planning, adding that the hotel was chosen because \"this is probably the best deal in D.C.\" A chance to \"reconvene\" and \"encourage enthusiasm\" On issues like abortion, religious freedom and Israel policy, many conservative Christians say Trump has followed through on his campaign promises. One source noted that many white evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016 with the knowledge that \"with Trump, it was going to be a gamble\" but with no hope that Democrat Hillary Clinton would deliver on any of their top-priority issues. Many Republicans fear 2018 will be a wave election for Democrats, who've been organizing in opposition to Trump. Trump has battled low approval ratings, and some polls have suggested support for this president has declined among white evangelicals, a key voting block for Republicans. The June meeting will be a chance for evangelical leaders to seek reassurance from Trump and to talk about how to mobilize conservatives around other issues this fall, a source said. \"Let's reconvene,\" the source said, \"and let's see what we can do to encourage enthusiasm \u2014 beyond Trump, so to speak.\" Such a meeting with the president would mirror a similar event held two years ago, when hundreds of mostly white evangelical Protestants gathered at a New York hotel to meet with then-candidate Trump. The purpose of that gathering was largely to reassure evangelicals concerned about the presumptive Republican nominee's reputation for vulgarity and his multiple marriages. It was a few months before the revelation of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump could be heard bragging about groping women's genitals without their consent. It was a \"pivotal moment\" in Trump's 2016 campaign, said Ken Blackwell, a conservative activist who advised the Trump transition team. Many evangelical leaders had backed other candidates in the Republican primary, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \"It's an element of his base that can be mobilized quickly,\" Blackwell said. \"It is organized, as was demonstrated in the 2016 elections. It is a block of voters that will make a difference in outcomes, if they turn out [in 2018].\" Voting, a Christian's \"civic duty\"? In addition to meeting with Trump, participants also plan to spend several hours discussing priorities and strategy for the midterms, which could include inserting reminders in church bulletins to head to the polls on Election Day. Another source with knowledge of the plans for the event tells NPR that the gathering will encourage pastors and other leaders to frame voting as a Christian's \"civic duty,\" rather than urging churchgoers to support a particular political party. That said, white evangelicals overwhelmingly favor Republican candidates at the polls. Whatever their misgivings, 81 percent of self-identified white evangelicals voted for Trump in the November 2016 election. Recent polls suggest a majority still back Trump despite the Daniels allegations, though his popularity with the group took a dip when the news initially broke. The source with knowledge of plans for the June meeting told NPR that organizers have worried that some evangelicals might avoid the event because of the Daniels controversy. \"For some evangelical leaders,\" the source said, \"it's a liability.\" But others, including Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, expressed optimism that the president will weather the Daniels storm. \"I just honestly don't hear hand-wringing over the issue,\" Nance said. \"They're not surprised; they made that decision a long time ago. This president is not Rick Santorum or Mike Huckabee; he doesn't pretend to be a Bible-banging evangelical.\" Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, also said it's \"highly dubious\" that the allegations will substantially erode support for the president or suppress midterm turnout. Reed said he will attend the meeting with the president if the planning moves forward. Given how organized and energized Democrats are this year, he said it's important for evangelical leaders to rally their base. \"If these folks don't turn out in record numbers in 2018,\" Reed said, \"it's gonna be a long night for Republicans.\" Johnnie Moore, an informal evangelical adviser to Trump, downplayed the discussions, calling them \"entirely conceptual\" at this stage. Moore described himself as an \"observer\" rather than an organizer but did say conversations are underway about a potential gathering of hundreds of evangelicals in Washington, D.C., in the coming months. \"There is a very active discussion about the desire of evangelical leaders to get together again, principally to discuss policy issues going into 2018. And it has nothing to do with any questions about the past life of our president.\" As for the format, Moore said that, too, is still being discussed, and the president would not be the \"center of the discussion\" \u2014 though Moore said that if 1,000 evangelicals gather in Washington,  he believes the president would try to meet with them. Moore noted that many conservative Christians are pleased with Trump's policy record so far and are eager to talk about \"what's next\" for their policy priorities. \"What I think will happen if there is a meeting and he participates,\" Moore said, \"I think there will be one heck of a celebration.\"",

            "article_content": "In Illinois, two very rich men vying for their parties' gubernatorial nominations are dominating the conversation, and it's not necessarily to their benefit.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Now a primer on the election for governor in Illinois. Tomorrow is the primary. Both Democrats and Republicans will consider men with vast personal fortunes and significant political baggage. From the statehouse in Springfield, Illinois Public Radio's Brian Mackey reports. BRIAN MACKEY, BYLINE: The first thing you need to know is that Governor Bruce Rauner is unpopular - like, deeply unpopular. Just three years into his first term, his approval rating is 31 percent, among the worst in America. That's partly because he presided over a two-year budget standoff that only ended when some of his fellow Republicans turned on him, working with Democrats to raise taxes. Then Rauner outraged conservatives by signing a pair of Democratic bills dealing with immigration and abortion. All this has set off a fierce competition among Democrats who see an opportunity to take back a blue-state executive mansion. But we'll come back to that in a bit. First, like Rauner, we have to get through the Republican primary. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEANNE IVES: He's betrayed our party. And you know what? You cannot buy back trust after betrayal. MACKEY: This is Jeanne Ives. She's a state representative who's giving Rauner an unexpected run for his money. Rauner has tried to pretend he doesn't notice her campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRUCE RAUNER: It's part of the process. You get some fringe elements or whatever coming in as part of a campaign. And these things happen. MACKEY: That's what Rauner says. His actions, however, reveal he's taking her insurgency more seriously. He's refused to debate her and is spending money on attack ads - not that he's feeling pinched. One of the other important things to know about Rauner is that he has a lot of money - hundreds of millions of dollars made during a career as a private equity investor. That means, assuming he can fend off Ives' longshot primary challenge, Rauner will have an essentially limitless supply of cash with which to compete for a second term. So how are Democrats going to deal with that? It's led to the question animating their primary. Namely, do Democrats need their own billionaire? Enter Jay Robert Pritzker, who goes by the initials J.B. He's one of the heirs to the Hyatt hotel fortune, which makes him a billionaire several times over. Pritzker has completely self-funded his campaign, in the process shattering state records. And he's promising Democrats he'll share the wealth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) J B PRITZKER: It isn't just about beating Bruce Rauner. It's about electing every Democrat everywhere in this state. MACKEY: His main rivals for the nomination are Daniel Biss, a state senator with a Ph.D. in math from MIT, and Chris Kennedy - yes, one of the Kennedys - among Bobby and Ethel's 11 children. Both men have been competing to be the main alternative to Pritzker, whose wealth has allowed him to dominate the airwaves for the better part of a year, putting him ahead in polling. But Pritzker has his own liabilities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROD BLAGOJEVICH: You don't want to be secretary of state, do you, J.B.? PRITZKER: Oh, I wasn't pushing for me... BLAGOJEVICH: Yeah. PRITZKER: ...To be secretary of state. I mean... MACKEY: This is an FBI wiretap of Pritzker chatting with then-Governor Rod Blagojevich. You might remember him as the guy who went to prison for trying to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat. Now, Pritzker was never accused of wrongdoing, and these tapes were never played at trial. But the Chicago Tribune obtained them. And in discussing potential Obama successors, Pritzker did make racially insensitive remarks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRITZKER: You know, but if you're forced to put an African-American in the spot, the one, you know - the least offensive and maybe get to the most is Jesse White. MACKEY: The least offensive African-American Jesse White is Illinois's popular five-term secretary of state. And he forgave Pritzker. But the fundamental question for Democrats remains. When facing a Republican with essentially limitless wealth, are Pritzker's billions worth the baggage in which they're packed? Voters have until tomorrow evening to decide.

            "article_content": "Voters in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district will vote in Tuesday's special election to decide who their representative will be in the House for the rest of the year.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: There is a Pennsylvania special election today in coal country. Back in 2016, it was Trump country, and Republicans want to make sure it stays that way. The race for the House seat is far too close for comfort for the GOP, and the party has put a whole lot of money into the race, which has Republican Rick Saccone running against Democrat Conor Lamb. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Why is this House seat up for grabs in the first place? LIASSON: That's a good question. This House seat was represented by Republican Tim Murphy. He'd represented the district since 2003. He was a strong anti-abortion advocate, but he had to resign in October after it was reported that he had asked a woman with whom he was romantically involved to have an abortion. MARTIN: All right, so the seat is open. It has become far more competitive than at least Republicans had anticipated - the president feeling a little defensive, bragging on Sunday on Twitter that Republicans have won all five special elections for House seats this term. So does the president have reason to be worried about the outcome here? LIASSON: He certainly does. The president won this district by nearly 20 points. And while he's right that Republicans have won all those special elections, there has been a steady tilt toward Democrats in those elections. They've been overperforming everywhere. And, of course, he failed to mention that Doug Jones, the Democrat, won in Alabama over Republican Roy Moore. MARTIN: In the Senate, yeah. LIASSON: But - yes, in the Senate. And it looks like it's going to be a toss-up. But if Democrats turn out in big numbers, especially in a white, working-class, Trumpy district like this one, it could be a real disappointment for the president who held a rally on Saturday near the district in part to campaign for the Republican candidate. And you can tell how worried Republicans are about this because the chairman of the state Republican Party is calling this a Democratic district even though Republicans have won the last eight elections there because it has a slight Democratic registration edge. And Republicans are already disparaging their own candidate. MARTIN: Playing the expectations game. LIASSON: Yeah. MARTIN: So why bother pumping millions of dollars into a seat, as the GOP is, when the outcome's not really going to change the dynamics in the House - right? - in terms of the votes. LIASSON: Absolutely not. The Republicans have spent over $10 million defending this seat. And this seat is a little like Brigadoon, that mythical Scottish village that disappeared in the mist, because this district is going to disappear because of a gerrymandering decision by the courts. In November, it won't exist. It'll have different boundaries, different voters. But right now, it's the only game in town, so it's being freighted with significance, and the results are going to be interpreted as an indicator of whether there's a Democratic wave or not. Republicans are worried that if they lose this race or just even win it by a hair, there will be more retirements. And it's going to be a test of whether Donald Trump can help Republicans even when he's not on the ballot. So this race is very symbolic, and it's very psychological even though it has almost no effect on the power dynamic in the House of Representatives. MARTIN: So is this a referendum on the president or is - I mean, why is Conor Lamb, the Democrat in this race, so competitive in a solid Republican district? LIASSON: Well, he's competitive for a couple of reasons. The Democrats nominated a candidate who fits their district. They didn't go to the left. They didn't nominate a kind of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren candidate. Conor Lamb is conservative on guns. He doesn't support Nancy Pelosi. He personally opposes abortion. And he's a pretty good candidate. He's raised a lot of money. He's appealing. He's a former Marine, former prosecutor. Also, the other reason he's so competitive in this district is that President Trump is unpopular even in places like the 18th District of Pennsylvania, and that never bodes well for the party down ticket. And this really has become a referendum on the president and his party, and this is a pretty good test case. MARTIN: So people are going to be paying attention to this - party strategists as they look towards November, no doubt. LIASSON: Absolutely. MARTIN: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson for us this morning. Hey, Mara, thank you so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump Jr. and Rick Saccone, GOP nominee for Pennsylvania's 18th District, shake hands with supporters during a campaign rally on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump Jr. and Rick Saccone, GOP nominee for Pennsylvania's 18th District, shake hands with supporters during a campaign rally on Monday. Tuesday's neck-and-neck special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District carries a lot of weight for both parties \u2014 despite the fact that it won't even exist in its current iteration come November. Republicans have gone all-in to try to save underperforming state Rep. Rick Saccone. The GOP nominee got an eleventh-hour rescue-mission visit Saturday from President Trump, who carried the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election. GOP-allied groups have poured in more than $10 million to help Saccone, who has underwhelmed in fundraising. If that's not enough to save him, it would be an embarrassing and alarming loss for Republicans eight months from the midterm elections. Meanwhile, even Republicans privately concede that Democratic nominee Connor Lamb \u2014 a charismatic, young former Marine and prosecutor \u2014 is the superior recruit. He has brought in far more money than the GOP candidate in this traditionally solidly red district near Pittsburgh. Lamb has raised $3 million in the race, while Democratic outside groups stayed mostly on the sidelines. They have put in only about $1.7 million, allowing Lamb to run a more independent race. Lamb has cut a moderate profile with a populist tinge. He has said he would oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader and has also wooed steelworkers, coal miners and union activists in this blue-collar district. He has a somewhat similar economic message to that of Trump when he campaigned and won here. This special election was triggered by the resignation of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who stepped down after it was revealed that he \u2014 an anti-abortion-rights congressman \u2014 had had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to terminate a possible pregnancy. Because of court-ordered redistricting, the district as it is drawn now will cease to exist come Election Day 2018, and neither Saccone nor Lamb will even live in the rejiggered seat. So the fact that Republicans are spending so heavily to save what's essentially a phantom district underscores what is on the line: They don't want a loss in such a GOP stronghold to spur even more panic among their ranks that Trump is dragging them down. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating for an upset that will further galvanize their energetic base hoping for a blue wave in November. To this point, since Trump has been president, Republicans have underperformed in GOP-held House special elections but still won all five of them. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are four questions to ponder in the meantime: 1. Will this be a canary in the coal mine for the GOP? A few months ago, when a rash of retirements seemed like the latest alarm bells for Republicans, GOP strategists urged caution. Some pointed to this Pennsylvania race \u2014 where Saccone was still heavily favored \u2014 as the possible canary in the coal mine to watch for Republicans. This race, they said, could be a much bigger sign of danger ahead for the GOP. If Lamb does win on Tuesday night, it could send even more GOP members of Congress heading for the exits, adding to what's already a record number of retirements. The ominous signs have been there for some time for Republicans. Since Trump's election, 39 state legislative races have flipped from red to blue. Democrats notched big wins last November in both the Virginia and New Jersey governors' races. And special House elections last year across the board showed a major shift toward Democrats, even if they didn't notch a victory in a GOP-held race yet. Republicans have far underperformed in special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina \u2014 all solidly GOP territory. GOP candidates have underperformed President Trump's 2016 election results in several special elections so far during his tenure.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrats did score a major upset in December in the Alabama Senate race, flipping a seat in a state that Trump carried by nearly 30 points. In that contest, Republicans were running a deeply flawed candidate in GOP nominee Roy Moore, long a controversial figure in state Republican circles. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct and pursuing them romantically when they were teenagers and he was much older. Republicans are already trying to paint Saccone as a weak candidate, but blaming him for underperforming is hardly a credible excuse in such a Republican area. It would instead be a sure sign of danger ahead, at least in the narrative that would form about 2018: what it would mean for GOP morale, fundraising and the power of the president to help candidates over the line. No race is a perfect predictor, and Republicans will also surely note that before their own massive wave in 2010 that helped them capture control of the House, there was another Pennsylvania special election that went Democrats' way. That race certainly was no sign of their fortunes come November. Still, there's been more than enough evidence in the 16 months since Trump was elected that the energy on the Democratic side is very real. Now, a Lamb win would mean that even areas that were once considered safe GOP territory might no longer be. 2. Is the Trump coalition transferable? Trump rode into town Saturday night in nearby Moon Township to campaign for Saccone. He had a trademark wild and unpredictable rally to help Saccone. He boasted that he was able to help save the Georgia special election in a similar fashion and later tweeted about it: The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday. The president even gave the Democratic nominee his own Trump-branded nickname, \"Lamb the sham.\" He made the case for Saccone, who has run as an unabashedly pro-Trump candidate, before turning to myriad other topics and insults. It was all classic Trump \u2014 eager to claim credit despite scant evidence he helped move many poll numbers, as in Georgia. He didn't mention other places where he has gone in and lost \u2014 like Alabama, where he first backed the losing primary candidate and then failed to get Moore across the finish line. For Trump, every day is Nov. 8, 2016. He revels in reliving that historic night and boasting of his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton. But now Tuesday night could show whether Trump's winning coalition is transferable to other candidates \u2014 or not. Democrats faced a similar problem under President Obama. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated, when Obama was on the ballot, Democrats gained 31 seats in the House and nine in the Senate. When he wasn't, the party lost 82 seats in the House and 17 in the Senate. President Obama wasn't able to help Democrats much during his tenure when his name wasn't on the ballot.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Obama's popularity dropped during his tenure, and he was, indeed, a drag on his own party in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passed. But Obama's numbers were stronger than Trump's, and there wasn't the constant chaos and scandal plaguing the current White House. Ultimately, Trump's unpopularity remains the biggest detriment for Republicans in the midterms. It raises the question of how Trump could be \u2014 or is willing to not be \u2014 dispatched on behalf of Republicans on the trail over the coming months. That will be even more acute if Saccone loses. Even places like the Rust Belt where he was once seen as an asset may not be a given any longer. While Trump doesn't like to be associated with anything losing, he also never passes up a chance to get before a crowd. So while he may salivate at campaigning more, it could be hard for anyone in the GOP to make the case to the president he would hurt more than help. Republicans have already been trying to downplay expectations ahead of a loss too, with Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio making the stunning argument on Fox News Monday that \"this is a Democrat district\" despite Trump's heavy win \u2014 even though past GOP presidential nominees also performed similarly and Murphy routinely won re-election easily, or even went unopposed. A Democrat hasn't won here in 15 years. 3. Can the economy and tax bill save Republicans \u2014 or not? The silver bullet for Republicans in the midterms could be the positive economy \u2014 and the GOP tax cuts they passed last year that are growing in popularity. Yet that argument wasn't used much in the final stretch to help Saccone in Pennsylvania. Early ads touted economic growth and the tax overhaul, while hitting Lamb for downplaying the impact of the tax cuts. But in the final stretch, that message was abandoned for much more ominous ads hammering Lamb over immigration and crime. That was the same dark turn Republicans took in Virginia last fall \u2014 a gambit that failed. So if that's their closing message, it's a sign that the political boon they hoped to gain from an economic boom might not be working. And, as much as Democrats haven't figured out messaging on the tax bill, Republicans may not have either. One of the unknowns is how the recently announced tariffs could affect the race. Areas like the 18th District, where blue-collar Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Trump, have been hard hit in an age of globalization. Trump's imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would seem to be tailor-made to boost political support in economically distressed areas like this. However, a Monmouth University poll (taken before Trump's visit), which showed Lamb with a narrow lead \u2014 both under regular- and high-turnout scenarios \u2014 found the tariff announcement didn't seem to sway voters at all. Plus, both Saccone and Lamb have been supportive of the tariffs. Former Vice President Joe Biden points to Conor Lamb, right, the Democratic nominee in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, during a rally last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Gene J. Puskar/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden points to Conor Lamb, right, the Democratic nominee in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, during a rally last week. 4. Can Republicans' anti-Pelosi message still work? Lamb has run a more centrist campaign and underscored local issues. That has helped him close the gap and win crossover Republicans. But this race is also a test of whether Democrats can blunt what has been one of Republicans' most effective weapons \u2014 Nancy Pelosi. Lamb has run ads boasting about how he would oppose Pelosi as Democrats' House leader \u2014 or even speaker \u2014 if he is elected, echoing pushes by like-minded legislators such as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton in calling for new leadership. And the surrogates he has had campaign for him, like former Vice President Joe Biden, have a much different appeal to voters in this area than the San Franciscan could. Nevertheless, Republicans have been repeatedly able to turn Pelosi into a political bogeyman, dragging down surging candidates by tying her to them. It was a strategy they first employed successfully in 2010 \u2014 and replicated it. They most recently used it in last year's Georgia special election. Ads from outside GOP-aligned groups have continued to argue that Lamb would still be a Pelosi lackey even though he says now he wants new leadership. But if Lamb is able to survive being linked to Pelosi, it could be an encouraging sign for Democratic candidates across the country, some of whom have already signaled they want new leadership, as well. Pelosi remains a fundraising machine for the Democrats, and she still wields considerable influence. But if Democrats want to win back the House, a Lamb win might show they need more candidates like the Pennsylvanian in conservative areas who are willing to buck the status quo and go against party leadership. And that could raise even more questions of who will be in the leader's chair come 2019.",

In the Mahoning Valley of Eastern Ohio, many traditionally Democratic voters switched sides to vote for Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Gene J.

In the Mahoning Valley of Eastern Ohio, many traditionally Democratic voters switched sides to vote for Trump. When the phone rings at the Republican Party headquarters in Mahoning County, Ohio, a 77-year-old retired hairdresser and former lifelong Democrat answers. Connie Kessler is a recent GOP convert with a religious-like zeal to help her hometown elect more local Republicans. Sometimes she answers calls from voters; other times she updates the database \u2014 she does the kind of odd jobs she says she used to do for local Democrats. If Donald Trump hadn't run for president, Kessler says she'd probably still be a Democrat. \"He's the one that turned me,\" she says at her makeshift reception desk near a giant cut-out of the president, with his signature thumbs-up gesture. \"When I walked in here to sign up as a volunteer, I was a Democrat,\" she says. \"I don't want Democrat next to my name anymore.\" Connie Kessler, 77, says she voted for President Obama in 2008, but with Trump's election she has become a Republican.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Connie Kessler, 77, says she voted for President Obama in 2008, but with Trump's election she has become a Republican. Like thousands of people in the Mahoning Valley, a region midway between Pittsburgh and Cleveland, Kessler left the Democratic Party and voted for Trump in 2016. A similar story played out across the region, where white, working class families in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin helped propel Trump into the White House. But the question remains: Were these Obama/Trump voters one-off Trump supporters \u2014 or are they the newest Republicans? 2018 offers the first hint of whether Trump's election was an aberration or a major realignment of the parties. The Mahoning Valley has been loyal Democratic turf for generations; it's old steel country full of labor union members. But in the last presidential election, many people abandoned the party at the national level. Trumbull County, which President Barack Obama had won by 22 percentage points in 2012, went for a Republican president for the first time since 1972. And the initial evidence, based on more than a dozen interviews with Obama/Trump voters and disillusioned Democrats across the Mahoning Valley, is mixed. Some, like Kessler, say they're ashamed of modern day Democrats and no longer want to be a part of the party. Others insist they're still loyal to the party and will grab a Democratic ballot in the Ohio primary this May. Hillary Clinton did far worse than Barack Obama in Ohio's Mahoning Valley counties, long thought of as a Democratic stronghold.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 2016, there was a massive discrepancy between national and local Democratic performance. Even though Trump won Trumbull County by 22 percentage points, Democrats won every county-level race. In neighboring Mahoning County, Clinton pulled off a slim victory \u2014 25 points behind Obama's 2012 victory there \u2014 and, again, local Democrats won many races. In fact, the Democratic congressman from the region, Tim Ryan, won re-election with nearly 70 percent of the vote. Voters' values Many in the Mahoning Valley say that divide is evidence that the national Democratic Party has moved too far left \u2014 prioritizing \"transgenders\" and \"immigration,\" as multiple people said, at the expense of the economy. At the Yankee Kitchen restaurant near Youngstown, Jeff Zatchok, a former public school teacher and administrator, says he voted for President Obama in 2008, but chose Trump in 2016 \u2014 and he's \"100 percent\" satisfied with the president. \"Either my views or the Democratic Party's views changed over the course of those years,\" says Jeff Zatchok, who voted for President Obama but now sees himself as more of a Republican.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Either my views or the Democratic Party's views changed over the course of those years,\" says Jeff Zatchok, who voted for President Obama but now sees himself as more of a Republican. \"Either my views or the Democratic Party views changed,\" he says, in between bites of egg, on a recent morning. \"To me, the Democrats used to be kind of 'middle America,' and it seems to me they've gotten away from that.\" These days, he feels more like a Republican. Even the chair of the Mahoning County Democratic Party says his national party is out of sync with local voters, and his congressman, Tim Ryan, agrees. \"People \u2014 whether they're white, black, brown, gay, straight \u2014 they want a job, they want high wages and a secure pension and secure health care. That's it,\" Ryan tells NPR. \"And I'm trying to pound this message into everybody's head.\" Democrats in the Mahoning Valley are more conservative than coastal Democrats on cultural issues like religion, abortion and immigration. \"I think this country \u2014 our country \u2014 has no respect or morals,\" says Lisa Moore, a retired schoolteacher, flanked by a giant painting of the Last Supper on her dining room wall. She says it also feels like Democrats these days prefer \"illegals\" over U.S. citizens. The former local Democratic congressman in this region, Jim Traficant, took a hard-line stance on immigration, once saying that \"anybody that jumps the fence shouldn't be made a citizen, they should be thrown out.\" But there's little room for such a position in the modern-day Democratic Party. McDonald, Ohio, in Trumbull County was a \"company town\" created by the Carnegie Steel Corp. The steel industry used to employ thousands of people in the region, but most of those jobs have disappeared.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption McDonald, Ohio, in Trumbull County was a \"company town\" created by the Carnegie Steel Corp. The steel industry used to employ thousands of people in the region, but most of those jobs have disappeared. \"We've had complete devastation in this area for the last 20 to 30 years,\" says Scott Seitz, an elected Democratic official who crossed party lines to vote for Trump. \"We didn't leave our Democratic Party. Our Democratic Party left us.\" In 2000, Seitz lost his job at a steel mill. And so he started a gutter cleaning business that he now maintains with his sons. In February 2017, he got a job back in the mills making titanium for F-35 jets, and he credits the president, in part, for finalizing the contract that led to an increase in hiring at that local plant. \"He spoke to me about jobs,\" Seitz says. Seitz knows the local steel mills will never return to their old glory, but he's optimistic that the steel and aluminum tariffs the president is ordering will help his region. \"It is certainly long overdue for the struggling steel industry throughout Ohio and the Rustbelt area,\" he says in an email. Seitz acknowledges China may strike back with more tariffs, but for now he's trying to remain optimistic because, to him, it seems the president is trying to level the playing field to help American workers. \"Rebelling\" among Democrats Around the region, there is little evidence of buyer's remorse for Trump. For some, Democratic criticism of the president is only further justification to reject the party as a whole. Lisa Moore, the retired schoolteacher, says she plans to vote Republican all down the ballot. \"I'm worried if the Democrats get in, they get a majority, they'll try to impeach him,\" she says. \"So, as long as he's in office, I'm gonna vote all straight Republican.\" Lisa Moore and her mother, Frances Kimpton, both say they were lifelong Democrats prior to Donald Trump's election, but now they intend to vote for only Republicans in the 2018 midterms.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lisa Moore and her mother, Frances Kimpton, both say they were lifelong Democrats prior to Donald Trump's election, but now they intend to vote for only Republicans in the 2018 midterms. Her 76-year-old mother, Frances Kimpton, a loyal Democrat until 2016, nods in agreement. \"I'll never vote for a Democrat as long as I live,\" she says. \"I don't like them anymore ... the Democrats have been fighting him.\" But not all Obama/Trump voters are willing to entirely forsake the party because of their loyalty to the president. Some say even if they would vote for Trump again, they'll vote for Democrats at the local level. John Schultz, a former Democratic precinct committeeman, voted for Trump in 2016 \u2014 the first time he cast a ballot for a Republican candidate in his 66 years. John Schultz, a lifelong Democrat who voted for Trump in 2016, says his region isn't realigning \u2014 it's \"rebelling\" against the Democratic Party.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption John Schultz, a lifelong Democrat who voted for Trump in 2016, says his region isn't realigning \u2014 it's \"rebelling\" against the Democratic Party. \"I was born and raised a Democrat, lifelong Democrat,\" he says, eager to point out that he's not a Republican \u2014 and still thinks George W. Bush was the \"ultimate failure\" as a president. \"[But] the national Democratic Party has become disconnected and alienated from Middle America.\" He says local Democrats feel neglected by Washington and figured they didn't have much to lose by voting for Trump, a Republican who spoke like a Democrat on trade. \"I don't think it's realigning,\" Schultz says. \"I do think this area is maybe rebelling.\" Still, he insists he's a Democrat who will vote for Democratic candidates in the Ohio primary. \"It's in many ways ingrained into people that they're Democrats,\" says Paul Sracic, chair of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University. He's not sure that voters, regardless of Trump, have changed their overall ideological orientation. \"I don't think they feel like they have a real home in either political party.\" As for Scott Seitz, he plans to vote for fellow Democrats in 2018, but he's still yearning for more: \"I hope that the Democrats in the 2020 election have a candidate that appeals to us. And we can go back to being full-fledged Democrat.\"",

Northwest Iowa is one of the safest places for Republicans in the country. It's represented in the U.S. Congress by hardliner Steve King, who has a long history of controversial positions and comments. But David Johnson also represents part of northwest Iowa. And while King might look to the White House and see a kindred spirit, Johnson calls Donald Trump's rhetoric \"misogynistic,\" \"race-baiting,\" and \"bigoted.\" David Johnson is a former dairy farmer who's been a senator in the state legislature since 2003. He was a prominent local leader for both George W. Bush and Mitt Romney during their presidential campaigns but left his party after Donald Trump became its presidential nominee in 2016. Now he's running as an independent, and he's not alone. Bob Krist, a Nebraska state legislator and retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel, is running as an independent in that state's gubernatorial election. Kansas City attorney Craig O'Dear also left the Republican Party and is campaigning for the U.S. Senate in Missouri. In Iowa, Sen. Johnson is facing Republican Zach Whiting, an aide to Rep. King, in November. No Democrat has announced yet. Johnson knows running without the backing of one of the two major political parties could spell trouble but he sees opportunity. \"There's no regrets here,\" he says. \"I'm getting quite a bit of support from people that I never got before.\" Little Swan Lake Winery owners Diane and Scott Benjamin (left and center) pose for a picture with neighbor Erica Schultes (right) near Estherville, Iowa, on Jan. 23, 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Little Swan Lake Winery owners Diane and Scott Benjamin (left and center) pose for a picture with neighbor Erica Schultes (right) near Estherville, Iowa, on Jan. 23, 2018. And he's also feeling more liberated as a lawmaker. \"I've even been told that my job was only to represent Republicans,\" he says, \"the Democrats be damned.\" Erica Schultes lives in Sen. Johnson's district and says she supports him more now than she did when he was a Republican. Schultes, a realtor who also raises chickens and hogs, is concerned about the environment. In this part of the country, many environmental issues center around hog confinements. Johnson has sponsored a bill, opposed by Iowa Republicans, that would increase regulation on hog confinements. Schultes and Little Swan Lake Winery co-owner Diane Benjamin are happy to see their state senator publicly evolve, especially in a part of the state where people's votes have been a foregone conclusion. \"A lot of political conversations don't take place that maybe should take place,\" Benjamin says. \"I don't think they take place out in the open,\" Schultes responds. \"I think they do take place behind closed doors.\" The two hope behind those doors there's enough support for an independent Johnson to keep his seat. But running as an independent can be tricky. Evan McMullin made his name as an independent presidential candidate in 2016. He thinks that even in rock-ribbed Republican districts like Johnson's, there are many voters in the middle. \"They're sort of homeless in this environment and looking for something new,\" McMullin says. \"But at the same time there's not much political infrastructure to support people in that space which I believe is the majority of Americans.\" McMullin has co-founded Stand Up Republic, a political advocacy group, which spent $500,000 on ads in Alabama's special election last year asking Republicans to reject Roy Moore, their party's U.S. Senate nominee. Alabama elected Democrat Doug Jones. Simpson College Political Science Professor Kedron Bardwell says that's an example of how the U.S. political system works, and that independent bids are long shots. \"This is the trap of American politics,\" Bardwell says. \"We are a two party system and the rules that we have \u2014 winner take all \u2014 create a two-party system just by nature.\" And if Alabama isn't proof enough, there was also Evan McMullin's own race in 2016: He got just over 12,000 votes in Iowa, while winner Donald Trump received more than 800,000. Sen. David Johnson is facing just a sliver of that electorate in November but the challenge may be just as great.",

Kim Reynolds speaks to a crowd at a campaign rally with President Trump in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Oct. 9. Next month, 36 states will elect a governor. Nine of those races, where Republicans are in office, are so competitive that some analysts say they are a toss-up. Even though a Republican is in office now, the winner could come from either party. Like in Iowa, where Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds can't seem to inch past her Democratic challenger, businessman Fred Hubbell, who has been polling several points ahead of her for months. In the past week, several big-name Republicans have come to the state to campaign with Reynolds. This weekend it was barbecue and live music at a harvest-themed fundraiser for her in Des Moines, with balloon animals and face-painting for the kids. For the adults, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was the keynote. The daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee told the crowd it needed to keep the state's top office in Republican control. \"Trust me, I've seen what a liberal Democrat running a state looks like. Remember, I'm from Arkansas and I lived under the Clintons for a long time.\" Reynolds poses with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders at a harvest-themed fundraiser in Des Moines on Oct. 13.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Reynolds poses with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders at a harvest-themed fundraiser in Des Moines on Oct. 13. An incumbent, yes, but this is the first time Reynolds has run for her office. She was lieutenant governor and took over for former Gov. Terry Branstad when he became U.S. ambassador to China last year. Reynolds touts a budget surplus of $127 million and a state unemployment rate of 2.5 percent as reasons voters should keep her as governor. Carol Gerst gets that. Gerst says that although she is a registered Democrat she plans to vote for Reynolds. She approved of Branstad while he was in office and says, \"We're staying with Kim because we think he was preparing her for this moment.\" As Reynolds stepped out of the shadows of her predecessor she has walked into the light of President Trump. Last week, she appeared onstage with him in front of a packed arena in Council Bluffs, praising him. \"Thank you for cutting taxes for hard-working Iowans, for eliminating senseless regulations that stifled innovation and jobs,\" she said. \"For standing strong with Justice Kavanaugh and appointing conservative judges to the court!\" Democrats see Trump as a campaign point, too: They are hoping Reynolds' close alignment with the president works in their favor. The immediate effects of Trump's tariffs have not been good for farmers. And while Iowa went big for him in 2016, two years later, he has a less-than-stellar approval rating in the state.

Fred Hubbell, the Democratic nominee, is a former board member of Iowa's Planned Parenthood and has some name recognition in the state. He is wealthy, using a lot of his own money on his campaign, and is getting help from some of his out-of-state friends, like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"Fred Hubbell is going to be the next governor,\" Inslee said, talking with volunteers getting ready to knock on doors in Grinnell, a small college town. \"Donald Trump is just a blip in history and we are going to rescue this country starting right here in Iowa.\" Hubbell's campaign has primarily focused on what he says is Reynolds' mismanagement of Medicaid and the state budget. \"We shouldn't be taking money out of education, out of health care, out of public safety, out of our judicial system and then [coming] up with a budget surplus that was a lot bigger than they thought it was and they can't explain why.\" On the other hand, Reynolds frames Hubbell as out of touch with everyday Iowans and criticizes him for not releasing more of his tax returns. Artist and Democratic volunteer Tara Shukla-Jones says she is voting for Hubbell even though he wasn't her first pick in the primary. \"I think voting is kind of like brushing teeth. It's not really glamorous and it's not really about you. It doesn't always make you feel fabulous but if you don't do it for a long time there are problems, right? So I think Fred Hubbell is certainly a better choice for governor.\" With early voting underway, some Iowans have already cast their decision in a race that has quickly become one of the country's most competitive gubernatorial elections.",

The two candidates running for governor in the Georgia Democratic primary on May 22 have plenty of similarities: they're both women named Stacey; they're both former legislators in the Georgia House of Representatives; they're both lawyers; and they're both calling for similar progressive policies, such as expanding Medicaid. But Stacey Abrams is black. And Stacey Evans is white. The color of their skin is the most obvious, if not superficial, difference between the two women. And it's led to a racialized campaign full of competing strategies on how you win. No Democrat has won a gubernatorial or U.S. senate race in Georgia in more than a decade. For some context, in 2014, both the Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jason Carter and the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn lost by about 200,000 votes. So the question is \u2014 how does a Democrat in 2018 find those additional 200,000 votes? For all their similarities \u2014 that is where Evans and Abrams diverge. Two strategies Stacey Abrams launched her campaign in Albany, a city in southwest Georgia where nearly three-quarters of the residents are black. It was symbolic. She believes Democrats keep losing statewide elections because they're too focused on winning over moderate white Republicans. \"Political analysts keep looking at not only what the structure of Georgia is, but they're also looking at the playbook that was used in Georgia, and that's an old playbook,\" said Abrams. \"It's an old playbook that never invested in any of these communities of color in Georgia.\" Abrams is convinced the only way a Democrat can win is by engaging with untapped minority voters, particularly those in rural communities, who've often been overlooked. She says it's not about excluding the Democratic base of white progressives, but broadening the coalition. \"My campaign is about ... both those who are traditional Democratic voters and those voices who will be Democratic if we ask them to speak up,\" she said after a recent campaign stop in Marietta, Ga. But her opponent Stacey Evans has a different strategy. She, too, says the party needs to dig deep into its base and reach out more to rural voters, but she's also committed to converting disaffected moderate Republicans. \"I want to go into the suburbs of Georgia and talk to moderate voters about why progressive policies like restoring tuition-free technical college ... will not just help individual families, but will help our economy,\" she said during a debate on Georgia Public Broadcasting. \"And I know that when we do that we will get votes.\" Stacey Evans thanks her supporters at a party to celebrate her 40th birthday.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Stacey Evans thanks her supporters at a party to celebrate her 40th birthday. Evans points to her own family as proof. \"My mom voted for Trump,\" Evans told the local NBC affiliate. \"And I feel like she did it out of desperation. She felt like nobody was speaking to her.\" Her supporters insist she has a better shot at beating any Republican candidate in the fall. \"I think she's the one who's most likely to draw on more moderate voters of either Republican or Democratic types,\" said Jessica Orvis, munching on hors d'oeuvres at a party in Atlanta to celebrate Evans' 40th birthday. In addition to courting moderate Republicans and independents, Evans has begun attacking Abrams for not being sufficiently progressive. Abrams has received the endorsement of national groups, such as Emily's List and Planned Parenthood, in addition to an endorsement from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But surrogates for Evans are trying to delegitimize those endorsements by highlighting that they're coming from out-of-staters who are unfamiliar with Georgia politics. Not an election about race ... but it's in the atmosphere Evans' main criticism of Abrams is that she gutted the HOPE scholarship \u2014 a generous program created in the early '90s that essentially offered students free college tuition. Evans says cuts to the program disproportionately hurt black high school students. She's been running an ad on TV that says 97 percent of African-American high school graduates lost access to full scholarships because of the deal Abrams struck with Republicans when she was minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives. It's an effective attack; three times in two days, black voters on the campaign trail asked Abrams about it. Gary Morgan was one of those voters. He stopped Abrams in a shopping mall parking lot. \"You voted for that?\" he asked more as an accusation than a question. \"Because otherwise nobody would have gotten anything,\" Abrams told him. \"The Republicans wanted us to eliminate any student getting the HOPE scholarship who didn't pass a standardized test.\" Abrams and her supporters say as House minority leader she had to compromise with Republicans to avoid worse cutbacks. Abrams spends about six minutes walking Morgan through her decision step-by-step and by the end of the conversation he is convinced, and he's pulling money out of his wallet to donate to her campaign. But before he walks away, he also offers her some advice. \"We don't vote for just black people as much as white people would like to think that,\" Morgan told Abrams. \"We vote for which one is really gonna represent us. You gotta show that she's a hypocrite, because she's got a strong ad against you and it's damning to our community.\" It's overly simplistic to say this election is about race. But race is in the atmosphere. Last year, Abrams' supporters shouted down Evans at the annual Netroots Nation Conference chanting \"trust black women.\" And more recently, Evans was criticized for a video that showed her face blending into Martin Luther King Jr. Whether intentional or not, some voters have slipped into racially coded language. One white voter, for example, said that she was supporting Evans in part because she had better \"manners\" than Abrams. But Abrams \u2014 the black candidate \u2014 certainly has white supporters; just as Evans \u2014 the white candidate \u2014 has a number of black supporters, including well-known surrogates in the Atlanta political scene, like progressive former state Sen. Vincent Fort. \"Let's just be real, and I'm gonna say something Stacey [Evans] could never say,\" said Lisa Cunningham, an African-American supporter of Evans. \"I'm from Georgia, Stacey Abrams cannot win the state of Georgia. Period.\" She said \"the elephant in the room\" was skin color. \"An African-American person of her stature cannot today win in the state of Georgia in the general election,\" she said. Cunningham said she also has reservations about Abrams record on the HOPE scholarship. But Abrams' supporters point to her experience and credentials. She was the state house minority leader for seven years. \"She has the experience,\" said Barbara White, an Abrams supporter in the crowd for a campaign event in Cobb County. \"She's been in in politics for a long time, and she's for the people.\" Abrams has a double digit lead in the polls, but many voters say they're still undecided. The reality is whichever Stacey wins the Democratic primary, her strategy \u2014 whichever strategy it is \u2014 will face a big test in November's general election because Georgia is still a state that consistently elects Republican candidates statewide.",

            "article_content": "The concept of free speech is frequently heard in courtrooms across the country. Advocates on all kinds of issues try to tie their legal and policy arguments to a constitutional right most Americans hold as fundamental. Consider recent debates over net neutrality, for example, or abortion rights. The impetus for the First Amendment \u2014 granting Americans the freedom of speech, religion and the press and the right to petition and peacefully protest \u2014 stemmed from the view that the Constitution granted a lot of power to the federal government without much protection for citizens' rights, historians say. But many of the modern cases have less to do with citizens speaking to federal power than with the boundaries of businesses and organizations reaching into Americans' lives. Below are a few of the cases from the 21st century that highlight both the versatility and the limitations of what the right to free speech has come to embody, at least in the U.S. justice system. Anti-abortion-rights demonstrators stand outside the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 after oral arguments over buffer zones around abortion clinics.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anti-abortion-rights demonstrators stand outside the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 after oral arguments over buffer zones around abortion clinics. Abortion protest buffer zones McCullen v. Coakley, 2014 In 2007, the Massachusetts state legislature created a 35-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics that could be crossed only by people entering the facilities. Protesters and \"pro-life counselors\" who try to dissuade women from receiving abortions were barred from being inside the buffer zone. Anti-abortion-rights activist Eleanor McCullen, who stood outside the same Planned Parenthood in Boston every Tuesday and Wednesday for over a decade, argued that the buffer zones were an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. \"It's America,\" she said. \"I should be able to walk and talk gently, lovingly, anywhere with anybody.\" The U.S. Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled in her favor, finding that the buffer zones infringed on protesters' First Amendment rights. Massachusetts took \"the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his opinion. To curb harassment, he noted, the state could follow the lead of New York City, which made it \"a crime 'to follow and harass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a reproductive health care facility.' \" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has ruled that companies can describe skim milk without additives as \"skim milk.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has ruled that companies can describe skim milk without additives as \"skim milk.\" Censoring skim milk Ocheesee Creamery LLC v. Putnam, 2017 Most of the vitamin A that is found naturally in milk is contained in its cream \u2014 which is removed when milk is skimmed. Under Florida law, milk can only be labeled \"skim milk\" if it has the same amount of vitamin A as whole milk. That was a problem for Ocheesee Creamery owner Mary Lou Wesselhoeft, who wanted to sell pure skim milk. If the creamery artificially added enough vitamin A, the product would meet Florida's skim milk label requirement, but Wesselhoeft didn't want additives of any kind in her product. Wesselhoeft, represented by the Institute For Justice, filed a free speech lawsuit on the basis that the First Amendment \"protects the right of businesses to tell the truth.\" The case made it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where a three-judge panel ruled in her favor, saying: \"The Creamery's use of the words 'skim milk' to describe its skim milk is not inherently misleading.\" Condoms are passed out at an event for AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the driving force behind a measure that would have regulated condoms in porn films.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Ach/AP Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Condoms are passed out at an event for AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the driving force behind a measure that would have regulated condoms in porn films. Condoms as art California Proposition 60, 2016 Proposition 60 would have allowed the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration to prosecute producers anytime a condom is not visible in a pornographic film. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation and its president sponsored the proposition amid a 20-year high of sexually transmitted infections in the state. Pornographic producers and performers cited artistic freedom of speech and noted that performers were subject to mandatory testing. Member station KALW reported that \"performers also worry that if Prop 60 passes, the industry would go underground \u2014 something they argue would ultimately make them less safe.\" California voters rejected the proposition by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent.

Federal Election Commission, 2010 In a landmark case that restructured American campaign finance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that political donations amount to a form of speech protected under the First Amendment, even when the spending is done by corporations and unions instead of individual people. Though companies can't directly donate to campaigns, the ruling gave them power to freely spend money in support or opposition of political candidates on the federal, state or local level. This led to the creation of a new type of political fundraising vehicle called superPACs, which contributed to the explosive growth of campaign spending. They now outspend the national political parties. As NPR's Nina Totenberg put it, Citizens United represented one of the key cases showing how the Supreme Court has over time \"extended some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights\" to corporations.

But the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected the protesters from liability because the signs were about the country in general. Roberts wrote in the majority opinion: \"Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and \u2014 as it did here \u2014 inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.

The U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the ban violated the Constitution and indeed ruled that the First Amendment protected video games the same way it protects books, plays and movies. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the government did not have \"a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed\" just because lawmakers think that ideas or images \"are unsuitable for them.\" Scalia drew a parallel between violent video games and books like Grimm's Fairy Tales and pointed out that while the United States does often shield children from depictions of sex \u2014 the country had no such tradition for violence.",

In his long-shot bid to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, O'Rourke has campaigned in at least 226 of the state's 254 counties. The rain's coming in sheets as folks file into the Douglas Community Center in Pittsburg, Texas, population 4,707. The organizers of an event for Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke have set out 50 chairs, but they're worried now that's going to be too many. But by the time the candidate bounces through the door, they're unfolding dozens more chairs as the crowd zooms past 100. O'Rourke, who currently represents the El Paso area in the U.S. House, is running for the chance to unseat the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. No Democrat has represented the Lone Star State in the Senate since 1993, but O'Rourke believes he can beat the odds, in part by campaigning aggressively in every part of this sprawling state. \"Of the 254 counties [in Texas], we've visited 226 so far. This is 226 today,\" O'Rourke tells the crowd, who have been chanting, \"Beto, Beto!\" Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat challenging Sen.

More than 100 people showed up to the event, in a town of just over 4,700. O'Rourke has his work cut out for him. A recent Texas Politics Project poll showed nearly 40 percent of Texas voters have no idea who he is. But county by county, O'Rourke is slowly getting his name out with crowded, grass-roots events like the one in Pittsburg. \"I love Beto, I came out to see him. I've probably seen him eight times. He stands for everything that Ted Cruz doesn't and I think he's the real deal,\" said retired teacher Barbara Rosel. O'Rourke's substantial fundraising has also drawn notice. \"In the first 45 days of this year we raised $2.3 million with an average online contribution of 25 bucks,\" said O'Rourke as he spoke to NPR while sitting down for lunch at a Pittsburg restaurant called Hot Links. Cruz raised about $800,000 during the same period. \"I just haven't seen this kind of excitement and energy and willingness to do what it takes in Texas in my life,\" O'Rourke added. That fundraising may help him make up for the lack of awareness Texas voters have of the Democrat, according to Texas Tribune executive editor and political analyst Ross Ramsey. \"I think he'll have enough money, whether they vote red or blue in November, Texans will know who Beto O'Rourke really is,\" Ramsey told NPR.

Ted Cruz, the congressman has been seeing momentum in crowds and small dollar donations.\n                \n                    \n                    Wade Goodwyn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, campaigns in Pittsburg, Texas. In his race against Sen. Ted Cruz, the congressman has been seeing momentum in crowds and small dollar donations. O'Rourke is capitalizing on an extremely restive Democratic electorate. Although Texas Democrats have been largely shut out of statewide office for the past two decades, they've been closing the gap with Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 600,000 more votes in Texas than Barack Obama did just four years earlier. President Trump won the state by about 9 percent. O'Rourke says the president has a lot to do with the energy among Democrats. \"They're coming out because they don't want a wall [with Mexico]. People are coming out because they don't want to hear the president refer to the countries of Africa as 's***hole' nations,\" said O'Rourke. \"People are coming out because they don't think the press is the enemy of the people, they think they're the best defense against tyranny. People are coming out because they want women to be treated with dignity and respect.\" The tall, thin 45-year-old sometimes gets described as a West Texas version of John F. Kennedy. But it's O'Rourke's unabashed liberalism and earnest delivery that makes Democrats swoon. At the Pittsburg event, O'Rourke criticized the state's decision to shut down family planning clinics, arguing it has resulted in sky-high maternal mortality rates. In a state where guns are sometimes seen as a birthright, he argues for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. O'Rourke has two challengers in this Tuesday's Democratic primary, but had a 50 point lead in the latest polling. This fall, it's likely O'Rourke will face Ted Cruz in the general election. Although Cruz's reputation with Republican voters suffered when he refused to endorse Donald Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, he is an accomplished fundraiser and formidable opponent. Cruz's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but Cruz is taking the race seriously. He recently warned Houston-area Republicans: \"The left is going to show up. They will crawl over broken glass in November to vote.\" Early voting numbers in Tuesday's Texas primaries show that Democrats have more than doubled their numbers from the same point in the 2014 midterms, while Republicans are up only 15 percent, according to David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report. Ramsey warns that it's easy to read too much into early vote totals, since they may just indicate Democrats are taking advantage of the convenience of early voting. The final turnout on Tuesday will be a better indication of where things sit. \"It's still a Republican state. It would take a lot of things to fall in place, but that said, up to this date O'Rourke has a lot of things going for him,\" Ramsey said. He added that many Texas political observers are reminding themselves that they saw the rise of another long-shot Senate candidate six years ago. His name was Ted Cruz.",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood says the organization's president, Cecile Richards is stepping down after more than a decade with the organization. Her 12-year career at the organization was full of highs and lows.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The longtime leader of Planned Parenthood says now is the time to step aside. Cecile Richards says it has been a challenging year for the reproductive rights movement. She also says President Trump's election has helped galvanize a new generation of progressive leaders and activists. She will leave Planned Parenthood sometime this year. She spoke today with NPR's Sarah McCammon, who has this look back on Richards' career. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: For more than a decade, Cecile Richards has had a tough job as the most high-profile spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. She's been called upon to defend the organization's work, which includes providing contraception and health screenings mostly to low-income women and about a third of the nation's abortions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CECILE RICHARDS: It's just - it's a shame to think that there are people in this country who are so committed to ending women's access to both birth control and safe and legal abortion that they'll really resort to any means. MCCAMMON: That's Richards speaking before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2015. Her testimony followed the release of secretly recorded sting videos by the anti-abortion rights group The Center for Medical Progress, which accused Planned Parenthood of selling fetal body parts. Richards denied that and said the videos were deliberately misleading. Not long ago, Richards and other reproductive rights activists had hoped this would be a year of progress for their movement. She spoke in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the party's national convention in 2016, where she celebrated Planned Parenthood's 100th anniversary and heralded the historic election many were predicting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARDS: And a century later, an enormous ceiling is coming down. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: That glass ceiling of course did not fall, and Richards has faced renewed fights as President Trump has nominated socially conservative judges and cabinet members and promoted policies that roll back access to abortion and contraception. Speaking to NPR, Richards said one of her proudest accomplishments has been helping to beat back efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which requires most health plans to cover birth control without a copay. RICHARDS: Now, of course I know the Trump administration is doing everything they can to erode that. But what I have found is that when you have a benefit like that, women get really mad when people try to take it away. MCCAMMON: Richards calls this year the most energizing of her career as a groundswell of activists rose up against Trump. Her own activism has made her a hero to progressives and the focus of much criticism from abortion rights opponents. Penny Nance is CEO of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. PENNY NANCE: I mean, this is a very sad legacy. And I hope that whoever comes after her will reconsider the direction and mission of Planned Parenthood. MCCAMMON: Richards' former colleague, communications strategist Elizabeth Toledo, was a vice president at Planned Parenthood when Richards joined the organization in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration. ELIZABETH TOLEDO: The organization at the time - I think they knew that the partisan political attacks were only going to become more fierce. And they recruited someone to lead them through that very difficult time. MCCAMMON: Even before coming to Planned Parenthood, Richards was no stranger to political activism. She was a top staffer to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and, before that, a grass roots organizer. Richards says she plans to continue to be involved in that kind of work which she learned from her parents, including her late mother, former Texas Governor Ann Richards. And she says she's not ruling out the possibility of running for public office herself someday. RICHARDS: You really never know what's coming next. And as my mom used to always say, never turn down a new opportunity. So I will - I'll be looking at everything. MCCAMMON: Cecile Richards says whatever comes next will include organizing for candidates she supports in the 2018 midterms and cheering on a new generation of activists at Planned Parenthood.

            "article_content": "Cecile Richards is leaving Planned Parenthood after more than a decade as president of the reproductive rights group. She has been at the forefront of the debate over abortion.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: One of the nation's most prominent advocates for reproductive rights is stepping down. After more than a decade, Cecile Richards is preparing to resign as president of Planned Parenthood. Richards has been at the forefront of the debate over abortion that has become more politically divisive in recent years. Here she is speaking before members of Congress back in 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CECILE RICHARDS: It is unacceptable that in the 21st century, women in America are routinely harassed for accessing a legal medical procedure. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon joins us now to talk about this. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: What does Cecile Richards' departure mean for Planned Parenthood and the larger abortion rights movement? MCCAMMON: Well, it comes after, you know, what's been kind of a hard year for the movement. The election of Donald Trump as president came as a surprise to many who hoped to see Hillary Clinton elected as the first female president. She, of course, is an advocate of abortion rights. And abortion opponents have celebrated several victories under Trump, both in terms of policies to restrict abortion rights and his appointment of conservatives to the courts. But abortion rights advocates tell me, while they face challenges, it's also an encouraging and exciting moment for multiple progressive causes. Trump's election has been a rallying point. We've seen a lot of energy and organizing on the left around women's rights - think of the Women's March, more engagement from the Democratic base in the 2017 elections in Virginia, for example. So Cecile Richards leaves Planned Parenthood at a time when there is concern but also optimism. MARTIN: Why is she leaving? I mean, what's the public - what is she saying publicly about why she's leaving, and then why is she really leaving? MCCAMMON: Yeah, well not saying publicly all that much so far, though she is 60 and she's been with the organization for almost a dozen years - since 2006. I've been talking to some of her friends and allies. And one of them, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, told me that Richards has been really instrumental in leading not just Planned Parenthood but the progressive movement over this past year against the Trump administration. CHAD GRIFFIN: Cecile Richards is someone who is admired by millions and feared by those who dare stand in her way. And she has brilliantly brought together progressive leaders. MCCAMMON: And Griffin says within days of the election of Donald Trump, Richards convened a group of these leaders to strategize and get ready for the next year. She's been doing that for the past year. And apparently, she sees this as the time to move on from Planned Parenthood. MARTIN: So just because of the nature of her work, she's obviously a controversial figure in American culture and American society. What are abortion opponents saying about her resignation? MCCAMMON: Right. There's always been a lot of criticism of Cecile Richards and Planned Parenthood from anti-abortion rights groups. And largely, they're celebrating. They're glad to see her go. Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America described her legacy - Richards' legacy of leading Planned Parenthood, the group that provides about a third of the nation's abortions - she described that as sad. And Nance says she hopes Planned Parenthood will move in a new direction. MARTIN: Do we know what she's going to do next, Ann - Cecile Richards? Ann - I almost said Ann because her mom - famously, Ann Richards was the governor of Texas. Right? MCCAMMON: That's right. Her late mother was Texas Governor Ann Richards. And that is a possible direction she could go. I've heard some speculation that maybe she'll run for office, either in New York, where Planned Parenthood's based, or in her home state of Texas. She could continue her political activism that had been part of her entire career. And I'm also hearing there may be opportunities in academia. Whatever she does, I know - her supporters are telling me they will continue to support her and imagine she will continue to be a leader in the progressive movement. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thanks so much, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "1 of 7 Saturday saw protesters take to the streets from New York to Los Angeles \u2014 from Nigeria to Iraq. Various incarnations of the second annual Women's March demanded social change, promoted female empowerment and declared a resistance to President Trump on the anniversary of his inauguration. With Saturday's worldwide turnout, you could be forgiven for forgetting that, in fact, Sunday marks one full year since the original Women's March. Its organizers knew, of course. And they made a conscious choice about where to host their flagship anniversary event: Las Vegas, Nev. Its title, \"Power To The Polls,\" reveals its stated objective: to direct the ire, unity and energy of its participants into voting booths for the next round of congressional elections in November. Nevada was chosen for its status as a \"battleground state that will shape the Senate in 2018,\" the organizers say on their website. Organizers have been quick to note that Hillary Clinton won Nevada in the 2016 election and that the state also recently elected the first Latina U.S. senator. Organizers say Sunday's event is meant to be the beginning of a national voter registration effort across 10 states, with the goal of registering at least one million people, reports NPR's Leila Fadel. Sunday's event was not a march, organizers say, but a rally, beginning at 10 a.m. local time inside the Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas. Officials tell Fadel that although the venue can hold 40,000, they expected roughly 17,000. The organizers say they are less concerned with crowd size than with spreading their message. Nearly two hours after doors opened, Fadel estimated that thousands \u2014 many in the movement's trademark pussyhats \u2014 had filed into the stadium under clear skies.

And this year we're going to go out and build it.\" Critics argued that the original Women's March in Washington, D.C., featured and drew mostly white, liberal women. Organizers tell NPR they took that assessment to heart and increased outreach to a more diverse set of groups. The crowd and lineup Sunday was \"pretty diverse,\" Fadel reports. A Native American woman kicked off the day's speeches, reminding the audience that Las Vegas sits on historic native land and that indigenous women face a disproportionately higher rate of murder compared to their peers. Fadel reports that, in a sense, political diversity was still limited. Conservative women appeared to be a rarity. The Las Vegas rally, while one of the most prominent of the day, was not the only Women's March event planned for Sunday. According to a database kept by the organization, it appeared that dozens of both affiliated and unaffiliated marches and rallies were scheduled to take place. Cities like Salem, Ore., and Phoenix, Ariz., also held rallies.

Bush went on to lose his bid for re-election to Bill Clinton.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul J.

Bush and first lady Barbara Bush play with confetti at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. Bush went on to lose his bid for re-election to Bill Clinton. As the years pass, we edit and compress our memories of presidents and other national figures until only a few salient impressions endure. Most of what we once knew recedes into our cerebral hard disk. That may be especially true for one-term presidents, often remembered more for what turned them out of office than for what got them there. Would this apply to the one-term president who died Friday, George H.W. Bush? His name was attached to some of the nation's top positions for more than two decades even before his namesake son won the White House twice. This weekend's outpouring of nostalgia, affection and grief for \"George the First\" surely makes the case for his significance. But even with a public figure this durable, many facets of the story fade with time. That's a pity, because the greater meaning of anyone's life is often contained in the things others forget. Take the example of Bush's decision, at age 18, to forgo college and join the Navy in the midst of World War II. (The White House got this wrong in their official statement, saying he had gone to war only after Yale.) Or the way he moved to Texas to start his business career, far from his well-established clan in New England. Most Americans have long forgotten that Bush first ran for president way back in 1980 and actually won the Iowa caucuses over a field of better-known current and former officeholders \u2014 including Ronald Reagan. That was the first of many times Bush would confound the experts, either by exceeding expectations or at times by falling woefully short.  It sometimes seemed he did better when expected to lose and worse when expected to win. Back in 1980, Bush was full of confidence about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and regional power bases in Texas and the Northeast. His TV ads spoke of \"a president we won't have to train.\" That was a shot at the incumbent of the time, Democrat Jimmy Carter, often seen as at sea in the White House, lacking Washington experience and much of a political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in general. (The ads were also a bank shot at Reagan, who was still thought of as an actor, primarily, and a foreign policy naif in particular). Training, connections Bush had the training. He had the senator father, the Ivy League pedigree and the war hero story \u2014 not to mention years in politics. He had made a quixotic bid for the Senate in 1964 and then been elected to the House in 1966, one of just two Republicans in the chamber's Texas delegation. Nonetheless, as a freshman, he got a coveted seat on the Ways and Means Committee, a personal favor that Chairman Wilbur Mills did for an old friend (who happened to be Bush's father). Bush had opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but once in Congress, he voted for a successor bill in 1968 that was deeply unpopular in his Houston district. In his two House terms, he had also voted to support Planned Parenthood and shown at least a passing interest in the nascent environmental movement. Flowers are laid at the base of the statue at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Suzanne Cordeiro /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Flowers are laid at the base of the statue at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas. President Richard Nixon saw potential in Bush and encouraged him to run for the Senate in 1970 (against a Democrat named Lloyd Bentsen). It was a bit of a long shot, and Bush lost. But Nixon named him ambassador to the United Nations in 1971, giving him his first exposure on the world stage. Two years later, with tensions rising over Nixon's Watergate scandals, Bush was installed as chairman of the Republican National Committee. He would serve in that job for two years, performing dutifully for the party, including making a formal call for Nixon to resign, shortly before Nixon did so in August 1974. Shortly thereafter, President Gerald R. Ford sent Bush off to be the U.S. envoy to China. (There was no ambassador to China because the U.S. still had not formally recognized the Communist regime in Beijing.) Fourteen months later, Ford brought Bush home to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Bush held the CIA job for just a year but is often credited with restoring morale at the agency after Senate hearings had exposed many of its clandestine operations around the world. Today, the CIA headquarters campus is named the George Bush Center for Intelligence. Skirting scandal Largely unscathed by his time working for Nixon and running the CIA, Bush would again show a talent for skirting scandal later on, in his waning years as vice president. But first, we need to go back to 1980. Carter's re-election year of 1980 attracted a swarm of serious Republican challengers, including Reagan and Bush and Sens. Howard Baker and Bob Dole and a former Democratic governor of Texas named John Connally, who had served in Nixon's Cabinet and switched parties. But it was Bush who broke out in Iowa. Newsweek's cover showed him jogging alone on a rugged country road. But the front-runner stumbled in New Hampshire, where Reagan took him down in a TV debate. Bush tried to limit the event to a one-on-one, but Reagan insisted on bringing in the other rivals. Reagan, dramatic as ever, prevailed with a memorable line: \"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\" After that, it was scarcely a contest, but Bush hung around until May. His campaign manager, a Houstonian named James A. Baker III, persuaded him to quit the race. Baker reasoned that having Bush bow out gracefully improved his chances of becoming Reagan's running mate. Indeed, the ticket emerged at the convention in Detroit (after a flurry of interest in a Reagan-Ford ticket). The Reagan-Bush brand went on to win Electoral College landslides in 1980 and 1984. Bush generated relatively little controversy in the No. 2 role, although as a former oil company executive, he was vulnerable to resentment over historically high gasoline prices. Some conservatives wanted the aging Reagan to install a more ideological partisan as his wingman in a second term, but Bush and Baker managed to beat back that threat. In Reagan's second term, his administration was exposed for selling arms to Iran in exchange for hostages (and using the profits to illegally fund anti-communist insurgents in Central America). Investigators looked for evidence of Bush's involvement in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. But Bush said he was \"out of the loop\" on that one, and no one ever proved otherwise. '88 campaign The next big hurdle was winning the GOP nomination to be Reagan's successor. Suddenly, Bush found himself besieged. Newsweek's cover now showed him boating with the headline \"Fighting the 'Wimp Factor'.\" Was Bush too preppy to be president? Too lightweight and accommodating to wear Reagan's mantle? In 1988, Bush got no love in previously friendly precincts of Iowa, unhappy about a farm recession. In 1988, the caucuses preferred Kansan Bob Dole, with Bush finishing third and on the brink of extinction. Then Bush pulled his biggest upset, turning the tables on Dole in New Hampshire, winning big by putting taxes in the spotlight and with the help of Republican Gov. John Sununu (whom Bush would make chief of staff in the White House). In July 1988, Bush was struggling in the polls. Gallup had him losing to Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis by 17 points after a Democratic convention devoted largely to mocking Bush (\"Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth\"). But after a successful GOP convention in New Orleans (and a memorable speech that included a no-new-taxes pledge), Bush turned things around. He ran a campaign of appeal to ordinary Americans, eating pork rinds and visiting a flag factory, while various operatives put damaging attack ads on TV and spread rumors about Dukakis' mental health. Bush again defied predictions by holding his own in the TV debates in the fall and then sweeping to victory in 40 states in November, winning a majority of the popular vote. His inaugural address was a model of moderation and grace. He acknowledged Reagan on the dais but clearly pivoted away from Reaganism, speaking of a \"kinder\" and \"gentler\" approach, as he had in New Orleans. He stretched out a hand of cooperation, literally gesturing at the Democratic leaders (who had majorities in both House and Senate). As president, of course, Bush is remembered for managing the global adjustment as the Soviet Union collapsed and the old Communist bloc ceased to exist. He has been praised for forming a coalition in the Persian Gulf War that lifted Iraq's occupation of neighboring Kuwait in early 1991. The short, successful war lifted Bush to a peak of 89 percent approval in the Gallup Poll and seemingly made him a shoo-in for re-election. Angering conservatives He is also remembered for a budget deal in the summer of 1990 that raised some taxes, restrained some spending and helped to reduce the federal deficit over the next decade. This capitulation to higher taxes would cost him dearly among conservatives in 1992. But Bush's first big initiative as president was actually a tax cut. He tried hard in 1989 to lower taxes on capital gains (the profits on sale of stocks and bonds and other invested assets).  The bill passed with bipartisan support in the House but fell short in the Senate, where it was opposed by Bush's old Texas nemesis, Lloyd Bensten. Bush also found the waters choppy when presented with two vacancies on the Supreme Court. His choice of New Hampshire's David Souter (recommended by Sununu) sailed through but disappointed conservatives, who rightly suspected Souter might move to the left once confirmed. The other pick was Clarence Thomas, a steadfast conservative who remains on the court today, the longest-serving of the current nine justices. Thomas was barely confirmed after a bruising battle over former aide Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment. And finally, Bush failed to muster a convincing response to public dissatisfaction over the economy. A short recession in late 1991 and early 1992 was more severe in some locales, including Bush's native Northeast. His administration's reluctance to take this downturn more seriously made Bush appear out of touch. The Democrats that year nominated Bill Clinton, then 46. The age gap between the two major party nominees has been the widest since the 1850s, and Clinton's empathetic charm was on full display in the debates. Bush was also weakened throughout the year by crossfire from two other challengers. Former Reagan speechwriter Pat Buchanan ran against Bush and nearly won the first primary in New Hampshire (the bellwether state for Bush's fortunes). Billionaire businessman H. Ross Perot mounted a third-party bid that would eventually get 19 percent of the November vote, running against government debt and trade deals. He managed to reduce the vote for the two major parties enough so that Clinton could win with just 43 percent of the vote (Dukakis had received 45.6 percent four years earlier). Bush, whose re-election had appeared unstoppable just a year earlier, dropped below 38 percent and carried only 18 states \u2014 losing the Electoral College 370-168. Post-presidency Since then, Bush has burnished his legacy largely by being himself. He spent little time in Washington, preferring the family retreat in Maine, his presidential library at Texas A&M University or his home in Houston, making occasional trips to the ballpark. On his birthday, he sometimes belied his age by skydiving. In the last 15 years, he carried out several diplomatic and charitable missions in a remarkably friendly partnership with Bill Clinton. His sons carried on the candidate tradition in Texas and Florida, then on the national stage. He played a modest role in son George's national campaigns and advised him from time to time. Many key advisers from the first Bush White House returned to similar or more prominent roles in the second \u2014 especially in national security. It is difficult for one-term presidents to claim greatness, but some of their images and memories have had staying power. As the world of the 21st century unfolds, the credentials and governing ideas and personal style of the first President Bush may seem remote. They may serve as a touchstone of remembrance only. Or they may someday provide a template for emulation by those who wish to recapture something of value from the past.",

Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., speaks at event about addressing opioid crisis in July in Florence, N.J.\n                \n                    \n                    Julio Cortez/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., speaks at event about addressing opioid crisis in July in Florence, N.J. New Jersey Republican Tom MacArthur is a like a lot of Republicans running for re-election this year. He ran in 2016 on a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes across the board. Two years later, his decision to follow through on both could cost him his seat. MacArthur won his congressional race two years ago by more than 20 points, but now he is running neck-and-neck with Democrat Andy Kim, a former national security official who launched his campaign as a reaction to MacArthur's central role in keeping Obamacare repeal alive. He said he was inspired to run for office when a health crisis hit his family just as the health care repeal was working its way through the House. \"Seeing that contrast between my representative on TV talking about how he saved that health care repeal bill and gutting pre-existing condition protections, while I'm at the hospital worrying about my family's future, that's why I got into this race,' Kim said. \"When I talk to people in this district, it is the same thing. They're not forgetting about health care.\" Health care is dominating this race, but so are concerns about the impact of the GOP tax bill that capped the deduction for state and local taxes. MacArthur is the only congressman in New Jersey running for re-election after voting for the health care repeal and the tax cut legislation. That unique combination has made him a prime target for national Democrats who frame this race as a referendum on the entire GOP agenda under President Trump. MacArthur is fighting back, arguing his votes on those two issues are just a part of a broader career built on bipartisanship. MacArthur declined to participate in this story, but he defends his approach to voters in his latest ad. \"I've been named one of the most bipartisan members every year in Congress,\" MacArthur says, looking directly into the camera. \"Andy Kim is running to protest Trump. I'm running to represent you, whether you like Trump or not.\" The race has at times become a nasty brawl. The candidates have sparred in debates, traded jabs on Twitter and benefited from millions of dollars in attack ads from outside groups. All to win an increasingly small sliver of votes, just two weeks before voters go to the polls. A recent Stockton University poll found MacArthur leads Kim 47 to 45 percent among likely voters. Only 4 percent said they are still undecided. A controversial Obamacare intervention Democrats say Republicans miscalculated when they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The law, which was once the subject of bipartisan frustration, grew in popularity when voters began to worry that Republicans would end its most popular protections. That made it difficult for GOP negotiators to agree on many of the elements to replace the law they vowed to end. By early 2017, the repeal effort \u2014 a core party campaign pledge since 2010 \u2014 seemed doomed as House Republicans sparred over pre-existing conditions, birth control coverage, minimum standards for health plans, controlling costs and the end of coverage for millions of people. But then MacArthur stepped in with an amendment that saved the House bill by trading off some federal standards for continued protection for those with pre-existing conditions. He created a way for states to request waivers to get out of major portions of the law, like a requirement preventing insurers from increasing prices on older, sicker people and minimum coverage standards for health plans. The New Jersey Republican defended that proposal after his efforts helped secure enough votes to pass a House repeal bill. \"I've said many times that this bill is not perfect, but it's an improvement from where it started and I stand by my efforts to make it better,\" MacArthur said in a statement following the vote. That measure fell short in the Senate, but MacArthur's role drove New Jersey voters to flood town halls. Voters like Jen Sime, who was one of dozens of constituents who showed up to confront MacArthur at a nearly five-hour town hall following that vote. Sime is now the vice president of a local young Democrats chapter that is organizing for Kim. \"There's been a very big effort to make sure people don't forget that feeling,\" Sime said. \"The legislation he tried to bring into Congress would have affected me personally. There's no rhyme or reason to take coverage away from people who desperately need it and wouldn't be able to get it otherwise.\" Sime says she hears about health care frequently when contacting potential voters by phone ahead of the midterm election. It's something she says Kim taps into at nearly every event he does. \"It's about people's lives, its personal,\" Kim said. \"Ninety percent of the people that come to our events have told me they've never been to political events; they've never contributed to candidates before. MacArthur has taken some steps to soften the impact of his vote. He now says he supports some parts of the law, particularly the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \"My commitment has always been to protect pre-existing conditions,\" MacArthur said in a recent forum on News 12 New Jersey. \"Maybe do it differently than the Affordable Care Act that has driven costs up.\" Many voters, like Paul Sheppard, say that message is confusing. Sheppard, shopping at a farmers market in the largely Republican coastal town of Tom's River on a recent afternoon, says both candidates are running negative ads that attack the other without really saying what their positions are. \"I don't like the fact that they're bad-mouthing each other,\" Sheppard says. \"It doesn't make me feel good about voting for one or the other.\" Taxes lurk in the background Health care may have been the issue that went viral, but the Republican tax bill is also haunts MacArthur. He was the only member of the New Jersey congressional delegation to vote for the tax bill, because most members worried it would curb tax breaks that are extremely popular in the state. Many people here already use the maximum deductions for state and local taxes, which are high in New Jersey, and the mortgage interest deduction. And they were hit particularly hard when Republicans decided to lower the cap on those deductions. MacArthur defended his support for the bill in a statement released when the bill passed the House last December. \"Months ago, some in my own party wanted to eliminate the state and local tax deduction, which would have had a devastating impact on the overburdened taxpayers in New Jersey,\" MacArthur said. \"After months of negotiations with The White House and House Leadership, I was able to successfully restore the property tax deduction, which will benefit all South Jersey property owners.\" But that's not a huge comfort to voters like Bruce Preston, who was having breakfast at the Golden Dawn diner recently in Wilingboro. Preston says he usually votes Republican, but he doesn't like that New Jersey got hit hard by the tax law. He says he's not really comfortable with rolling back the Affordable Care Act either. \"I certainly will vote Republican for the Senate,\" he said. \"Absolutely.\" But when it comes to the House, he's just not sure. Preston says he likes the idea of the House being controlled by Democrats as a way to keep policies in check, even if Trump is still president and Republicans control the Senate. \"I'm a little bit on ... I don't know ... that one, I'm not sure,\" Preston says of his House vote. \"I've been thinking of voting Kim.\"",

Two years ago, Shivam Sharma rushed to a Mumbai hospital at 2:30 a.m. He'd had sex earlier that night with a man who was HIV positive. They'd used protection, but Sharma just wanted to be sure he was safe. So he went straight to the emergency room and asked a junior doctor for a preventative dose of antiretroviral medicines, or PEP \u2014 post-exposure prophylaxis. Hospital staff \"were absolutely clueless,\" Sharma, 28, recalls. No one had ever asked for a PEP before, staff told him. \"They pulled out a massive manual on how to deal with sexually-transmitted infections and insisted I take something like 25 different tests,\" he says. They phoned a senior doctor at 3 a.m. Sharma felt frustrated. He had to fight for a basic prescription. It was just like the first time he got tested for HIV, back in college. He went to a posh health clinic, and the nurse yelled across the room, warning a colleague \u2014 and anyone else within earshot \u2014 to \"be careful\" of him. The implication was that Sharma was dangerous and dirty because he had identified himself as \"queer.\" For more than 150 years, homosexuality was a crime in India. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a British colonial-era law, banned sexual acts that were \"against the order of nature.\" There have been prosecutions under the law. But more frequently, it gave police license to harass and blackmail gay men. Section 377 drove generations of LGBTQ Indians into the shadows. It prevented many from fully embracing their sexual and gender identities. It complicated both patients' and doctors' access to information on LGBTQ-specific health issues. And it got in the way of access to vital medical care. When India's Supreme Court ruled Sept. 6 to decriminalize homosexuality, modifying Section 377, it opened a new era for public health policy. In its judgment, the court said the Indian constitution guarantees all Indians, including LGBTQ people, \"the right to emergency medical care and the right to the maintenance and improvement of public health.\" India's government has yet to announce any formal changes. Activists hope for major reforms to health policy, including mandatory sensitivity training for doctors and nurses at public hospitals and clinics, and new LGBTQ-specific chapters in medical school textbooks. But they acknowledge implementation could take years. Despite that first traumatic HIV test experience, Sharma kept seeing doctors for regular checkups and care. But many LGBTQ Indians say they have long avoided doctors and hospitals altogether. Some may self-medicate, taking over-the-counter drugs for sexually-transmitted infections without getting tested. Some may visit homeopaths or pharmacists when they really need a doctor. Others may hide their sexual orientation when they enter a hospital or clinic and then don't get the care they may need, like HIV testing, for example. Despite the obstacles to getting appropriate and respectful care, it was almost unheard of for medical professionals to report a patient for violating Section 377. But for many patients, interactions with doctors and nurses were enough to leave them punished emotionally. Twenty years ago, when Shashi Bhushan was a teenager, a dermatologist asked if he had a girlfriend and whether they were sexually active. Bhushan explained that he had multiple partners and was homosexual. \"Don't you think this is curable?\" Bhushan, now 36, recalls the doctor asking. \"I said, 'Well, it's not a disease.'\" His doctor believed otherwise. And some of India's most popular spiritual gurus preach the same thing. Bhushan says acceptance and awareness of gay rights has improved a lot in the past 20 years, especially in cosmopolitan cities like the capital New Delhi, where he lives. But Bhushan says he's terrified of getting ill while traveling in the countryside. \"I am still scared to visit doctors in small towns and rural areas,\" he says. When someone who is openly gay does visit a doctor, the doctor often prescribes so-called \"conversion therapy,\" in which counselors try to \"convert\" someone from being gay, says Vinay Chandran, a peer counselor and director of Swabhava, an LGBTQ support group. \"I'm often left seething when I hear about the treatment LGBTQ people get at both public and private hospitals,\" Chandran says. \"When these people eventually come to me for counseling, they're already scarred.\" Given such experiences, it's no wonder people in India circulate crowdsourced lists online of LGBTQ-friendly doctors and clinics. But such efforts are informal. \"It has to go through word of mouth,\" says Arnav Srinivasan, a 38-year-old transgender man who has not undergone surgery. Srinivasan, a market analyst in Bengaluru, has never in his life been to a gynecologist. He is already worried about reaching menopause \u2014 when such a visit might be medically necessary. \"I will be looking for an inclusive doctor who is open to talking about my sexuality and doesn't make me feel like a woman,\" he says. While condoms are readily available in Indian drugstores, Section 377 made it difficult to educate LGBTQ people on how to use them correctly. One of the plaintiffs in the successful lawsuit that challenged the law was a health worker who was jailed in 2001 for handing out condoms to gay men. He was charged with abetting a crime. \"[Health workers] do need to have conversations about protection, but those couldn't happen because of Section 377,\" says Pallav Patankar, former director of programs at Humsafar Trust, a Mumbai-based nongovernmental organization that promotes LGBTQ rights. Research shows that males who have sex with other males have a higher rate of HIV infection. In India, the national HIV infection rate is 0.31 percent, but among homosexual males, it's 4.3 percent. Now that homosexuality is no longer a crime in India, health organizations need not worry about breaking the law when they promote safe sex and distribute condoms to high-risk groups in the LGBTQ community. The Section 377 ruling is actually the second such Supreme Court decision in recent years that pertains to sexual minorities. In 2014, the court recognized transgender as an official third gender and legalized gender reassignment surgery, which is now offered by some top Indian hospitals. It also instructed state governments to make available gender-neutral public toilets. But experts say progress on social acceptance has been slow. Gender-neutral toilets are scarce, and most hospitals in India have male or female communal wards, not private rooms, and lack spaces to accommodate people who do not conform strictly to male or female genders. When Srinivasan, a transgender man, goes to a clinic, medical staff note his gender as \"female\" without asking him. \"They assume your identity. That really puts me off,\" he says. \"The doctors really have to be educated about the spectrum of sexuality.\" Officials at India's Health Ministry and Council of Medical Research did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for information or interviews on what they plan to do differently after the Supreme Court ruling. \"The [Supreme Court] verdict clearly suggests that the onus is on the government to disseminate [new guidelines] to public institutions, especially to law enforcement,\" which has been behind some of the harassment and blackmail of LGBTQ Indians in the past, says Dr. Sambuddha Chaudhuri, a public health expert based in Mumbai who has done research on HIV and sexual minorities. \"There's been no official statement, which is surprising for a government which is so savvy on social media.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads a conservative, center-right party and is running for re-election early next year. He has not spoken publicly on Section 377 nor its revision. \"After the transgender ruling, the court mandated sensitization programs in schools and for police. But it's unclear how much public visibility there will be for future programs. The government might just do it quietly,\" Chaudhuri says. Nonprofit groups may pick up the slack. Humsafar Trust spokeswoman Koninika Roy told NPR that her organization is planning to offer anti-discrimination workshops to Indian district courts and law enforcement agencies. While gender and sexuality sensitivity training is common in many Indian corporations, it's often missing in hospitals and medical schools. \"There was almost nothing on LGBTQ health in my medical school textbooks, except for a mention of [people born] intersex\" with aspects of both male and female genitalia, says Dr. Sangeeta Saksena, a gynecologist based in Bengaluru who went to med school in the late 1980s. In 2001, Saksena co-founded an NGO called Enfold to provide sex education to college students and their parents. \"We need a complete revamp of our approach to sexuality and sexual health,\" she says.",

She says she thinks in order to win against Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, she and her fellow candidates need to run far to the left. The stakes are high for Iowa Democrats in the midterms this year. It's been a while since there's been a major win for the party in the swing state. And Tuesday could be one of the first steps. That's when Democratic voters will select a candidate to run against Iowa's Republican Governor, Kim Reynolds. Early voting in Iowa was underway and primary day was less than two weeks away when a bombshell story shook up the Democratic race for the state's top seat. Three women came forward accusing one of the candidates, state Sen. Nate Boulton, of sexual misconduct. The 38-year-old Boulton, once considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, quickly suspended his campaign. The Iowa Senate Democratic minority leader is calling on the first-term senator to resign. And meanwhile, the remaining five candidates have been working to woo Boulton's supporters. As a labor attorney, Boulton has been a champion for union worker rights in the legislature. And the state's largest public sector workers union endorsed him. \"I am going to do everything in my power to elect a Democrat [for] governor of this state and every other elected office that we can,\" says Danny Homan, the union's president. \"I believe in absolutely nothing that Kim Reynolds stands for.\" Swaying Boulton's supporters will be critical for the remaining candidates \u2014 polls showed Boulton was the most likely candidate to pull ahead of the front-runner, Fred Hubbell. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell, who is in the lead according to polls, speaks with supporters in downtown Des Moines before a debate with fellow party members less than a week before the primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell, who is in the lead according to polls, speaks with supporters in downtown Des Moines before a debate with fellow party members less than a week before the primary. Hubbell is a 67-year-old businessman who served on the board of the regional Planned Parenthood. And he's wealthy. He's put nearly $3 million of his own money into his campaign and is massively outspending all the other candidates. \"Fred told me before either of us got in that I couldn't run,\" one of his competitors, longtime Democratic operative John Norris, pointed out in a light-hearted moment in a debate in May, \"because he was going to have all the money.\" Hubbell's wealth doesn't bother Felicia Hilton, a supporter. She gathered with others who say he has their vote outside the Democrats' final debate last week. \"If Fred Hubbell is willing to spend every dime that he has, in my opinion, to save Iowa from this radical extreme Republican party right now, I'm all for it,\" Hilton said. With total control of the statehouse last year, Republicans passed many conservative priorities, like gutting public sector union rights and passing the country's most restrictive abortion law \u2014 which has been temporarily blocked by a district judge. Governor Kim Reynolds signs SF-359, one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the U.S. It prohibits an abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. A district judge has temporarily blocked the law.\n                \n                    \n                    John Pemble/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Governor Kim Reynolds signs SF-359, one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the U.S. It prohibits an abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. A district judge has temporarily blocked the law. Hubbell and the other candidates regularly attack Gov. Reynolds for what they say is fiscal mismanagement and for giving too many tax breaks to corporations. They also criticize Gov. Reynolds for not reversing the state's privatized Medicaid. \"We need to fix this state,\" Hubbell told NPR walking into the final debate. \"We need to turn it around and take it back where most Iowans want it.\" Meanwhile, Gov. Reynolds has had to introduce herself to Iowans this election. That's because she was never elected to the office. She's been lieutenant governor since 2011 and last year when President Donald Trump tapped Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to become the US Ambassador to China, Reynolds took over. She's unopposed in her primary and is running ads trying to show voters who she is. Cathy Glasson, a Democratic candidate for Governor, a nurse and a union leader says that in order to win against Reynolds, she and her opponents need to lean far to the left. \"They think by staying in the center and doing status quo politics, as usual, is how to beat [Reynolds],\" Glasson says. \"It's absolutely not the way to beat her because Democrats have lost 11 out of the last 14 governor races by doing that.\" Glasson has the support of many Iowans who backed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential election. Betty Salmon, a retired teacher, came to talk to Glasson at a campaign event in Des Moines. She says she thinks Glasson, who's calling for Medicare for all and stricter gun control, would beat Reynolds. \"She is trying to make up for a lot of lost years that we've been sitting on the fence and not really addressing the problems that have been building up.\"",

But sometimes, it can lead us to wicked places. Envy: it's an unflattering, miserable emotion. And it's universal. All of us, at some time or another, will experience that feeling of wanting what someone else has, and resenting them for having it. Of course, like all human emotions, envy has a purpose. It's a tool for social comparison, one that can alert us to imbalances in the social hierarchy. Sometimes, these feelings of envy can prompt us to improve our lives, says Harvard social psychologist Mina Cikara. \"If you have more than what I have, I may be inspired by what you have,\" she says. But envy can also turn malicious, causing us to feel resentment, rage, and a desire for revenge. University of Kentucky social psychologist Richard Smith says malicious envy is often intertwined with another dark emotion, schadenfreude \u2014 the pleasure we feel at the suffering of others. Researchers have found evidence that malicious envy and schadenfreude may be fueled by competition in realms like politics and sports. In one study, researchers found that hard-core sports fans felt pleasure when a rival team's player was badly injured.  In another study, researchers found that some people felt joy when American service members died in large numbers in the war in Iraq, because it made the other political party look bad. The research into the link between envy, schadenfreude and harmful actions is just beginning, but Mina Cikara says there's growing evidence that dark emotions and violent acts are related. Schadenfreude, she says, \"is present in the most dire of human conflicts. If I feel good every time I watch a bad thing happen, maybe next time I'll make a bad thing happen.\" This week, we explore emotions that can inspire us to become better people \u2014 or to commit unspeakable acts.

He's seen here in one of the agency's videos. Carl Higbie, who was appointed by President Trump to serve in the federal agency that runs AmeriCorps and other volunteer service programs, has resigned his high-level post and apologized after a report emerged quoting racist and anti-Muslim remarks he made in 2013. Ranging from callous to provocative and often tipping into bigotry, Higbie's comments were unearthed by CNN's KFile unit, which published audio clips taken from the Internet talk radio program Sound of Freedom, which Higbie hosted, and other sources. In addition to their bigotry, many of the remarks promulgated outright falsehoods. \"We're promoting birth control to a black woman because of the incredibly high rate of children born out of wedlock that are undercared for or not cared for at all,\" Higbie said in one quote from a segment in which he accused black people of \"a lax of morality.\" In another segment that dealt with immigration, Higbie is quoted saying, \"What's so wrong with wanting to put up a fence and saying, 'Hey, everybody with a gun, if you want to go shoot people coming across our border illegally, you can do it' \" for free. After the CNN report emerged, Higbie resigned from his post. He also apologized via Twitter, saying: \"I'm sorry. I'm not sorry that my words were published, I am sorry that I said them in 2013. Those words do not reflect who I am or what I stand for, I regret saying them.\" I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not sorry that my words were published, I am sorry that I said them in 2013.

Higbie is a former Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and was a Trump surrogate during the 2016 campaign. He was then appointed to the post of chief of external affairs in the Corporation for National and Community Service. After Trump's election win, Higbie was criticized by members of Congress, including Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Calif., for citing the U.S. use of Japanese internment camps during World War II as a precedent for a potential immigrant registry. In another quote from the CNN piece, Higbie said, \"I was called an Islamophobe and I was like, 'no, no, no, no, no, I'm not afraid of them. I don't like them. Big difference.' And they were like, 'well, you're racist.' I was like, fine if that's the definition of it, then I guess I am.' \" Higbie also criticized the majority of veterans who say they suffer from PTSD, saying that most of them are either \"milking\" the system for money or lying about their conditions. If a veteran acts out because of PTSD, he said, it's because they have \"a weak mind.\" In addition to Higbie's own show, he made comments about Muslims and President Barack Obama on online talk radio programs with titles such as Where's Obama's Birth Certificate and Warrior Talk Radio.",

Updated at 1:55 p.m. ET There are two new faces and a slimmer GOP Senate majority as the chamber returned to kick off 2018 on Wednesday. Alabama Democrat Doug Jones takes the seat once held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, after his December victory over controversial GOP nominee Roy Moore, who was accused by several women of sexual assault and misconduct against them when they were teens and he was in his 30s. The upset victory by Jones narrowed Republicans' hold on the Senate to only one seat, 51-49. That's noteworthy going into a midterm election year, making Democrats' impossible path to a Senate majority now just improbable. They're still largely on defense, with 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states that President Trump won. But if they can flip the GOP-held Arizona and Nevada seats \u2014 which are highly competitive \u2014 and defend all their incumbents, there's a way. Democrats also have a new seat to defend with Wednesday's swearing-in of Minnesota Democrat Tina Smith. The state's former lieutenant governor takes the place of former Democratic Sen. Al Franken, who resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Smith will run for the remainder of Franken's term in November, though she could face a primary. Republicans are eyeing their chances in a state that Trump lost by less than 2 points. Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty could run, and former Rep. Michele Bachmann said recently on televangelist Jim Bakker's radio show that she is also considering a bid. The entrance of both Jones and Smith signals a shift in the Senate. Jones is someone whom Republicans are sure to target as a potential crossover vote, and he may be amenable given that he will have to run for re-election again in 2020 in deep red Alabama \u2014 and probably not against a scandal-plagued challenger. Smith's swearing-in means there are now a record 22 women in the Senate \u2014 something that isn't insignificant given the rise of sexual assault and harassment claims across the country and the circumstances of both Franken's exit and Moore's loss. And she will serve alongside the state's other senator,  Democrat Amy Klobuchar, making Minnesota the sixth state to ever have two women represent it simultaneously in the Senate. Even though Jones won a special election for his seat and Smith was appointed, it's Smith who will have the seniority edge since she and Jones are being sworn in at the same time \u2014 simply because Minnesota is more populous than Alabama. Here are some things to know about both Smith and Jones: Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith fields questions after being named the replacement for Sen. Al Franken by Gov. Mark Dayton last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith fields questions after being named the replacement for Sen. Al Franken by Gov. Mark Dayton last month. Smith has long been involved in politics, but her time as an elected official has been relatively short. Her first elected role is the one she just left \u2014 lieutenant governor. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton chose her as his running mate in 2014 after she had served as his chief of staff and top adviser. Before joining Dayton's team, Smith worked for his onetime gubernatorial opponent, Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak. She also served as Rybak's chief of staff and his campaign manager, though he bowed out against Dayton during the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's nominating convention, with Dayton going on to win the subsequent primary. Rybak told the Minnesota Star-Tribune in a 2013 profile of Smith that she was known as the \"velvet hammer\" around City Hall because \"she jumps into a problem and tries to fix it rather than complain about it.\" Rybak also said Smith was known as \"every Republican's favorite Democrat\" because of her ties to the business community, which is where she got her professional start. A New Mexico native, she graduated from Stanford, earned an M.B.A. from Dartmouth and later moved to the Twin Cities to take a marketing job at General Mills. That led to her becoming involved in local politics, and eventually she served as the vice president of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Smith also has close ties to the Mondales, one of the most famous families in Minnesota politics. She served as campaign manager for the 1998 campaign for governor by Ted Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale. And she advised the elder Mondale's last-minute 2002 campaign for Senate after incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash only 11 days before the election. Both campaigns were unsuccessful. Smith also gained a reputation for tempering Dayton, who the Star-Tribune noted had \"a reputation for being critical, demanding and occasionally blustery. ... Among those close to her, Smith is known for cajoling Dayton in a certain direction rather than confronting him toe-to-toe. She tries to surround him with a diverse range of voices and opinions, allowing him to draw conclusions and make decisions.\" \"One of the things I have learned is that the person has to be who they are,\" Smith told the paper. \"You can't turn them into a version of who they are. If you do that, you are not really serving them very well.\" This Senate seat is Jones' first foray into electoral politics, though he has also been active in Democratic politics for some time. Jones is a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama who was nominated for the post by President Bill Clinton in 1997, serving until 2001. His most high-profile case was successfully convicting two Ku Klux Klansmen for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which killed four young African-American girls. That experience was invoked by Jones in campaign ads and may have helped him win record support from black voters, especially African-American women, en route to his upset of Moore in the deeply conservative state. Jones also helped prosecute Eric Rudolph for the 1998 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and injured a nurse. Jones has worked in the Senate before, serving on the Judiciary Committee staff for Alabama Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin, the last Democrat who represented the state in the Senate until retiring in 1997. He would return to Alabama to work as an assistant U.S. attorney and then began practicing criminal defense. As the Montgomery Advertiser noted, his defendants included a man accused of supplying Contras in Nicaragua. Another was former Gov. Don Siegelman, who was eventually convicted of bribery and obstruction of justice, though Jones didn't represent him during that trial. Jones did hold elective office when he was a student at the University of Alabama, serving in the student Senate and as president of the Off-Campus Association. While attending school, Jones also worked at a steel mill. Jones ran for the U.S. Senate for a short time in 2002 before dropping out after facing trouble raising money \u2014 not unusual given the conservative nature of the state. But when the seat opened up again with Sessions' appointment to lead the Justice Department, relationships in what had long been a weak Alabama Democratic Party paid off. One of the people who urged him to run and later campaigned for him was former Vice President Joe Biden, whom, NBC News reported, Jones had once introduced to speak during remarks at his law school and later reconnected with when he was working on the Judiciary Committee.",

            "article_content": "Four years ago, Republicans went into midterms focused on dismantling the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Democrats now believe the health care issue could boost them to victory in November.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Four years ago, Republicans went into the midterm elections with a clear focus on health care. They ran on dismantling the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Now the script has flipped. This time around, Democrats believe the issue of health care could boost them to victory in November. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has more. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Leaders of both parties are ready to talk to voters about health care. At a recent breakfast in Washington, Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who also chairs his party's Senate campaign committee, bragged about a CNN poll from late March. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: When people are asked who do you trust more on health care issues, by a margin of 20 points, voters say Democrats. KURTZLEBEN: Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sees health care, and more specifically Republicans' attempts to weaken the Affordable Care Act, as a concrete example of legislative success for conservative voters to rally around. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: I've now been on the Senate three decades. This is the best year and a half for right-of-center policies since I've been here, everything from tax relief to repealing the individual mandate. KURTZLEBEN: Both parties claim their respective victories, but health care is clearly more motivating for one side. Thirty percent of Democratic registered voters say that health care is the most important issue for candidates to talk about, according to a recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That makes health care a top issue for Democrats. Only half as many Republicans say health care is the most important issue. Mollyann Brodie, the head of polling at the Kaiser Family Foundation, says it could fuel Democratic turnout this year. MOLLYANN BRODIE: I think that our poll certainly suggests that if you want to get your base out and motivate them to turn up to the polls, you would want to be talking about health care, for the Democratic side. KURTZLEBEN: It's definitely motivating Corrine Nagel (ph), a Democrat from Davenport, Iowa. CORRINE NAGEL: I don't even have health insurance right now. It's not feasible in the state of Iowa at this time. They have decimated Obamacare in this state, and there is only one company. And, of course, they want a lot of money to insure me. KURTZLEBEN: Iowa has had a rocky experience with Obamacare, to put it mildly. A Politico headline called the state an Obamacare horror story. Iowa had been at risk of having zero Obamacare insurers in the state. There's one now, but high premiums and decisions by state officials have kept some people out of the exchanges. Iowans worried about health care have much more on their minds than Obamacare, however, according to Democratic State Representative Marti Anderson. MARTI ANDERSON: They're really worried about mental health because everybody has, you know, a sister Jane or an Aunt Bessie or an Uncle Tommy who needs some help, and finding that help is a big deal. KURTZLEBEN: A mental health care system often described as being in crisis is one of several health care topics driving voters to the polls here. In addition, led by Republicans, the state has in recent years privatized Medicaid, cut funding to Planned Parenthood and passed a strict abortion law, all health care-related decisions that have angered Iowa Democrats. Democratic congressional candidate Pete D'Alessandro says that the issue of health care is inescapable as he talks to voters throughout Iowa's 3rd District. PETE D'ALESSANDRO: Everywhere you go, regardless of whether it's urban, rural, people are talking about how their premiums have gone up, how they don't have the same coverage they had, how they don't know how they're going to continue to provide for their families or for themselves, get the health care that they need. KURTZLEBEN: All of that said, Kaiser's Mollyann Brodie cautions against thinking that health care will be the driving force in the elections this year. BRODIE: Even though they want to hear candidates talk about it, it doesn't mean, I think, this is necessarily a health care election. KURTZLEBEN: And that's because a force bigger than any policy debate is shaping this year's campaign. BRODIE: We found that a candidate's support or opposition for President Trump is actually more likely to be named as something important to these voters than necessarily national issues. KURTZLEBEN: In other words, if you spend your days attacking the president or praising him, many voters won't care about your plans to lower insurance premiums.

            "article_content": "Long considered among Europe's most socially conservative countries, Ireland is holding a referendum next year to legalize abortion. The vote follows another that legalized same-sex marriage.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Ireland used to be one of the most socially conservative nations in Europe. Lately that's been changing. In 2015, voters legalized same-sex marriage. During last year's election, the country voted in a gay, biracial prime minister. And this summer, the Catholic country will vote on whether to repeal one of the strictest abortion laws in the Western world. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Dublin; there have been calls for this change for many years. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: They held candles and signs that read never again - some 2,000 people protesting the death of Savita Halappanavar outside government buildings here in 2012. The dentist from India died after doctors refused to perform an abortion while she was miscarrying. Taking the microphone, Sinead Redmond of the group Parents for Choice demanded change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SINEAD REDMOND: Savita Halappanavar is dead unnecessarily, and we are all complicit while the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution remains in place. LANGFITT: Now, five years on, Irish citizens will finally have a chance to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the country's constitution which only permits abortion in exceptional cases, such as to save the life of the mother. Ailbhe Smyth, who was among the protesters that night, says Halappanavar's death was a turning point. AILBHE SMYTH: The impact was absolutely huge. LANGFITT: Smyth runs a group of more than a hundred organizations that pushed for the referendum. SMYTH: People were so profoundly shocked that there was an enormously strong emotional reaction so that the whole country was very aware yet again that we had failed a woman. LANGFITT: Most Irish women seeking abortions go to England. In 2016, they numbered more than 700 according to the Department of Health in England and Wales. In a survey last month, The Irish Times found that 62 percent of people here want to change the Constitution and allow greater access to abortion. Halappanavar's death isn't the only reason attitudes towards abortion and other social issues are changing. Smyth says revelations about decades of sex abuse in Catholic schools has had a big impact as well. SMYTH: The authority of the Catholic Church here has been very seriously undermined, and Irish people now have a much more independent approach to the practice of their religion and tend to say, my conscience matters most. LANGFITT: Turtle Bunbury says before the scandal, the church genuinely scared people. Bunbury's the author of a series of books about the country's changing culture called \"Vanishing Ireland.\" We chatted in a Dublin pub. TURTLE BUNBURY: A lot of the people I met and interviewed grew up living in F-E-A-R, full-on fear of Beelzebub and that they would burn in hell. And then before their eyes, they started watching the Catholic Church start to crumble. LANGFITT: And with it went much of the Church's moral authority. Bunbury said outside influences also made Ireland more liberal. BUNBURY: As it's an island, we've had for many long centuries an experience of going abroad. And they go off, and they spend time in Australia or America or England. LANGFITT: Many emigrants came home during the economic boom of the 1990s, bringing with them new, more liberal ideas. CAROLE HOLOHAN: My name is Carole Holohan, and I am an assistant lecturer in modern Irish history in Trinity College. LANGFITT: Holohan says around that time, university became free, and foreign investment poured into the country. HOLOHAN: So when I think of social change in Ireland, yes, I do think of the Catholic Church, but I also think of the economy and how the place has changed very rapidly in the space of one or two generations. LANGFITT: For some older people, that change has been too fast and in the wrong direction. Leaving church one Sunday morning in Dublin, Mona McSweeney lamented what she sees as a decline in social mores with the rise in everything from divorce to petty crime. MONA MCSWEENEY: I'm definitely going to vote against abortion. I really don't approve of it at all. I feel we've had contraception and - contraception, so you shouldn't need to have a child that you didn't want. LANGFITT: McSweeney, though, doesn't think her views will prevail. She expects Irish voters to repeal the country's anti-abortion amendment later this year. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Dublin. [POST BROADCAST CORRECTION: Corrected on Jan. 25: In this story, we say that more than 700 women sought abortions in England or Wales in 2016. In fact, 3,265 women from the Republic of Ireland went there for abortions, and that covers only those who provided clinics with Irish addresses. Corrected on Jan. 8: In this story, we say that Irish voters elected a gay, biracial prime minister. In fact, Leo Varadkar was chosen by members of the governing party, Fine Gael, to be leader of their party after the election \u2014 and he became Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister) as a result of that party vote.] Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "One of the newest members of the U.S. Senate is Tina Smith, a low-profile Democrat from Minnesota. The state's lieutenant governor is stepping into the seat previously occupied by Al Franken, who resigned following allegations of sexual misconduct.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The U.S. Senate has two new members today - Doug Jones, whose race in Alabama against Judge Roy Moore caught the nation's attention, and Tina Smith of Minnesota. She replaces fellow Democrat Al Franken after his resignation amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Senator Smith inherits a seat that has changed parties four times since 1990 and faces a November special election that's likely to be competitive. Here's Brian Bakst of Minnesota Public Radio. BRIAN BAKST, BYLINE: Where Al Franken was an outsized political figure, Tina Smith was practically tugged into public life. Until yesterday, Smith had been Minnesota's lieutenant governor, the only elective office she's held. For most of her career, she focused on the images and agendas of others as a trusted adviser to a big city mayor, a governor and a former vice president. TINA SMITH: You know, sometimes I think people in politics are always looking for the next job and the next opportunity. And frankly, that's just not the way I'm wired. BAKST: Former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak says that doesn't mean people should take his former chief of staff lightly. R T RYBAK: She is not a person to go crawl over every other political body to get to the place. She's a person who wants to get stuff done, and she's in the right position to do that. BAKST: Rybak once dubbed Smith the velvet hammer. It reflected what Rybak saw as her charm and mettle in helping close deals at City Hall and providing a steady hand in times of crisis, like when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed during rush hour. As senator, Smith says her focus will be on bread-and-butter economic issues such as health care and paid family leave. SMITH: I don't think Minnesotans are sending us here to Washington D.C. just to fight with each other. They're sending us here to actually deliver results for people. BAKST: Smith is 59, a New Mexico native, a wife of 33 years and a mother of two. She has an MBA from Dartmouth and came to Minnesota for a job at General Mills. She left to start her own business before migrating toward jobs in politics. That includes running the campaign for Walter Mondale in a 2002 Senate race the former vice president lost. It was for the seat Smith will now hold. Mondale says he's looking forward to having Smith represent Minnesota. WALTER MONDALE: She's very honest. You can - that's a touchstone of her career. She's not going to cut any corners. She's - we'll hear it straight from her. BAKST: Smith must now get acclimated to the Senate while building a statewide campaign. She passed last year on a chance to succeed retiring Democratic Governor Mark Dayton, who appointed her to the Senate. The Democratic field looks clear, but that's only part of the battle in a state that neither party has a lock on. It's a historically blue state where Republicans have made substantial inroads lately. Suburban State Senator Karin Housley is the only Republican to jump in so far, but former Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann are considering campaigns. Jennifer DeJournett runs a political group called VOICES of Conservative Women. She says this seat is ripe for Republicans if they pick the right candidate. She expects Republicans to hammer Smith on abortion, linking it to her past stint as a Planned Parenthood executive. JENNIFER DEJOURNETT: She's kind of got the worst of both worlds, quite frankly. Totally unproven, no hard base, but she's got an ideological record that is completely - you know, completely there. BAKST: Smith's allies hold her out as a champion for women's health and say they're ready for the 2018 fight. For NPR News, I'm Brian Bakst in St. Paul. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "A narrowly divided Senate is putting 2 Republican women and 3 red-state Democrats in the high court spotlight. And, there are reports of new construction at North Korean missile and nuclear sites.  NOEL KING, HOST: We don't know yet who President Trump is going to nominate to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: But it is never too early to focus on senators who could decide the fate of whoever the nominee may be. The White House has begun lobbying five senators, we're told - three Democrats, two Republicans. KING: NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis is with us now. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: We have heard a lot about the Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. They can swing things by siding with the Democrats. But there are also Democrats who could support the president's nominee. Who are they? DAVIS: They are the three red-state Democrats who are up for re-election this year in states that Donald Trump won big. That's Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. We should note, President Trump is headed to West Virginia tonight for a campaign rally. He's already been at a campaign rally in North Dakota. So that's another factor. We know that that's where the White House is looking. There were, of course, 10 Democrats in states Trump won. But these are the three that matter for really one reason. They are the only three Democrats who voted for President Trump's first nominee, Neil Gorsuch. There's really no expectation on Capitol Hill that if a Democratic senator was a no on Gorsuch they could get to a yes on the nominee to replace the swing vote on the court, Anthony Kennedy. KING: All right. Let's hear from one of the Democratic senators who is likely to be in the hot seat. Here's what Indiana's Joe Donnelly told Indianapolis TV station WTHR after his meeting with President Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF WTHR BROADCAST) JOE DONNELLY: I've told the president that I thought what was critical was to pick a justice in the mold of Anthony Kennedy, which is moderate, common-sense and isn't making decisions just based on politics but on what's right for the country. And the president seemed very interested in that. KING: What does that comment tell us about the pressures that these senators are facing? Does it tell us anything? DAVIS: Well, one thing we know is that the president is already calling from this list of 25 nominees, all of which have been approved by conservative activist groups. So it's unlikely he's going to turn to a moderate face that Joe Donnelly was talking about there. But think about what's happening in 2018 long before we knew this was going to be vacant. It's already being called the year of the woman, most specifically the Democratic woman. And groups on all sides of the abortion debate - I think on the abortion rights side, groups like Planned Parenthood and NARAL, are already mobilizing their members. They have huge imprints in states like Maine and Alaska. And I think for these Democrats, you know, this is going to be one of the toughest tightropes to walk in politics this year. How do these Democrats balance the conservative realities of their states - for Democrats like Donnelly and Manchin, they have often sided with abortion opponents in their votes and their own views - and not alienate the Democratic women in their states that they're going to need to show up and vote for them to have a fighting chance to win re-election? KING: The president says he'll make his announcement this coming Monday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants the nominee on the bench for the start of the next session on October 1. How likely is that to happen? DAVIS: It's pretty likely. You know, historically, it takes about two to three months to confirm any nominee once they've been announced. Assuming there is nothing that derails a nominee - there's no scandal, there is nothing that comes out - that should stay on track. For comparison, it took 65 days from nomination to confirmation to confirm Neil Gorsuch. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, will have 84 days from Monday until the next session begins to confirm Trump's nominee. KING: Eighty-four days. NPR's Susan Davis, thanks so much. DAVIS: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: After his face-to-face summit last month with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the president tweeted this - (reading) Everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. INSKEEP: Although let's remember that North Korea never really signed on to that. They only agreed to work on it. And weeks after the summit, we're focused on reports of new construction at North Korean missile and nuclear sites. Satellite photos and news reports come just in time for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to that country this week. KING: The Wall Street Journal's Jonathan Cheng has been covering this story, and he's with us now from Seoul. Hi, Jonathan. JONATHAN CHENG: Hi, there. KING: So what have you learned about new activity at these sites in North Korea? CHENG: Well, just a few days ago, we saw some satellite imagery over the North's main nuclear research center that showed that buildings there were being upgraded and expanded. And now, just yesterday, we got some more satellite imagery, this one from a missile production facility on the other coast of North Korea. And there, they've been expanding it pretty aggressively there. And as you point out, the North didn't sign on to immediately stop and to denuclearize. But it certainly doesn't look good in light of the president's tweet and some of the remarks that he's made. There are people that are going to be looking at this and saying, this doesn't bode very well for what we had hoped, you know, the two sides had agreed upon in Singapore. KING: Well, is it a sign that Kim Jong Un isn't taking denuclearization seriously, or is this some sort of negotiating tactic? Because he's not hiding it, which is interesting. CHENG: Yeah. And surely, he would be aware that the eyes in the sky would be taking a close look at all of these facilities, not just before that June 12 summit in Singapore but also immediately afterwards. And throughout that entire period, we saw the work taking place and continuing there. And the satellites watched it all, basically. So it's hard to say exactly what the calculation is here. But there are people who are saying, look, let's not expect that simply shaking hands with the U.S. president is going to mean they're suddenly going to roll over and stop doing everything they've been doing. They've been working on this for decades, and that's likely to continue until the U.S. can secure a very firm commitment from them that we're not going to do this anymore. And then we'll be watching again to see whether or not they are complying with that. KING: And that commitment has been elusive. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is headed to North Korea on Thursday. Do we have a sense of whether this might change his priorities or the conversations he has with people there? CHENG: I imagine that Mike Pompeo will bring this up. I don't know exactly what he's going to say to them, of course. But even before these reports came out, I'm sure that U.S. intelligence had been keeping track of all of these developments. And so you can imagine that that's going to come up in conversation, especially since Donald Trump, in Singapore, said that he would stop U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, which is a key demand of North Korea. That wasn't in the agreement, and Donald Trump, you know, basically canceled it. So I think the U.S., especially at this point, is going to be looking for some sort of reciprocation. INSKEEP: And U.S. officials have privately acknowledged they don't have anything from North Korea yet. And the next thing they want, as one U.S. official puts it, is for North Korea to step on the scale and be weighed, show exactly what is in their nuclear program. And it appears, rather than doing that, North Korea at the moment is gaining weight. CHENG: (Laughter) That's right. KING: Jonathan Cheng of The Wall Street Journal, thank you so much for joining us. CHENG: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right, we're going to go now to a story that has riveted Thailand - and much of the rest of the world - for over a week. The news is good, but it is not completely finished yet. INSKEEP: Twelve boys and their soccer coach were found alive inside a flooded cave on Monday. They'd been missing nine days. It appears they were trapped when heavy rains filled up cave passages. And their route to safety is still underwater. KING: Michael Sullivan has been covering this story for NPR, and he has just come from the area outside the cave complex. Michael, thanks for being here. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: You're welcome. KING: So who found these kids and their coach? And how did they find them? SULLIVAN: So it was two British divers and a Thai navy SEAL team that found them more than a mile and a half from the cave entrance on a shelf in the dark. And this cave system is very, very complex. It's about 6 miles long totally, so they got lucky finding them. And the children were in remarkably good spirits and in remarkably good condition, too. And they were very, very happy to see the divers and very politely thanked them, too. KING: Well, it's extraordinary because we're talking 10 days here, and we're talking children. Do we have a sense of how they managed to survive - food, water, just the basics? SULLIVAN: Not a lot of food, but they were able to find some water inside the cave, some fresh water. And that's how they survived. Now they've been given energy gel packets to tide them over. And obviously, they've gotten water from the divers as well. And that's what they used basically. They just survived on the water that was in the cave. It's really extraordinary that they lasted as long as they did. But it happened. KING: And as you point out, this is not a normal cave in the sense that we think of a normal cave. There are some real logistical challenges to getting these kids out. What is standing in the way? SULLIVAN: There's a number of things standing in the way. I mean, there are rocks. There are huge pools that are completely, you know, flooding parts of the cave that the divers had to get through to get to these children. So they're going to have to take the children through those passages to get them out. And that's a very big challenge right now because, obviously, these kids don't know how to dive. But they might need to be taught how to dive... KING: Wow. SULLIVAN: ...If they're going to get out in a timely manner. And there's another school of thought that says maybe they'll just leave them there - supply them there and wait for the rains to stop. But that doesn't sound very likely. KING: Is there a sense of when the rains do stop, if they were forced to choose that option? SULLIVAN: Not for months. And the most important thing is - I mean, right now - they've had a couple of days of no rain, and that's allowed them to pump a lot of water out of the cave. But we're scheduled to have a lot more rain coming beginning tomorrow. And as I look over at the cave right now, I see a huge thundercloud right above it. KING: Oh, wow. Michael Sullivan, thank you for taking the time. SULLIVAN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF DUSTIN O'HALLORAN'S \"AN ENDING, A BEGINNING\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And, a Saudi journalist is missing in Turkey.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: The three-month confirmation fight is over, and Brett Kavanaugh is the newest associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Yesterday he was in his chambers preparing for oral arguments before this newly constituted court. NOEL KING, HOST: But there is still a lot of bitterness over this process. Republican Senator Susan Collins was on CNN yesterday defending her vote to put Kavanaugh on the court. Collins, who's a moderate, says she was convinced Kavanaugh will not overturn a woman's right to get an abortion. (SOUNDBITE OF CNN BROADCAST) SUSAN COLLINS: He says for a precedent - a long-established precedent like Roe to be overturned, it would have to have been grievously wrong and deeply inconsistent. He noted that Roe had been reaffirmed 19 years later by Planned Parenthood v. Casey. He said it should be extremely rare that it be overturned. GREENE: OK, a lot of questions about whether this appointment will change the court. Will it shift the court to the right? Let's bring in NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley, one of many journalists following the story over the last three months. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: All right so we have a confirmation now. Kavanaugh's on the court. What are experts, analysts saying about how the court might change with him seated? HORSLEY: Kavanaugh's placement on the court cements a conservative 5-4 majority, probably for years to come. Whereas Justice Kennedy, the Reagan appointee that Kavanaugh will replace, was pretty conservative himself - but he occasionally sided with the court's liberal wing, most famously in a string of gay rights cases - Kavanaugh is expected to occupy a space well to the right. So that shifts the center of gravity. You will now have Chief Justice John Roberts as the tipping-point justice. The question is how much restraint Roberts displays in the name of the court's institutional integrity. That will determine whether the shift to the right is gradual or swift. But a shift it will be. GREENE: And we could start finding out really soon. I mean, October looks to be a busy month for this court. What's on the docket? And what should we be looking for? HORSLEY: Well, as Politico notes, one early case is one that our colleague Hansi Lo Wang has covered aggressively. It concerns the 2020 census and that controversial citizenship question, more particularly whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross should have to answer questions about his role in adding that question. Critics, who say the question would compromise the accuracy of the headcount, they want to quiz Secretary Ross. The administration has tried to shield him from questioning. In the past, Kavanaugh has written that presidents are too important to be distracted by this kind of litigation. So we'll see if that logic extends to Cabinet secretaries. There's also a case about whether gays and lesbians should be protected from discrimination in the workplace. The court has not officially granted a review to that. That's one that could be on their docket. GREENE: Scott, one - a poll that came out last week - actually, it was our poll, NPR's - suggested that Republicans have been very energized by this confirmation battle, maybe closing the energy gap with Democrats, but Democrats also talking about, that a debate like this is going to fire up their base. Has this confirmation battle changed the dynamic heading into the midterm elections? HORSLEY: It's certainly energized Republicans to match Democrats, who are already pretty excited. We'll see if that lasts now that Kavanaugh has been seated. It's possible that, given the geography, this will have a mixed reaction. It could help Democrats in the suburban districts that will determine control of the House. And it could also help Republicans in some of the rural red states that will control the fate of the Senate. Certainly this is something the president's going to be talking about as he campaigns this week in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky. There's a formal swearing in ceremony at the White House tonight. So this is kind of a victory lap for the president. GREENE: NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks. HORSLEY: Good to be with you, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, for several hours in Pyongyang. KING: And it seems like the meeting went well. Both sides are claiming success at working toward nuclear disarmament and setting up a second summit between Kim and President Trump. But then Pompeo's trip seems to have ended on a negative note because he stopped to brief officials in Beijing, and these tensions between the U.S. and China came up. GREENE: And let's bring in NPR's Anthony Kuhn, who is in Beijing. Good morning, Anthony. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So let's start with this meeting in North Korea. Are Pompeo and Kim claiming that there was some sort of progress made? KUHN: Yes, they are. They say they're - Pompeo said that the two sides are closer to that summit, even though no date or place has been announced yet. Nor do we know whether it will happen before or after the November midterm elections in the U.S. But Pompeo was very upbeat that real progress on the North Korean nuclear issue could be made at a second summit. And perhaps no one was upbeat as Kim Jong Un. According to North Korean state media, he said that he was satisfied with productive and wonderful talks with Pompeo on denuclearization and other issues. And Kim said he was optimistic about the future because he and Trump have deep confidence in each other. GREENE: Any idea what progress we're actually talking about when it comes to the nuclear issue? KUHN: OK, well, the way they phrase it, the way the U.S. side phrases it, is that they made progress on implementing the Singapore summit between Kim Jong Un and President Trump. And nuclear disarmament is a big part of that. Also, Kim Jong Un invited international inspectors to go check out a dismantled nuclear test site called Punggye-ri. But really, that's not really - that - the U.S. doesn't really see that as a disarmament measure, more as a confidence-building measure. That test site may actually be defunct anyway. But no details about the main things that the two sides want. North Korea, of course, wants a formal treaty ending the Korean War. The U.S. would like to see, most of all, a timeline and an inventory of what it has and when it's going - how it's going to get rid of its nuclear assets. GREENE: OK, so then Pompeo moves on to China, where it sounds like things were not totally friendly. KUHN: That's right. We don't know exactly what happened in these talks. But when Pompeo sat down with Wang Yi, his Chinese counterpart, he got an earful. Wang Yi said, you know, you're hitting us on trade, on Taiwan and on baseless accusations, by which I think he was referring to this speech that Vice President Pence gave last week, which was - adopted a very confrontational tone. And Wang said, look, you come here. You want to cooperate with us on the North Korea issue. That's exactly why we have to avoid confrontation. GREENE: So is that at risk now? I mean, could China's cooperation - could China not be so cooperative on North Korea if they feel things are frosty with the U.S.? KUHN: Well, China says it has not abandoned the goal of a nuclear-free peninsula. It's going to fulfill its international obligations, such as U.N. sanctions. But, you know, Beijing and Seoul both think that North Korea needs to be rewarded when it makes progress. They think it has made progress. And they're also both very interested in investing North Korea because they see things thawing on the peninsula, and they want to take advantage of this opportunity. GREENE: NPR's Anthony Kuhn in Beijing. Anthony, thanks. KUHN: Sure thing, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, there are still no signs of a missing Saudi dissident and journalist. Last week, Jamal Jamal Khashoggi went into the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul. He was never seen coming out. KING: Yeah, Turkish investigators have now told several news organizations that Khashoggi is dead. They say he was killed by a team of Saudi agents and that his body was dismembered and taken out of the consulate. Now, Saudi Arabia denies this and says that Khashoggi left the consulate not long after he arrived. GREENE: Jamal Khashoggi was a contributor to The Washington Post. He's also been a guest on NPR. This is him speaking to All Things Considered in May. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JAMAL KHASHOGGI: Even when I speak to you, I feel somebody over my shoulder. I have family back in Saudi Arabia. I have friends. And the government is having a heavy hand on us. GREENE: All right, on the phone with us is Karen Attiah. She's the global opinions editor at The Washington Post. She's also Khashoggi's editor. Karen, I'm so sorry that you're going through this with someone you work with. Thank you for taking a few minutes for us. KAREN ATTIAH: No, no, thank you for covering this. GREENE: So as we mentioned, no body has been found. Are you convinced of what some Turkish officials are saying, that Khashoggi was murdered here? ATTIAH: Right, you know, we don't have proof positive of sort of either scenario, that he's alive or dead, from either the Saudis, who are still maintaining that he left the consulate, whereas Turkish officials are saying that he's dead. You know, again, what is worrying - most worrying is that we haven't heard anything for almost a week now. It's Monday. I think - I think right now we're still obviously hoping for the best. But - but it just - it just feels pretty grim right now. GREENE: I mean, Saudi Arabia is obviously denying that - the accusations that they might have killed him. But can you talk about what kind of journalist he is and why he might be a target of the Saudi government? ATTIAH: Absolutely. You know, so he's been a journalist for about 30 years. I think what people should know is that for a long, long time, he was a loyalist to the Saudi - the Saudi authorities, to the regime. He was an adviser to the royal family - very, very close to them, to the senior princes - and within the last two years or so also became more and more the target of the crackdowns on dissent. And so when we - when we got in touch about a year ago, he wrote his pretty much first op-ed, after being silenced, after being fired from multiple columns. And he said, you know, it's becoming so repressive that I have to leave. I have to leave my job. I have to have my family. And that's when we started our working relationship. And we penned dozens of columns. And yes, he was critical of Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, but also kind of took a very advisory role, wanted this young prince to do the right thing for his country. He loved - Jamal loves Saudi Arabia. He didn't want to be known as a dissident. He just wanted to be a journalist. He just wanted to be free to write the truth. And I think writing for The Washington Post gave him a certain sense of energy. And he got to be a journalist again. That's what hurts the most about all of this. GREENE: All right, Karen Attiah, thanks so much. We appreciate it. ATTIAH: Thank you so much. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to announce the creation of a new division to protect health workers who object to procedures for religious reasons.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump has frequently promised to protect religious freedom in this country. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, and his administration believes action it will take today will do just that. This morning, the Department of Health and Human Services is set to announce a new division for conscience and religious freedom. It's going to aim to protect medical professionals who object to participating in procedures that go against their beliefs. MARTIN: All right, to better understand the implications of this, we are joined in our studio by NPR's health policy correspondent, Alison Kodjak. Hey, Alison. ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: What's this new division all about? KODJAK: Well, so the division's being created as part of the Office of Civil Rights (ph), and we're going to learn a lot more details later this morning. But what it appears to be is a broad and - a broad new division aimed at protecting anyone who cites moral or religious reasons for refusing to take part in, say, abortions or to treat transgender patients or perhaps participate in other kind of types of health care. MARTIN: Things that they would claim are antithetical to their morals or set of ethics or religion. KODJAK: Right. MARTIN: So I thought that Health and Human Services already had protections for - in those cases. KODJAK: They have some. So the protections right now - last year, they issued new rules that allow employers who offer insurance coverage to refuse to pay for birth control if they cite a religious or moral objection. And, you know, the - this is actually sort of a reversal of an Obama-administration policy that said everyone - they have to treat transgender patients, and they have to participate in health care if they're going to work in health care. But when HHS offered those new guidelines last year, the head of the Office of Civil Rights made it clear that in his mind, the right to, as he put it, live out your religious identity, really needs to be protected just as much as any other civil right. MARTIN: So this is just going to expand the religious exemptions when it comes to doctors and physicians and what they can treat and what they can't. KODJAK: It is. It's a whole new division that will review issues and things like that. So they're going to expand what people can object to, and the idea that they can do a moral or religious exemption... MARTIN: Ah, that's a difference. KODJAK: That's something that has brought - had made a lot of critics worried because you don't have to have a specific religion. MARTIN: Religious doctrine to point to. KODJAK: Exactly, exactly. MARTIN: So what else are critics saying? I imagine there's a lot criticism out there. KODJAK: Yeah, a lot of groups are weighing in - everybody from the ACLU to physicians' groups to, of course, Planned Parenthood. The doctors' groups say they're worried this could hurt patient care. Say you're a transgender person who comes in to an emergency room, and maybe it's a Catholic hospital. And, you know, what if people in that emergency room decide they're not going to treat you? You know, it's unclear how much this will actually play out. But I talked to Senator Jim Lankford, who's been pushing for something like this. His office yesterday - they cited nurses in Texas who did not want to participate in abortions but were required to because it was an emergent situation. MARTIN: And they would find that to be a big problem. KODJAK: Right, exactly. MARTIN: ...Because it stands in the face of their religion. KODJAK: So it's unclear how much this happens, but it could. MARTIN: All right, NPR health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak for us this morning about these imminent changes to religious exemptions at Health and Human Services agency. Thanks, Alison. KODJAK: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, David, day in, day out, we cover big institutions, right? We're talking about corporations, Congress, the president, the media. GREENE: And here's something all of those institutions have in common. Americans have lost faith in them. That is one of the takeaways from this NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that is out now. The poll also asked about President Trump's popularity as we approach the one-year anniversary of his inauguration. MARTIN: OK. NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here to break down the numbers with us. Hey, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Americans don't trust institutions. We knew this. I mean, this was something that Donald Trump tried to capitalize on the campaign trail, right? What exactly are the numbers pointing out? MONTANARO: Well, political institutions that have served, really, as the cornerstone of American democracy - they're in real trouble - I mean, from Congress to the political parties and the presidency itself. You know, Trump may have campaigned on that, but the office of the president doesn't do very well, either. Americans have very little confidence in any of those. Just 8 percent have a great deal of confidence in Congress, for example. Only about 1 in 3 have much confidence in the Republican or Democratic parties. And right in there with them, Rachel, is us in the media. MARTIN: It's disheartening. So let's talk about the president specifically. We know that his poll numbers have not been great over the past year as taken in snapshots. But when you look back at the entire year, how's he doing? MONTANARO: Not very well. His approval numbers largely remain the same. About 57 percent don't approve of the job he's currently doing. We also asked, though, about how he's done in his first year as we approach the one-year anniversary this weekend of him being sworn in as president, and here's where the numbers are really striking. Fifty-three percent of Americans say the president's first year was a failure, and by a 2-to-1 margin, people say that he has divided the country. Now, they do give Trump, I should say, relatively positive marks on his handling of ISIS and the state of the economy. And those aren't small things, especially in an election year, right? But on just about every other issue, they don't think he's done a very good job at all. And by the way, that includes foreign policy and, you know, that alert that went out over the weekend in Hawaii that shook the island. It's not surprising to see why people were so scared because more than 7 in 10 Americans are concerned about the possibility of war breaking out with North Korea. MARTIN: So 53 percent of Americans think that the - his first year was a, quote, \"failure.\" How does that stack up to other presidents at this time in their tenure? MONTANARO: Well, for Barack Obama, for example, we were in the middle of the Great Recession. Numbers weren't great for him, either. Almost half the country said that he had fallen below their expectations. But he did have a majority on his side when people were asked about the direction Obama was taking the country, and that's not the case for Trump. MARTIN: It's an election year, of course - midterms coming up this fall. Anything in this poll that could help us as we anticipate those votes? MONTANARO: Well, certainly, it's never good when the president has this kind of - these kinds of numbers and his party rates so badly. Democrats, like I noted, don't do much better, but Americans do say they prefer Democrats to control Congress by about 6 points. But that's actually lower than a lot of other polls that have that have been out there. And I asked our pollster about this, and he said that what kind of happens is that when the president is tweeting things that are embroiled in controversy, then the number widens out. And that could be a - actually, a bad sign for Democrats because if he controls things during the - during October, that could be a bad sign for Democrats. MARTIN: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks. MONTANARO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, we know Apple makes a lot of stuff that we use a lot - the iPod, the iPhone, the i-everything (ph). GREENE: I-everything. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: The i-radio (ph) program. MARTIN: They're around. They make a lot of things. GREENE: Yeah, they also get criticized, though, for making a lot of those products in China and also holding a lot of their cash overseas. Yesterday, though, that company announced a huge investment in the United States. Apple plans to build a new campus and bring on 20,000 jobs over the next five years, and this led President Trump to take some credit for this. He tweeted last night, quote, \"I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States.\" MARTIN: All right, we are going to bring in Kif Leswig (ph) - he - Leswing, rather. He's a senior reporter at Business Insider. Hey, Kif. KIF LESWING: Hey, how you doing? MARTIN: Doing well. What more can you tell us about Apple's plans here? LESWING: So, you know, yesterday, there was a variety of announcements, but one of the biggest ones is that it's going to make a one-time, mandatory tax payment of $38 billion, and that's a really huge number in taxes. MARTIN: Wow. LESWING: And it sounds like a huge number in taxes. MARTIN: Yeah. LESWING: But it's actual - it - yeah, yeah. It - I mean, and it is. But it's actually much less than it would've been before the new U.S. tax law that was passed in December. So, you know, the fact that Apple is paying this now signifies that they've saved a lot of money on their taxes. MARTIN: And so this is a voluntary thing. They're, like, doing this out of the goodness of their own heart now. LESWING: No, it's mandatory, and, you know, it's under the new U.S. tax law. Under the new U.S. tax law, they could pay over a period of time or they could pay all at once, so they decided to go with the all-at-once approach. So no, they're not doing this out of the goodness of the heart. This... MARTIN: So this money - presumably, this is going to come back into the U.S. economy in some way, and President Trump has - wants credit for this. Should he get it? LESWING: Yeah, he does want to credit for this. And, you know, he - and he tweeted about last night, calling it a huge win. Yet, I think he deserves credit for, you know, collecting these taxes, but maybe not necessarily for the new 20,000 employees in the campus that they were also speaking about yesterday. MARTIN: Do we know where this new Apple campus is going to be? LESWING: No. And, you know, the rumors haven't really started yet. It's not like Amazon. Amazon basically put out, you know... MARTIN: Bids. LESWING: ...A request... MARTIN: Requests, yeah. LESWING: ...For all these cities. Apple's not doing that, Apple's doing it more quietly. But no, we don't really have any idea. Apple does have a big campus - Austin - already, so... MARTIN: We'll see where campus No. 3 might be. Stay tuned for that. Kif Leswing of Business Insider talking about these new investment moves by Apple. Thanks so much, Kif. LESWING: Thank you very much.

It was a sign of lasting outrage, coming a year after the first women's marches following President Trump's inauguration. Editor's note: NPR is examining the role of women in the 2018 midterm elections all week. To follow upcoming coverage and look back at how the role of women in the 2014 midterms was covered, click here. More than a year and a half ago, the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated, millions of women worldwide took to the streets in fury over his election. It was a massive show of resistance \u2014 likely the largest protest in U.S. history, as the Washington Post reported at the time. One of the biggest questions that loomed over the demonstrations that day: could the energy last? Amy Chomsky, an ophthalmologist from Nashville, attended the demonstration in Washington, D.C., and she wanted to make it clear that she and her fellow marchers were serious in their anger. \"We're not just crazy protesters,\" she said the day of the march. \"It's a shame that we have to still be fighting for women's rights or saying that we have a right to decide on our own reproductive health. We have a right to equal pay. It's a shame that we're still doing this.\" And for Chomsky, that energy has lasted, making her more politically active than ever before. \"I really in the past was kind of like, 'Eh, the right person will win, I'm sure,'\" she told NPR last month. \"I voted probably in several presidential elections. I rarely voted in either local or midterm and things like that. Now I really try to vote on all of those.\" In addition to that, she says that for the first time she has yard signs, is making political donations, and helping put on a fundraiser for a Democratic Senate candidate. And that makes her a prime example of the surge in energy among Democratic women this year. Loading... \"What you're seeing is just this harmonic convergence where women are running, women are volunteering in campaigns, women are making record numbers of contributions,\" said Celinda Lake, Democratic pollster. \"And women are voting for Democrats, especially women Democrats.\" A record number of women have run and won primaries for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and governorships this year, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, and a record number of women have also won nominations for state legislatures; the vast majority are Democrats. Women turn out \u2014 and this year, they're very Democratic It's nothing new for women to be politically active \u2014 women's turnout rate has outstripped men's in every presidential election since 1980, and in every midterm election since 1986. (In terms of raw numbers, women have outvoted men in every national election since at least 1964. These days, that gap is several million every election year.) In that sense, every year is the \"year of the woman.\" But in 2018, polls show women have swung even more Democratic than usual, while men remain nearly evenly split, or leaning slightly Republican. According to an NPR analysis of recent likely-voter polls, this year's gender gap could be even bigger than those in 2014 and 2016, with women far more Democratic than in either of those years. \"Republicans heading into the midterm need to be concerned about the gender gap,\" says Republican pollster Christine Matthews. Loading... Expanding the gap: Education and race That larger gap may be here to stay, Matthews says, in part because it's inseparable from other longer-term political trends. \"Whereas the Republican Party used to primarily be comprised of college educated voters, college educated voters \u2014 particularly college educated women \u2014 have been becoming more Democratic,\" Matthews said. \"What happened is the 2016 election sped that up.\" Loading... Among the most energized of Democratic voters are women of color, says Aimee Allison, president of Democracy In Color, a group that does multiracial organizing among progressives. \"We have the possibility of women of color for the first time getting recognition for Democratic Party successes out of the midterms, and people taking a good look at those numbers and saying, 'Oh my goodness, women of color made the difference,'\" she said. In particular, Black women have relatively high turnout rates, and they vote heavily Democratic. Black women in Alabama propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate seat \u2014 a remarkable political upset \u2014 in a December special election, and they also helped push Ralph Northam to a win that was larger than predicted in most polls in his 2017 election for the Virginia governorship. In Allison's opinion, that kind of energy among progressive voters of color \u2014 especially women \u2014 should be enough to get some Democrats who might be tempted to see moderation as a winning strategy to change their minds. \"I don't know how many losses political consultants need to have in order to say we're going to stop chasing Trump voters, or white moderates, and start looking at the math that says we actually don't need them in order to win,\" she said. \"The new coalition that is part of the playbook includes white voters, but it doesn't center on trying to attract moderate white voters,\" she added. Republican women sticking with Trump While many women are swinging Democratic, women who supported Trump when he first took office stuck with him over the long term. Women voters who voted for Trump largely maintained their \"warm\" feelings toward him as of March 2018, according to an August study from the Pew Research Center. Cindy Moser is one woman who has stuck with the president. The retired teacher from North Carolina attended Donald Trump's inauguration, and she stressed then that she's not alone in being a woman who supports Trump. \"I was on his train from day one,\" she said then. \"One by one, all my family and friends hopped on. My mother was the worst. Now she looks at me, she says, 'I told you he was going to be good.' I just have to laugh.\" And she's still on that train. \"I absolutely adore him,\" she told NPR recently. Moser added that she doesn't really empathize with women who dislike Trump. \"I've always been a strong woman. If I wanted something I found a way to get it. Nobody has stopped me,\" she said. \"It's just the way I am. I don't feel victimized by Trump.\" That sets Moser apart from many American women, 62 percent of whom disapprove of Trump, and half of whom strongly disapprove, NPR and Marist found in a recent poll. And that may affect how they vote in November. For her part, Amy Chomsky is hoping that means they'll vote. \"I think this is a pivotal time,\" she says. \"I just feel like we need to get as much Democratic vote as we can. And I think the more people who can get out and vote in these midterms is gonna make a difference.\" And that intensity is coming from a woman who doesn't remember voting in a midterm before.",

Updated at 5:54 p.m. ET Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday, setting the stage for what promises to be an epic political battle over his replacement. A Trump nominee is likely to be far more conservative than Kennedy, who, though appointed by President Ronald Reagan, voted with the court's liberals in some key cases. Kennedy, who will turn 82 next month, made the announcement the same day the court handed down its last pending opinion for the 2017-18 term. He said he would continue to serve through July 31 of this year. Speaking from the Oval Office soon after Kennedy's announcement, President Trump said Kennedy has \"been a great justice of the Supreme Court.\" Trump also said the process to replace Kennedy will \"begin immediately.\" The president pointed to a list of potential nominees he put together and made public previously. \"It will be somebody from that list,\" Trump said, adding \"hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding [as Kennedy].\" Trump also told journalists Wednesday that Kennedy came to the White House to meet with him prior to making his announcement. The president met with the Supreme Court justice for about 30 minutes, Trump said. The president also said he asked Kennedy for any recommendations as to his replacement but would not reveal whom Kennedy suggested. In a separate statement, the White House described Kennedy as \"a tireless voice for individual rights and the Founders' enduring vision of limited government. His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history.\" Speaking on the Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said, \"The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by providing advice and consent on President Trump's nominee to fill this vacancy. We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall.\" A simple majority of 51 votes is required to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans currently hold 51 seats. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been away from Washington, D.C., while he is being treated for brain cancer, but Vice President Pence could cast a tiebreaking vote if needed. McConnell came under heavy criticism from Democrats for holding up President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland before the 2016 presidential election, leading to Trump's nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the court open because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. McConnell is coming under immediate criticism from Democrats for pledging to confirm a nominee just before this year's midterm elections. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement that encouraged the president \"to choose a nominee with the credentials, intellect and commitment to the rule of law necessary to serve on the Supreme Court.\" Grassley also said he looks forward to having the nominee before the committee, which vets and approves federal judicial nominees, for a hearing \"in the weeks ahead.\" But the Senate's top Democrat argued Wednesday that Kennedy's replacement should not be considered during this midterms year, citing the course Senate Republicans pursued in refusing to consider Garland. \"Our Republican colleagues in the Senate should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a Supreme Court nominee in an election year,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said from the floor of the chamber. He added: \"Millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president's nominee, and their voices deserve to be heard now, as Leader McConnell thought they deserved to be heard then. Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.\" Reacting to news of Kennedy's retirement, Schumer also said, \"This is the most important Supreme Court vacancy for this country in at least a generation. Nothing less than the fate of our health care system, reproductive rights for women, and countless other protections for middle-class Americans are at stake. ... The Senate should reject, on a bipartisan basis, any justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade or undermine key health care protections. The Senate should reject anyone who will instinctively side with powerful special interests over the interests of average Americans.\" There is little doubt about Kennedy's mark on history. Quite simply, he remade the face of marriage in America. More than any other justice, he was responsible for the advancement of LGBT rights. He wrote four of the court's opinions on the subject over nearly two decades and ultimately declared marriage between two people of the same sex a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,\" Kennedy said in his opinion. \"In forming a marital union two people become something greater than what they once were.\" A pivotal role and someone admired by colleagues Justices of the Supreme Court sit for their official group photo in June 2017.

Seated, from left: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kennedy, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer. Standing:  Elena Kagan, Samuel Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch. On a court that has become increasingly conservative, Kennedy's role has been pivotal. In 5-to-4 decisions, his vote has usually determined the outcome on some of the hottest legal and social issues of the day \u2014 not just gay rights, but abortion, campaign finance, gun rights, affirmative action, the war on terrorism and the death penalty. \"His jurisprudence prominently features an abiding commitment to liberty and the personal dignity of every person,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement Wednesday. \"Justice Kennedy taught collegiality and civil discourse by example.\" Justice Clarence Thomas, the second-longest current justice behind Kennedy, said he is \"deeply, deeply saddened to see Justice Kennedy leave the Court.\" He also praised his demeanor and civility. \"Even during the most difficult and challenging times, he had a way of elevating each of us by his example,\" Thomas said. \"He is a good man who will be remembered not only for a long and productive career on the bench but also for the way he conducted himself.\" Justice Ginsburg called him a \"true gentleman, a caring jurist, and a grand colleague in all respects.\" She added, \"I will miss the pleasure of his company at our Conference table, his helpful suggestions on circulating opinions, his recommendations of art exhibitions to visit with my chambers staff, and much more. For the good he has done during the 43 years he has served as a member of the Federal Judiciary, he has earned a rousing Bravo.\" Justice Stephen Breyer called him \"a judge of great vision.\" Justice Samuel Alito said Kennedy \"will surely be remembered as one of the most important justices in the history of the Court.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor called him \"one of the most thoughtful colleagues I have known\" and added that \"it is undeniable that he has had a monumental effect on the law.\" Justice Elena Kagan said \"his legacy will be of enduring importance\" and that she would \"miss his kindness, decency, and warmth.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch, who served as a clerk for Kennedy a quarter-century ago, praised his integrity and wisdom and called him a \"great man and a great judge.\" \"It was the honor of a lifetime to serve as his law clerk 25 years ago,\" he said, \"and it has been an unexpected joy to serve this year as his colleague.\" (Read their full statements.) Landmark decisions in jeopardy President Trump listens while Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy speaks during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump listens while Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy speaks during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House. President Trump has pledged to nominate a replacement who will almost certainly vote differently on many of these issues, putting some landmark decisions in jeopardy \u2014 from Roe v. Wade to the legalization of same-sex marriage. That will please and reward conservative groups that have supported him. At the same time, it will galvanize opposition among Democrats, and potentially even some moderate Republicans. The confirmation rules this time, however, will be different from the get-go. When Democrats threatened to delay Trump's first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in 2017, Republicans voted to exempt Supreme Court nominations from filibusters, which required a supermajority of the Senate to cut off debate. So this time, the president will make his choice knowing that he needs only to get a majority of the Republican-controlled Senate to approve his nominee. And McConnell has proven adept at keeping his troops in line on judicial nominations. Still, the pressure will be intense, and the stakes high. If anyone has doubts about how different the court is likely to be when a centrist conservative like Kennedy is replaced by someone more hard-line, there is the example of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement in 2006. President George W. Bush chose Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor, and the effect has been profound; O'Connor has even complained privately that Alito is systematically dismantling her legacy. Perhaps the best example of that dismantling is in the area of campaign finance. O'Connor, onetime GOP leader of the Arizona Senate, voted to uphold landmark campaign finance legislation in 2003 \u2014 only to see the court reverse that decision seven years later, after Alito replaced her. While O'Connor was on the court, a majority of justices continued to support legislation that regulated campaign fundraising. But after her retirement and the Alito appointment, Kennedy wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision in Citizens United, the 2010 case that remade the way campaigns at every level are conducted. The decision unleashed an ever-growing flood of cash into political campaigns. It reversed a century-old understanding that had sought to prevent corruption by barring corporations, and later labor unions, from spending their general treasury funds on candidate elections. For Kennedy, reversing that legal understanding from the early 1900s was the realization of a long-held view of free speech. \"Political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy,\" Kennedy wrote in the Citizens United decision, \"and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\" In general, there is probably no greater example of Kennedy's approach to the law, and how it will almost certainly differ from Trump's nominee, than the question of how to interpret the Constitution: whether the Founding Fathers intended their creation as a static document, bound by the literal meaning of its words, or whether those words represent concepts of liberty to be interpreted over time. In a 2003 decision that struck down a Texas law criminalizing private homosexual conduct, Kennedy said that the Founders understood that they were writing a document for the ages. \"They knew time can blind us to certain truths,\" he wrote in Lawrence v. Texas, \"and later generations can see that laws, once thought necessary and proper, in fact serve only to oppress.\" Kennedy (right) prepares to administer the judicial oath to Judge Neil Gorsuch during a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House in 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kennedy (right) prepares to administer the judicial oath to Judge Neil Gorsuch during a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House in 2017. The men and women on Trump's list of potential replacements disagree with that view, for the most part. They side with the late Justice Antonin Scalia and his successor Justice Neil Gorsuch, as well as other conservatives on the Supreme Court today, who believe the nation is bound by the original intent of the Founders. During his presidential campaign, in a bid for the support of social conservatives, Trump issued two lists totaling 21 names and pledged to pick his first Supreme Court nominee from those lists. He did just that in naming Gorsuch to fill the open seat once occupied by Scalia. People involved in that selection process say that the president intends to expand that list a bit now. He might add Judge Brett Kavanaugh from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and possibly former Solicitor General Paul Clement, a highly regarded Supreme Court advocate who served in the George W. Bush administration. Clement's main drawback in the president's mind, though, is said to be that he has no judicial track record to examine. Back in consideration are some of the names on the previous list: Judge Thomas Hardiman, of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, and Judge Raymond Kethledge, who serves on the 6th Circuit, which covers a large part of the Midwest. Hardiman was the runner-up last time and is known as a staunch gun rights advocate. All four are in their early 50s.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that a vote to fill a Supreme Court vacancy would be a \"top priority.\" Now a confirmation vote to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy will come just months before the midterms.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement now adds a Supreme Court nomination battle to the Senate agenda. The confirmation process will unfold just before the midterm elections, where congressional majorities are at stake. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis joins us now. Hey there. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So could you hear the collective gasp over there on Capitol Hill... DAVIS: (Laughter) Yes. KELLY: ...When news broke this afternoon? DAVIS: Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is incredibly consequential. And it might be the one point that all senators will agree on in this upcoming confirmation fight, is just how big of a deal this vote could be. It's much different than Neil Gorsuch because Neil Gorsuch was a conservative replacing a conservative on the court, former justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Kennedy is the swing vote, and who they nominate to represent him - expected to be a conservative - could fundamentally change the makeup of the Supreme Court. And it could be, as you said, an absolutely epic battle. KELLY: An epic battle. Now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that he's ready for this, that he wants the Senate to confirm the nominee this fall. Is that a realistic timeline? DAVIS: Senate Democrats would like it not to be. They're already calling on the Senate to delay the vote until after the elections, citing Mitch McConnell, saying that he blocked Merrick Garland's nomination before the 2016 elections under the argument that voters should have a say. Mitch - or Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed that argument today on the floor. This is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: Millions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president's nominee. And their voices deserve to be heard now, as Leader McConnell thought they should deserve to be heard then. Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy. DAVIS: It might be hypocritical, but it's - I think - safe to say it's not going to move Mitch McConnell. He's - very much plans on moving forward with the fight this fall. And it should be easier for Republicans to confirm him because they also changed the rules. And you cannot filibuster Supreme Court nominees anymore, so you only need 51 votes, no longer need 60. KELLY: Well, stay with the politics here because Supreme Court battles historically have been seen as more favorable for Republicans. Their base has been more motivated to get out and vote over this than maybe Democrats or the base to the left. How might this play out? DAVIS: I think so much of it is going to depend on who exactly it is. The White House has indicated it will be someone from an established list of about two dozen conservatives, all of which are in the mold of Neil Gorsuch. Should note that one of them is a sitting senator, Mike Lee of Utah, who did say today he'd be happy to take the job if given the nomination. But you're right. Nothing - this is good news for Republicans - right? - because this is such a base-energizing, motivating vote, especially if it's framed over the soul of the Supreme Court, right? Like, this is going to get the grassroots out. That said, I think the issue we're going to hear a lot about in this confirmation battle is abortion rights and the future and fate of Roe v. Wade. And few issues motivate the Democratic base more right now than - in this year of the woman, than issues facing women and reproductive rights. So those two forces combined - I think - is also what's contributing to this early sense that this could just be an absolutely intense battle in the weeks and months before the midterm elections. KELLY: Well, we look forward to your tracking it for us. That's NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. Thank you. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Comic Roy Wood Jr. is now a correspondent for The Daily Show, but he got his start performing in comedy clubs in the South and Midwest \u2014 sometimes in places where he felt unsafe as a black man. \"I did a lot of shows in a lot of strange places,\" he says. \"I've been called the n-word from the stage by somebody in the crowd and the club owner did nothing to defend me.\" After a show, Wood would sometimes drive three or four hours out of town rather than sleep in a place where he felt unsafe. But looking back now, Wood, who grew up in Birmingham, Ala., is grateful for those early experiences. \"I'm thankful for those gigs because that's the type of stuff that now, with The Daily Show, it gives me an opportunity to tap into who some of the audience is,\" he says. \"If nothing more, my first nine or 10 years of comedy were a very, very bitter education on the psyche of the middle of the country.\" In addition to appearing on The Daily Show, Wood hosts the Comedy Central series This Is Not Happening, in which comics tell stories about things that happened to them in real life. He also starred in the 2017 Comedy Central special Father Figure. On writing the Trump rap sketch for The Daily Show We were just talking about how much Trump brags. He literally is like a rapper \u2014 he talks about his house, his boat, his properties \u2014 and I started talking about it with Jordan Klepper, who was a correspondent at the time (this was before he was hosting The Opposition). Klepper [and I] said, \"I bet if we dug deep enough into his tweets we could find enough bars to put into stanzas to make a full-blown rap song.\" The Microsoft Word document [we created] was font size 12, single-spaced and it was about 20 pages of just quotes and tweets and anything braggadocios and we neatly went through and found line by line and put it all together. On experiencing racism in different parts of the country I think the difference between Southern racism and Northern racism is that in the South you know where you stand and ... when you know where the boundaries are, then you kind of know how to play the game a little bit more. So if someone's going to openly say, \"I don't like you people and I'm going to hang a [Confederate] flag over my door to remind you I don't like you people,\" then I know not to eat at that business. How much cleaner is that than me sitting there and getting bad service for an hour and a half, complaining to the manager and nothing happening? Which one is more tormenting? The Confederate flag is literally more convenient. You save me 90 minutes. On growing up in Birmingham, Ala. I grew up ... on the Westside, the neighborhood is called West End 35211, one of the worst zip codes in the city in terms of crime statistics at the time. ... Pretty rough neighborhood. On the back side of the crack era. ... We moved in on the back end of white flight, so in the '80s we had a couple of white neighbors but by the early '90s and crack had really taken over it was pretty much an all-black neighborhood. The one thing I've kind of joked about sometimes \u2014 but it's actually true \u2014 is that if you're going to live in gang territory it behooves you to live deep in gang territory, because where I lived in Birmingham, most of the shootings were happening where territories met, on borderlines almost, if you will. So there were a lot of bad people, but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirt areas in relation to where I lived. On how his basketball hoop growing up kept him safe from gang violence in the neighborhood The saving grace for me in my neighborhood was that my parents bought me a really nice basketball goal. ... We had one of the few houses in the neighborhood with a two-car garage, a very wide two-car garage, which meant the way the goal was set up you could play almost half-court if you played off into the dirt off into the driveway. So we basically had half-court, and so all the gangbangers came to our house to shoot hoops, so I met everybody in the hood. ... My father was a radio personality in the city and he was highly respected. My dad was a civil rights journalist back in the '60s and '70s. Any march you can find any footage of, I'm sure my dad is no more than two or three steps behind Dr. King, covering the march. And so when it comes to black political talk and when it comes to black political commentary and playing the blues and my dad did the morning news on the radio. My father was the voice of the city of Birmingham for a very long time. His name rang out. And out of respect to my father, guys would leave guns around the corner, they would leave their liquor up the street and when they came to our house it was Switzerland. So you might see a Vice Lord and a Gangster Disciple, it's plausible, right there in our driveway. And there's no drama, out of respect to my father and my mom. On his parents' response to him sneaking Playboys I found some Playboys in the attic that were my dad's from way back when, and I got the bright idea to stash them in the living room, because they'll never check there, they'll check my room, but you won't dare check the living room couch. And sure enough, they found them and the first thing my father did was sit me down and talk about objectifying women and why it's wrong and then he gave me a quiz on all the parts of the reproductive system, male and female. My dad basically, by turning into this weird encyclopedia moment, he desexualized a woman's body, because now it's, \"You better know the ovary, the fallopian tube. You better know everything about this if you're going to look at stuff.\" ... That was kind of the first real bird-and-bees conversation. It made it so boring! You see a rap video and you're like, \"That's a gluteus! That is not a big butt!\" The moment your dad makes you call a butt a gluteus, it just does it. On having a toddler son and being on the road a lot doing comedy For me, [the toddler years] don't matter as much as the ones to come. If I had to pick a 10-year stretch to be physically present and there I would pick 10 to 20 versus 1 to 10. ... Because 10 to 20 is where you really get an opportunity to shape and really infuse the morality. You lay the groundwork that first decade, but that second decade, you know, it's for me, raising a black man in this society, a 6-year-old can't understand the conversations that I need to have with him about consent and about how to deal with the police, about how to make sure he gets a bag when he leaves that store. A 13-year-old can, and those are the lessons that will maybe save his life. So if I have to be gone an extra weekend to make enough money so that I don't have to work later on, or that I can work smarter later on, then I'm going to be gone.

My guest Boots Riley wrote and directed the new movie \"Sorry To Bother You.\" It's a social political satire starring Lakeith Stanfield, one of the stars of \"Get Out\" and the TV series \"Atlanta.\" This is Boots Riley's first film, but he's had a long career as a rapper with his group The Coup, a self-described revolutionary music collective. Their music is on the soundtrack of the film. Riley grew up the son of political activists who moved from Chicago to Oakland when he was 6. His grandmother ran the Oakland Ensemble Theater. \"Sorry To Bother You\" is set in Oakland. It takes aim at corporations that underpay or otherwise exploit workers. It's also a story about race, relationships and conscience. When the movie begins, Lakeith Stanfield's character is broke and living in his uncle's garage. He talks his way into a telemarketing job, but everyone he cold-calls hangs up on him. An older, more experienced telemarketer played by Danny Glover offers some advice. Use your white voice. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SORRY TO BOTHER YOU\") DANNY GLOVER: (As Langston) Hey, young blood. Let me give you a tip. Use your white voice. LAKEITH STANFIELD: (As Cassius Green) Man, I ain't got no white voice. GLOVER: (As Langston) Now, come on. You know what I mean. You have a white voice in there. You can use it. It's like being pulled over by the police. STANFIELD: (As Cassius Green) Oh, no. I just use my regular voice when that happens. I just say back the [bleep] up off the car, and don't nobody get hurt. GLOVER: (As Langston) All right, man. I'm just trying to get you some gain. You want to make some money here? Then read the script with a white voice. STANFIELD: (As Cassius Green) People say I talk with a white voice anyway. So why isn't it helping me out? GLOVER: (As Langston) Well, you don't talk white enough. I'm not talking about Will Smith white. I'm talking about the real deal, like this young blood. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Hey, Mr. Kramer. This is Langston from Regal View. I didn't catch you at the wrong time, did I? GROSS: (Laughter) That scene's from Boots Riley's new film. Boots Riley, welcome to FRESH AIR. BOOTS RILEY: Hey. Thanks for having me. GROSS: Whose voice was that that we heard as Danny Glover's white voice? RILEY: Well, there's a rumor that that's Steve Buscemi. GROSS: Oh. RILEY: But it definitely is not. But it's not. GROSS: That makes sense. I can hear that. It's... RILEY: But it's not him, actually. GROSS: It's not him? RILEY: No. No. I'm just saying that's a rumor. And someone wrote it on Wikipedia. And that's what people get for reading Wikipedia as fact. But, no, it was just our engineer. He did a scratch take. And we liked that a lot. So we kept it. GROSS: I didn't know about the Wikipedia rumor. RILEY: No, I thought that that's why you were asking that. GROSS: No. No, I thought... RILEY: OK. GROSS: No, because I didn't know. I knew that Patton Oswalt did one of the voiceovers. RILEY: So David - Yeah, David Cross does Lakeith Stanfield's voice, and Patton Oswald does Omari Hardwick's voice. So yeah. GROSS: I don't want to give away spoilers in the film. So I'm going to ask you to do your brief synopsis of the film without things that you don't want the audience who hasn't seen it to know. RILEY: Yeah, OK. This is an absurdist, dark comedy with magical realism and science fiction inspired by the world of telemarketing. It's called \"Sorry To Bother You.\" In it, Lakeith Stanfield plays Cassius Green, who's a black telemarketer with self-esteem issues and existential angst, who discovers a magical way to make his voice sound like it's overdubbed by a white actor. That white actor is played by David Cross. Hilarity ensues. GROSS: (Laughter) Well done. (Laughter). So you actually worked as a telemarketer for a while. So you put on a voice. RILEY: I was actually really good at telemarketing. GROSS: Were you? Why were you so good? RILEY: Willingness to use my creativity for evil. GROSS: (Laughter) Keep going. RILEY: So, for instance - I mean, the last time I did telemarketing, it was actually telefundraising, which is ostensibly better than regular telemarketing. So we were calling from the Bay Area to Orange County on behalf of LA Mission, for instance, which is a homeless shelter. But as we know Orange County is very conservative, Republican, racist - all of those things. And my job was to get money for the LA Mission. So my pitch was something like, hello, we're calling to ask you how you're doing. And they'd be like, fine, what are you calling about? OK. So no break-ins today. No - nothing wrong with your car or anything like that. They'd be like, no, why are you asking? Well, there's been a series of break-ins, and, you know, people are worried. And we understand the police can't do anything about it. So we've come up with a solution. And they're all ears because I've just scared them. And I say, so what we want to do is we want to move all the homeless people from your area to downtown Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Mission. And they're - you know, we're going to teach them how to take baths and interview for jobs and give them God. And they'd always give money. So - and it was terrible. You feel bad. You could make yourself feel good about raising money for a homeless shelter. But you're saying all this messed up stuff. GROSS: I like the way you shot the opening telemarketing scenes where Lakeith Stanfield's character is calling people up. And visually, what happens is, like, his desk and him sitting behind basically crashes into their home, into the person he's calling, into their home as a kind of metaphor for how intrusive the call is. And he's interrupting people's lives. He's interrupting, like, a couple having sex. He's interrupting a woman whose husband has, like, stage 4 cancer. And he comes on and says, sorry to bother you, you know, and goes into his pitch. How did you come up with that visual image? Is that how it felt like when you were doing telemarketing - that you were literally crashing into somebody's home uninvited? RILEY: Well, definitely, it felt intrusive. And the whole situation is awkward. And what I tried to do in this movie is, one, give the audience the same emotional feeling that the character was supposed to be having. So that called for visual inventiveness. And in this case, I wanted the two people to be in the same room. And so I put them in the same room. And I think us doing that early on in the film allowed people to accept a lot more. And that's what I did throughout. Every time I needed something for the audience to go through something emotional, something that had to do with the larger philosophy that I have or anything like that, I bent the reality of that world. GROSS: So you're also a longtime rapper with your group The Coup. And before there was the movie \"Sorry To Bother You,\" The Coup released an album with that title. What's the relationship between the album and the movie? RILEY: I finished writing the script. I got to the end the first time in 2012. And I needed a way to get a buzz going about the script because I didn't know anyone in the film world. So I made an album that was inspired by the screenplay. It's been so many years since we put that album out that we actually made a new soundtrack album, which is by The Coup, for the movie. So that will also be coming out in this summer. GROSS: So I wish we could play music from the soundtrack of \"Sorry To Bother You.\" But since it's not going to be released until later in July, I thought we'd hear a track from the album \"Sorry To Bother You\" which came out in - what'd you say? 2012? RILEY: '12. GROSS: Yeah. RILEY: Yes. GROSS: So this is a song that I think provides a similar energy to the song that you used on the soundtrack at the beginning of the movie \"Sorry To Bother You.\" And it's called \"The Magic Clap.\" You want to say a few words about it? RILEY: Yeah. And as far as that energy, I'd like to - you know, I tried to go the intellectual route and say that I needed this visceral energy for this or that. But also, we're a performing band. And we need shows that rock the crowd. And so we need songs that rock the crowd. And that's also the reason for songs like this. But this song is talking about that moment when theory turns to action, that moment in your brain. And for the purposes of the song, we're calling it \"The Magic Clap.\" GROSS: OK. So let's hear \"The Magic Clap\" from the 2012 album \"Sorry To Bother You.\" And this is The Coup. And you'll hear my guest Boots Riley, who wrote and directed the new film \"Sorry To Bother You.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE MAGIC CLAP\") THE COUP: (Singing) Come on, kids. Gather around. Listen up. The magic clap. M-A-G-I-C C-L-A-P. Let's go. M-A-G-I-C C-L-A-P. Let's do it. Clap, the magic clap. Clap, the magic clap. (Singing) It's like a hotwire, baby, when we put it together. When the sparks fly, we'll ignite the future forever. This is the last kiss Martin ever gave to Coretta. It's like a paparazzi picture when I flash my Beretta. I got scars on my back, the truth on my tongue. I had the money in my hand when that alarm got rung. We want to breathe fire and freedom from our lungs. Tell Homeland Security we are the bomb. Clap, the magic clap. GROSS: That's music from the 2012 album by The Coup, \"Sorry To Bother You.\" And Boots Riley, who is the producer and rapper in The Coup, has now made a film called \"Sorry To Bother You.\" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PRINCE SONG, \"THE BALLARD OF DOROTHY PARKER\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Boots Riley, and he wrote and directed the new movie satire \"Sorry To Bother You.\" You became a rapper. You were in the music world before you were in the film world. So I think you always knew you wanted to make movies. How did you end up being in the music world first? RILEY: I was at film school in San Francisco State, and at that time, the school was more - I found it to be more focused on experimental film and documentary. You know, I was interested in narrative and things that could reach many people. And going to school in San Francisco, you're not going to meet as many people that are making films as you would if you went to film school in New York or LA. So we got a record deal where they were actually offering me money to do music, to do my art. So I quit school really quickly and did that instead. We just happened to be at the right time and the right place because the Bay Area, specifically Oakland, was a place that every record label decided they needed a group from. So we rode that wave that was started by people like Digital Underground, Too Short and MC Hammer. GROSS: OK. So I have to ask this (laughter) - when you were in high school, you wrote, like, a rap version, rap lyrics, for the songs from \"West Side Story.\" RILEY: Well, I wrote the play as well. GROSS: Oh, oh, wow. OK. As a fan of \"West Side Story,\" I must ask you to tell us about that and to ask you please to maybe do some of the lyrics. RILEY: Well, I'm very old, so I don't know how I'd remember something from 1987, '86 that I only did once or twice, so - but I can guarantee you just imagine something really corny. And the first raps I ever wrote, which is how I actually got into rapping is because I did that for the play and nobody booed. So I decided maybe I could figure out how to do it. GROSS: Related to theater, your grandmother ran the Oakland Ensemble Theater. Did she inspire you to want to do theater or to perform? RILEY: Yeah. I think as a kid that was addicted to TV, she maybe thought that that was a way to get me away from the TV, to say, well, you could do what they're doing there. And so it was acting. I would be around her sometimes when she was doing - they did \"Flash Gordon.\" I remember that. And there were just a bunch of people that were always creating. And I went on auditions with her. I remember that was - the first time I met Danny Glover was - I was probably like 10 and there were auditions going on, and I recognized him because he had already been in stuff. But - yeah - and then I became part of another theater group that was called the the Black Repertory Group, and it was just in a storefront in Berkeley. And there would be just one-person plays coming through, and we would help them happen. But I think that's how I got into film was I also at the same time was an organizer. I became an organizer in helping out farm workers to organize a union. And so I saw the opportunity to fuse art and movement building. But seeing storefront plays made me think that maybe that wasn't the most effective thing to do. And at the same time, Spike Lee was out, so I got really excited about the idea of doing film instead. GROSS: So you met Danny Glover through your grandmother. RILEY: Actually I met - you know, that's how I met him the first time, but him and my father have known each other since 1968. They were part of the San Francisco State strike together, which created the first school of ethnic studies in the United States. GROSS: So did he remember you when you asked him to have a brief role in your film? RILEY: Well, I've known him so... GROSS: Oh, so he didn't have a chance to forget you (laughter). RILEY: He's a family friend, yeah, yeah. GROSS: That's great. RILEY: He's a family friend. But he was the last person to sign on, I will say that. And that's because to him I was his friend's son with a script. And so - and I'm sure so many people approach him with screenplays all the time and... GROSS: And with their son's screenplays. RILEY: Yeah, yeah. So - but he even though he was the last one to sign on, he's probably the most enthusiastic about it. I've - he sat through six screenings and is always laughing the loudest at the movie. GROSS: So give us a sense from, like, when you started performing. What else was happening in the rap world when you entered it? RILEY: Well - so our lyrics were seen as political. And I say seen as political because they were. However, I think that all of this stuff is political. Everything we talk about is political. And only the things that disagree with the status quo are called political and - which ends up kind of lying to us because then we think that the status quo is what should be or what's regular. And it stops us from thinking. Anyway - so it was at a time when supposedly political rap was over with. This was years after Public Enemy had been out. And also we didn't fit the mold of what people thought West Coast rap was supposed to sound like or talk about. So the labels always had a hard time putting us into a genre that they could easily sell. GROSS: So before you made your new movie, your first feature film, you were in a lot of music videos with your group, The Coup. Did you have a hand in directing the music videos? Because you wanted to be a filmmaker. RILEY: So at first, we were on a big label. You know, that was my thing. I was like, I went to film school. The label would say, OK, if you direct the videos since you don't have experience, you know, here's your budget way down here, and if you let this other person direct it, then you've got a budget way up here. And wanting to promote the - wanting to get the best video possible, that's what we went with was the other directors. But I, you know, was very involved in that, again, from the treatment to camping out in the editing room. And we - I did co-direct one video, which is an eight-minute-long story song called \"Me & Jesus The Pimp In The '79 Granada Last Night\" and - where we had Roger Guenveur Smith play Jesus the pimp. And - yeah, so I did that. And then, you know, with some of our other videos, I was involved in various ways; but no, only co-directed that one. GROSS: Did the music videos that your band was in help prepare you at all for making your new movie, \"Sorry To Bother You?\" RILEY: Well I'll tell you what - I told investors that they did. GROSS: (Laughter). RILEY: But it's a different art form. And so there were all sorts of things that I just was worried about that I didn't know. Like, OK, if you have a scene and there's 12 extras going up and down the street, who's the person that tells them to go and stop, you know, little things like that? A lot of those questions also got answered because I went to the - I took part in the Sundance Labs and then forced people to be my mentors in other cases. GROSS: My guest is Boots Riley. He wrote and directed the new satirical film \"Sorry To Bother You.\" He also fronts the hip-hop band The Coup. His music is used in the film. After a break, we'll talk about what went through his mind as the band's tour bus rolled off a cliff. And he'll tell us about growing up the son of activists. And Kevin Whitehead will review a new release of a previously lost 1963 Coltrane studio session with his quartet. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STRANGE ARITHMETIC\") THE COUP: (Rapping) Economics is the symphony of hunger and theft. Mortar shells often echo out the cashing of checks. In geography class, it\u2019s borders, mountains and rivers, but they will never show the line between the takers and givers. Algebra is that unique occasion in which a school can say that there should be a balanced equation. And then statistics is the tool of the complicit to say everybody\u2019s with it and that you\u2019re the only critic. And teacher, my hand is up. Please, don\u2019t make me a victim. Teachers, stand up. You need to tell us how to flip this system. Teacher, my hand is up. Please, don\u2019t make me a victim. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR I'm Terry Gross, back with Boots Riley, who wrote and directed the new film \"Sorry To Bother You.\" It's a social political satire about power and race, focusing on the story of a telemarketer played by Lakeith Stanfield, who is exploited by the corporation he works for. Riley also fronts the hip-hop band The Coup, whose lyrics often condemn capitalism and the misuse of power with a satirical edge and catchy beats. Let me ask you about something else, a very different kind of incident in your career with The Coup. In 2006, you were in a tour bus accident with the other members of the group. And the van, or whatever you were driving in, flipped over and caught on fire. Were you or your bandmates injured? RILEY: Yeah. Our - no one died, but Silk E, who sings with us, she suffered three broken ribs and her lungs punctured in a couple places. We were also in the bus with another group of musicians who were touring with Mr. Lif and their DJ - the skin on his head and on his skull split open and his leg's broken. It was terrible. We went off a cliff 35 feet down. GROSS: Oh, gosh. RILEY: And the bus caught on fire and ended up exploding. So... GROSS: How did you get out? RILEY: Well, it got stuck on a rock, and we were basically sideways. And so people had to hang off and come down. And we were on - we ended up having to traverse up this rocky hill to get away from the bus. And many of us were covered in blood, and we were up at the highway waving people down. And nobody would stop for us for a long time. And what we found out from the people who eventually stopped for us was because people were told - this was near El Centro, Calif. And people were told there not to stop for anyone for any reason because they might be illegal immigrants. So apparently even if we were covered in blood and things torn and one woman also - the person selling merch for Mr. Lif - she got her finger cut in half so blood streaming down. People weren't stopping. GROSS: Wow. I'm just trying to think of you going down a hilly path, like you and your - a rocky path. You and your bandmates with somebody having two broken legs and somebody having like three broken ribs - that must've been hard. RILEY: It's something that doesn't affect you until a little bit after because - right then - you're just trying to make sure everybody's safe. Everybody gets out of... GROSS: Yeah. RILEY: ...Harm's way. GROSS: What about you? Were you injured? RILEY: I wasn't. I was going to be in a part of the bus that nobody actually was in. But had I been in that part of the bus, I would've been locked in. And instead, I didn't go to that part of the bus because there were people on the bus who hadn't seen the movie \"Anchorman\" ever. And I wanted to watch that with them. This is weird 'cause my movie's nothing like \"Anchorman,\" but I like that movie for my own personal reasons. And so I wanted to sit there with them. So we're watching \"Anchorman\" in the front of the bus. And I had this - I thought about the fact that in entertainer coaches, there aren't seatbelts. And I thought about, well, what would I do if we got in a crash? And I pantomimed myself, bracing myself against the table 'cause they have like this diner table (unintelligible) that I was sitting at. I pantomimed myself, bracing myself with my leg and my arms in different things and figured that out. It was really strange. And... GROSS: Do you think you were having a premonition? RILEY: ...Then it happened. I don't really believe in that sort of thing but maybe I - yeah. I'm always paranoid. So... GROSS: (Laughter). RILEY: ...You know, I probably did that on the way here, too. GROSS: So did that make you think about how life can change in an instant? RILEY: You know, the trip down took - I don't know - a couple seconds. And it was enough time for me to be mad at the driver and then think about whether or not I was going to die. And I decided I was going to die, be scared, then mad, then accept it and then think about whether I had done everything I could do in my life. My answer was yes. Like, I had lived - I had done the best I could do. You know, and then you think about your kids, and are they going to be OK? And, you know, I had somehow - I put that to rest. But, yeah, I - and that was the weird thing - is that I made myself OK with dying. And, because of that, I realized how terrible it would've been for my answer to have been no - how it would've felt. And so I think it reinforced that in me. It also reinforced the idea that we could die at any second. GROSS: Yeah. RILEY: And I want to try to be as present as possible. GROSS: So you thought you were going to die even though you weren't injured? RILEY: Yeah, I did. No, this was as the... GROSS: Oh, as it was - oh, oh, oh. RILEY: ...Bus was going down - as we were careening down. And people are flying... GROSS: Oh. RILEY: ...Around me, and I'm holding on. And I have no idea - you know, it's the middle of the night. I have no idea what awaits us. Had it been 10 seconds before, it would've been a hundred-foot drop. GROSS: Wow. So you're very political as a person. Your music is political. The film has a lot of political messages in it. Your father was very political as well. Did... RILEY: What do you mean by political? Who isn't political? GROSS: That he was a civil rights activist. RILEY: I mean, like, are there people that aren't? GROSS: He worked with the panthers. I mean, like... RILEY: Yes. GROSS: ...Literally involved in... RILEY: I agree with you. I'm just kind of... GROSS: Activist. I should say political activist. RILEY: It's just a pet peeve what people call it. Political... GROSS: Yeah, I understand. RILEY: No, but yeah. GROSS: But your father was an activist. And there's even... RILEY: Yes. Yes. GROSS: ...A photo of him with Malcolm X and Floyd McKissick who'd been the head of CORE, the Congress on Racial Equality - one of the... RILEY: Yeah. GROSS: ...Big civil rights groups from the '60s. RILEY: Yeah. GROSS: What does that photo mean to you? RILEY: I think it represents his legacy of being involved with civil rights movements and fighting for change. He joined the NAACP at the age of 12 and, like, started the Durham, N.C., chapter of the NAACP at that age. I mean, meaning there was nobody in Durham, and they needed somebody to start it there. And he - and later joined CORE and came to San Francisco. So that picture really says a lot for me. He was moderating a debate between Floyd McKissick and Malcolm X, and he was 18 years old. So him - you know, it shows me a driven young man. GROSS: So your haircut looks like you could be in the panthers in the '60s. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: This kind of big afro with kind of like early '70s big sideburns. Are you trying to make a statement with your hair about your connection to that period? RILEY: I think when I first got it - I got sideburns because I - you know, in my early 20s, I looked like I was 12. GROSS: (Laughter). RILEY: Sideburns helped out with that. And after that, it's just 'cause, you know, I got used to it. And actually times when I wanted to change my hairstyle - I knew that so many people knew us from music videos and didn't necessarily know the name of the group but knew it was that dude with the afro that - I knew that me being on the cover with that hairstyle let a lot of people know that this was our album. But... GROSS: Yeah. RILEY: ...I do think, obviously, I like how it looks 'cause I would change it real quick if I didn't. It makes my nose smaller. GROSS: (Laughter) Now we're getting to the real answer. Why don't we take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Boots Riley. He wrote and directed the new movie \"Sorry To Bother You.\" He's also a rapper, and his band the Coup has several albums that they've recorded since 1993. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF QUINCY JONES SONG, \"HIKKY-BURR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Boots Riley. He wrote and directed and did the music for the new movie \"Sorry To Bother You,\" which is a satire that has to do with telemarketing and then goes to all kinds of political and social places after that. And the name of his band is the Coup, and they've been recording since 1993. So your father went to law school when you were how old? RILEY: He graduated law school when I was 9. So... GROSS: And this was like a second career for him, right? RILEY: Yeah, he - I mean, he had many. So one of them being a bus driver. The other being a full-time organizer for radical organization. And he - what else? He drove the train at the San Francisco Zoo - lots of different things like that. I think often when people are organizers, they have to - they take whatever job they can. And... GROSS: It's like his day jobs. RILEY: Yeah. Yeah. GROSS: So when he went back to college to study law, did that give you hope that - like you can change your life? Like, you can... RILEY: No. I... GROSS: ...You can reinvent yourself or make a big change. RILEY: Yeah. I mean, I was young enough to where I didn't think about it like that. I mean... GROSS: You're too young to - yeah. RILEY: As you're a kid, like, you're - you've got food in the refrigerator. The lights are on, and hopefully you shield your children - if you can - from even the worry that the lights might get cut off, right? So I just knew that he wanted to do that. And it actually had been something he wanted to do. If you look at his high school yearbook, it said he wanted to be a lawyer. But I think he got involved with various movements, and that was more important to him at the time. And then he finally went back to school. GROSS: Was it hard for him to keep the lights on while he was in school? RILEY: I know that we were at various times on food stamps, and yeah. So - but, you know, it's weird to talk about it because then it seems like I'm telling a hardship story. Well, maybe economically it is. That's not how I remember my life, you know? I just had a childhood. And yeah. GROSS: So I think it's fair to say you consider yourself a revolutionary. RILEY: Yeah. GROSS: So I wonder if you vote, like in presidential elections. RILEY: I've voted for local things. I think that my - what my takeaway is that sometimes when people vote, they use that as their be-all, end-all. And the reason why is because we promote it as the be-all, end-all. It doesn't - I know that the answer is it doesn't have to be. It doesn't have to be the only thing that people do. You know, however, the way we sell these elections - the way we sell the candidates is that everything is going to change. And there's going to be a giant change, and so we get people involved in that. And so these movements that we build that could possibly pressure the people that hold the purse strings as opposed to just the people that are being controlled by the purse strings - those movements get dissipated. And so that is the reason that I don't promote that. I don't - you know, I'm not part of those campaigns. GROSS: So it sounds like you vote in local elections but not necessarily in presidential elections. RILEY: Yes. GROSS: And you seem to feel like whoever's in office - it doesn't make that big a difference, but do you perceive... RILEY: No, that's not what I'm... GROSS: Oh, OK. RILEY: That's not what I'm saying. GROSS: Do you perceive a difference between Obama and Trump when it comes to issues that directly affect people's lives, like reproductive issues, LGBTQ rights, marriage equality, climate change, the environment, voting rights, protecting our voting system? RILEY: I just said that, yeah, there's a difference. My problem is is that if we don't want to keep going further to the right - so, for instance, right now what's going to happen is a candidate can come up and just be a couple inches to the left of Trump. And they will be seen as almost radical, and we will vote for them. And then we won't criticize them like we did with - we didn't with Obama. Like, the immigration policies that Trump is trying to put forward right now are definitely a direct result of the things that Obama did. Like, as far as he, you know, built the stairs, and Trump built a couple extra steps on those stairs. And we didn't even criticize - for the most part, we didn't criticize Obama for the things that he was doing because he was a Democrat. So my thing is, yes, there is a difference. But where - if I have only so many minutes on this earth, how am I going to make the bigger difference? And for me, that has to do with helping to build a movement that can change policy. GROSS: But does it exclude voting? RILEY: ...No matter who's in office. GROSS: Does that have to exclude voting? RILEY: Well, the reason why as a campaign - it doesn't have to exclude a personal thing. But as a campaign - someone, you know, campaigning for someone, it does exclude that. GROSS: You're very anticapitalist. And now you're in the movie industry. You stand the possibility of having a movie career and actually making a lot of money. What have you promised yourself about how you'd handle money and fame if you get it? RILEY: Well, I have so many plans of things that I need to do, projects and things that - some are art-related. Some are, you know, having to do with other grassroots campaigns that - a lot of that. And I've also gone 20 years without any money that - a lot of that money is going to be gone as soon as it comes to me if it does - knock on wood. But the rest of it has - I've just got so many plans that I don't have to make promises to myself for what I personally spend because I have these other projects that the money will go to. GROSS: Boots Riley, it was great to talk with you. Thank you so much. RILEY: Thank you. GROSS: Boots Riley wrote and directed the new film \"Sorry To Bother You\" and fronts the hip-hop band The Coup, which did music for the film. After we take a short break, Kevin Whitehead will review a new release of a previously lost 1963 John Coltrane studio session. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today we join people throughout America on both sides of the political aisle in remembering Senator John McCain. His memorial service will be held at the National Cathedral next Saturday, one week after his death from brain cancer at the age of 81. We're going to listen to an interview I recorded with him in 2000 after his best-selling memoir \"Faith Of Our Fathers\" (ph) was published in paperback. But we'll start with the interview I recorded with him in 2005 after the publication of his book \"Character Is Destiny.\" This was five years after he'd lost the Republican presidential primary to George W. Bush. When we spoke, he was considering running for president in 2008. He did run, but lost to Barack Obama. McCain requested that those two former opponents speak at his funeral. We talked about many things in these interviews, including his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his years as a Republican senator from Arizona. This 2005 interview begins with a story that involves his mother, who has survived him and is now 106. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: Senator McCain, welcome to FRESH AIR. In your book \"Character Is Destiny,\" you talk a little bit about your own life. And you tell a great story about your mother's objections to the language you once used... JOHN MCCAIN: (Laughter). GROSS: ...To describe your experiences as a prisoner of war. Would you tell us that story? MCCAIN: Yes. My mother is now 93. I think she was 90 at the time that an excerpt from the first book that Mark Salter and I wrote called \"Faith Of My Fathers\" was excerpted in a magazine in Washington. And one of the excerpts that was printed in the magazine was that I was - when I was in prison in Hanoi and I would - being taken from one cell to another, I would yell obscenities at the guards to try to help the morale of my fellow prisoners who might be listening. We were not allowed to communicate with each other. And so some of those obscenities were printed in this excerpt and in the book. And my mother called, and so I answered the phone. She said, Johnny. I said, yes, Mother? She said, I just read the excerpts from your book in the magazine. I said, well, what'd you think? And she said, well, I'm coming over there and wash your mouth out with soap. I said, Mom, these were bad people; they were hurting me and my friends; they were very bad people. She said, that's no excuse; under no circumstances did I ever teach you to use language like that (laughter). GROSS: So what's the moral of that story in your mind? MCCAIN: The moral of story is you should always pay attention to your mother. And certainly, never write something that she might read that you might not want her to. GROSS: Yeah. But obviously, she was wrong because there is a place for obscenity. And that would be the place for it - is when you're... MCCAIN: I think so. GROSS: ...People are carrying you away to torture you. MCCAIN: (Laughter). GROSS: That would be the place for obscenity. MCCAIN: But, you know, my mom is - again, she grew up in an age where ladies and gentlemen never use that kind of language anywhere (laughter), as she said, under any circumstances. But she's a wonderful woman. She drives herself everywhere. She drove herself cross-country last Christmas, and I had to alert the local law enforcement agencies along the way. GROSS: (Laughter). MCCAIN: But she's in great shape. And she pays very close attention to my activities, watches my appearances on television and radio. And in Washington, quite often, I take her to various functions that I go to, and she's always the hit of the evening. GROSS: Well, your book is called \"Character Is Destiny.\" And of course one of the things that formed your character was being a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years in Vietnam. And you have introduced an amendment to the defense appropriation bill. This would prohibit cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment in the U.S. interrogations that happen outside of the U.S. Would you explain what you see is the need for this bill? MCCAIN: Well, first, I got to mention about my character being formed by being in prison. I don't think my character was formed in prison. I think it was formed before that. But what I think it made me realize, very frankly, in prison that I was dependent on others. It was my friends and comrades that picked me up when I was down and literally saved my life. And I mean, I always thought that I would be able to do everything for myself, and I found that I was very much dependent upon my comrades, who were my source of strength, and in a couple of cases, a couple of guys that took care of me when I was first prisoner, and they literally saved my life. We have a very bad image problem in the world - some of it deserved, some of it undeserved - that we are mistreating, torturing, treating inhumanely or cruelly people that we hold captive. In Abu Ghraib, pictures were shown on Al Jazeera, as we all know, 24/7. And it hurt us in our efforts in Iraq, and it hurts us around the world. Any information that can be gained by torture is, one, not reliable. Two, torture is not effective. And three, if I could sum up - there's a great hero of mine. His name is General Jack Vessey. A lot of Americans may not remember him. He was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got a battlefield commission. He was a private at the landing at Salerno in Italy and fought in many wars. He served in the Army for 46 years. And I saw him recently out in Minnesota at a dinner that benefited Iraqi veterans and their families. And he - I said, General, what do you think about this issue? And he said, any information that could be gained as a result of cruel, inhumane or - treatment or torture could never counterbalance the damage that is done to the United States of America when we do these things. And I think he put it as well as any anybody I've ever heard. GROSS: Now, you've said that when you were tortured in North Vietnam, that - you named names. You named the names of ball players. MCCAIN: Yeah, the starting lineup of the Green Bay Packers, yup. GROSS: So did that stop the torture? I mean, you gave them names that were totally inappropriate... MCCAIN: Mainly, what... GROSS: ...Names for what they were looking for. But did that... MCCAIN: For a while. For a while, yeah. But mainly, what they wanted is what you can get out of torture. Mainly, what they wanted was to get war crimes, confessions, statements criticizing your country, those kinds of things. It all started, really, as a science back in the Bolshevik days when they would have the show trials where these people would literally condemn themselves to death in Soviet Russia and confess to crimes that they couldn't possibly have committed because they'd been tortured to the point where they'd do anything to relieve the pain. You see my point? And by the way, there is one case published in the media that a al-Qaida individual was captured and gave information about weapons of mass destruction, which found itself into speeches given by the administration, and I think the president. It turned out later on, the guy recanted. You see? So it's not that useful. And psychological methodology is far more effective. The Israelis have been prohibited from using torture by their Supreme Court. They use psychological methods. GROSS: So you don't trust the information that is extracted under torture. You didn't give... MCCAIN: I don't trust it. GROSS: ...Accurate information, and you don't trust... MCCAIN: No, I don't. GROSS: ...Others would. MCCAIN: No, I don't. GROSS: One of the practices that is being examined here is waterboarding in which the interrogator basically pours water into the nose and mouth of the person being interrogated, and that person thinks that they are drowning. Although they will be... MCCAIN: Yeah. GROSS: ...Rescued from drowning by the interrogator, the person being interrogated doesn't know that. You've said that anything that makes it seem like you are on the verge of getting executed is torture. Do you know that from experience? Were you in that position? MCCAIN: No. I was never - that never happened to me. But I know of enough cases where people have believed that they were going to be killed or executed. That is - has tremendous - any person who is well-versed in the mental impacts of something like that will tell you how damaging that can be. As I said, most people - a beating is far, far preferable than a mock execution. GROSS: I just heard a hum in the background. Is that a plane going by? MCCAIN: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes. MCCAIN: Yes. Yes. GROSS: Oh, OK. Great. I'll just wait until it goes (laughter). MCCAIN: OK. GROSS: It's going real slowly, isn't it? MCCAIN: It may be a helicopter coming - a black helicopter coming to assassinate me because... GROSS: (Laughter). MCCAIN: That way we can keep - as a dedicated watcher of \"24,\" you never know what can happen... GROSS: (Laughter). MCCAIN: ...Because, see, they could kill two birds with one stone by wiping out a public - National Public Radio as well as a political enemy, you see? So they - it'll be hard to resist this target. GROSS: This is a dark plot, indeed. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: I think we are nearly safe now. That plane sounds in the distance (laughter). MCCAIN: All right. Whew. Thank God. GROSS: Now, since we've been talking a little bit about, you know, your experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and how that applies to your thoughts about torture, there's another Vietnam question I'd like to ask you. The National Security Agency recently released hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents on the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident. And this was the incident in which we were told that the North Vietnamese fired on our boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. And as a result of this, President Johnson authorized airstrikes, and Congress passed a resolution authorizing military action based on the Gulf of Tonkin. Now, these new documents that were released show that we weren't - our boats really weren't fired on. The Gulf of Tonkin incident never really happened, but information was distorted to make it seem as if it did. As a veteran, what's your reaction to this? MCCAIN: Well, we've known for a long time that there were questions about the Gulf of Tonkin \"incident,\" unquote. And the more important aspect of this, Terry, is that the firing - suppose that it did happen. The - still, is that enough rationale to escalate the conflict to the point where there's 500,000 people there and a full-scale military engagement with 58,000 killed, without Congress revisiting the issue? It seems to me that what you really saw was Congress not playing the role that it's constitutionally appointed to do. You see what I mean? GROSS: So you think that whether the Gulf of Tonkin happened or not, Congress should have revisited the issue, and that's the larger problem. MCCAIN: Oh, absolutely, particularly when we went from an escalation, a dramatic escalation - remember; when the Gulf of Tonkin incident took place, there was a relatively small number of American troops on the ground in Vietnam. And it dramatically escalated and - as did the conflict. Congress should have revisited it on numerous occasions, in my view. GROSS: Revisited it and pulled our troops out? Revisited it and ended the war? MCCAIN: At least made decisions whether to remain there, whether to accept an escalation, whether it was in our national security interests to continue the conflict. They basically took a pass and let the executive branch - until after the Tet Offensive, basically the administration had a relatively free hand in conducting the conflict. GROSS: Senator McCain, you supported the invasion of Iraq, and now you support sending in more troops and say to pull out now would likely lead to full-scale civil war. You've criticized Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for not having enough troops when we invaded Iraq. Do you hold him responsible for any other things that you consider to have been misjudgments in how the war has been executed? MCCAIN: A number of misjudgments. When the looting started and they failed to put that down with whatever it took, created an environment of chaos and insecurity for the people of Iraq. When we vastly underestimated the challenge of this growing insurgency. There was a period of time, Terry, when things were pretty quiet in Iraq. And we had a window of opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure and address some of the problems that faced the country, and they didn't do it. The administration in Baghdad was poorly done. As you remember, there was - General Garner was there, and he was out, and then Bremer came in. Mr. Wolfowitz said that we would pay for the war in Iraq with Iraqi oil revenues. When the first insurgents - oh, when the looting started, Secretary Rumsfeld said, stuff happens. And then when the insurgency started, he said there was a few dead-enders. The reason why I mention that, there was a gross mis - underestimation of the challenge we faced in the post-conflict aspect of Iraq. GROSS: We're listening to the interview I recorded with Senator John McCain in 2005. We'll hear more of that interview after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WESTERLIES' \"PLEASE KEEP THAT TRAIN AWAY FROM MY DOOR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded with Senator John McCain in 2005. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: Your new book, \"Character Is Destiny,\" is about people who you consider to be inspirational, to be role models, including Mother Teresa. And you have a daughter that you adopted from an orphanage that I think was run by Mother Teresa. Am I right about that? MCCAIN: Yes, yes, it was her group of nuns that ran a orphanage in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Yes, that's where my wife was visiting with a medical team. And Bridget was there. And she had a very severe cleft palate. And we were very pleased to have the opportunity and the blessing to bring her home and be part of our family. GROSS: When you were running for - in the presidential primary in 2000, there was - and I think it's fair to call it - a smear campaign against you which used your daughter. It was like a whisper campaign saying that your daughter was actually a daughter that you had fathered with a black prostitute. MCCAIN: Mmm hmm. That's a - yes. GROSS: How did this whisper campaign work? Like, how do these kinds... MCCAIN: I don't.. GROSS: ...Of rumors travel? MCCAIN: I don't know because I've never engaged in anything like that. We knew that that was out there. And it was very painful for us of course. GROSS: And also in these whisper campaigns are that you are mentally unstable because of your POW experiences and that your wife was an addict. How do you fight against things like that when no one is taking credit for saying it? And it's all - my understanding is it's like phone calls that come across on, like, two-way talk radio... MCCAIN: Mmm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. GROSS: ...And like, little handouts that are anonymously placed on cars in parking lots. And it's hard to trace back to an individual. MCCAIN: Well, it's very tough, and it was very difficult. But I would also point out that one of the major reasons why we lost in South Carolina was not because of that as much as it was that the entire Republican establishment supported President Bush, then Governor Bush, and were behind him. And he had a great deal more money to spend than we did. And they were better organized than we were in many respects. So - look; I didn't like, Terry, the things that happened. But for me to look back in anger over something that happened back five years ago is not appropriate. I want to move forward. I want to put it behind me. And I want to serve the people of Arizona in the Senate. I think it's wrong to hold a grudge in American politics. GROSS: Well, I wanted to ask you about it because it may be symptomatic of a larger problem in politics today, which is the smear campaign. You know, when you're smeared from somebody in the other party, you maybe expect it a little bit more. But when it's happening from your own party in a primary, is it more surprising, and does it make it more difficult to feel really united with your party when you know people within that party have lied about you in such a really destructive way? MCCAIN: Well, I've found in my experience probably the most bitter campaigns are primaries within the party because, you know, there's not - sometimes not much of a philosophical difference, so they get into other things. So primaries are usually pretty bloody and bitter and sometimes more so than a general election. But the other thing about it is, Terry, politics is not beanbag. And... GROSS: It's not what? MCCAIN: ...It gets tough. It's not beanbag. GROSS: Oh, oh. MCCAIN: And it's tough. And it's difficult. But I think that what you really need to look at is the - you know, the campaign that you waged. Overall, with some mistakes and some excesses, I'm very proud of the campaign that we ran. And I'm proud when I look back on it, the people that supported us and the people that rallied to us and the - you know, I'm very proud of the job that we did. And for me to be angry five years later and say this person did this or that person, you know, they did this - look; Americans want us to move on. And I was just re-elected to the Senate in the last election in 2004. I campaigned for the people of Arizona. So let me represent you and your interests and your values and your ambitions, not look back in anger at something that happened in a primary in South Carolina. Not only do I not hold a grudge, as you know, I campaigned very vigorously for the re-election of President Bush. And I was glad to do so. GROSS: Again, I was asking not because you're... MCCAIN: Sure. GROSS: ...Holding a grudge... MCCAIN: Sure. GROSS: ...But because... MCCAIN: Yeah. GROSS: ...You know, your campaign isn't the only campaign that this kind of thing has happened in. And I'm wondering if you think that there's something that can be done to stop those kind... MCCAIN: Well... GROSS: ...Of smears. And I'm wondering, too, if you consider the Swift boat campaign against John Kerry similar in fashion to the smear campaign against you, or if you consider that to be, you know, a different animal altogether. MCCAIN: Well, I think it was different in many respects because this was a paid-for ad campaign. What happened to us was all sort of under-the-radar kind of thing. In the campaign you're talking about in South Carolina, I think that the media can play a more instructive role. Maybe if the media had exposed some of this stuff more widely, we could have done a better job. And maybe we should have done a better job in exposing it. In the Swift boat campaign, I immediately condemned the attacks on John Kerry's combat record. I said it was dishonest and dishonorable to question his performance for this nation in combat. Now, any time before or after his role in combat, then I think it's relatively fair game. But, no, I did not approve of the attacks on John Kerry's combat record because he served honorably in Vietnam just as President Bush, in my view, served honorably in the National Guard. GROSS: Senator John McCain recorded in 2005. After we take a short break, we'll hear the interview I recorded with him in 2000 shortly after he lost the Republican presidential primary to George W. Bush. His family memoir, \"Faith Of My Fathers,\" had just been published in paperback. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're remembering Senator John McCain. The first time I spoke with him was in 2000 after his family memoir, \"Faith Of My Fathers,\" was published in paperback. McCain's father and grandfather were naval commanders. His father was commander in chief of the Pacific forces during the war in Vietnam. John McCain served as a naval aviator in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years. We spoke just a few weeks after he'd lost the 2000 Republican presidential primary to George W. Bush. He told me that in spite of losing that primary in 2000, the opportunity to run for the Republican nomination was at that point the greatest experience of his life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCCAIN: It's a rare and wonderful experience and one that I'll always treasure and not look back either in - with anger or remorse because of the fact that I was a loser. I was able - we were able to motivate millions of young Americans to be involved in politics again and - for example, in the Michigan primary, 300,000 voters who voted had never voted in their lives. And so I'm grateful for the experience. I learned that Americans are very patriotic. I learned that Americans want to serve the country. I learned that there is great cynicism out there and even alienation on the part of young people as to whether they are really well-represented anymore in Washington, D.C. And they - although they don't know the specifics of campaign finance reform - most of them never heard of McCain-Feingold - there is a cynicism out there that they are no longer represented in the special interests due. And there's a desire for overall reform - reform the tax code, reform of education, reform of the military, reform of health care. And if properly called, Americans will respond in - I believe in a most patriotic fashion. GROSS: Perhaps the most controversial statements you made during the primary had to do with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell when you called them evil and agents of intolerance. You said, we are the party of Ronald Reagan, not Pat Robertson. Didn't Robertson and Falwell become big political powers because of their affiliation with Ronald Reagan? MCCAIN: I believe what I said - we're the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. And what I meant by that was that we're a party of inclusion and not exclusion; we're a party of addition and not division; and that I believe that Reverend Robertson was leading our party in a way that made us exclusionary and frankly would doom us to a minority status. And I couldn't articulate my vision for the future of the party without saying I reject that kind of leadership of our party. What I think that Ronald Reagan did was both in demeanor and in action say, come on in; there is room for everybody in our party. That's how they were able to get the so-called blue-collar Democrats, the Reagan Democrats to come to our side and elect him and re-elect him by overwhelming margins. I don't think that Ronald Reagan ever sent a message of exclusion. Finally, there's room in our party for the religious right, but the religious right in my view - and the majority of them are good, hard-working families who are wonderful people. But we have to reject people like Reverend Robertson who say that there's not room in our party for those who disagree on specific issues. GROSS: In this election, the issue of abortion isn't being discussed nearly as much as it has been in recent previous presidential campaigns. You've described yourself as pro-life. In your political agenda, how would you rate the importance of, say, abortion compared to, say, campaign finance reform? Where do you see abortion fitting in? MCCAIN: I think it's an incredibly important issue because it has to do with one's fundamental beliefs. I mean, there's nothing more important than your fundamental belief. And that obviously has to do with my view that life begins at conception. But I also think that there is some areas that perhaps the Democrats don't want to get into as heavily in the past such as partial-birth abortion. I think partial-birth abortion is terrible, and a majority of Americans do. Medical technology is advancing so that earlier and earlier we are proving that there is a life there because children are born earlier and earlier and kept alive. And so I think there's some - a lack of leverage on the issue on - from the Democrat's side that perhaps they enjoyed in previous elections. I also think that some of us feel also that when you're getting into basic, fundamental moral beliefs, it gets a little complicated because you have to respect the views of others even if they are, you know, very strong differences. And what I would have - and counseled, and it was rejected - I would have had a preamble to our platform saying, look; we are a pro-life party. That is a basic tenet of the Republican Party. But we do not reject the participation of anyone who - just because they disagree on this or any other specific issue as important as that issue might be. You see my point? GROSS: Yeah. You're arguing that even people who disagree with that should be upstanding members of the party. But I'm wondering... MCCAIN: Absolutely. GROSS: I'm not sure I've heard you discuss how, in your own mind you weigh a woman's ability to control her reproductive destiny against your belief that, you know, life begins at conception. MCCAIN: Well, I believe that the process should be that Roe v. Wade be overturned. That would not change very much because it would then return the issue to the states. That's when those like me who believe in the sanctity of the unborn begin then the great debate to convince the hearts and minds of people that abortion is wrong. That is - the whole battleground is to have a debate and discussion respecting the views of others but trying to convince people that it is wrong. But just simply overturning Roe v. Wade would just, as I said, return it to the states. Then we need a great national debate. And then the woman's right to, quote, \"choose\" should be balanced obviously against a - the viability of a human life. And I'd be eager to enter into that debate with the pro-choice people with respect. GROSS: We're listening back to the interview I recorded with Senator John McCain in 2000. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WESTERLIES' \"PLEASE KEEP THAT TRAIN AWAY FROM MY DOOR\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded with Senator John McCain in 2000. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: You said that you were the only person in your high school that you knew of who was expected to go into the military. Both of your fathers were naval commanders. Your father was the commander in chief in the Pacific during part of the Vietnam War. Do you think you would have gone into the military if you weren't expected to, if it wasn't part of the family tradition? MCCAIN: You know, I don't know, Terry, because one of the aspects of my life which, being a child of the '50s, that I was expected - it was just sort of a natural evolutionary thing that I was going to be - go to the Naval Academy and be in the Navy. And that was partially what I rebelled against either consciously or subconsciously by being such a ne'er-do-well at the Naval Academy. I'm sure there were some regulations that I didn't break while I was at the Naval Academy but not many. And so one thing I've tried to focus with my own children is obviously encourage them to do well but not in any way exhibit any pressure towards a military career. And I hope that one of them chooses it. But I hope it would be out of their own desire rather than the pressures that - look; I love my parents, but it was sort of a thing that was kind of expected in those days. And obviously I'd like to have my children be - make more of a choice on their own initiative rather than what they might think I would want them to do. GROSS: You really disliked how Washington conducted the war in Vietnam. You felt that they didn't fight hard enough, that the war could have been won and could have been won in a timely fashion. And you say that most of the people you knew - well, maybe - am I going too far there? You... MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah, I think so, Terry. GROSS: Yeah. MCCAIN: Let me explain... GROSS: Thank you. MCCAIN: ...Very quickly. I think that - look; we had a decision to make early on in 1964 perhaps at the latest that we were either going to do whatever is necessary to win or don't go into the conflict at all. I could argue with you that it would have been probably a smart thing not to go in given the risk of Chinese and Russian intervention, that we couldn't win without, you know, full-scale operations which perhaps the American people wouldn't have supported, et cetera, et cetera. But the worst way to approach the conflict is to do it in half measures which frankly people like Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, who were over there as junior officers and leaders and platoon commanders and air and squadron commanders, understood that we couldn't do that again. And that was reflected in the conduct of Operation Desert Storm. So I'm very ambivalent about the Vietnam War. Sure, I wanted us to win. Sure, I'm sorry that millions were sent to re-education camps and thousands executed and others who had (unintelligible) by - you know, by taking boats. But at the same time, you can't go into these conflicts without understanding the nature of the enemy, which we did not, and are devoted to really taking risks in order to ensure victory. And my complaint about the Vietnam War was the strategy and tactics employed as - more than anything else, which were doomed - doomed us to failure. GROSS: And - but to sum up, you are very critical about how Washington conducted the war, how the politicians were managing... MCCAIN: Yes. GROSS: ...The war. MCCAIN: Yes. GROSS: Did... MCCAIN: And I was critical also of some of the military leaders early on who knew that the war - that there's no way we could win with that strategy and should have stood up and said, I quit; I resign. GROSS: Did the war shake your faith in politics? You ended up going into politics, but you must have been pretty cynical about it during the war. MCCAIN: No, I was cynical about employing a strategy which even junior officers such as I recognized were - was not a viable one. And I grieve and mourn to this day the loss - unnecessary loss of young American lives. That's the real tragedy of the Vietnam War, is those names that are etched in black granite down on the Mall. But my motivation to enter politics - one of them was to make sure that we learned those lessons and embarked on a healing process between the American people and the veterans who served, including our former enemies, the Vietnamese. So my motivation was a positive one rather than one of disillusionment. GROSS: Did you, after returning to the United States, ever have any doubts about the war and whether it should have been fought? MCCAIN: My doubts were significant. I read and studied for literally a year everything I could get my hands on about Vietnam. I wanted to know what it was that caused me to spend several years over there. I went all the way back to the French occupation of then-Indochina and all those things. And I learned a lot. And again, I learned that the Vietnamese were to a large degree nationalists, that there was a significant disconnect between what was going on on the ground and what was believed in Washington. Look; Jack Kennedy at his inauguration said, America will go anywhere and bear any burden in defense of freedom. And there was the belief in both Kennedy and Johnson and Nixon administration that if Vietnam fell - the domino theory - all of Asia would fall, et cetera, et cetera. Well, clearly that was not the case. And in fact, Nixon's trip to China during the Vietnam War was an interesting scenario. But - so I believe that the point is that if we ever send our young people into conflict, we have to have clear-cut goals. We have to have a clear strategy for victory and recognize that if the American people don't support that conflict, then inevitably, you are bound to fail. And that's why I admire former President Bush's ability to marshal American public opinion prior to our military engagement in the Persian Gulf War. GROSS: If you had done all the reading that you did after you returned home before you went to Vietnam, would you have still wanted to go? MCCAIN: (Laughter) That's a very interesting question. I think I would have - I'm sure I would have gone because I was a career military officer. But I certainly would have had a lot more questions. But very frankly, I don't know who would've answered them (laughter). But I - that's a - that question has never been asked of me before, Terry, but I think that I would have had significant questions. But I'm - I believe as a career military officer, I still would have gone. GROSS: Questions or doubts? MCCAIN: Well, I would've had concerns. Look; we had doubts on board the ship. I'll never forget one time I had - was assigned a target that came from - directly from the basement of the White House that had been bombed 37 times before. A hundred yards down the road was a bridge that was not on the target list that, clearly, the trucks were going over. We all remember watching, in the port of Hai Phong, the Russian ships come in, offload the missiles, the missiles trucked up, put into place, and then being fired at us. And we couldn't do anything to stop that from happening. It was - some of it was so insane, it was almost ludicrous. And so we could see, those of us who were in combat, how crazy the tactics were and how they really were not hurting the Vietnamese. The only time the North Vietnamese got hurt was the Christmas bombing of 1972 when we virtually paralyzed them with B-52 bombing. GROSS: You used to be, I guess, more of what you might describe as, like, a good-time guy. You liked to drink, you liked to have a good time, didn't pay that much attention to your studies, as we established. Do you feel like you're still capable of really having a good time? Or has, like, the whole POW experience, which happened, I know, a long time ago - but has that still at all affected your ability to relax or to enjoy yourself or, you know, experience pleasure? Because I know for some people that really does affect the ability to experience pleasure. MCCAIN: I enjoy every moment of my life. I enjoy every sunrise and every sunset. I enjoy and love the beauty of the state that I represent. The - my experiences have made me so appreciative of the opportunities that I've been given and the life that I've been able to lead. I enjoy every, every day, and I look forward to getting up. Do I relax? I have a high energy level, and so I get restless. And I read. And I try to hike and get some exercise in and that kind of stuff. And I, you know, work late and get up early, but that's not because I don't - haven't got the ability to enjoy myself. I always have this kind of a feeling deep down that I want to seize the moment and do whatever I can while I have the opportunity to do it. GROSS: John McCain, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. Thank you for your time. MCCAIN: Thank you, Terry. And thank you for some very tough and interesting questions. GROSS: Senator John McCain, recorded in 2000. His memorial service will be held Saturday at the National Cathedral one week after his death. We're going to take a short break here. Then our rock critic Ken Tucker will review a new album featuring country music stars performing songs written by Roger Miller. This is FRESH AIR.

            "article_content": "President Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates on Wednesday in Estero, Fla.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates on Wednesday in Estero, Fla. The last few weeks of any election are all about leaving one last impression with voters \u2014 a reminder of where a candidate stands and what he or she believes. This year in particular, the only closing argument that matters for Republicans is where they stand on President Trump. Midterm elections usually are about the president to some degree, but 2018 is shaping up to be a nationwide rehashing of 2016's political feuds. Trump said so himself in a recent rally in Mississippi. \"I'm not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket,\" Trump said. \"Because this is also a referendum about me and the disgusting gridlock that they'll put this country through.\" Trump is right. Every Republican on the ballot will be judged on Trump's record, but the way candidates handle that reality really depends on where they're running. By and large, Republicans spent the primaries reminding their core voters just how close they were to the president. They listed laws he signed that once bore their name. Many shared photos of a smiling handshake in the Oval Office with the president or a video of their meeting in a White House conference room. But by the time the general election rolled around, Republicans in competitive races had to shift their message and decide just how closely they could embrace the president and still appeal to critical moderate and independent voters. The NPR Politics team fanned out across the country in the final weeks before the election talking to candidates as they made their final pitches. We visited a dozen states, talking to Republicans running statewide for Senate and governor and in congressional districts that covered farmland, the suburbs and cities. We discovered that Republicans have found four ways to run in a midterm election that is all about Trump. Here are some examples of candidates who used the different approaches. Trump's most ardent supporters can mostly be found running for the Senate, governor and in safe GOP congressional districts. Candidates for offices in tightly contested Senate races in Republican-leaning states like Indiana, Montana, Arizona and West Virginia have all shared rally stages with Trump in the closing weeks of the election. In each case, their remarks follow a similar pattern. The candidate stands next to Trump to remind voters that a vote for him or her is a vote for the president's agenda. Montana Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale shared the stage with Trump twice this year, including an appearance in October where he made a familiar pitch: A vote for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is a vote against the president. \"You are making America great again. And if we want to keep America great, then we need everyone here to get out and vote,\" Rosendale said, addressing Trump. \"President Trump and all of his policies are on the line. So let's make history and retire Jon Tester and send President Trump the help he needs.\" A far smaller number of House candidates in competitive districts have been willing to be so explicit. Mark Harris in North Carolina is one of the exceptions. He is running in a district that includes Charlotte and is betting on Trump despite the rapidly changing demographics in the area. Younger, more diverse voters are flooding to high-tech and professional jobs in the city, and Democrats are growing more confident about their chances. But Harris welcomed Trump for a rally there last week and heaped on praise and also cited the president's favorite news source for an assessment of his performance \u2014 Fox News. \"The only things that haven't gotten done yet, we're going to do it in 2019 when the Congress convenes,\" Harris said. \"Mr. President, I want to join you and let's get the job done.\" Two years ago, in the final days of the 2016 presidential election, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller said he was \"100 percent against Clinton, 99 percent against Trump.\" In the closing stretch of a close campaign for re-election, though, Heller is not only sharing the stage with Trump at campaign rallies but showering the president with praise like \"Everything you touch turns to gold.\" Heller's shift from critic to close ally mirrors a journey \u2014 part change of heart, part political calculation \u2014 that many Republicans have made in the past two years. His could be the most dramatic about-face, however. \"I didn't like him; he didn't like me,\" Trump acknowledged at a recent rally for Heller. \"Then we started to like each other. Then, we started to love each other.\" Heller frames the shift as the natural result of a productive relationship. He touts Republican results like tax cuts and increased funding for veterans, saying, \"When you have success it builds trust; when you have trust it builds friendships.\" But while migrating toward Trump has been rewarded by GOP voters in primary after primary, it's unclear how a calculation like Heller's will play in a general election in an evenly divided state like Nevada, where independent voters will play a key role. Heller's opponent, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, is framing the shift as a flip-flop, painting Heller as \"Senator Spineless\" in ads like this one and focusing especially on Heller's shift from a \"No\" to a \"Yes\" during the Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If Heller and Trump's \"love\" leads to an Election Day loss, expect other Republicans who have made similar migrations to take note. When Trump floated the idea of trying to overturn the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship through an executive order earlier this week, Utah Rep. Mia Love was quick to put out a statement opposing the trial balloon. The response fits with the approach Love has taken in an unexpectedly close re-election campaign against Democrat Ben McAdams in her suburban Salt Lake City district. While Love by and large toes the Republican line on most issues and votes, and is quick to highlight Republican accomplishments like last year's major tax overhaul, she also repeatedly highlights the times she has disagreed with Trump, especially on immigration. Love called Trump's policy of separating parents and children who enter the country illegally \"absolutely horrific.\" She blasted his Oval Office comments about \"shithole\" countries as \"unkind, divisive [and] elitist.\" In short, Love is quick to keep Trump at arm's length any time he is controversial, but also quick to embrace the conservative measures and actions the Trump administration has advocated for. That approach reflects many Utah Republicans' continued uneasiness about Trump's approach, tone and personality but preference for most of his policies. \"I'm the only one in this delegation who has stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and have worked with him when he's done something right,\" she proclaimed during a recent debate. The key question: whether occasional statements of disapproval are enough to satisfy voters who are looking for a congressional check on Trump's instincts. There aren't many Republicans willing to reject the president completely, but Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo has not been shy about going his own way. Curbelo refused to endorse Trump in 2016 and has publicly opposed the president on climate change, trade and most famously on immigration. Earlier this week he directly criticized Trump's purported plan to end the practice of automatically granting citizenship to all children born in the United States. Birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution, so no @realDonaldTrump you can\u2019t end it by executive order. What we really need is broad immigration reform that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants. https://t.co/7xlbfrt6rW He led a group of moderate House Republicans in a rebellion against party leaders to try to force a vote on an immigration bill to provide permanent legal protections for immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought to the United States as children. Immigration is a key issue in his district, which stretches from the suburbs of Miami south through farm fields and on to the tourist hub of Key West. About 70 percent of the population is Hispanic. Roughly half of the Latinos in his district are of Cuban descent. Curbelo, the son of Cuban exiles, gets a warm welcome from a lot of voters because of that connection. He slips seamlessly between Spanish and English when talking to constituents and virtually never mentions Trump by name. Instead, Curbelo talks about his bipartisan record and openly refuses to back down from his criticism of the president. \"I don't remember ever apologizing for anything I've said,\" Curbelo said in a recent interview with NPR. \"Whatever I've said is what I believe. So why would I walk it back, you know?\"",

            "article_content": "In the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings, Pieter Hanson's mother took to Twitter. In a viral tweet, she claimed that he wouldn't go on solo dates with women because of \"the current climate of false sexual accusations by radical feminists with an axe to grind.\" She then ended the tweet with #HimToo, a hashtag that gained popularity over the weekend among those who believe that men such as Brett Kavanaugh are victims of false accusations. since she deleted it here\u2019s a screenshot. one of the greatest posts of all time pic.twitter.com/Z6TUKOjH9T There was just one issue: Her son didn't agree with the #HimToo movement. The Internet exploded with support for Hanson after he rebuked his mother's tweet in a post of his own. In the countertweet, he wrote, \"I respect and #BelieveWomen\" and added that his mother had been misguided. That was my Mom. Sometimes the people we love do things that hurt us without realizing it. Let\u2019s turn this around. I respect and #BelieveWomen . I never have and never will support  #HimToo . I\u2019m a proud Navy vet, Cat Dad and Ally. Also, Twitter, your meme game is on point. pic.twitter.com/yZFkEjyB6L The hashtag #HimToo also exploded, on both the left and the right sides of the political Twittersphere. Now, both sides are battling to control the narrative surrounding sexual abuse allegations using the same hashtag. #HimToo is just the latest trend in the social media political battle, but it illustrates how the meaning of a single hashtag can be twisted to control the narrative. The history of #HimToo Long before Pieter Hanson charmed the Internet, #HimToo had a rich history of use along both party lines. It was first used before the 2016 presidential election in conjunction with the #I'mWithHer rallying cry of Clinton supporters to also express support for Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine. Then, #HimToo was picked up by Trump supporters. Along with cries of #LockHerUp came #HimToo in reference to those surrounding Hillary Clinton, such as Barack Obama. #MeToo and #HimToo However, when the #MeToo movement started last year, #HimToo took on a new meaning, relating not just to politics but to sexual assault experiences as well. Some used the hashtag as a way to deliberately point out male victims of sexual assault and abuse or share their stories. Other #MeToo activists used the hashtag as a way to point out bad behaviors of men and hold them accountable. Cosby is finally found guilty. Makes me have hope that another TV celebrity will be held accountable!!!#HimToo #cosbysguilty #trumpsguilty Author Christopher Golden cites #MeToo as the direct reason for his own 2017 #HimToo Facebook post in which he admits fault in some of his past behavior toward women. \"It seemed to me that there's no solution to the problem without the participation of men, the acceptance that most men have behaved badly toward women at some point in their lives,\" he said.  \"I wanted men to actually talk about their personal behavior toward women.\" It seemed to me that there's no solution to the problem without the participation of men, the acceptance that most men have behaved badly toward women at some point in their lives. Christopher Golden, author How the Kavanaugh hearings popularized #HimToo #HimToo enjoyed modest usage on the Internet, going relatively unnoticed next to more popular, recognizable hashtags, until the Kavanaugh hearings kicked off last week. In the latest revival and reuse of the hashtag, it's the men who are victims. Supporters of Kavanaugh started posting #HimToo to paint him as a victim of false allegations and used the hashtag to point out the larger problem of innocent men being accused of sexual crimes they didn't commit in the age of #MeToo. One #HimToo supporter, Joe Chadwick, from Clearwater, Minn., told NPR he promotes #HimToo not as an attempt to discredit Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, but as a way to point out the need for fairness in sexual assault hearings. Kavanaugh is a victim, Chadwick said, because of the way in which he was treated as guilty from the get-go. \"I'm not really sure there's a middle ground,\" he said. \"That's the way our legal system works \u2014 innocent until proven guilty. I'd rather have one guilty guy go free than one innocent man be locked up. There has to be a presumption of innocence. It doesn't mean you don't believe the accuser or that she's lying about it; it just means that without corroborative evidence, the benefit of the doubt goes to the accused.\" He called today's climate for men an age of \"sexual McCarthyism\" in which women seem to be given the monopoly on morality and trustworthiness. Kaya Jones, a singer from Los Angeles who has also been a victim of abuse, agrees that women should not automatically be believed. In terms of the Kavanaugh hearings, she was undecided about whether Ford was telling the truth. \"We don't know because she didn't use the appropriate avenues for redress,\" Jones said. \"I'm a firm believer in speaking out. But you cannot ruin someone's life on an 'if'; be certain or don't [make] any accusations.\" #himtoo I believe #Kavanaugh \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/bLMYGeSP7n In the end, Jones posted in support of Kavanaugh because she felt that Ford had turned into a political pawn for those who opposed his nomination to the Supreme Court. #MeToo allows false claims The #HimToo movement in support of Kavanaugh has been, in some ways, the antithesis to #MeToo and #BelieveHer. Kaitlin Bennett, a conservative activist from Ohio who posted about #HimToo, believes #MeToo has had unfortunate side effects. \"#MeToo gave way to allow women to come out and make false claims,\" she said. \"This stuff does ruin people's lives. I think the #HimToo is reminding people that while women have been so propped up in media and that's important, we also can forget about the men who are falsely accused.\" Sometimes the women are aggressors. They go into situations with powerful men and they're the ones instigating the problem; they'll intentionally dress sexual. It's men's turn to speak up. Kimberly Meyer, #HimToo supporter Another #HimToo supporter, Kimberly Meyer of Barrington, Ill., said that she believes #MeToo is overrated and obscures instances in which women behave badly. \"Sometimes the women are aggressors. They go into situations with powerful men and they're the ones instigating the problem; they'll intentionally dress sexual,\" she said. \"It's men's turn to speak up.\" #HimToo rally Men who support the #HimToo movement will have a chance to speak up in person at an upcoming rally in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 17. The rally is being organized by Portland resident Haley Adams and will feature different conservative speakers. Adams firmly believes that #HimToo is not in opposition to #MeToo but rather seeks to support men as well as women. \"Men too can be abused; men too can be lied about. #HimToo has nothing to do with politics, it's about supporting men too,\" she said. \"There's a war on men.  Men are at risk today. I would not want to be a male today because of what's going on. They're being falsely accused, slandered, attacked and harassed at their homes.\" She cited Kavanaugh as an example, saying that his hearing was part of her inspiration for organizing the rally. Mocking #HimToo It wasn't long, however, before the trolls came out to play. #MeToo activists on the left saw the viral tweet of Pieter Hanson's mother and soon began to mock #HimToo with humorous versions of her original post. Liberal activist Molly Jong-Fast of New York City was among the first \u2014 and loudest \u2014 trollers, posting numerous iterations of #HimToo mock tweets, such as ones that used photos of Donald Trump Jr. For Jong-Fast, these types of tweets are her way of fighting against what she calls \"misinformation\" and reclaiming the narrative. \"The #HimToo hashtag is a larger way for Republicans to change the narrative, take the attention, and make it about white male oppression. It's Tucker Carlsonism as a hashtag,\" she said. \"We're often sort of fighting against these larger talking points.\" She said she felt that the #HimToo hashtag came across as entitled. Her decision to use Donald Trump Jr. as the photo for her mock tweets comes from Trump Jr.'s past appropriation of #MeToo into joke posts. Qasim Rashid, of Washington D.C., also felt that #HimToo attempted to take attention away from women and survivors. He said he had never felt at risk of being falsely accused and that the bigger issue is sexual abuse against both men and women. \"It's not hard not to be at risk,\" he said. \"I was raised in an environment to treat all people with respect and not do anything without consent.\" For some of the joke posters, the humor was not only used to disarm opposing arguments but also to help process their own anger and sadness following the Kavanaugh hearings. Charlotte Clymer, of Washington D.C., said she was filled with rage after seeing the way the Kavanaugh hearings were handled. As a survivor herself, her takeaway from the hearings was that boys and men are held to a lower standard, while survivors are often silenced, targeted and shamed, she said. \"It was a s***** experience,\" she said. \"Laughter is the best medicine and I think all of us felt a bit better laughing about all of it.\" This is MY son. Blends in really well in any situation. Seems lost in prayer, very spiritual. Only has one ear and it's under his belly, which seems appropriate for a male. Will never go on a solo date so as not to be decapitated and devoured after sex. I VOTE.#HimToo pic.twitter.com/XD4Wkgxh5P She also said that she enjoyed Hanson's response to his mother's tweet, calling it the best part of her week. \"Last night was a momentary reprieve from the pain, but it doesn't fix anything,\" she said. \"The oppressor cannot be the victim\" Not all the responses were as humorous. Nicole Torres, of Chicago, posted about how #HimToo missed the point of the #MeToo movement. \"The oppressor cannot be the victim,\" she wrote, and she compared #HimToo to  #AllLivesMatter, saying that they were both useless hashtags. \"I abhor women who would use false allegations against a man, and it is valid, and it does happen,\" she said. \"But #HimToo is trying to dismiss #MeToo. They will do anything to dismiss the female voice.\" The various uses of #HimToo are not something that Golden predicted when he originally posted the hashtag last year. \"Hashtags can be as harmful as they are helpful,\" he said. \"Sometimes they start a real, productive dialogue, but it has to go further than that.\" In this case, #HimToo has seemingly blossomed into a movement, taking on a life of its own.",

Chughtai and Cox are members of a newly formed campaign workers union. Many political campaign workers spend long hours at low pay, living off of pizza and coffee, all in the hope of seeing their candidate win. Now, labor organizers are setting their sights on bringing those workers into the labor movement at a time when the percentage of U.S. workers who belong to a union is falling steadily. The newly formed Campaign Workers Guild claims to have helped organize at least a dozen Democratic campaigns and one political consulting firm. \"It's been far too long that workers in this industry have been exploited. And now we're finally standing together to put an end to that,\" said Ihaab Syed, the union's secretary. One of those campaigns is Erin Murphy's, a Democrat running for governor in Minnesota, the first gubernatorial campaign in the country to unionize. Aisha Chughtai a field organizer for Murphy, says the job is demanding and doesn't lend itself to a nine-to-five shift. But ever since signing on with the Campaign Workers Guild, she's minding her schedule a bit more closely. \"Now I get a day off every single week where I am not allowed to be in the office. I'm not supposed to be working. And I don't. It's great.\" Chughtai is one of six full-time employees on Murphy's campaign who formed the union last month. Worker empowerment, Chughtai says, not job dissatisfaction, motivated the unionization drive. \"I think we should break down the idea that unions are only useful to go after bad bosses.\" Brief, cordial talks with the campaign manager resulted in a first contract. There's a base wage of $21 an hour with paid sick time and health benefits that now include dental and vision coverage. Harassment guidelines are spelled out. Members pay $30 a month in dues. The candidate is on board with her staff joining the Campaign Workers Guild. \"I thought this is awesome. And I still do,\" said Murphy, a state legislator who used to be a union leader with the Minnesota Nurses Association. She's one of three candidates vying for the nomination of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (yes, labor is in the party's name). She says having a unionized staff shows she's serious about collective bargaining rights and she's not worried the labor contract will hamstringing her campaign. \"I want people to come to a campaign because they share my values. I know how hard everyone in this campaign is working. One day of rest is going to make them more productive, healthier and we're going to be more effective because of that.\" But unionizing campaign workers isn't something that Democrats are universally embracing, despite the party's close ties to organized labor. \"A political campaign is different. It's a cause,\" said Steve Hildebrand, who spent 26 years managing campaigns, including serving as deputy national campaign manager for Barack Obama's successful presidential bid in 2008. While Hildebrand says he embraces the goal of assuring workplace dignity and proper compensation, \"Political campaigns are short-term gigs. They're not long-term operations, so this idea of unionization for an eight-month job, it just doesn't make a lot of sense.\" While Hildebrand is now out of the campaign business and runs a cafe in South Dakota, he's concerned the 2020 presidential campaign will be the next frontier for union organizers. \"Going into the general election if you have a campaign team that is not putting in 80 hours a week on the Democratic side, you're probably going to lose.\" While unionizing campaign workers may be a short-term boost for organized labor but long-term, Hildebrand says it could weaken unions further. \"What I would tell labor unions is that if you put pressure on political campaigns to organize and build unions there's a great chance they're going to lose and there's a great chance there is going to be no one there to fight your battles in Congress, in the Senate and at the presidential level.\" Still, Chughtai, the staffer on Murphy's campaign, says she hopes the Democrats running for the White House in 2020 invite unionization. \"I sure hope this is a litmus test. Right? It should be.\" Would she take a job for one without a union? Sure, she says, but her first step would be to organize that campaign.",

Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET John Dowd, the veteran attorney leading President Trump's outside legal team, has tendered his resignation, marking a shakeup just as Trump had turned his Twitter ire on special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation. Dowd declined to explain why he was leaving the team that is helping the president deal with the Russia investigation. But a source familiar with Dowd's thinking says he was tired and frustrated, in a draining job with not enough resources and with a client who was not taking his advice. When reached by phone all Dowd would say is, \"I love the president and wish him well.\" Trump's legal team is in the midst of ongoing discussions with Mueller over a possible interview with President Trump. Dowd recently described them as \"productive and constructive.\" Speaking at a White House event Thursday after news of the resignation broke, the president told reporters he would like to speak to investigators as part of the Mueller probe. Over the weekend, however, Dowd suggested that the Mueller investigation be shut down. At first, he said he was speaking as the president's counsel; then he walked it back to say he was speaking for himself. \"Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,\" Dowd said in an email. Those recent revelations? \"I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,\" Dowd emailed. Hours later, President Trump began tweeting his own criticisms of the investigation, using Mueller's name for the first time: The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT! Dowd's resignation also comes just days after the president added a new lawyer to the team, Joe diGenova, who has been outspoken in his attacks on the Justice Department Russia investigation. \"There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and \u2014 if she didn't win the election \u2014 to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,\" diGenova said on Fox News in January. Dowd was reportedly blindsided by the hire and according to one source expressed concerns to Trump that diGenova had conflicts of interest because his small law firm also represents former Trump campaign advisor Sam Clovis and former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo, both of who have reportedly been interviewed as part of Mueller's investigation. Dowd had only just been brought onto Trump's legal team last June to add some Washington experience to Trump's defense. Here's the thumbnail of Dowd's career we wrote up back then: John Dowd is best known as the author of the Dowd Report, which led to Pete Rose's lifetime ban from baseball for gambling on the game. \"I'm very, very happy and very proud of the commissioner of baseball for protecting the game,\" Dowd told NPR two years ago, when Major League Baseball denied Rose's request to be reinstated. \"In this day and age, protecting the integrity of anything is a big deal.\" In 2011, Dowd represented Raj Rajaratnam in a major insider-trading case. Rajaratnam was convicted on all counts and walking out of the courtroom Dowd offered some choice words to a CNBC reporter, flipping off the camera. Attorney John Dowd (left), who now is part of the legal team working for Trump, leaves U.S. District Court with his client Raj Rajaratnam after jury deliberations about an insider trading case in New York in 2011. But more to the point, Dowd is a seasoned Washington hand who represented Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the Keating Five scandal (McCain was cleared) and helped a retired Air Force colonel get immunity to testify in the Iran Contra scandal. That's experience that would be quite valuable if the president is in fact being investigated for obstruction of justice by the special counsel.",

            "article_content": "Voting in the first primaries of 2018 is already underway without a comprehensive public understanding about the cyberattack against the 2016 election.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voting in the first primaries of 2018 is already underway without a comprehensive public understanding about the cyberattack against the 2016 election. Even as Americans begin voting in the earliest 2018 midterm primaries, the public still doesn't have solid answers about what happened to its election systems in 2016. Instead it has conflicting accounts and official denials. The latest example this week came from the Department of Homeland Security, which slammed a report by NBC News that said the intelligence community had evidence in early 2017 to believe Russian operatives compromised more state voter systems in 2016 than previously known. DHS said NBC's story was \"factually inaccurate and misleading\" and stood by its previous assessment, that just one state, Illinois, had its system breached. NBC then slammed that response in a subsequent defense of its story, which quoted a former cyber-expert from the Obama administration, Michael Daniel, who said that when he was in the White House, it believed seven states had been compromised. What's the real story? How serious were the Russian cyberattacks across the United States? \"We simply don't have enough information unfortunately because nobody is going past these one-line statements that are obscure or obtuse [at best],\" said Mark Nunnikhoven, a vice president at the cybersecurity company Trend Micro. In a written statement to NPR, Daniel declined to specify the number of states he believed had their systems compromised. He did, however, seem to offer a justification for why intelligence that officials had in early 2017 could have pointed to a different conclusion than DHS officials are drawing now. \"Since [January 2017], there have been numerous factual developments resulting from the various ongoing investigations related to Russian election interference,\" Daniel said. \"The most important consideration is that the threat to electoral systems remains, and we need to continue to improve the security of such systems.\" Government agencies probably have more detail than they've revealed about the attacks launched by Russia's military GRU intelligence agencies and other cyberaggressors over the past two years. One clue about that was in a leaked National Security Agency report that laid out how Russian hackers targeted a specific elections vendor in Florida. Another was in the indictment released by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller charging 13 Russians and three Russian entities with using social media to amplify controversy within the United States. On Tuesday, NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers told members of Congress he expected that cyberaggression from Russia would continue this year and beyond as part of a strategic objective to shake Americans' faith. \"I believe they're attempting to undermine our institutions,\" he said. Unless the government releases more information, however, the back-and-forth will likely continue between press accounts of the attacks and the denials from officialdom. Even the basic numbers quoted since 2016 of the states affected somehow by the cyberattacks have fluctuated all the way up to 50. Six of the seven states mentioned in the NBC report told NPR that they found no evidence through their own independent reviews that their systems had been compromised. The seventh, Illinois, has been working with DHS since its voter registration system was broken into \u2014 though not altered \u2014 in the summer of 2016. Other states said they couldn't corroborate the NBC story. \"After NBC reached out to our office, we contacted our partners in state and federal intelligence and law enforcement,\" said Jesse Melgar, California's deputy secretary of state. \"None of them could corroborate NBC's claims nor has NBC provided any evidence to support their assertions.\" All seven states were on the list of 21 states that DHS had previously said were probed, or scanned, by Russians. Experts liken the scanning process to looking into the window of a locked home without actually opening the window or climbing in. So could Obama-era officials and people today in the Trump administration look at the same data from 2016 election and reach different conclusions? Nunnikhoven said intelligence officials may have since either found out more about the events or found out more about the attackers, \"so it might be easier to associate certain behaviors.\" For now, though, \"[Intelligence officials] are leaning a little too far on withholding information as opposed to right out and saying it,\" Nunnikhoven said. He added, \"There needs to be a little more detail so it's far more credible when you hear those reassurances.\" DHS says that it's being as forthright as possible and committed to continue building trust with the state officials it is helping. Reports like NBC's, it complained, undermine those bridges it is attempting to build. Secretaries of state and election directors received a classified briefing from intelligence officials two weeks ago, and DHS is in the process of getting security clearances for officials in every state \u2014 efforts meant to mend a rocky relationship, between the intelligence community and the states, that only got rockier when it took more than a year for the states to find out they were scanned by Russians in 2016. \"You want a government that's a transparent as possible but there's always a recognition there are some places where transparency can be counter- productive to defense or other values,\" said Kevin Kennedy, who oversaw elections in Wisconsin until June of 2016. \"That's the nature of democracy \u2014 that tension.\"",

But historian David Moss argues our democracy has been tested many times \u2014 and has proven resilient. The tone of American politics can be...nasty. It doesn't take a seasoned political analyst to see that. But is this nastiness really worse than in previous eras, and if so, what does that mean for our democracy? Historian David Moss takes the long view. He argues that our political systems are much more resilient than we realize, and that conflict, however bitter it may seem, can be productive. In his new book, Democracy: A Case Study, Moss points out that there have been many moments in our history when panicked Americans wondered if the nation would survive. And yet, the United States is still here. Furthermore, Moss says, many of the most intractable conflicts have resulted in innovations and compromises that still impact the way our government works today.
