            "article_content": "Read An Excerpt Reading Isabel Wilkerson is like hearing the stories of my parents\u2019 friends and their parents, the handed-down (and often sanitized) tales of their exodus from the South. The exits occurred for various reasons: the desire to escape the near-starvation of tenant farmer existences; the need to leave because their own prospects were so restricted, and they wanted more for their children; the middle of the night departures because a son had not been deferential enough to an outraged white townsman; the vaporization of an entire family overnight, because their pretty eldest daughter had attracted the lingering glance of a white man she would not be allowed to refuse, with dire consequences to her entire family. They\u2019re all reflected in The Warmth of Other Suns, Wilkerson\u2019s sweeping history of the Great Migration. As Wilkerson notes, America\u2019s greatest domestic movement began around 1917 and ended in 1975, an epoch during which millions of black American citizens fled Southern towns and cities, with their elaborate and complicated tapestries of Jim Crow laws, for the relative freedoms of the north. Ironically, the early black migrants were converging on the interior Ellis Islands of the North and Midwest (New York, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, etc.), just as oppressed Europeans were converging on the same cities. Both were huddled masses, yearning to breathe free, with one critical difference: black migrants were already citizens. Theoretically, they possessed the freedoms their European brethren were seeking. Despite that, they were routinely pushed to the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder where ABC -- Anybody But Colored -- was too often the rule. Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the New York Times, has taken what many would consider an indigestible chunk of history -- long and sometimes famously written about by earlier historians and sociologists -- and given us an extraordinarily palatable narrative. Much of it is seen through the eyes of three people: Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, who left Mississippi for Chicago and exchanged a grinding servitude to become the matriarch of a large family; George Swanson Starling, who departed the Florida orange groves for Harlem and a life as a Pullman porter; and Robert Joseph Pershing Foster, who escaped Monroe, La., and eventually settled in Los Angeles, where he became a prominent surgeon. Isabel Wilkerson received a Pulitzer Prize in journalism in 1993. She has also been awarded the George Polk Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Henson\n                    \n                \nhide caption Isabel Wilkerson received a Pulitzer Prize in journalism in 1993. She has also been awarded the George Polk Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. How the three got to their respective Northern meccas, what they gave up to remain there and what they got in return is the most American of stories. The Great Migration affected almost every black person with American roots: No matter where we were born and raised, almost all of us had our beginnings somewhere in the South.\u00a0 Before World War I, 90 percent of the country\u2019s blacks lived in the South. This fact seems quaint to black children born in integrated circumstances after the major struggles of the civil rights movement had been decided, but people my age and older remember well the rituals Wilkerson describes when migrants returned to their hometowns to visit: The routes were carefully plotted so overnight stays could be made with relatives or close family friends, because hotels below the Mason-Dixon Line (and sometimes above) refused black visitors. Coolers were packed with lunches -- sandwiches, cold fried chicken, delicate deviled eggs and buttery pound cake, accompanied by thermoses of iced tea and hot coffee (for the drivers) -- which were eaten on the move as the travelers passed restaurant after roadside restaurant. No pecan rolls from Stuckey\u2019s. No ice cream from Howard Johnson\u2019s. (And no explanation of why for the children, who were protected from these insults by their elders: It was years before I realized the Virgina and North Carolina Howard Johnsons were bypassed not because they were dirty, but because they were segregated.) Just as the election of a black president hasn\u2019t cured America\u2019s racial tensions, moving North didn\u2019t automatically guarantee a completely free life for Wilkerson\u2019s subjects. Robert Foster, for instance, drove nonstop from Louisiana for four days in an effort to reach his dream city, Los Angeles. There he imagined he\u2019d be free to practice surgery, not restricted to the ramshackle colored hospital of his Louisiana youth. The feverish drive wasn\u2019t because he was in a rush to get there -- he couldn\u2019t find overnight accommodations as he traveled.\u00a0 Apparently, there was still a lot of South in the Southwest. George Starling recounted what routinely happened when he and other Pullman porters stopped for a beer after a long day serving others: Their drafts were drawn, their money accepted, but after the empties were returned, the bartender would smash them under the counter, so no white patron would encounter -- even washed -- a glass black lips had touched. \u201c[They\u2019d] do it right in front of us,\u201d Starling told Wilkerson, the memory still fresh decades later. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they let us know they didn\u2019t want us in there.\u201d Wilkerson\u2019s personal histories both reflect and deftly illustrate an important part of American history that has only been discussed in clinical ways, sometimes quite famously. St. Clair Drake\u2019s Black Metropolis, a study of life in Chicago\u2019s South Side neighborhoods, is considered a definitive account of the transformation Southern migrants wrought on the Second City. The Warmth of Other Suns builds upon such purely academic works to make the migrant experience both accessible and emotionally compelling. People who grew up hearing tales of the Great Migration from parents, aunts, neighbors and cousins will read Wilkerson\u2019s book and say, \u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s how it was!\u201d And people largely unacquainted with the types of experiences Mrs. Gladney, Mr. Swanson and the flamboyantly successful Dr. Foster encountered over their long lives will end this exhaustively researched book with a deeper sense of a part of American history they\u2019d understood only superficially until now -- valuable knowledge as this country continues to navigate the tricky shoals of race.

It will be a major problem facing Haiti's next president. Campaigning for the election, scheduled for Nov. 28, is under way. In Haiti, campaigning for next month's presidential elections is under way. Nineteen candidates are vying to lead the earthquake-ravaged nation. And with Haitian-American musician Wyclef Jean out of the race there's no clear front-runner. It could be a contentious battle for one of the toughest political jobs in the world. Michel Martely is among the candidates. Wearing an open-collar white shirt and pressed gray slacks and with a shaved bald head, Martely is instantly recognized as he steps out of his SUV at the Port-au-Prince airport on a recent day. The baggage porters yell \"Presidente!\" and a crowd quickly forms around the musician turned candidate. Martely, who's known as \"Sweet Micky,\" has been a leading pop star in Haiti since the late 1980s. A Country Of Survival, Not Love Now, in his first run for public office, Martely wants to lead the country. \"We are living in a country of survival. We have no love for each other anymore,\" he says. Pop star Michel Martely, known as \"Sweet Micky,\" is now throwing his hat into the political ring. He is among 19 presidential candidates and a potential front-runner. Here, he is shown outside  Port-au-Prince's international airport on his way to a fundraising trip in the  United States.\n                \n                    \n                    Valentina Pasquali for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pop star Michel Martely, known as \"Sweet Micky,\" is now throwing his hat into the political ring. He is among 19 presidential candidates and a potential front-runner. Here, he is shown outside  Port-au-Prince's international airport on his way to a fundraising trip in the  United States. Martely also says there's no leadership in Haiti anymore. The country has huge numbers of people without work and in the wake of the earthquake huge amounts of work to do -- yet, he says, no one is putting the two together. \"We have the human resource to go ahead and start the cleaning. And yet no nobody is caring about that because everybody is too busy caring about making money,\" Martely says. \"The state doesn't serve anymore. It's not about serving the population; it's about getting rich when people get into power right now. So it's time that we changed that,\" he says. Despite the fact that he has no political experience, Martely says he can unify the country as it moves forward from the devastating January quake. Martely has a long list of pop hits to his credit, most of them sung in Creole. One liability for him may be that his reputation as an entertainer is that of a good-time party boy. Onstage, he often would don a dress and a wig at a moment's notice. Natural And Man-Made Problems Plague Polls The Jan. 12 earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless and much of Port-au-Prince in ruins. The next president will have to oversee the reconstruction and try to redirect what was already one of the most dysfunctional nations on Earth. Before the quake, roughly 80 percent of the population lived in poverty. Roads, electrical lines, sewers and other infrastructure were in desperate need of repair. Now, they need to be completely rebuilt, along with most of the capital. Post-quake reconstruction has progressed extremely slowly, and sprawling tent camps such as this one near the international airport at Port-au-Prince remain common sights.\n                \n                    \n                    Valentina Pasquali for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Post-quake reconstruction has progressed extremely slowly, and sprawling tent camps such as this one near the international airport at Port-au-Prince remain common sights. \"I think this is one of the most important presidential elections,\" says Raymond Joseph, who recently stepped down as the Haitian ambassador to Washington to run for president. But the Provisional Electoral Council rejected his candidacy \"They said that I didn't have what they call the discharge, meaning discharging yourself of your duties as ambassador. Well, I do have the discharge,\" he says. Joseph calls the electoral council's actions \"arbitrary\" and \"shenanigans.\" He says it's a sign that the ruling political elite don't intend to let Haiti hold clean, democratic elections on Nov. 28. In another controversial move, the council blocked Fanmi Lavalas, the popular party of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, from putting forward a candidate. Allegations of fraud in Haitian elections are practically inevitable, but this year's balloting faces additional challenges. The quake destroyed 40 percent of the polling stations in the country, killed tens of thousands of voters and displaced hundreds of thousands of others. And numerous people lost all their documents and no longer have voting cards. 'In The Hands Of God' The Organization of American States has launched mobile clinics in Port-au-Prince to help people get new IDs. But on a recent day, the lines at one mobile clinic have disintegrated into chaos -- and tempers are flaring. Raymond Joseph, former Haitian ambassador, renounced his  diplomatic post to run in this year\u2019s presidential elections. But the Provisional Electoral Council excluded him from the final list of approved  candidates because it said he had not given up his ambassadorial duties. He says the group's decision is a sign that the ruling political elite don't intend to let Haiti hold clean elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Valentina Pasquali for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Raymond Joseph, former Haitian ambassador, renounced his  diplomatic post to run in this year\u2019s presidential elections.

He says the group's decision is a sign that the ruling political elite don't intend to let Haiti hold clean elections. Maslin Jaunit says she's been at the clinic all day and hasn't been able to get a new ID card. Jaunit says she lost her house and all her documents in the quake. She says she can't wait all day for a new ID and at this point she's giving up. The recovery from the January quake is moving slowly, and many Haitians say they're skeptical about how much a new president can improve things. Desoire Alexander, 64, is sitting in the second story of what used to be a pink, single-family house in Carrefour, a neighborhood in Port-au-Prince. The first floor collapsed completely during the quake. The cement under Alexander slopes sharply toward the missing back of the building. He laughs when asked about the presidential candidates. \"I have no opinion when it comes to candidates because when they talk, you see their mouths, you see their faces, but you don't see their hearts,\" he says. Officials in Haiti insist that logistically everything will be ready for the Nov. 28 presidential polls. Alexander, leaning against a shattered block of concrete, says this election and the fate of Haiti as a whole are in the hands of God.",

If trying to overcome the Republicans' strong momentum in congressional races isn't motivation enough, the Democrats have an added incentive this year: Several of the tightest congressional and gubernatorial races are in states with significant black populations, giving blacks in heavily minority districts an uncommon chance to tip statewide contests. To rouse them, some organizers are applying aggressive tactics, including the use of openly racial invective directed at Republicans and Tea Party activists. The brazen tactics reflect an increased willingness among some to throw sharper elbows this year, given the Republicans' potential to take control of the House and gain seats in the Senate. The charged messaging appears to be a \"fight fire with fire\" counter effort to what Democrats and some political analysts describe as a racist undercurrent in the rhetoric from Tea Party activists and Republican candidates and pundits. \"I do have a sense that there is a very aggressive push,\" says David A. Bositis, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank on black political issues. \"There is a level of intensity there that, I think, could be quite significant in terms of the impact on the election. ... The Republicans and the Tea Party have a lot of people associated with them who have said racist things. It's a situation where two can play that game. They are not going to lie down and play dead.\" The Tea  Party movement first raised hackles when some of its supporters questioned whether President Obama had been born  in the U.S., a constitutional requirement for the office. In March, members of the Congressional Black Caucus  said Tea Party demonstrators shouted racial epithets at them while protesting  heath-care legislation outside the Capitol. One member said he was spit upon. Tea Party spokesmen have challenged those claims.

He said civil rights leaders had \"purposely distorted Martin Luther King's ideas.\" In  July, the Tea Party Express ousted its chairman, Mark Williams, for writing a  satirical letter from \"Colored People\" to Abraham Lincoln in which he, adopting the  voice of slaves, told Lincoln \"you were the greatest racist ever. We  had a great gig. Three squares, room and board, all our decisions made by the \u00a0'massa' ... We  don't cotton to that whole emancipation thing. Freedom means having to work for  real. ... That is just far too much to ask of us.\" 'I Ain't Going Back To The Cotton Fields Of Jim Crow' In Alabama, a recently recorded phone message targeting heavily black communities lays out an ominous warning before the narrator goes on to endorse Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ron Sparks and lieutenant governor hopeful Jim Folsom. The voice is that of an African-American state senator, an influential longtime politician in Alabama, who begins, \"Hello, this is Hank Sanders ... and I'm still mad as hell.\" \"I say hell no!\" he continues. \"I ain't going back to the cotton fields of Jim Crow days. I'm going forward with Ron Sparks, Jim Folsom and others who will do right by all of us.\" The Alabama \"robocall\" came in response to Republican candidates' pledges to roll back the health-care overhaul and other initiatives pushed through by Obama. Many black  Democratic leaders see that as a threat to the legislation's promise of providing health  insurance to millions of working-class blacks not covered by  employers. The Alabama Republican Party has accused Sanders of race-baiting.\u00a0\"It's pretty sad that the Democrat Party believes that the only way they can win  in 2010 is to scare people with images of slavery and cotton fields,\" state Rep. Mike Hubbard, chairman of the Alabama Republican party, said in a statement. He called on Sparks and Folsom to denounce the robocalls. So far, they have not done so. Sparks has responded to questions about the calls by saying racism still exists in Alabama, The Birmingham News reports. Sparks trails Republican Robert Bentley by at least 20 points, according to most polls, but Democrats hope the state's large black electorate can play a pivotal role in the down-ticket races. Maintaining Democrats' control of the state House, for instance, could turn on the outcomes of a dozen hotly contested seats. African-Americans in Alabama usually make up as much as 24 percent of the turnout in a general election, and the overwhelming majority of them vote for Democrats. \"It's been an intense, street-by-street political battle here and the African-American turnout is extremely important,\" says Joe Turnham, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party. \"The difference between African-Americans being 17 or 20 percent of the vote can be the difference between whether you win or lose. Even incremental turnouts of African-American voters can tip the scales.\" Spreading The Word Via E-Mail Separately, an e-mail circulating among African-Americans nationwide takes a similar swing at the right and calls Tea Party activists \"hate mongers.\" It isn't clear if the message, with the subject line \"Wake Up!!! Stop The Tea Party,\" was authored by a political organization.\u00a0The e-mail is addressed to Democrats and urges them to vote on Nov. 2 \"like our lives depend on it, because it does. The Republican party [sic] has been hijacked by dangerous, radical hate mongers called the 'Tea Party.' They are led by Glen [sic] Beck and Sara [sic] Palin [whose] only goal is to take down President Obama and the government. \"These people hate Blacks.\" it continues. \"They hate Latinos. They hate Muslims and have at times made many anti-Semitic statements. They hate Gays. They hate any moderate Republican who might be likely to cooperate with Obama. Their rallying cry? 'We want to take back our country!!' Take it back from whom?\" Polls signal tight races next Tuesday in many House, Senate and gubernatorial contests. Here's where some of those races are and the percentage of black voters. A strong turnout could affect the outcomes. House races: -- Alabama's 2nd District, 27% -- Maryland's 1st District, 11% -- North Carolina's 8th District, 25% -- Virginia's 2nd District, 20% -- Virginia's 5th District, 23% Senate races: -- Illinois, 14% -- Pennsylvania, 10% Races for governor: -- Florida, 15% -- Illinois, 14% -- Ohio, 11% Sources: NPR's Election Scorecard, Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, RealClearPolitics.com. \"These radicals could take this country back to Jim Crow and the hey-day of the [Ku] Klux Klan. Don't think it could happen? Just stay home on election day and see what happens to this country.\" Beck  has bridled at charges that he's racist or, at least, foments racial tensions.  This summer he backed off his 2009 remarks about Obama, saying that he  \"miscast\" the president's \"philosophy and his theology\" as racism, and now  believes it is \"liberation theology.\" Palin  hasn't gotten publicly caught up in much of the racial rhetoric. However, in August, after conservative  talk show host Laura Schlessinger used the N-word repeatedly in an  exchange with an African-American caller, Palin defended Schlessinger's right to  free speech in a Twitter posting: \"Don't  retreat \u2026 reload.\" Spending Big To Get Out The Vote Blacks historically have turned out to vote at rates below the national average. But a recent survey conducted by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University showed that 80 percent of black Democrats are as engaged, or moreso, in the midterm elections than they were in the 2008 presidential election. Likewise, Bositis says that his research recently released by the Joint Center suggests that Republicans' attacks on Obama, as well as blacks being well positioned to influence a number of close races, could drive black turnout higher than in past midterms. The Democratic Party says it is spending more than $3 million -- its biggest commitment ever in a midterm cycle -- on ad buys targeting African-Americans.\u00a0On Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced a new ad featuring R&B singer John Legend that will air in urban markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin and on nationally syndicated radio shows with predominantly black audiences. First lady Michelle Obama has appeared on Tom Joyner's morning radio show, the highest-rated program among blacks. African-Americans within the Obama administration are hitting the campaign trail. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who is black, appears in the October issue of Essence magazine. Charles Bailey (right) tells Rep. Tom Perriello (D-VA) that he's angry because the \"change\" President Obama promised in 2008 hasn't happened yet. Perriello's district is among those where the outcome could depend on which party does a better job at turning out its voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken MaGuire/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption However, high-priced media blitzes aren't reliable for turning voters out, according to Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie. \"The results are a little bit mixed in my perch in Atlanta,\" she says. \"If I listen to black pundits, there are still a lot of complaints that blacks have been ignored, both agenda-wise and electorally. ... You can't just rely on indirect forms of mobilization, like robocalls or radio ads. You've got to do the retail politics. You've got to talk to people. If you do that, there's strong evidence that your likelihood for turning out voters in future elections goes much higher.\" Michigan Offers A Cautionary Note In Michigan, where black turnout was 57 percent in 2006 and 64 percent in 2008, the Democrats are struggling to energize their base despite having committed several million dollars to the effort. Much of the Democratic effort centers on Detroit, the state's power base for Democrats and black voters. That base is usually strong enough to keep Michigan's Democratic candidates in contention, if not propel them to victory. But at a rally in Detroit on Sunday, former President Bill Clinton drew a crowd of about 500 people, enough to fill only a third of the room. For a city that still adores Clinton, who once packed any venue there by the thousands, the thin showing illustrates the lack of excitement for Michigan's Democratic candidates. At the top of the Democratic ticket in Michigan, Virg Bernero, the party\u2019s nominee for governor, appears unable to stop the state from electing its first Republican in eight years. He trails Republican Rick Snyder by as many as 20 points, according to the latest polls. Bernero's selection of African-American Brenda Lawrence as his running mate has done little to energize black voters or other Democratic loyalists. And he's had to overcome relative obscurity, as mayor of the small capital city of Lansing. Detroit's population is roughly 81 percent black and boasts more than 567,000 total registered voters. Midterm election turnout traditionally averages about 37 percent, and Democratic organizers are aiming for a turnout of 35 percent, or about 200,000. \"We've got quite a few groups that popped up over the last couple years since the 2008 election, young folks in the city who have formed their own groups and are working through their social-networking groups,\" says Eddie McDonald, who chairs the Michigan Democratic Party's coordinating campaign. \"And we've got the churches running their own individual political action organizations and doing community outreach.\" McDonald says the party is spending \"millions\" of dollars on outreach. Working against the Democrats is not only the low name recognition of the party's statewide candidates, but also the absence of hot local elections that drive up turnout. Instead, many voters are distracted by the particularly ruinous effects of the recession on Michigan. More than a third of Detroiters live below the poverty threshold, and Michigan's unemployment rate in September was 13 percent, compared with the nation's 9.7 percent. The malaise among voters could pose problems for Obama and the Democrats in 2012, given Michigan's traditional role as a bellwether for presidential elections. Democrats admit the same could be true in other future battleground states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. \"You could end up having a heavier lift,\" McDonald acknowledges. \"Michigan is still hurting from an economic standpoint. So there are things we still need to work on when it comes to ... finding something to use as a catalyst or some sort of rallying cry as we move toward the election in 2012.\"",

            "article_content": "Read An Excerpt \"You can no longer talk about what black America thinks or feels,\" writes Eugene Robinson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post columnist, in a new book about the increasing disconnect between America's African-American communities. In Disintegration: The Splintering of Black America, Robinson argues that America's African-American population can now be divided into four distinct groups: the abandoned poor; immigrants and people of mixed race; the mainstream middle class; and the small but powerful elite. He describes how each group has a different 'black experience' and largely remains detached from the others. Robinson tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that generational changes have also changed what it means to be African-American, using his own family as an example. He grew up in the Jim Crow South, while his sons grew up in a predominantly white, middle-class neighborhood. His father, who was born in rural Georgia in 1916, served in a segregated Army during World War II. \"If you look at those three generations, you see how much has changed,\" he says. \"My father grew up at a time when basic fundamental civil rights battles were being fought. By that's totally different from the time I reached adulthood, when those rights were guaranteed, and totally different from the world in which my kids grew up.\" On election night in 2008, Robinson was working as an analyst on-air for MSNBC when he momentarily left the set to call his parents. (His father, who was 92 at the time, has since died.) \"It was a night I'll never forget,\" he said. \"I got to call and tell them that they had lived to see the election of the first African-American president and then spent several days thinking about that, thinking about the fact that [my father's] life had spanned such a period. The world in which he was born and the world in which he died were two different worlds.\" The Splintering of Black America by Eugene Robinson Hardcover, 254 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

Writer Eugene Robinson grew up in a segregated world. His hometown of Orangeburg,  S.C., had a black side of town and a white side of town; a black high school and a white high school; and \"two separate and unequal school systems,\" he tells NPR's Steve Inskeep. But things are different now. Just look at the nation's capital -- home to the first black U.S. president, a large black middle class and many African-Americans who still live in extreme poverty. Robinson details the splintering of African-American communities and neighborhoods in his new book, Disintegration: The Splintering of Black America. His story starts in America's historically black neighborhoods, where segregation brought people of different economic classes together. Robinson says that began to change during the civil rights era. \"People who had the means and had the education started moving out of what had been the historic black neighborhoods,\" Robinson explains. Read An Excerpt He cites Washington, D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood as a prime example of this because of how Shaw was home to a vibrant black community and a thriving entertainment scene in the 1930s through the 1950s. By the '70s, Shaw had become a desolate, drug-ridden area. \"In city after city, African-American neighborhoods that \u2026once had been vibrant and in a sense whole -- disintegrated,\" Robinson says. He attributes that change to African-Americans taking advantage of new opportunities, resulting in a more economically segregated community. \"There have always been class distinctions in the black community,\" Robinson says, \"but what I believe we've seen is an increasing distance between two large groups, which I identify as the Mainstream and the Abandoned.\" Robinson says that while a \"fairly slim majority\" of African-Americans entered the middle class, a large portion of the community never climbed the ladder. It's getting harder and harder to catch up, he says, \"because so many rungs of that ladder are now missing.\" So as formerly segregated neighborhoods begin to gentrify; rents increase and longtime residents get pushed out. \"What happens to this group that I call the Abandoned is that they get shoved around -- increasingly out into the inner suburbs -- and end up almost out of sight, out of mind,\" Robinson says. Of course, that's not to say that life was better before the civil rights movement. Robinson says Americans can't forget what life was like before integration. \"Forty-five years ago, only two out of every 100 African-American households made the present day equivalent of $100,000 a year. Now it's eight or nine,\" he says.\u00a0 \"No one would turn back the clock and go back to those days.\" But Robinson says opportunities for African-Americans to climb into the middle class are quickly disappearing, putting black families that did manage to make it into the middle class in a difficult position that involves a certain amount of \"survivor's guilt\" and plenty of frustration that efforts to help -- haven't. Eugene Robinson works at the Washington Post where he has served as a foreign editor, an associate editor, a columnist and the London bureau chief.\n\n                    \n                    Julia Ewan\n                    \n                \nhide caption Eugene Robinson works at the Washington Post where he has served as a foreign editor, an associate editor, a columnist and the London bureau chief. \"I know very few middle-class black Americans who are not involved in ... attempts to reach across the gap -- through the church, through mentoring programs, by spending time reading in the schools,\" Robinson says. \"Yet, you need something much more holistic ... and purposeful if we're frankly ever going to have the kind of impact that we need to have on the people left behind.\" There's a good deal of friction between African-American communities, Robinson says, but it doesn't get talked about very much.\u00a0 People living in poverty \"have the resentment and sourness that comes with having been left behind,\" he says, \"the feeling that, 'Well, these people think so much of themselves, and they've moved away to their fancy places.' \" According to Robinson, there's a word for that feeling. \"Sadity\" is used to describe someone who is \"stuck up\" or who thinks he or she is better than everyone else. \"It reflects this outsized importance that is given in poor black communities to this concept of respect,\" Robinson says. And if the black poor remain mired where they are right now, he says, it will be bad for everyone -- that's what gives the cause a sense of urgency. So while the changes the civil rights movement has inspired over the past 50 years have absolutely been for the good, there's still important work to do.

In any athletic contest, winning teams play their own game and force the other side to play that game too. The same being true in elections, it's remarkable how timidity leads Democrats to fight this year's campaign on Republican terms. Nowhere is this more obvious than on taxes, where the entire debate revolves around what to do about the cuts enacted under George W. Bush. Almost no one is talking about extending the progressive tax cuts that were included in President Obama's stimulus program. Nor are we discussing the impending death of a pro-work public assistance program that, for a rather modest sum, has helped provide jobs to 250,000 low-income Americans. At least on the Bush tax cuts, Obama has drawn a clear and sensible line. He's said that Congress should extend the reductions for the middle class but not those for families earning more than $250,000 a year. For the life of me, I don't get why some Democrats are so afraid of this vote. Substantively, most of the 31 House Democrats who signed a letter last week urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to chicken out of this fight claim to be deficit hawks. Why then add $700 billion to the deficit for the purpose of continuing a tax program that disproportionately benefits millionaires? And politically, why shouldn't Democrats dare Republicans to vote against extending middle-class tax cuts and then have to explain that they opposed them because not enough money was going to the rich? But notice that this entire battle is being framed around Bush's proposals. The parts of the Obama stimulus program that never get discussed \u2014 one reason why it may be so unpopular \u2014 are its many tax reductions. John Podesta, president of the Center for American Progress and White House chief of staff under President Clinton, noted the Obama tax cuts also expire at the end of this year: \"I don't understand why we're only talking about extending George W. Bush's tax cuts, which are heavily skewed to help the wealthiest Americans, yet no one's discussing President Obama's cuts, which are exclusively focused on middle-class families.\" I don't understand it, either. The stimulus included not only the broad Making Work Pay tax cut that gave most families an $800 refundable tax credit, but also the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, which were especially helpful to lower income families. If the child tax credit isn't extended, 7.6 million children in low-income working families would lose all benefits from the provision, and an additional 10.5 million children would have their credit reduced. The biggest losses, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, would be among families earning between $12,850 and $16,333, many of which include a parent working full time for the minimum wage. Tell me again: Why is it more important to preserve millionaires' tax cuts than to continue helping these far more vulnerable Americans? Why are Republican leaders who argue that failing to extend all of the Bush tax cuts would constitute a tax increase not saying exactly the same thing about the Obama tax cuts? Is it blind ideology, an exceptional solicitude for people with very high incomes, or the fact that Obama's cuts were packaged into the dreaded stimulus? And perhaps the biggest scandal of all \u2014 especially after last week's Census Bureau finding that one in seven Americans is now living in poverty \u2014 would be to allow the expiration of an emergency fund included in the stimulus to subsidize jobs for low-income parents and young Americans. The program will end on Sept. 30 unless the Senate joins the House in passing an extension. States have used over $1 billion from the fund to work with businesses to provide jobs, and this innovative approach is particularly helpful to communities hit hardest by the downturn. It embodies a value every conservative campaigns on: that the best anti-poverty program is a job. Pelosi, at least, finally started talking late last week about the need to extend the Obama tax cuts. And you have to hope that Senate Republicans will let the jobs fund extension through, since it's hard to think of a more Republican approach to alleviating poverty. But you also have to ask why Democrats didn't try long ago to move any of these items to the center of the debate. Why cede so much attention to the ideas of George W. Bush?",

The network that gave us The Sopranos is hoping to prove again that crime does pay, at least so far as subject matter for a weekly series. Set in Atlantic City in the 1920s, Boardwalk Empire starts just before Prohibition, with city movers and shakers holding a huge party and literally counting down the moments until the new national alcohol ban \u2014 and the illicit schemes that will keep the booze flowing \u2014 will make them even richer. When you hear that HBO is presenting another drama about the mob, the initial reaction is that the network is ripping off The Sopranos and the many crime films of Martin Scorsese. Except that Boardwalk Empire is created by Terence Winter, who produced and wrote (or co-wrote) dozens of Sopranos episodes \u2014 including the classic \"Pine Barrens.\" And the pilot of Boardwalk Empire is directed by Scorsese himself, who's also an executive producer on the series. If anyone has earned the right to explore more of this territory, it's these guys. Based on Nelson Johnson's nonfiction book about the colorful history of Atlantic City, Boardwalk Empire mixes actual historical characters with invented ones. So we get a young, cocky Al Capone and a corrupt politico named Nucky Thompson, played by Steve Buscemi and based on a real-life Atlantic City power broker named Nucky Johnson \u2014 but we also get a wholly invented young thug named Jimmy Darmody, a World War I veteran played by Michael Pitt. Jimmy has returned from the front lines with an itchy trigger finger, and Nucky, who up to now has made his fortune without spilling blood, isn't happy about his employee's violent streak. Betting On Buscemi: The actor steps into a dominating lead role as Nucky Thompson, a thinly fictionalized version of real Atlantic City politician Nucky Johnson.\n                \n                    \n                    Craig Blankenhorn\n                    \n                \nhide caption Betting On Buscemi: The actor steps into a dominating lead role as Nucky Thompson, a thinly fictionalized version of real Atlantic City politician Nucky Johnson. \"Are you that stupid?\" Nucky says, berating Darmody. \"Do you have any idea how in over your head you are? Did I not tell you to slow down?\" \"I tried to tell you, I'm not a kid anymore,\" Darmody sulks. Nucky pauses. \"And killing?\" he says, cursing. \"And larceny. That makes you a man?\" \"No,\" says Darmody. \"You got brains, kid. You got a future,\" Nucky says. \"I still got a future,\" Darmody replies. \"We both do.\" That's the side of Buscemi we expect to see \u2014 the frustrated hothead who has been so entertaining in supporting roles in Fargo, The Big Lebowski and, yes, The Sopranos. But Nucky is a leading role, and Buscemi makes the most of it. Lording over Atlantic City from his suite of rooms at the Ritz-Carlton, he barks orders, ridicules underlings and confronts powerful adversaries. Yet he's not all business: He has a dumb but spirited mistress, played with all kinds of entertaining zeal by Paz de la Huerta. And very quickly he develops a soft spot for Margaret, a poor pregnant woman who comes to see him after her husband lost all their money gambling. Margaret is played by Kelly Macdonald, and in this new crime series, she's the biggest thief of all, because she positively steals every scene she's in. You may have been impressed by this young actress in the past; I have, when she starred opposite Bill Nighy in The Girl in the Cafe and co-starred in the original miniseries version of State of Play. But here Macdonald, like Buscemi, vaults herself to a new level. It takes several episodes \u2014 I've seen the first six \u2014 for their relationship to evolve into something different, and something potentially dangerous. All of Boardwalk Empire is like that. Think of it as a chess game, where the opening moves establish the positions of various pieces. It takes patience to develop strategies and spring traps, but there's a major payoff. By the third hour, you really care about these people, and that makes the stakes, and the violence, more intense. In fact, there are scenes in Boardwalk Empire that are unforgettably violent. Not over the top, like a carnage-obsessed video game, but unforgettable for their emotional intensity \u2014 like when Roman Polanski sliced Jack Nicholson's nostril in Chinatown. It's Atlantic City, Jake \u2014 and it's just as powerful. Boardwalk Empire, without question, is better than any new series the broadcast networks are serving up this fall. It's the only new show worth adding to your weekly must-see list \u2014 and with its visual majesty and period music, it's like nothing else on TV this year. Unlike most things in Atlantic City, Boardwalk Empire is a very good bet.",

Karin Slaughter is a master of the thriller genre; her latest book, Broken, is full of twists and turns and technical details.  It revolves around two women: A police detective with a story to hide, and a medical examiner who finds herself drawn into a murder investigation in the town she used to call home. In the latest installment of our Thrilled to Death series, Slaughter joins NPR's Michele Norris to talk about Broken, and the books and authors that influenced her along the way.  You can hear their conversation by clicking the \"Listen\" link at the top of the page.  Below, read Slaughter's recommendation of Denise Mina's Garnethill. Read An Excerpt By Karin Slaughter The most enduring stories in literature generally have some kind of crime at their center, whether it's the bloody butchery of Hamlet, the lecherous misanthropes of Dickens or the lone gunman from The Great Gatsby.  We would not have the courtroom drama of To Kill a Mockingbird without Mayella Ewell's accusation of rape.  We would not have The Lovely Bones if little Susie hadn't been targeted by a pedophile.  We would not have Water for Elephants without the brutal death of a sadistic wife-beater.  Even Gone With the Wind had a shocking, cold-blooded murder. In all of these works, violence, or the threat of violence, doesn't just propel the plot; it creates tension, it tests character and, most importantly, it brings conflict that has to be resolved.  Pushing the boundaries of polite society does not just fall under the purview of crime fiction authors.  Good writers know that crime is an entre into telling a greater story about character.  Good crime writing holds up a mirror to the readers and reflects in a darker light the world in which they live. There isn't a better crime writer today than Denise Mina.  Her first novel, Garnethill, began a trilogy of books featuring Maureen O'Donnell, a psychiatric patient and incest survivor.  As with many victims of sexual abuse, Maureen has turned her anger inward.  At every point in her life, she's chosen the worst path, whether it's becoming sexually involved with the psychiatrist who is supposed to be helping her or self-medicating with alcohol.  That she wakes up after a blackout to find her lover violently murdered is just the beginning of the grueling emotional journey she embarks on to find her sanity. Maureen's volatility is the hallmark of not just a good crime novel, but a good crime novel written by a woman.  There is nothing precious about this damaged character.  You want to root for her, but you also want to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to snap out of it.  The fact that our anti-heroine isn't perfect, that she believably crosses lines that many of us wouldn't think of approaching, opens up a startling dichotomy: everything Maureen has survived has made her want to die.  This is a woman's life that you don't often find talked about in contemporary fiction; an awakening where Edna finally remembers how to swim.  A battered woman, an abused and self-abusing woman, who doesn't have to die in order for her struggle to have meaning. In many ways, Mina's writing reminds me of Kathryn Harrison's earlier work -- the childhood exploitations of Thicker Than Water combined with the willful self-destruction of Exposure.  Both women write about characters who live in the extremes.  Both writers know that the only way to push the boundaries of the craft is to push the boundaries of crime.  No matter the genre, this is the legacy to which all good writers should aspire.  Violence well-told is a fulcrum for prying the scab off of the human condition.

Read An Excerpt The summer of 2001 was the summer of Chandra Levy; the 24-year-old Washington intern vanished without a trace -- amid much speculation. Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz investigated the case for the Washington Post. In their new book Finding Chandra: A True Washington Murder Mystery, they reexamine the tragedy. The authors talk with NPR's Neal Conan about a number of \"critical mistakes\" made by the police investigating the case.  First, there was a surveillance camera in Levy's apartment building that recorded who went in and out of the building, but police didn't get access to the video before it was recorded over. Secondly, police who wanted to see what Levy had looked at online on the morning of her disappearance corrupted the computer's hard drive.  \"For at least a month,\" Horwitz explains, \"investigators didn't know what she was looking at that morning... She had gone to a site for Rock Creek Park in the nation's capital, and clicked on hiking trails.\" So, says Horwitz, in lieu of clues, the police turned their attention to Levy's boyfriend, Rep. Gary Condit (D-Calif.) \"They had a singular focus on him from beginning, and because of that, they weren't looking anywhere else, and that started the press frenzy.\" Police didn't get the hard drive back until a month later, when they discovered Levy's search for hiking trails in Rock Creek Park.  The police chief called for a search of the entire park, near all the paths and the roads. Authors Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz have each won Pulitzer Prizes for their investigative work.\n                \n                    \n                    Evy Mages\n                    \n                \nhide caption Authors Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz have each won Pulitzer Prizes for their investigative work. \"But when they executed the search, they only searched off the roads, not the paths,\" Higham explains. By doing so, searchers missed Levy's body by barely 50 yards.  \"If they had found her that day, they would have seen right away, that she was the victim of a violent crime, of a random attack.\" Instead, Levy's body lay in the woods for another year, when her remains were found by a hiker.  By that time, there were few clues left for investigators to piece together the case. District of Columbia police determined Levy's death was a homicide, and in April, 2009, Ingmar Guandique was charged with her murder.  He has plead not guilty, and is expected to stand trial in 2010.",

James Clyburn (D-SC) gestures as he walks through statuary hall as the House prepares to vote on health care overhaul in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Sunday, March 21, 2010. As the House debate on the health bill heads into late evening, the rhetoric is just as divided along partisan lines as the final vote will be. Democrats appear confident that they will have the 216 votes needed to pass a pair of bills designed to provide near-universal health insurance coverage. Republicans, who are unanimous in their opposition, have described the bills as \"a disgrace.\" The quest for widespread health care coverage has gone on for a century. Democrats are highly aware that they are about to prevail on a historic vote, making references to past landmark legislation such as Social Security and figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. \"I'm proud to be a member of Congress, but never as proud as I am tonight,\" said Eliot Engel (D-NY). Democrats are highlighting the bill's prospects for reducing the deficit, lowering prescription drug prices for Medicare patients and expanding coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans are blasting the bill for being overly ambitious and too expensive. \"Never before in our history has a major change in legislation been made on a purely partisan basis,\" said John Shadegg (R-AZ). \"Mark my words, the massive expansions of Medicaid in this bill will bankrupt our states.\" They are criticizing it for increasing taxes and expanding the reach of the federal government. They also say that the executive order President Obama plans to sign if the legislation is enacted to placate abortion opponents will not stop the expansion of abortion using federal dollars. The executive order  would clarify that no taxpayer dollars would be spent on abortions. That prompted Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) and a half-dozen of his allies to announce they would vote for the pair of bills (HR 3590, HR 4872) later Sunday. \"This bill was going to go forward,\" Stupak said. \"I do believe they had the votes.\" Republican Opposition Every vote counts for Democrats. When the House voted on its version of the health care bill in November, 39 Democrats voted against it. This time, House Democrats can only afford to give up 37 votes if they hope to achieve a majority of 216 votes. No Republicans will support this legislation. If it passes, the GOP pledges to make it the top campaign issue in this fall's midterm elections. \"Let's see who's still here after the American people speak loud and clear this November,\" Rep. Connie Mack (R-FL) said during floor debate. Opponents of the health care bill carry a \"Kill the Bill\" sign near the U.S. Capitol on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Opponents of the health care bill carry a \"Kill the Bill\" sign near the U.S. Capitol on Sunday. The GOP has made good on its intentions to set up procedural roadblocks before the bill was even formally up for debate. By mid-afternoon Sunday, Republicans had so far raised two motions arguing that the bill violates House rules regarding earmarks and unfunded mandates on states and localities. \"This bill is the mother of all unfunded mandates,\" said Paul Ryan (R-WI), the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. Both points of order were defeated on mostly party-line votes. Following the procedural wrangling, the House is nearing debate on the legislation itself. The House will first take up legislation that had been passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve. If the House passes that bill, it will be cleared for Obama to sign into law. The House would then take up the so-called reconciliation bill, which is, in essence, a package of amendments to the Senate bill. That reconciliation package then goes to the Senate for approval. 'Kill The Bill' Early debate took place against a backdrop of protest inside and outside the Capitol. A group of Republican lawmakers unfurled from a Capitol balcony a Gadsden flag, emblazoned with the slogan \"Don't tread on me.\" Numerous protesters displayed the flag as well. Capitol Police removed a small number of protesters from the House gallery after they broke in, chanting \"kill the bill.\" At least two were restrained with zip-tie handcuffs. Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) says an agreement reached with President Obama on Sunday banning use of federal funds for abortions will clear the way for the Democrats to have enough votes to pass the House health care bill.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) says an agreement reached with President Obama on Sunday banning use of federal funds for abortions will clear the way for the Democrats to have enough votes to pass the House health care bill. Some Republican members cheered the protesters on from the House floor. \"I've never seen members of the House cheering on a guy resisting being kicked out of the chamber,\" Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) told TalkingPointsMemo. \"It's a dangerous situation, and the Republicans are cheering him on.\" Bill supporters were in evidence also. Mary Narayan, a registered nurse, told NPR's Julie Rovner, \"I am in support of this bill because I feel everyone has a right to health care, just as they have a right to education and a right to live.\" Inside The Bill The reconciliation bill aims to extend health insurance to 32 million more Americans \u2014 leaving just 5 percent of the nation's nonelderly population without coverage. The bill would achieve this by expanding Medicaid and by requiring most individuals to buy insurance. Most of the bill's $940 billion price tag comes from subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. Subsidies are larger under the reconciliation bill than under the Senate version, but the subsidy would not grow as much over time. The Congressional Budget Office on Saturday estimated that the reconciliation bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over the next decade. That's an increase of $5 billion in savings from the CBO's estimate on Thursday, reflecting changes that would be made through a \"manager's amendment.\" Critics of the bill say that such savings are largely illusory, as they are dependent on tax increases and spending cuts scheduled years out that could be repealed before taking effect. The Senate bill includes an excise tax on so-called Cadillac plans worth more than $23,000 of coverage for a family of four, beginning in 2013. Couples earning more than $250,000 would pay additional Medicare taxes. The reconciliation bill delays the start of the Cadillac tax for an additional five years but increases its bite after 2018. Both bills call for Medicare cuts of more than $500 billion, but Congress has often blocked scheduled Medicare cuts in the past. Individuals and small businesses could buy coverage that meets new federal standards through 50 insurance exchanges, which would be run by the states. Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that provides coverage to the poor and disabled, would be expanded to cover everyone earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. In answer to budget concerns of states, the reconciliation bill would increase the federal share of the cost of covering new enrollees. Both versions of the legislation would also address the so-called doughnut hole that leaves many Medicare recipients on the hook for prescription drug costs, although in slightly different ways. Both bills require all citizens to have some form of health insurance. Under the Senate, individuals must buy insurance by 2016 or pay fines \u2014 $750 or 2 percent of income, whichever is greater. The House reconciliation bill shifts those numbers to $695 or 2.5 percent of income. The Senate bill requires companies with 50 or more employees to help pay the cost of insurance if taxpayers are primarily footing the bill for their workers' coverage. The reconciliation bill would charge firms of that size $2,000 annually per employee if they don't provide coverage, while offering an exemption to some businesses on the first 30 employees.",

But that has many in the black community feeling that a historic opportunity to address urban issues is slipping away.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A new generation of African-American leaders, like President Obama and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (pictured above at a January 2009 dinner), seem to be moving away from the identity politics of their predecessors. But that has many in the black community feeling that a historic opportunity to address urban issues is slipping away. From President Obama to prominent mayors and legislators across the country, a new wave of \"post-black leaders\" has been gaining prominence, in part by avoiding the identity politics of their predecessors.  But that inclusive outlook has translated into a painful reality for many in the black community who feel that a historic opportunity to address urban issues is slipping away, a victim to the changing political landscape, shifting demographics and a dreadful economy.  It was against that backdrop that members of the restive Congressional Black Caucus met privately Thursday with the president, who invited them to the White House to talk about his finish-line push to get health care legislation passed.  The leaders emerged from the one-hour meeting pledging to work together on an agenda that includes health care, education and the economy. But the nation's first black president no doubt got a private message from caucus members who are increasingly frustrated by what they see as Obama's lack of focus on poverty and unemployment in the African-American community. 'No Such Thing As A Black President' Obama wanted to come in as a new kind of politician, and, with the others, wanted to posture as de-racialized politicians. But they need to understand that it still matters. Leonard Moore, author of \"Carl B. Stokes and the Rise of Black Political Power\"  The caucus' complaints \u2014 publicly aired before the meeting \u2014 underscore the shifting reality for traditional African-American leaders in a world where their most prominent political descendants are stepping away from identity politics.  It's not that America is suddenly post-racial, says Manning Marable, director of Columbia University's Institute for Research in African-American Studies.  \"But there's just no such thing as a black president,\" says Marable, the author of many books on race and black leaders in America. \"Obama's base is multiracial and multiclass and a reflection of the reality of America.\"  He characterizes new black leaders, from Obama to Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, as \"post-black\" politicians who \"rarely, if ever, privilege or emphasize race in political decision-making.\"  The transformation, he argues, has been necessary and inevitable.  'They Need To Understand That [Race] Still Matters' Obama's election epitomized the rise of the new class of African-American leaders that included not only Patrick, but also high-profile mayors Cory Booker of Newark, N.J., and Adrian Fenty of Washington, D.C. But as prominent movement leaders leave the stage because of age or, in the case of longtime New York Congressman Charlie Rangel, age and scandal, some African-Americans say they feel abandoned by the new wave. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), accompanied by fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, speaks to reporters Thursday outside the White House in Washington, following a meeting with President Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), accompanied by fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus, speaks to reporters Thursday outside the White House in Washington, following a meeting with President Obama. President Obama met Thursday afternoon with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, ostensibly to talk about efforts to get health care legislation passed. But the leaders also discussed jobs and high unemployment in the African-American community. After the meeting, the White House in a statement said the president \"acknowledged the progress that has been made on the economy, while also expressing his concern for long-term unemployment. He requested that members provide specific recommendations to the challenges concerning job creation.\" Studies have shown that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately hit by the dismal economy. According to the organization United for a Fair Economy, unemployment in those communities hit a 27-year high in 2009. Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, chairwoman of the 43-member Congressional Black Caucus, attempted to mute her members' public complaints about the president that preceded the caucus' White House meeting Thursday. Emerging from the White House, Lee said caucus members have \"been working with the president since before he was the president,\" and that she didn't know where reporters had heard \"grumblings\" about Obama. -- Liz Halloran  \"When I look at Patrick, Booker and Obama, they are not traditional black politicians \u2014 they're not from the black community and they don't have a natural base,\" says Leonard Moore, author of Carl B. Stokes and the Rise of Black Political Power.  \"Obama wanted to come in as a new kind of politician, and, with the others, wanted to posture as de-racialized politicians,\" says Moore, an assistant vice president at the University of Texas at Austin. \"But they need to understand that it still matters.\"  There is frustration that the president hasn't specifically articulated black issues, Moore says, particularly the pressing problems of the urban African-American community.  Unemployment among African-Americans has been hovering around 16 percent; the overall national rate reported earlier this month was 9.7 percent. A new jobs bill, black caucus members have complained, does little to address that stark reality.  So frustration is understandable, say activists like Kristen Clarke, a civil rights lawyer for the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \"Certainly, Obama's election reflects the transformative possibilities for black American leadership,\" Clarke says.  \"But there remains a need for a very deep conversation about race \u2014 and it needs to happen at the executive branch, with civil rights group on the ground and in the communities,\" she says.  Marable argues that social advocacy is better pursued outside of electoral policy, with the end product sometimes translating into legislation.  Change Isn't Coming; It's Here, And It's Latino  The intense discussion about leadership in the black community comes at a time when the political influence story is also shifting.  The nation will embark on a new census in coming weeks, and numbers collected during the once-a-decade effort will be used to fashion congressional districts.  Census experts predict that more minority-dominated districts will emerge from the process, but they will largely be majority Latino, says Tim Storey, a redistricting expert and senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Two decades ago, following the implementation of the Voting Rights Act, there was a surge in African-American candidates and members of state legislatures, he says. Those numbers appear to have hit a plateau. Last year, there were 628 blacks among the nation's 7,382 state legislators. Blacks make up 13 percent of the nation's population and 9 percent of its state legislators. \"Really, the census story is going to be more on the Hispanic side, rather than the African-American side,\" Storey says. Growth in the Hispanic community, expected to become the nation's majority in 30 years, is far outpacing black population growth. Going forward, the only way to increase black political representation, Storey says, will be to get African-American candidates elected in more white or multirace districts. It will be all about building coalitions. Data show that about one-third of all black state legislators serving over the past few years had been elected in majority-white districts.  Hard Truths  That's the future, experts say, and one that Obama and other new-wave black politicians recognize.  Only 10 to 15 percent of whites now say they won't vote for a candidate who is black, Marable says, a dramatic change from the days when African-American candidates were typically unable to muster more than 40 percent of the vote. Race remains a fundamental factor affecting one's chances in life, he says, but it has had a rapidly declining effect on electoral politics. \"Symbolic representation that may have worked in the '60s and '70s doesn't work today,\" Marable says, calling outdated the old desire to simply have what was referred to as a \"black face in a high place.\"  Next week marks the second anniversary of then-candidate Obama's historic speech on race in America, \"A More Perfect Union.\"  ",

But according to New Yorker editor David Remnick, the key moment in Obama's political education might have been a setback. Remnick has written a new book, The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama, about Obama's journey to the White House and how that story intersects with the history of race in America. When Obama first ran for national office, in a 2000 primary against incumbent Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush, he wasn't so well-known, and the mostly African-American voters of Illinois' 1st Congressional district greeted him with skepticism. Read An Excerpt \"They saw Obama as a newcomer,\" Remnick tells NPR's Renee Montagne. \"They saw Obama as a kind of do-gooder from Harvard \u2014 and, quite frankly, somebody who was biracial, someone who was not them. He was not one of them.\" The voters weren't alone in responding badly to Obama the candidate, Remnick says. \"Everybody around Barack Obama thought this was a mistake. His wife, Michelle, his advisers, his friends \u2014 [they] all thought that running for Congress in 2000, against Bobby Rush \u2014 a former Black Panther, a big favorite on the South Side; not the greatest congressman in the world, but a big favorite nevertheless \u2014 was a gigantic mistake,\" Remnick says. \"They were right. By a margin of two-to-one, he had his head handed to him.\" Obama couldn't make any headway with the voters against Rush, \"the original authentic,\" as Remnick puts it. Obama's problem? He was an outsider, and he never located a viable political reason to be in the race. \"In most congressional districts, in order to challenge the incumbent, you have to have a reason to essentially fire the incumbent \u2014 whether it's scandal or neglect \u2014 or some reason that he should be thrown out of office,\" Remnick says. \"Obama had a small circle of followers from Hyde Park, some supporters from his state Senate district, but he was never able to convince the district that they should fire Bobby.\" To this day, Rush takes pleasure in the win. Remnick interviewed him while doing research for The Bridge. \"I've gotta say, I've never met anybody who felt better about the election of Barack Obama for president, because on the one hand, the first African-American president is a source of enormous pride, despite Rush's complicated background with Obama,\" Remnick says. \"On the other hand, Bobby Rush knew that he was the only person in the universe who had really defeated and really kicked the behind of Barack Obama.\" It was a difficult loss for Obama to take, because in addition to the drubbing, the election played out as a test of his racial credibility. Some of the 1st District's older African-American voters called Obama a carpetbagger. Even Rush, remembering the campaign, couldn't resist getting in a jab at Obama. \"At one point in our interview,\" Remnick says, \"Rush slowly ambled out of his chair and kind of did a very sinuous walk across his office and said, 'You know Barack Obama, you see him walk now like this, he didn't walk like that back then.' Which I thought was a pretty suspect way to challenge \u2014 yet again, years later \u2014 Obama's racial bona fides, his authenticity.

A community that he thought that he was part of, that he had aspired to, had rejected him and rejected him soundly. And it was quite possible that his political career was over.\" Perhaps the decision to run had been a miscalculation. But Remnick says Obama, a state senator at the time, ran because he was out of options. \"He discovered that being a state senator was dull, that his ability to make any impact was extraordinarily limited,\" Remnick says. \"To be a state senator in Illinois is not exactly what he dreamed of at Harvard law school.\" But at the time, he had little choice. \"What could he run for? To be able to run for Senate right out of the state Senate was not going to be available to him. He had to take a leap of faith and he had to risk failure. And he failed,\" Remnick says. \"And in any great career, failure is an instructive moment. That was his. That was his crucible. And he failed spectacularly.\" But it may also have been the moment that pointed Obama in the direction of his political assets. After the loss, Remnick says, Obama \"started to travel around Illinois, he started to learn the state. ... He starts discovering himself as a politician, that he has appeal much broader than somebody like Bobby Rush could ever have,\" Remnick says. \"And he learns a great deal in those travels, and then he decides to run for Senate in a very, very crowded field in 2004.\" David Remnick has been the editor of The New Yorker magazine since 1998. His 1994 book Lenin's Tomb won a Pulitzer Prize.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Remnick\n                    \n                \nhide caption Since that point, Obama hasn't lost a race he's entered. After one-sided wins in the Senate primary and general elections in 2004, he didn't even get a taste of competition, Remnick says, until the 2008 Iowa caucuses. Like the occasions where he would be on the winning side, the loss to Rush in 2000 was one-sided, and Obama quickly learned that he didn't like losing. He even flirted \u2014 briefly \u2014 with getting out of politics, Remnick says. \"He had a job interview for a foundation. This foundation would have set him up rather nicely. He would have gotten a huge salary, and he would have had all kinds of money to give away to good works. And he went into the interview and his hands were shaking and he came out of it, and basically the guy who was interviewing him said, 'Of course you can have this job, but you don't want this job.' \" It was a reality the future president couldn't deny. \"He had the addiction,\" Remnick says. \"He had the desire to be a politician. Even though he had been very suspicious of big-time politics when he had been an organizer, he left organizing convinced, in fact, that the had to go into politics because that's where the real stuff happens.\" The Life and Rise of Barack Obama by David Remnick Paperback, 662 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

            "article_content": "In many ways, David Remnick's new book, The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama, is very much like its subject: Even-handed, eloquent, beautifully packaged. Certainly, it's promising. As a journalist, Remnick is a heavyweight.  In 1994, he won the Pulitzer for his book on the Soviet Union. Now, he's at the helm of The New Yorker. And so, we have a top editor-in-chief writing about the commander in chief.  How could this not be extraordinary? The problem is, Remnick has set himself a nearly impossible task.  The Bridge attempts \"the most complete account yet\" of the most famous man on the planet -- a man scrutinized daily by the media, whose life is still a work in progress, and whose biography is known to most of us already. Thanks to Obama's own words, the public has been familiarized with much of the territory covered in The Bridge.  His Kansan-Kenyon background.  His Hawaiian-Indonesian childhood.  His personal struggles with racial identity.  His absent father. We've known about his drug use, his career missteps, his naivete. And we know, too, that Obama has \"stood on the shoulders of giants\" -- that his election is the historic culmination of a legacy that began with slave ships, marched in Selma, and preached on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. For all his skill, Remnick is largely stuck.  His biography is well-researched and articulated, but contains nothing earth-shattering.  How can it? Without resorting to tabloid journalism, the best Remnick can do is elaborate on the facts, delve into the footnotes, expand upon the broader historical contexts.  And here's where The Bridge is strongest.  You learn about the Kenyan airlift that brought Obama's father to study in the U.S. You hear Jimi Hendrix blasting in Obama's freshman dorm.  You see his restlessness, confidence and ambition laid bare. You go door to door with him as he learns to finesse Chicago's South Side. You meet his roommates, patrons, mentors. In a particularly sobering section, Remnick notes that 12 American presidents owned slaves, eight while in office; he resurrects the era viscerally with slaves' own accounts. At its best, The Bridge enriches Obama's life story with historical gravitas and fine detailing. But there's another problem.  Obama's rise has been so recent that it's hardly history yet.  Most of the people reading The Bridge will have witnessed it in real time. The section of the book that recounts the 2008 election  seems to restate the obvious. And his life and presidency are still unfolding.  In trying to bring the book up to the minute, Remnick risks obsolescence. His epilogue, written in January, is already out of date. Yet oddly, The Bridge may actually be ahead of its time. The events in it are so well-known right now that its scholarship may resonate better in 20 years, after Obama's presidency has truly become history. Future generations who haven't just lived through what it documents may find this book riveting.  The Bridge, in short, may be like young wine -- requiring time for its value and quality to emerge in full force. Or, it may be like Obama's Nobel Peace Prize -- a massive achievement that has been issued, perhaps, prematurely.

            "article_content": "The Irish government has finally agreed to a bailout from the IMF and the EU, but the fact that the country even needed international aid has angered many people there. They are angry that the government let Irish banks overextend themselves, then promised to rescue them with billions of euros of Irish taxpayers' money. Many of Ireland's 4.5 million people are also angry that their long struggle for independence from Britain in the last century will now culminate in a loss of economic sovereignty. This anger is being expressed through biting satire, music and Guinness.  MELISSA BLOCK, host: The Irish government has finally given in to international pressure and agreed to a bailout to help cover its massive debt. Prime Minister Brian Cowen says he will call an early election in January, after his government presents a new austerity budget. It's unclear whether the money will calm markets across Europe, saving Portugal and Spain from needing the same help. What is clear is that the Irish people consider this a humiliating reversal of their country's long, slow rise out of poverty. And as NPR's Philip Reeves reports, they are struggling with one overriding emotion. PHILIP REEVES: The Irish are angry. Theyre angry because their once-booming nation must now to compromise its sovereignty by signing on to a massive EU bailout. Theyre angry with their banks for recklessly running up huge debts by investing in a property bubble. Theyre even angrier with the politicians who led them to this point and especially Irelands prime minister Brian Cowen. (Soundbite of political protest) Unidentified Group: (Chanting) Cowen, Cowen, Cowen, out, out, out, out REEVES: Protestors gathered outside parliament in Dublin today, calling for Cowens resignation. They made their feelings very clear. (Soundbite of whistle) (Soundbite of shouting) Talk to almost anyone in Ireland these days, and youll find anger. Youll find indignation too and sometimes shame. The Irish are dealing with these emotions their way. Mr. PADDY CULLIVAN (Satirist): Yes, there's Brian Cowen, ladies and gentlemen, there's Brian Cowen. Brian Cowen is there. (Soundbite of laughter) REEVES: A giant picture of the Prime Minister Cowens rotund face hangs inside a pub in Dublin. In front of it stands a throng of drinkers medicating their anger with Guinness and satire. Theyre listening to a man called Paddy Cullivan. Mr. CULLIVAN: I think the most criminal thing about all of this is that the government played with people's optimism. They played with their aspirational desires to do better, to get better after hundreds of years of being a pauper state. So these are songs with names like \"Going Forward,\" or \"(unintelligible) Ruining Ourselves,\" or \"We're Living Way Beyond Our Means.\" The crime is lack of knowledge. If they didn't know what the regulators were doing, if they didn't know what the banks were doing, they should have known. Irish people are funny. They will always say things like: Ah, now, leave him alone, sure isn't he a nice fellow altogether. We do not put people in jail. We do not victimize a leader because of how we remember him. Now you can say anything about them. Do you know who A.J. Chopra is? He's the man from the IMF, not having any fun. There's no one there because they've all left the country. Oh, lots of Irish are leaving. That's the problem. And the youngest ones are. We'll be the lost generation. Like people in their 30s and late 30s, we got involved economically in the boom. We bought our first house maybe four years ago, but we bought it at a huge premium. And so we're the ones who are stuck here. We can't even leave. This is the thing. Young people can leave. REEVES: Cullivans comedy is out there. He's rude and sometimes eye-wateringly caustic. He explores the fine line between humor and rage, and sometimes rage wins. Mr. CULLIVAN: (Singing) It used to be our country when we had the means, and we had a ball. Now it's your country. It's your country, now it's worth (BEEP)-all. Mr. CULLIVAN: My big problem is that we all owe an incredible amount of money personally and as a country. And that's going to lead to terrible things because when we didn't have any money and went through recessions, we just had a little bit less. Mr. CULLIVAN: (Singing) We are where we are. It's just corporate speak... Mr. CULLIVAN: I'm not into the optimism business, but I am into the satire business, and if we can laugh at how stupid we are, possibly we don't allow stupid people to run things again because they'll be laughable. REEVES: The show ends. The drinkers pour out of the pub into the cold Dublin streets and head home. This was comedy night, but it was also about real and painful issues in Ireland, issues that directly impact the life of another performer this night: stage name, Ding Dong Denny OReilly; real name Paul Woodfull. He has three small children. Mr. PAUL WOODFULL (Writer): We've had to negotiate a reduction in our mortgage for five months, and so we are one of those people that could be thrown out, so I am personally very angry about the situation. REEVES: Ding Dongs been wondering how long the Irish can carry on joking about the way their countrys been turned upside down. Mr. WOODFULL: You kind wonder is there a tipping point where Ireland will go crazy, and when it does go crazy, maybe it'll go crazier than everywhere else because certainly we have a history of doing that.

            "article_content": "President Obama will stump in Virginia on Friday for a vulnerable freshman congressman: Democrat Tom Perriello. It's the only public campaign event the president is doing for just one House member. Perriello squeaked to victory in 2008 in Virginia's conservative 5th District, which also voted for John McCain. And he won by the narrowest margin in the country \u2014 just 727 votes. Polls show Perriello trailing his challenger, Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt. The national parties \u2014 and outside groups \u2014 have been spending like crazy on the race. A Campaign Spree Virginia's 5th District is a sprawling wedge in the middle of the state, stretching from north of Charlottesville all the way down to the North Carolina border. Rep. Tom Perriello (D-VA) (right) speaks to a potential voter during a campaign rally at Tonsler Park in Charlottesville, Va, on Oct. 10.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At midnight on Monday, the incumbent, Perriello, set out on a 24-hour campaign spree across the district. He greeted late-night truckers and steelworkers. He got a haircut, and he worked the coffee machine with a barista at Baine's Books and Coffee in Appomattox. You could imagine he was a little squeamish about being seen brewing a fancy latte when his message is aimed at the working and middle class. \"We know every day, there are individuals and families out there that are struggling, working late-night shifts, working two shifts just to be able to support their family and make it through the day,\" he said. \"And part of what we've tried so hard to do is to make it a little easier to get by in the 5th District \u2014 whether that's tax relief or helping to weatherize homes or helping to make college more affordable.\" After he met with veterans and students at Longwood University in Farmville, Perriello spoke to NPR. See Political Junkie Ken Rudin's forecast for the race in Virginia's 5th District and in other House, Senate and governor races around the country at NPR's Election Scorecard. \"The Republicans, to be honest, have the better bumper sticker and the better 30-second spot, but we have the actual plan and work ethic behind it,\" he said. \"And I think that people were saying, 'Hey, we're ready to maybe look at something else,' and looked at the Republicans and said, 'Wait a second, they're supporting the same exact stuff that got us into this mess.'\" 'Is Obama On The Ticket?' At a Perriello phone bank at the campaign office in Farmville, a sign on the wall reminds workers of that whisker-thin margin two years ago. \"In this election, the ground game is everything,\" says Lucas Brown, the regional field director for the Perriello campaign. \"It's such a narrow margin that it's going to be all about turnout.\" Joy Speakes, working the phones at Farmville headquarters, says when she was 12 years old \u2014 in 1951 \u2014 she joined a walkout at the segregated, all-black high school to protest atrocious conditions there. The court case that followed ended up in the Supreme Court, as part of Brown v. Board of Education. Speakes is looking at this election \u2014 thinking about that history \u2014 and trying to tap into the excitement Barack Obama generated two years ago, as she talks to voters. \"They'll say to me, 'Is Obama on the ticket?' And for awhile, I was saying no \u2014 he's not on the ticket. But then, the next time I got a call and they asked me was Obama on the ticket, I said yes, he is,\" she says. \"His name is not on the ticket, but you need to get out to vote because he cannot keep his agenda going if you don't vote for the people that supported him. So then, they begin to understand.\" Virginia State Sen. Robert Hurt greets constituents before a Family Foundation Dinner at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in   Martinsville, Va., in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption 'They're Mad As Heck' Not far away is the county Republican headquarters. It's front and center on Main Street in Farmville and painted bright red. \"There's a lot of interest out there in this particular election,\" says Paul Hoffman, the Robert Hurt campaign chairman for Prince Edward County. \"I think a lot of people see the trend of the rampant growth of the national debt, the trend of much more intrusive government programs that interfere with their liberties \u2014 and their ability to live their lives the way they choose to live their lives \u2014 and they're mad as heck and they're not going to take anymore.\" As for Tom Perriello running as an independent Democrat in 2008? \"Yes, he's bucked the system a little, but on the key bills of Obamacare, cap and trade, and the stimulus bill, he voted lockstep with the Democratic leadership in Washington,\" Hoffman says. The Republican committee chairman for the county will be voting in his first election this year. Daniel Bradshaw is just 18 years old. He thinks the Virginia electorate this year will look far different from two years ago. \"We had voters come out in 2008 that had never come out before \u2014 and I highly doubt they'll ever come out again,\" he says. 'We're In The Short Rows' As Hurt, the Republican nominee, greets a crowd of veterans in Danville on the southern edge of Virginia, he thanks a supporter and tells him, \"We're in the short rows now.\" That's tobacco-pulling talk: You start with the long rows in the middle of the field; save the corner for last. Hurt was thanking Dave Newman \u2014 a veteran who served with the 25th Infantry in Korea. Newman wants a balanced budget, less spending and more jobs in this district, where there are pockets of unemployment of more than 20 percent. \"You know, I was raised in a Democrat home,\" he says. \"My dad would have voted for that donkey they got if they hadn't run a person. And what's happened is, the party has left the people.\" When Hurt talks to the veterans, he talks about a return to limited government, free enterprise and individual liberty. \"If you stop and think about our founders \u2014 and we're very, very proud of the founders that are connected to our 5th District \u2014 James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry \u2014 you know, when you stop and think about those men, and you stop and think about what they understood about tyranny, and what they understood about freedom, I can tell you, it brings this election, I think, even more to forefront.\" Afterward, Hurt says Perriello has consistently marched with the Democratic leadership \u2014 and that makes him out of step with voters in Virginia's 5th District. \"I think very much that people want to pull the emergency brake on this thing,\" he says. \"We've got to pull the brake on these policies that I think are taking us over a cliff. But by the same token, we have got to have the guts to make the tough choices and we have to have the guts to lead.\" Voters' Views On Farmville's Main Street, Linda Yoder, an independent voting for Hurt, says Hurt understands small business \u2014 she owns a real estate company. She likes the idea of health care reform but thinks the law went too far. \"I don't think that it is a guaranteed right, like life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\" she says. \"Just like not everyone can afford a BMW and a Lincoln, maybe not everyone can afford the same health care coverage. Not everyone can afford to eat lobster two nights a week \u2014 some people eat hot dogs.\" Right across Main Street from Yoder's company is Harlan Horton's law office. A Perriello supporter, he says the congressman is honest, works hard and comes to town often. \"I actually talked to Tom Perriello last Friday \u2014 he was in my office for a pretty long conversation. And I think there is some anti-incumbent sentiment, but I think Tom Perriello could actually stay. I mean, I think he might win.\" But Horton does know voters who are flipping: They voted for Perriello two years ago, but are turning to the Republican this year. Perriello has to hope that Obama's rally in Virginia on Friday will help him turn out enough voters to keep his seat. Republicans are banking on just the opposite: that the president's visit will drive their voters to the polls on Tuesday to vote Perriello out.",

Roosevelt and his heart remained very much with the working class of which he had once been a member as a letter carrier. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act in 1935.\n                \n                    \n                    Anonymous/National Archives\n                    \n                \nhide caption I remember visiting his house once as a much younger man and, during a discussion about Social Security, saying maybe it should be means tested to reduce benefits to more affluent retirees to leave more money in the system, extending its solvency. You would have thought I said I hated Herman Melville. Both this gentle man and his equally gentle wife just about jumped down my throat. You can't do that, they said. We earned that money, they said. We remained friends but I never broached that subject again. That's why Social Security got to be known as the third rail of American politics. Politicians quickly learned that talking about anything that threatened to reduce benefits was political suicide. If an old, left of center married couple could get exercised about it, better to leave it alone. One exception was then-President George W. Bush who in early 2005 at the start of his second term indicated he wanted to use his political capital to pursue partially privatizing Social Security. That, of course, didn't work the way he had hoped. Social Security remains the third rail. And Democrats are hoping it has as much electricity flowing through it this year as it ever has. NPR's Scott Horsley reported on Morning Edition that Democrats are hoping to slow down the momentum of some Tea Party-backed candidates by defining them as anti-Social Security in voters' minds. An excerpt of his report: SCOTT: This year, Social Security is paying out more money in benefits than it's collecting in payroll taxes. \u00a0That trend will accelerate later in the decade, as more and more baby-boomers retire. Republican Senate candidate Joe Miller of Alaska told ABC Social Security is fine for today's seniors, but young people need a different option. MILLER: \"Ultimately, \u00a0we've got to transition out of the Social Security arrangement and go into more of a privatization. \u00a0And it's not that radical an idea.\" SCOTT: Other Senate candidates backed by the Tea Party, including Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado, have also endorsed private retirement accounts for younger workers, though all three caution existing benefits should be preserved for today's retirees. Despite that qualifier, President Obama and other Democrats have seized on the Tea Party candidates' privatization comments in an effort to paint them as extremists whose vision of government can't be trusted. OBAMA: \"As long as I'm President, no one is going to take the retirement savings of a generation of Americans and hand it over to Wall Street. \u00a0Not on my watch.\" (applause) SCOTT: Defending Social Security against Tea Party candidates has also become a staple of Democratic campaign ads, like this one in Colorado, directed at Republican candidate Ken Buck. AD VOICEOVER:\"Buck wants to privatize Social Security. And he even questioned whether Social Security should exist at all.\" ROBERT SHAPIRO: \"Democrats will try at every opportunity to go after\u00a0Republicans where they're vulnerable. That may be one vulnerability.\" SCOTT: Political scientist Robert Shapiro of Columbia University says if Republicans are vulnerable on this issue, it's because Social Security is very popular. \u00a0In a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, more than two out of three people said they'd be less comfortable backing a candidate who wants to privatize it. SHAPIRO:\"Social Security still has enormous support among all segments of the public.\"",

It doesn't seem to matter whether you're a Republican or a Democrat -- if you're a political incumbent and your place of business is Washington, D.C., your name is mud. One incumbent in serious trouble is Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, who is heading into a runoff Tuesday against Lt. Gov. Bill Halter to decide the Democratic nomination. A week before the primary vote on May 18, polls showed Lincoln with about a 9-point lead. But those polls were wrong. Lincoln barely beat Halter and came nowhere near the 50 percent margin she needed to win outright. Two weeks later, Lincoln is hoping the polls are wrong again -- because now they show Halter slightly in the lead. Incumbent Discontent It is not easy being an incumbent these days. Voters are unhappy about the economy, the deficit, the oil spill, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the job situation, the bank bailouts -- it's an extensive list. Sen. Blanche Lincoln says she shares voters' frustrations with the government.\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Johnston/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Blanche Lincoln says she shares voters' frustrations with the government. If voters don't know exactly what they would have done differently had they been in charge, they know they have seen enough of those who have been calling the shots. In Lincoln\u2019s latest ad, she acknowledges the widespread discontent. \"I know you\u2019re angry at Washington. Believe me, I heard you on May 18,\" she says in the ad. \"But I won\u2019t back down to the Washington unions or the Wall Street banks that don't care about Arkansas. And I won\u2019t back down as the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in fighting for child nutrition and family farms. ... I\u2019d rather lose this election fighting for what\u2019s right than win by turning my back on Arkansas.\" Reaching Out During a recent campaign stop at an early voting location in Conway, Ark., Lincoln finds a group of about 25 supporters. \"How\u2019s our early voting going?\" she asks. In a parking lot, the senator subtly points out that while voters are angry with elected officials, there is a flip side to the incumbency coin. \"I share their anger; I share their frustration. I went to Washington to make change and I think I\u2019ve worked hard to get into places where I can,\" she says. \"I produced the toughest bill on Wall Street of anybody up there. I also took over as chairman of the Ag Committee and produced the largest increase in child nutrition in the history of the program.\" Lincoln knows if rural Arkansas is going to develop economically, federal money is going to have to be a big part of that. Many in the small crowd are Lincoln staff or volunteers, but one man has made his way here to ask the senator for her help. He asks Lincoln if she's familiar with a central Arkansas water project, and Lincoln assures him that money is in the pipeline to keep the project going. Arkansas Lt. Gov. Bill Halter is running as a populist outsider and has attracted support from trade unions and progressive groups.\n                \n                    \n                    Danny Johnston/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arkansas Lt. Gov. Bill Halter is running as a populist outsider and has attracted support from trade unions and progressive groups. The Challenger Thirty miles away in Little Rock, Lincoln\u2019s opponent is standing outside his campaign headquarters, getting reports from the field. Halter\u2019s candidacy and success might seem improbable in state like Arkansas. He\u2019s running as a populist outsider and has attracted support from trade unions and progressive groups like MoveOn.org. His candidacy is partly a response to Democratic frustration with Lincoln\u2019s inconsistency on the health care bill and her refusal to support the Employee Free Choice Act. Halter's good looks and articulate style have resonated to a degree that has surprised many pundits here, and he has positioned himself as an advocate for working- and middle-class voters. \"I\u2019ve said that the first bill that I will introduce as United States senator is a bill to remove the tax incentives that currently encourage American companies to ship jobs oversees and to replace those tax incentives with tax credits for those companies that create jobs here in Arkansas or across America,\" he says. \"That is something that resonates strongly with Arkansas voters.\" Unexpected Support Unlike most challengers, Halter also has had plenty of money for television advertising -- including a recent spot blasting Lincoln for accepting campaign contributions from oil and gas companies. By attacking corporate elites and their political allies in Washington, Halter has garnered support from some surprising places. Like rural Arkansas, for example, where Lincoln, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, was expected to trounce Halter -- but didn\u2019t. \"Well, that\u2019s the beautiful and strange thing here. I would bet that a lot of those rural white swing voters don\u2019t know that Halter owes his candidacy to labor unions and organizations like MoveOn.org,\" says Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas and director of the Arkansas Poll. \"On his TV ads, he was very effective about beating the drum about Washington being broken. And that was very attractive to those rural white swing voters who make or break elections here in Arkansas.\" The contest is so close it is within the margin of polling error. The current political wisdom is that Lincoln and Halter are simply vying for the right to get trounced by the Republican candidate, John Boozman, come November. But as Halter has already proved, Arkansas politics can be unpredictable, and November is many months away.",

            "article_content": "At his press conference this week, President Obama aimed his harshest rhetoric at Republicans -- likening them to hostage-takers with a gun to the head of middle-class taxpayers. But he also described those Democrats who were willing to risk tax hikes for the middle class as \"sanctimonious\" and \"purist.\" Since the midterm elections, Chris Lehane, a former aide to President Bill Clinton, had been wondering whether Obama intended to move to the center and triangulate between the two parties, like Clinton did, or hunker down on the left, like President Harry Truman did. Lehane he says he got his answer. \"He chose the triangulation path,\" Lehane says. \"But ... the distinction here is that Truman and Clinton -- each different path worked for both of those individuals because they ultimately knew where they were going. They had a governing philosophy behind it; the public knew where they ultimately wanted to go.\" Lehane says that's Obama's real problem -- not whether he's moving left or right. \"For this president, I just don't think the public has necessarily picked up on what that governing philosophy is,\" he says, \"so each of these decisions he faces becomes these one-off moments, and the public really doesn't understand what's ultimately behind the decision-making.\" Democrats in the House certainly don't. Right now, they and the White House look like they're in a bad marriage. House Democrats are furious over a deal to extend tax breaks for the wealthy, and they feel cut out of the negotiations between the White House and the Republicans. Falling Into A Trap? White House aides deny they have a conscious political strategy to triangulate, and Obama has often said he won't use his liberal base as a foil just to prove he's in the center. But it's also true that the president's advisers don't think they have a problem with their base. Instead, they feel they need to work harder to get independent voters back on the president's side. Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg says the president has to do both. \"The cruel math of presidential politics is that a lot more people who voted for the president were Democrats than were independents,\" he says. \"It's going to be ... as important keeping the Democrats happy who voted for him as it is shoring up some weakness in independents. He's got to do both -- there's not a choice here.\" The White House has tried furiously over the past two days to convince its own troops that, dollar for dollar, they got more in the tax-cut deal than the Republicans did. But some supporters of the president -- even those who agree this is the best deal he could have gotten -- are wondering whether this is the model for the new balance of power in Washington, where the president is unable to control the debate. \"That's what's keeping me up at night,\" says John Podesta, former chief of staff to Clinton. Willing To Fight? Podesta says there will be plenty of traps ahead. \"In this particular circumstance, I think he made a tough choice but the right choice,\" he says. \"The Republicans are going to try to repeat this over and over and over again. ... So he's going to have to anticipate that, not get caught in the circumstance where you really are left with very few or no choices and ... prepare the public and prepare the battleground to win those fights.\" This, says Podesta, is at the heart of congressional Democrats' angst -- whether it's the coming showdown over the debt limit or the epic battle about to begin over the budget and the deficit. Podesta says Democrats are not sure the president is willing to have those fights or able to define them on his own terms. \"They're looking into 2011 and 2012, and all they see is fog,\" he says. \"They don't see a clear plan of where the priorities are going to be, what investments need to be made. ... They see fog -- there needs to be clarity. And I think that the president has the chance in the State of the Union to reset the table -- to provide that clarity, to draw the right lines that the American public can understand, so that there's a clear choice.\" But Obama says, in effect, not to worry. As he said on Tuesday, he has plenty of lines in the sand. \"I will be happy to see the Republicans test whether or not I'm itching for a fight on a whole range of issues. I suspect they will find I am,\" he said. The problem is that, right now, his own party in Congress isn't sure he'll pass that test.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives steamrolled over Republican objections Thursday to pass a permanent extension of the Bush era middle-class tax cuts for taxpayers making up to $250,000. The move is purely symbolic since it stands little to no chance of getting Senate approval. Senate Republicans have insisted that the tax cuts also be extended for those with income above $250,000. But House Democrats and President Obama have so far rejected a permanent extension for the higher income taxpayers, saying it would cost about $700 billion over ten years. The Bush tax cuts are due to expire at the end of December. With a smile, Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced the bill's passage by a 234-188 vote. Earlier in the day, the next speaker, Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) called the Democratic maneuver \"chicken crap.\" Actually, what he told reporters was: I\u2019m trying to catch my breath so I don\u2019t refer to this maneuver that is going on today as chicken crap, all right. This is nonsense, all right? The election was one month ago. We are 23 months until the next election, and the political games have already started trying to set up the next election. The move will allow House Democrats to boast that they kept their vow to extend the tax cuts to the middle class and deny them to wealthier taxpayers who, they argue, have received an unfair amount of the nation's income during the last decade. The vote also comes against a backdrop of White House negotiations with congressional Republicans over extending the tax cuts, discussions which have reportedly gone nowhere fast.",

Mohamed ElBaradei's National Association for Change movement has gathered 900,000 signatures on a petition to amend the constitution and end the stranglehold President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party has over elections. Egypt is holding parliamentary elections on Sunday and President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party is widely expected to win most of the seats. However, after nearly 30 years in office, whether Mubarak will run again in presidential elections next year is far less clear. The 82-year-old is one of the world's oldest leaders and has served longer than any Egyptian ruler since the mid-19th century. Growing rumors about his declining health have many questioning whether he can handle another term. That prospect of a change in leadership has both the ruling National Democratic Party and its opponents jockeying for control, and\u00a0already has led to violence in this parliamentary election season. On Nov. 19, security forces clashed with participants at campaign rallies around Egypt sponsored by the Muslim Brotherhood. The group is a banned political movement, but through influence with independent lawmakers like Sobhy Saleh, the Muslim Brotherhood controls one in five seats in parliament. Saleh witnessed a two-hour long clash between Brotherhood supporters and police in his home district in Alexandria that erupted after a speeding armored car drove into the crowd, injuring 17 people. Parliament member Sobhy Saleh, an independent aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, greets supporters in his neighborhood in Alexandria. The area strongly supports the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned as a political movement in Egypt.\n                \n                    \n                    Holly Pickett for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Parliament member Sobhy Saleh, an independent aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, greets supporters in his neighborhood in Alexandria. The area strongly supports the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned as a political movement in Egypt. The lower-middle class neighborhood he represents is called El Raml. It is teeming with apartment buildings and residents rush out to greet Saleh whenever he is on the streets. But in this staunchly pro-Muslim Brotherhood district, all of the campaign banners and posters are for Saleh's opponent from the ruling party. Residents and shopkeepers say they support Saleh, but that police pressured them to display the ruling party ads. Saleh\u00a0is worried\u00a0the government won't stop there. \"I trust the voters,\" he said. \"But I don't trust the authorities not to throw this election. They don't respect the law, the constitution or even court orders.\" Saleh has cause to be worried. His seat is one of the many opposition seats the government has decided to go after in the 518-member parliament. Experts say a compliant parliament with no meaningful opposition will make it easier for the ruling party to hand-pick a successor to Mubarak should one be needed.

The government appears to be leaving nothing to chance. It virtually eliminated judicial oversight of Sunday's polling and is limiting the voting period to one day instead of three. Critics complain the steps make it more difficult to independently monitor the polls, meaning the vote will be more vulnerable to fraud. In Cairo, some activists are training to be informal poll watchers in hope of spotting fraud. They are part of a group garnering signatures across Egypt for a petition that seeks to amend the constitution and end the ruling party's stranglehold over elections. The petition drive -- organizers say it has gathered 900,000 signatures thus far -- was inspired by Mohammed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Many reform-minded Egyptians would like to see ElBaradei run for president. Petition organizer Abdul Rahman Yusuf says a key goal is to convince Egyptians that meaningful political reforms can happen safely and peacefully. But he and others say such reforms won't come in time for next year's presidential elections, even if Mubarak steps down. Posters supporting Gamal Mubarak, Hosni Mubarak's son, for next year's  presidential race have sprung up in Alexandria.\n                \n                    \n                    Holly Pickett for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Posters supporting Gamal Mubarak, Hosni Mubarak's son, for next year's  presidential race have sprung up in Alexandria. If Mubarak decides to retire, many Egyptians think the president might give the nod to his younger son, Gamal, to succeed him. The younger Mubarak is an investment banker and powerbroker in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). But he lacks military experience and is said to be at odds with some of the old guard. Nevertheless, his supporters plastered what appeared to be Gamal Mubarak campaign posters on public buildings and along several streets in central Alexandria last week. That is illegal, although the dozens of police officers in the area did nothing to remove them \"Yes we support you,\" the posters say in Arabic. They also propose a \"revolution of love, and intifada (uprising) of the people.\" Gamal Mubarak has some advantages over other ruling party prospects, says Hala Mustafa, a member of the NDP policy secretariat and editor of Democracy Review magazine, published by the state-funded al Ahram Foundation. \"He's the youngest, so it means that he could be more flexible in dealing with the causes and the issues of the future,\" she said. Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world. While Mubarak has slowly introduced political and economic reforms, the government has struggled to meet the demands of its people.

But ruling party spokesman Ali El Dean Hillal says it is too soon to be talking about who will be president after Hosni Mubarak. He refused to confirm or deny news reports that quoted him announcing Mubarak will run again. But he vehemently denied other reports claiming a power struggle over succession is underway within the National Democratic Party. \"What I can tell you, and I sit on all the high councils of the NDP, \u2026 there's not much discussion about that because we don't feel the need for doing it,\" he said. Hillal adds that is because Mubarak is still a very active leader with a keen mind. Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to the United States and dean of the School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at American University in Cairo, says it is clear that Egypt's next president, even if it isn't Mubarak, will belong to the NDP. He said he hopes the NDP has a more realistic margin of victory -- such as 60 percent rather than 80 percent. (The ruling party won 70 percent of the seats in parliament in the last elections in 2005.) \"The competition is what makes you feel like you are accountable,\" Fahmy said. To him, that would be a meaningful sign that Egypt's democracy is evolving. But many critics of the government say accountability won't come unless there are constitutional reforms. They want limits on how much power one party can wield and how long one man can rule Egypt.",

The people of the slum have grown cynical over the years and no longer get their hopes up when government officials and journalists come around to ask about life here. Aida Abdel-Fattah, 50, is the wife of a retired government printer. The couple raised six children here in this Cairene version of a Depression-era Hooverville. She is among the more outspoken residents. Abdel-Fattah says that after a massive rockslide in 2008 killed scores of her neighbors, her makeshift compound was scheduled to be torn down. She says officials told the 11 families who live here that they would be moved to government-built apartments down the road. The municipal inspectors came several times and urged them to be ready to move, she says. But two years later, Abdel-Fattah is still here, even though some of the shanties were badly damaged by the rockslide and appear to be ready to collapse. Abdel-Fattah accuses her landlord, who owns several compounds in this illegal district, of paying off the inspectors. Kind of like the bribes that she pays the electric company workers who come around every few months to threaten the families for stealing power from the main lines.\u00a0(As their homes are illegal, there is no lawful way for Abdel-Fattah to tap into the power grid). She says she doesn't hold out hope of ever getting into the government-built apartments.

At a post G-20 news conference in Seoul, S. Korea, the president also roundly debunked the Huffington Post report that he was surrendering to Republicans on an extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. CNN'S Dan Lothian asked the president the questions about his international stature post-Election Day and possibly extending the tax cuts for the highest income earners. The relevant excerpt from the news conference: DAN LOTHIAN: \u00a0Thank you.\u00a0 After the midterm elections you said that you were open to compromise on the Bush tax cuts.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re prepared today to say that you\u2019re willing to accept a temporary extension for the wealthiest Americans?\u00a0 And then on an unrelated question, do you feel that the election has weakened you on the global stage? THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The answer to the second question is no.\u00a0 I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last several days as we\u2019ve traveled through Asia is that people are eager to work with America, eager to engage with America on economic issues, on security issues, on a whole range of mutual interests. And that\u2019s especially true in Asia, where we see such enormous potential.\u00a0 This is the fastest-growing part of the world.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got to be here and we\u2019ve got to work.\u00a0 And I\u2019m absolutely confident that my administration over the next two years is going to continue to make progress in ensuring that the United States has a presence here not just for the next couple of years but for decades to come. With respect to the Bush tax cuts, what I\u2019ve said is that I\u2019m going to meet with both the Republican and Democratic leaders late next week and we\u2019re going to sit down and discuss how we move forward.\u00a0 My number-one priority is making sure that we make the middle-class tax cuts permanent, that we give certainty to the 98 percent of Americans who are affected by those tax breaks. I don\u2019t want to see their income taxes spike up -- not only because they need relief after having gone through a horrendous recession, but also because it would be bad for the economy. I continue to believe that extending permanently the upper-income tax cuts would be a mistake and that we can\u2019t afford it.\u00a0 And my hope is, is that somewhere in between there we can find some sort of solution.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not going to negotiate here in Seoul.\u00a0 My job is to negotiate back in Washington with Republican and Democratic leaders. The president's message that he still had the same juice as before on the world stage despite his party's \"shellacking\" wasn't necessarily undermined by his failure to complete the negotiation of a free-trade agreement with South Korea that he inherited from the Bush Administration. Opening up the U.S. to further Asian imports was always going to be a difficult lift, to say the least, at a time when the U.S. economy is struggling to add jobs domestically. But if Obama really couldn't be expected to say \"Yes, the election left me weaker on the world stage\" others were certainly willing to suggest as much. The Washington Post, for instance, reported under the headline \"Obama, weakened after midterms, reveals limited leverage in failed S. Korea deal\": Although no one has said that Obama was unable to reach agreement directly because of his midterm losses, neither Lee nor other leaders in Seoul for the Group of 20 summit appear eager to help him with his biggest concerns or ingratiate themselves with the American president, as they had a year ago. For his part, Obama said it was a matter of his novelty and all the hype wearing off: When I first came into office, people might have been interested in more photo ops because there had been a lot of hoopla surrounding my election.\u00a0 But I now have a genuine friendship with Prime Minister Singh of India and I think that he and I share a level of understanding and interest in working together that didn\u2019t exist when I first came onto the scene.\u00a0 I think the same is true for Chancellor Merkel; the same is true for Prime Minister Erdogan; the same is true for President Lee. That doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t going to be differences, but -- the same is true for my relationship with President Hu.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t any easier to talk about currency when I had just been elected and my poll numbers were at 65 percent than it is now.\u00a0 It was hard then and it\u2019s hard now.\u00a0 Because this involves the interests of countries and not all of these are going to be resolved easily.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not just a function of personal charm. It\u2019s a function of countries\u2019 interests and seeing if we can work through to align them. NPR's own Scott Horsley got to ask a question, too, which was essentially: have the G-20 nations lost their sense of urgency now that the worst of the global financial crisis seems to have passed? Obama allowed that had happened to a degree. And Scott's question led the president to a baseball metaphor: THE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think what it means is that in the absence of crisis people probably are willing to hunker down a little bit more on some of the negotiations.\u00a0 Speed seems less of the essence, and so people think, well, if it doesn\u2019t get solved now maybe we can put this off for another day. What\u2019s remarkable to me, though, is despite some of those impulses we're still getting stuff done.\u00a0 And as I emphasized before, we should not anticipate that every time countries come together that we are doing some revolutionary thing.\u00a0 Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.\u00a0 But they\u2019re really important singles.\u00a0 And I just listed some of these out. IMF reform -- this is something that folks have been talking about for a decade or more.\u00a0 It\u2019s gotten done.\u00a0 Financial regulatory reform -- huge lift -- that we talked about in my first G20 summit, it is now coming to fruition.\u00a0 We've still got some more work to do but we've made enormous progress in a huge\u00a0 -- really short period of time.\u00a0 Basel II I think took a decade to negotiate; we got this done basically in a year and a half.",

But he appeared intent on positioning himself as reasonable, only seeking to do the work of the American people even in his new, weaker circumstances, at least on domestic affairs. To that end, his remarks after a cabinet meeting are part of the continued olive branch of bipartisanship he wants to be seen extending to congressional Republicans. If anyone gets blamed for the expected legislative gridlock of the next two years, he doesn't want it to be him. The president said will have Congress' four top leaders over to the White House on Nov. 18 in a meeting he promises will be more than a photo op. Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) the man expected to be the next House speaker, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ken.) may even stay for dinner, depending on how long the meeting goes. Obama indicated. I mentioned yesterday we have to act in order to assure that middle-class families don\u2019t see a big tax spike because of how the big tax cuts have been structured. It is very important that we extend those middle-class tax provisions to hold middle-class families harmless. But there are a whole range of other economic issues that have to be addressed: unemployment insurance for folks who are still out there looking for work; business extenders, which are essentially provisions to encourage businesses to invest here in the United States, and if we don\u2019t have those, we\u2019re losing a very important tool for us to be able to increase business investment and increase job growth over the coming year. We\u2019ve got to provide businesses some certainty about what their tax landscape is going to look like, and we\u2019ve got to provide families certainty. That\u2019s critical to maintain our recovery. I should mention that in addition to those economic issues, there are some things during the lame duck that relate to foreign policy that are going to be very important for us to deal with, and I\u2019ll make mention of one in particular, and that\u2019s the START treaty. We have negotiated with the Russians significant reductions in our nuclear arms. This is something that traditionally has received strong bipartisan support. We\u2019ve got people like George Shultz, who helped to organize arms control treaties with the Russians back when it was the Soviet Union who have come out forcefully in favor of this. This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue but rather a issue of American national security. And I am hopeful that we can get that done before we leave and send a strong signal to Russia that we are serious about reducing nuclear arsenals, but also sending a signal to the world that we\u2019re serious about nonproliferation. The president noted that he would soon be leaving for Asia and South Asia on what is largely a trade mission meant to boost the economic prospects of U.S. companies and workers. He noted that the developing countries that increasingly compete economically with the U.S., especially China and India, wouldn't be slowing their efforts to be even competitive with the U.S. So the U.S. couldn't afford to slow down either. It allowed him to reprise comments he made when he stumped for Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. So, in sum, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. People are still catching their breath from the election. The dust is still settling. But the one thing I\u2019m absolutely certain of is that the American people don\u2019t want us just standing still and they don\u2019t want us engaged in gridlock. They want us to do the people\u2019s business, partly because they understand that the world is not standing still. If gridlock happens despite his public pleas for bipartisanship, such comments as Thursday's will allow Obama to argue that he reached out but was rebuffed by Republicans. He will be able to then run for re-election against a do-nothing Congress just as President Truman did in 1948.",

            "article_content": "Hours after Republicans captured the  House of Representatives and  slashed the Democratic majority in the  Senate, a subdued President  Obama said in  a White House  news conference that voters were mostly preoccupied with  the slow economic recovery. Obama  would not concede that a Republican election rout marked a  massive repudiation of his agenda, but he did shoulder the blame for deep  voter frustration over the economy.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A sober President Obama acknowledged Wednesday that he took \"a shellacking\" in the midterm election and that his once highflying relationship with the American voter had hit rocky times. \"There is an inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble,\" said the president, whose party on Tuesday lost control of the House in a historic Republican wave. The GOP is expected to gain at least 60 seats, the biggest increase in more than seven decades. Democrats barely clung to their Senate majority. \"The responsibilities of this office are so enormous,\" Obama said, that \"sometimes we lose track of the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place.\" Working With Republicans The president, who drew comparisons with midterm losses suffered by presidents Reagan and Clinton during their first terms, pledged to work with GOP leaders on issues ranging from tax cuts to modest forward movement on energy policy, But he warned Republicans that while frustrated voters may have spurned him and his party, they want to move forward and not \"relitigate\" the past two years. GOP leaders, including House Speaker-in-waiting John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, clearly disagree: They say they are poised to immediately start overhauling the recent health care legislation. At a Wednesday morning press conference, Boehner referred to the health care initiative as a \"monstrosity\" that needs to be replaced. McConnell said voters sent a message that they want to stop Obama's agenda. Republican leaders say they are committed to a smaller government and have called for discretionary spending to be curtailed to 2008 levels. Gridlock Or Common Ground? Obama defended his administration's initiatives -- from the economic stimulus package to the auto industry bailout, as well as the health care bill -- as tough decisions that were \"right for moving the country forward.\" \"It's understandable that folks said to themselves, maybe this is the agenda as opposed to a response to an emergency,\" he said, and viewed it as an overreach with the \"price tags that went with that.\" He suggested that Americans would have been more confident in the administration's actions if the nation's unemployment rate was 5 percent now instead of 9.6 percent. While legislative gridlock seems likely going into the 2012 presidential campaign, Obama listed several areas that he believes Democrats and Republicans may find common ground. He wants to renew a conversation on energy policy -- though something far less than the comprehensive House plan that stalled in the Senate. He said he's open to negotiating terms of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at year's end, and he even said he was open to tweaking health care legislation in areas of concern to Republicans. Republicans are looking to permanently extend Bush tax cuts for wealthier Americans; Democrats -- including Obama -- have sought to end those cuts, but extend tax cuts for the middle class. The president Wednesday appeared newly open to negotiation. And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn\u2019t change how things got done. And I think that frustrated people. President Obama, acknowledging that he had disappointed supporters Obama also touted his coming trip to Asia as proof of his administration's efforts to open markets and create new American jobs. An 'Ugly Mess' He also took a look back at the past two years and acknowledged that he had disappointed supporters. \"When I won election in 2008, one of the reasons I think that people were excited about the campaign was the prospect that we would change how business is done in Washington,\" he said. \"And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn't change how things got done. And I think that frustrated people.\" He seemed contrite when asked specifically about the wheeling and dealing that he and the administration engaged in during the health care debate. The negotiations, he said, were an \"ugly mess\" and affected how people ultimately viewed the final legislation. \"I regret that we couldn't have made the process more, healthier than it ended up being,\" he said. \"But I think the outcome was a good one.\" Obama took responsibility for Tuesday's losses, expressed sadness for Democratic lawmakers who lost while standing by the administration's policies, and defended his more controversial efforts. Pronouncing himself humbled, he pledged to negotiate with Republicans on a much less aggressive agenda. \"Over the last two years we have made progress,\" Obama said, \"but clearly too many Americans haven't felt that progress yet and they told us that yesterday. \"As president, I take responsibility for that,\" he said.",

The news conference was dominated by politics. We updated this post and our headline with highlights. Update at 1:58 p.m. ET. Last question:\u00a0Was the outcome of the election a sign that voters think he's out of touch with their economic pain? \"There is an inherent danger in being ... in the bubble\" of the White House, Obama says. When he was campaigning in 2007 and 2008, the president continues, many voters seemed to think he understood them. But \"when you're in this place (the White House), it is hard not to seem removed.\" He has to figure out how to do what needs to be done on the job, Obama says, while also \"getting out of here\" to let Americans see, hear and talk to him. It's a process, according to Obama, that all presidents go through. \"I'm not recommending to every future president that they go through a shellacking like I did last night\" in order to help them get that message, he jokes. Update at 1:48 p.m. ET: A bit of humor. Will he invite soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner to the White House for a Slurpee? (During the campaign, Obama often said Republicans were standing back at the site of a hypothetical car crash, sipping on Slurpees and asking to get the keys back.) Maybe, says the president, \"they're delicious drinks! ... A Slurpee summit.\" Update at 1:45 p.m. ET: You said during the campaign that Republicans would put the nation \"into reverse.\" Have voters told you that it's your policies that would move America backward? No, says Obama. He rejects that notion because when he took office \"the economy was in a freefall.\" Now, \"it has stabilized,\" though \"you can argue it's stuck in neutral.\" Update at 1:37 p.m. ET: Is he willing to negotiate on how the \"Bush tax cuts\" are extended? \"Absolutely,\" Obama says, after also stressing that his priority is to protect middle class families and businesses. President Obama, as he answered a question today.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images  \n                    \n                \nhide caption Update at 1:35 p.m. ET: How does it feel, Obama is asked, to see so many Democrats go down to defeat -- in particular some, such as Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia, who worked hard for his agenda? \"It feels bad,\" Obama says. He's \"seeing really terrific public servants, not having the opportunity to serve anymore.\" Update at 1:32 p.m. ET. Question: You've said before that \"elections have consequences,\" are there \"areas you would be willing to compromise on\" after yesterday's returns? \"I've been willing to compromise in the past and I'm willing to compromise going forward,\" Obama says, citing energy policy as one area where he says that's happened. Update at 1:29 p.m. ET. Question: Is any more economic stimulus spending \"dead at this point\" because of opposition to increasing the national debt? \"The question that my Republican friends and me and Democratic leaders have to answer is 'what are our priorities?',\" Obama says. He goes on to talk about the need for investments in education, infrastructure, transportation, technology and other areas. Policymakers, says Obama, must distinguish between \"stuff that isn't adding to our growth ... and those things that are absolutely necessary\" to boost job growth now and over the long haul. \"Without any Republican support on anything it's going to be hard to get things done,\" Obama adds. But, he says, it would be wrong to predict that the GOP will block all such efforts. Update at 1:20 p.m. ET.\u00a0Question: Is his health care overhaul in danger of being repealed? \"We'd be misreading the election if we thought the American people want to see us for the next two years relitigate\" the arguments of the past two years, Obama says. He is \"happy to consider\" Republican ideas on health care if they would produce (in his opinion) \"faster and more effective reform,\" says the president. Update at 1:18 p.m. ET: Continuing to address the question about whether he does or does not \"get it,\" the president says that he was elected in part because many Americans were excited about changing the way things are done in Washington. But, \"we were in such a hurry to get things done, that we didn't change how things got done,\" Obama says. \"And I think that frustrated people.\" Voters, the president says, are more frustrated by the \"outcomes\" -- in particular high unemployment -- than by the policies he has pursued. Update at 1:15 p.m. Second question: If you're not reflecting on the decisions you've made, could voters conclude that \"you're just not getting it?\" \"I'm doing a whole lot of reflecting,\" Obama responds. Update at 1:13 p.m. ET. First question: Are the election results a \"fundamental rejection of your agenda?\" The president doesn't give a direct yes or no. But he does say that\u00a0\"I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make.\" And, Obama adds, \"the overwhelming message that I hear from the voters is that we want everybody to act responsibility here in Washington.\" Update at 1:08 p.m. ET: \"I want to engage both Democrats and Republicans in serious conversations about where we're going as a nation,\" Obama says. And the American people, he adds, don't want lawmakers \"to spend the next two years refighting the battles of the last two.\" \"I do believe there's hope for civility,\" Obama says. Update at 1:05 p.m. ET. The president begins by conceding that he had a long night. \"Some election nights are more fun than others,\" he says. \"Some are exhilirating. Some are humbling.\" He understands, Obama adds, that \"people are frustrated. They're deeply frustrated -- with the pace of our economic recovery.\" Meanwhile, we've got a question for everyone:",

            "article_content": "For the past two years, the president has had strong Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. He has used those majorities to push sweeping legislation through Congress against the almost unanimous opposition of Republicans. After Tuesday, those Congressional majorities will almost certainly shrink \u2014 and may disappear altogether. He's making one last push to hold on.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: Political analysts settled into their predictions over the weekend. Many see Republicans with an excellent chance to take the House. MONTAGNE: They say Democrats may be able to hold a reduced majority in the Senate, but we don't really know until after everyone finishes voting. INSKEEP: Two numbers in a Washington Post survey suggest the range of possibilities. The survey actually shows Democrats with a lead among all voters. MONTAGNE: But among those likely to show up, Republicans hold an edge, as they have for months. Republican enthusiasm could make John Boehner the next speaker of the House, and we'll hear from his campaign in a moment. INSKEEP: Here's NPR White House correspondent Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO: This weekend was President Obama's last push to hold on. The campaign went from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania... BARACK OBAMA: So I want everybody to get out there, knock on doors, make phone calls, volunteer. SHAPIRO: ...to Bridgeport, Connecticut... OBAMA: If you're going to the barbershops and the beauty shops, talking to your friends and talking to your neighbors... SHAPIRO: ...to Chicago, Illinois... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) OBAMA: I need you to get out and vote in this election... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) OBAMA: ...because if you do, if you're willing to step up, if you're willing to try... SHAPIRO: ...and finally, to Cleveland, Ohio. OBAMA: ...we will restore our economy. We will rebuild our middle class, and we will reclaim the American dream for future generations. God bless you. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) OBAMA: And God bless the United States of America. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) SHAPIRO: Presidential advisor David Axelrod spoke with reporters about the outlook for the House as the Chicago rally was wrapping up. DAVID AXELROD: You know, it's obviously very competitive. We knew that going in. We won 55 seats in the last couple years. I think 49 were in districts that Senator McCain carried in the presidential election. We - so we're playing on difficult turf in a midterm election. We knew of all those factors going in, so it's not a huge surprise that we're fighting hard there. SHAPIRO: Illinois Senator Richard Durbin is currently the second-most powerful Senate Democrat. Before the Chicago rally, he told me if the election had been a month ago, there's no way Democrats would have kept Mr. Obama's old seat. RICHARD DURBIN: If this election had happened October 2nd, there would've been a different outcome. But I think we have caught our stride and we have a terrific Get Out the Vote effort going on here and across the country. And I think it can be a big difference. SHAPIRO: Can I just ask, personally, how it feels to be fighting so hard to hold onto this seat that President Obama held when he was a senator? DURBIN: I never take any election for granted. I lost three elections before I ever won one. I don't assume a thing. The voters have the last word. And if you get - you have to get up, roll up your sleeves and go to work, that's what it's all about. SHAPIRO: At Cleveland State University yesterday, he gave a crowd of 8,000 supporters a partisan version of his unity, hope and change message from two years ago. OBAMA: We're not seeing that from the other party. I guess there feeling cocky, maybe. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) OBAMA: The Republican leader of the House says: \"This is not a time for compromise.\" That's a quote. The Republican leader in the Senate said his main goal for the next two years - his top priority is to win the next election and to beat me.

Bloomberg News reports that a survey done this week suggested that a majority of Americans had some basic facts about the economy and fiscal policy exactly wrong. A Bloomberg story excerpt: The Obama administration cut taxes for middle-class Americans, expects to make a profit on the hundreds of billions of dollars spent to rescue Wall Street banks and has overseen an economy that has grown for the past four quarters. Most voters don\u2019t believe it. A Bloomberg National Poll conducted Oct. 24-26 finds that by a two-to-one margin, likely voters in the Nov. 2 midterm elections think taxes have gone up, the economy has shrunk, and the billions lent to banks as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program won\u2019t be recovered. The story goes on to quote the head of the polling firm that conducted the survey who blames Democrats for not messaging better. \u201cThe public view of the economy is at odds with the facts, and the blame has to go to the Democrats,\u201d said J.\u00a0Ann Selzer, president of\u00a0Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa-based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. \u201cIt does not matter much if you make change, if you do not communicate change.\u201d Selzer may be partly right. Democrats themselves say they are guilty of the sin of omission in failing to get their message out. But as President Obama has himself admitted, he didn't do him or his party any favors. The new health-care law brought with it new taxes, mostly on those with higher income, to pay for expanding coverage. And then there's his insistence on letting the Bush tax cuts lapse for higher earners. Both of those by themselves may have contributed to the impression captured in the Bloomberg poll. But Selzer also fails to give Republicans credit for effectively communicating their message -- sometimes fact-based, sometimes not -- that Democrats were raising spending and taxes and exploding deficits and the national debt. Still, the overall point is hard to argue with, that as voters participated in early voting or get ready to go to \u00a0the polls Tuesday, many will have in mind \"facts\" they believe to be true that just aren't so. That has always been true in U.S. history. But in the past it was often because it was often difficult for voters to access accurate information. Now, with the facts so readily available with a few clicks of a computer mouse, that is less of an excuse.",

President Obama hosts a big campaign rally Friday in Nevada, home of embattled Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He's also campaigning on the West Coast. In between rallies, Obama hosted another \"backyard conversation\" in Seattle on Thursday. This one focused on how his economic policies affect mothers, wives and female business owners. \"Things like equal pay for equal work aren't just women's issues,\" he said.\u00a0 \"Those are middle-class family issues, because how well women do will help determine how well our families are doing as a whole.\" The White House says the president enjoys these backyard sessions as a chance to talk directly with people. So what's it like to come face to face with the president? The Rev. Michael Amadeo knows. He's the pastor at Holy Trinity Church in Des Moines, Iowa, and one of several dozen people who gathered for a backyard session there a few weeks ago. \"I really did not have my hand raised until he said this is going to be the last question,\" Amadeo said. \"And then I was like, OK, we'll see what happens.\" You can hear more about the president's backyard conversations on next week's episode of This American Life. \"I'm going to have to call on the guy with the collar,\" Obama said. Amadeo asked about a 55-year-old father of two in his congregation who has been out of work for more than a year. \"What will your economic policies do for him within the next year to be able to secure a job and have that American dream again?\" Obama gave a long answer. He talked about green jobs and worker retraining and the many letters he gets from parents who are out of work. It took about eight minutes in all. Afterward, some reporters were shaking our heads, saying the president needs to come up with a snappier response. But Amadeo told me he wasn't really expecting an easy answer. Maybe there isn't one. \"It is real difficult for people who are unemployed to be patient,\" he said.\u00a0 \"And rightly so. I've got to put food on the table. I've got electric bills to pay. I've got a mortgage to pay. \"We in America like things instantaneously. It's tough for us to be patient in allowing the economy to heal.\" I heard something similar from a man in New Mexico. \"As Americans, we need to be realistic,\" Andy Cavalier said. \"It took years for this to happen. You can't expect something to change overnight.\" Cavalier's father is a disabled Marine veteran. His stepmother, Etta Cavalier, is a longtime educator. They were chosen by the White House advance team to host another backyard conversation -- this one at their ranch on the outskirts of Albuquerque. \"They wanted my husband and I to invite our neighbors,\" Etta Cavalier said. \"They're Republican. They're Democrats. They're all types. There was no screening that took place.\" Neighbors brought their own lawn chairs, and Obama rested his microphone on a tree stump. Some of the questions were tough, ranging from education to mortgages to the president's own faith. After about an hour, Obama called on Andy Cavalier, who grew emotional describing his father's struggles to get adequate care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. \"You don't have to apologize for being emotional about your dad,\" the president said. \"I get emotional.\" Talking about his father, a wounded veteran, Andy Cavalier is overcome with emotion while asking President Obama a question during a backyard discussion in Albuquerque, N.M., on Sept. 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Talking about his father, a wounded veteran, Andy Cavalier is overcome with emotion while asking President Obama a question during a backyard discussion in Albuquerque, N.M., on Sept. 28. Andy Cavalier was impressed. \"I was nervous and almost embarrassed I was getting that emotional,\" he said. \"He saw that. He came up and gave me a hug, which was probably a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I got a hug from the president.\" The Cavaliers were already fans of Obama, but the visit won over at least one of their neighbors. \"At the end of the event, he came up to my husband and says, 'I like what I heard. I've always voted Republican, but now I'm going to vote Democrat,' \" Etta Cavalier said. But persuasive as the president can be in person, these backyard conversations don't seem to be shaping the broader political debate. That's frustrating to some of Obama's supporters. \"There are so many relevant topics that all of us -- conservative and progressive or liberal -- could be talking about and solving, but we're not,\" said Walt Rowen, a business owner in Pennsylvania. He met up with the president not in a backyard but at a town hall meeting sponsored by CNBC. The questions there were carefully screened. Rowen had to send his in ahead of time, and he was quizzed by a TV producer as he made his way to Washington,  D.C. The network wasn't sure how many people would get to ask questions, but Rowen was high on the list, at No. 3. \"So it was at that moment, halfway to Washington, that I had an uh-oh moment: 'This is really going to happen. I'm actually going to be there asking President Obama a question.' That was a pretty heavy moment,\" he said. When the town hall began, Rowen was sitting in the front row. When his turn at the microphone came, he told the president that successful businesses have to keep investing. It sounded like Rowen was working his way up to ask for a tax cut. But that's when he surprised me. \"I believe you're investing in this country as small businesses invest. And yet for some reason, the public just doesn't get it,\" Rowen said. \"I need you to help us understand how you can regain the political center, because you're losing the war of sound bites. You're losing the media cycles.\" As it turned out, Rowen himself would lose this media cycle. The sound bite most people remember from the CNBC event was the woman who asked the first question, Velma Hart. \"I'm a wife. I'm an American veteran. I'm one of your middle-class Americans. And quite frankly, I'm exhausted,\" she said, in a line that quickly went viral. Rowen happened to be sitting next to Hart before the broadcast, and they talked about her disappointment that Obama hasn't lived up to sky-high expectations. Rowen counseled patience, sounding very much like the owner of a family business that's now celebrating its 100th year. \"Like businesses, many, many times it's a long-term process. You can't expect immediate results,\" he said. \"You've got to look down the road and say, 'These are the policies that I need to implement now that will get me where I want to go.' \"And that's very difficult to get across in our society today. Everybody is like Velma Hart. She wants an immediate answer. She wants instant gratification. And it's not possible.\" Rowen's words reminded me of Cavalier's and Amadeo's. But their philosophy isn't one that's getting a lot of airtime these days. That has left Rowen asking the question one hears from across the political spectrum: left, right and especially center. \"Why aren't people like me that have opinions like mine being asked or talked to?\" he asked. Across the country, there's no shortage of shouting this election season.\u00a0 But beyond the backyard, real conversations about politics are hard to come by.",

Patty Murray for her seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Ted S.

But to gain an outright majority, Republicans also need to win at least one state that usually goes Democratic. That state may be Washington, which hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 1994. The incumbent up for election this year is Patty Murray, a Democrat first elected in 1992, in what became known as the \"year of the woman.\" She ran as the \"mom in tennis shoes,\" an image she still likes to evoke. But after three terms in the Senate, she's no longer the underdog. She ranks high on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, and she chairs the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. As a result, she's helped bring billions of dollars of federal spending back to Washington state, much of it in the form of earmarks. That kind of clout used to ensure an incumbent's re-election. But this year, Murray's challenger, Republican Dino Rossi, is trying to turn it into a liability. That's how NPR's Ken Rudin rates the Senate race between Patty Murray and Dino Rossi. See what other political observers think, and get predictions for other races, at the Election Scorecard. \"The old-school measurement of a good senator was how much pork you drug home,\" Rossi says. \"The reality is, we're going to have to have less spending throughout, because right now we're on the verge of moving towards bankruptcy.\" Rossi says he'll refrain from earmarks, though he stops short of promising to bring fewer federal dollars back to Washington state. His background is in commercial real estate, and he schedules frequent campaign events with local businessmen, who echo his call for an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone -- not just the middle class, as the Democrats prefer. \"People can go and chase the American dream, and then, when they're successful, you don't punish them for their success!\" he says. Rossi's talking points hew closely\u00a0to\u00a0the Republican Party's national message this election. And Rossi, who twice ran unsuccessfully for governor, is disciplined about sticking to those national themes.\u00a0For instance, in campaign ads and in person, Rossi refers to the administration's stimulus package as the \"jobless stimulus,\" a wording that's standard template in Republican campaigns around the country. \"The election of\u00a02010 is the most centralized or nationalized campaign that we've seen at least since 1994,\" says David Olson, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Washington. He says both the Murray and Rossi campaigns have lacked substance; for instance, he says, Murray seems unwilling to defend the stimulus. \"She very well could by pointing out that the difference between unemployment in the absence of the stimulus package, instead of being 10 percent, more likely would have been in the neighborhood of 20 percent,\" Olson says. Rather than wade into a complex economic argument about the stimulus, Murray has struck back by painting Rossi as pro-Wall Street, based on his investment in a small local bank. The Democrats are bringing out the big guns, including Vice President Biden, to campaign for Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), who is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Dino Rossi.\n                \n                    \n                    Ted S. Warren/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption She's also raised questions about the conservative groups that have helped Rossi with attack ads against her.\u00a0At a recent campaign rally, she said the ads were paid for by \"who knows who on Wall Street or Airbus or Karl Rove.\" In Washington state, where Boeing is still a major employer, it never hurts to associate your opponent with Airbus, Boeing's rival. The Murray campaign admits it has no actual evidence that Airbus is paying for the ads -- just that it might be, given the conservative groups' lack of transparency about their donors. The Murray-Rossi race is generally considered a tossup, though some recent polls have come to\u00a0divergent conclusions\u00a0about who's ahead, and by how much. But it's clear the Democrats are worried about a Senate seat that seemed safe just a few months ago. They're bringing in the big guns: Bill Clinton, Vice President Biden and first lady Michelle Obama, and on Oct. 21, President Obama arrives for his second visit on Murray's behalf.",

So that helps to explain why he'll be attending a big rally for Gov. Martin O'Malley in Prince George's, County, Md., with its large population of middle-class blacks. Obama will stop there on his way to the airport to travel to another pocket of high popularity for him, Illinois, where he will campaign for Alex Giannoulias who is running for the Senate seat Obama once occupied. In Maryland, Obama will be in a decidedly blue piece of a very blue state,\u00a0historically black Bowie State University. It's not that O'Malley really needs Obama's help. The Democratic governor holds an 11-percentage point lead over his Republican challenger, former Gov. Robert Erhlich. For the White House political operation to send the president to Maryland right now is arguably like sending oil to Saudi Arabia. But it ensures that the president gets to be in front of a sympathetic crowd that will shower him with affection. It will also make for visuals of an excited predominantly black audience that might help recreate some of the energy from 2008. The Washington Post points out that Democratic officials are very concerned about the turnout of black voters. So the presidential visit is meant to address some of those concerns. And it allows him to efficiently squeeze in a rally on the way to the airport.",

Is yours? Government agencies, academics and advertisers all use different criteria to describe\u00a0the middle class. The middle class is impossible to define but essential to the country. The overwhelming majority of Americans consider themselves to be part of the middle class, all but the very rich and the most poor. \"The reason everyone wants to be part of it is that the middle class have historically been viewed as the heroic people,\" says Kevin Leicht, a University of Iowa sociologist. \"They have played by the rules and made most of their earnings by working hard at a job.\" But Leicht is among a number of social scientists who believe that the middle class has been \"squeezed,\" not just by the current economic doldrums but also by longstanding trends, such as rising household debt and college and health care costs. \"If you look at opinion polls about a range of economic issues, what you see is intense anxiety among Americans about their economic future and their ability to create opportunities for themselves and their children,\" says Paul Pierson, coauthor of\u00a0Winner-Take-All Politics, a new book about inequality. Despite the real pain caused by the recession, however, not everyone sees evidence that the middle class is falling short. Middle class incomes have gone up over the past 30 years, paying for a bonanza of consumer goods and bigger homes that point to improved standards of living, not diminished ones. Credits: Heidi Glenn, Hansi Wang and Avie Schneider/NPR \"The last 30 years have been a period of improvement, although slower and with new strains,\" says Lane Kenworthy, a professor of political science and sociology at the University of Arizona. \"We've got a lot of real evidence that people tend to weigh strains much more heavily on their psyches than improvements, especially if improvements are slow and steady.\" Reasonable Aspiration The notion that the mass of Americans can broadly share in the prosperity of the country has been deeply ingrained in the culture since colonial times. This is the real meaning of \"the land of opportunity.\" Not everyone could strike it rich, but it was reasonable to aspire to a comfortable standard of living that the next generation could match or exceed. This is what brought waves of immigrants to these shores. It is the possible dream. \"It's the middle class that represents comfortable holidays, safe homes, cars and having your kids go to college,\" says Deborah Thorne, a sociologist at Ohio University. \"Who wouldn't want to be middle class?\" Lifestyle Improvements Over the past 30 years, income inequality has risen -- the rich have gotten richer -- and middle-class income has not grown as rapidly as during the years immediately following World War II. Still, creature comforts have improved. Things that were considered luxuries a generation ago are now widely available. Not only are houses much bigger on average, but they are also more likely to have multiple rooms filled with air conditioning, phones, Internet connections and bigger, gaudier televisions. The larger homes contain smaller families, with fewer children, making it easier to indulge. Being middle class is not just about the things but a sense of financial stability. Deborah Thorne, a sociologist at Ohio University \"Even in the heart of the recession, the iPad could come out and Grand Theft Auto could sell 8 million copies,\" says Stephen J. Rose, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce and author of\u00a0Rebound, a 2010 book arguing that economic trends have been helping the middle class. Bittersweet Times Most Americans think of themselves as part of the middle class. \"They don't want to seem poor, they don't want to seem rich -- they want to seem like everyone else,\" says John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Government agencies, academics and advertisers all use different criteria to describe\u00a0the middle class. But it's clear that people smack dab in the middle -- households making just under $50,000 -- have been hit hard by the recession. \"The state of the middle class is bittersweet,\" Rose says. People in the broad middle can afford plenty of goodies, he says, but they're not getting as big a share as the rich or the professional upper middle class. \"They feel they don't have quite as much,\" Rose says. A Sense of Stability The middle class is not just falling behind in relative terms but also is being \"hollowed out,\" says Thorne, the Ohio University sociologist. Household goods may be more affordable and available, but the costs of some big-ticket items that practically define the middle class -- health insurance, college education for the kids -- have been shooting upward for years. Fewer companies are offering health insurance or guaranteed retirement incomes. Stock market losses and the bursting of the housing bubble have eaten into the average American's net worth. Many people have very little cushion to fall back on, should they lose their jobs or suffer an illness that leads to uncovered medical expenses. Schmitt says middle-class income may have improved over the past generation, but not over the past decade, when job creation was flat even before the recession. When most people think of the middle class right now, it's colored by the deep downturn and where we are right now. The idea of calamity or crisis of the middle class is an overstatement. Lane Kenworthy, a professor of political science and sociology at the University of Arizona \"Being middle class is not just about the things but a sense of financial stability,\" Thorne says. \"I don't believe you can consider those people secure, stable members of the middle class, because they're so vulnerable if something happens.\" Anxiety Turns To Anger That widely shared sense of anxiety -- made more intense by the recession -- \"is reflected in the anger you see on both sides of the political extremes, both with the Tea Party and MoveOn.org,\" says Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. \"Underneath that anger is the incredible insecurity of the middle class.\" President Obama's signature achievement -- the expansion of health coverage -- was designed to address this sense of insecurity. For many people, it has had the opposite effect, although that of course may change as it begins to take effect. For now, while middle-class voters may not have suddenly grown more conservative, they do appear more skeptical about government's ability to address their deepest concerns, says Ruy Teixeira, a political analyst at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank. And he says they are receptive to the \"limited government\" arguments raised from the party not in power. \"People don't believe government, when it tries to address their problems, will get the job done,\" he says. \"Republicans are surfing on that sense.\" A Feeling of Increasing Pressure Rose, the Georgetown economist, predicts that the economy will begin to turn around in time for the 2012 election, and that middle-class incomes will rise accordingly. \"When most people think of the middle class right now, it's colored by the deep downturn and where we are right now,\" says Kenworthy, the University of Arizona sociologist. \"The idea of calamity or crisis of the middle class is an overstatement.\" It's often hard to see past present conditions. Most postwar recessions were short and not deep, and recovery came quickly. \"This one is not that,\" Rose says. As a result, current economic problems, however long they last, have increased the economic pressure felt by much of the middle class. \"There's a general sense that people in the middle class have to work harder and longer to generate whatever upward mobility they can get,\" Teixeira says. \"They're not exactly living in grinding poverty, but people feel pressed.\"",

Bush Administration officials and congressional Republicans knew back when the tax cuts were enacted that the day would come when the cuts would either be extended or left to die. And anyone who voted to allow them to lapse (read Democrat) could be accused of raising taxes, never a popular position with most voters. In other words, Republicans set a tax trap for Democrats and seems to have worked. In the run-up to the mid-term election, on Thursday, Democrats decided to put off a vote on extending the tax cuts until after the election. Democratic lawmakers in close races worried that a vote to extend the cuts only for households with incomes below the $250,000 threshold, the preferred approach of President Obama and congressional leaders, would expose them to the toxic charge of voting for higher taxes. So they prevailed. Thus the vote will now come after the election. An excerpt from The Hill gives a sense of the fear on Capitol Hill surrounding a vote extending the tax cuts. Liberal lawmakers in both chambers had pressed their leaders to schedule a vote on legislation that would make permanent the tax cuts for families earning below $250,000 but allow the rates for families above that threshold to rise. Families in the top brackets would see their income tax rates rise from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively. Centrists and Democrats facing tough reelections, however, balked at voting for any tax increases. Republicans have argued for an extension of all of the current tax rates, which became law during the Bush administration. Sen. Evan Bayh, a centrist Democrat from Indiana, said the divisions in his party emerged in stark contrast during the lunchtime meeting. \u201cA majority of opinion was probably for having a vote, but for a majority of people who were running, maybe not,\u201d he said. But the tax trap doesn't go away for Democrats. They'll still be snared. If Democrats lose the House but retain the Senate, as many analysts now think likely, soon after taking power in January a\u00a0Republican-led House could send to the Senate legislation to extend tax cuts for households with over $250,000 in income. If Senate Democrats have an even smaller majority than the 57 members they have now, which analysts also expect, the pressure will likely increase on Senate Democrats to vote for those higher-income tax cuts. Voting against them would allow Republicans to accuse Democrats of voting for huge tax increases since wealthier households pay the lion's share of taxes. In 2007, for instance, taxpayers in the top one percent of income paid 40.4 percent of all taxes. If the Senate Democrats buckle and vote to extend tax cuts to the wealthy and Obama sticks to his guns on the issue with a veto, that would allow Republicans to intensify their charges that he's a typical tax-and-spend as he heads towards his re-election. A possible lifeline for Democrats is that they do have some polling on their side suggesting that voters support the Obama position that tax cuts only be extended for households under $250,000. If voters beyond those in the Tea Party movement start showing a strong preference that federal deficit and the debt be placed on a significant downward track, then Obama may be better able to successfully fend off Republican attacks about being a taxer and spender. But Democrats clearly have the trickier political landscape to navigate on the tax issue than Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Anti-Obama sentiment has helped shift independent voters towards Republicans and away from the Democrats who control Congress.\u00a0\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Brashear/AP Photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption The fight between Democrats and Republicans to control Congress and the White House at this point in the 21st Century comes down to winning over enough independent voters. And Thursday there was sobering news for Democrats on that front. Republicans appear to be winning that contest at the moment, according to a new survey of independent voters by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center discussed the poll's findings with All Things Considered co-host Robert Siegel. Again, there wasn't much positive data to cheer up Democrats. The \"let's throw the bums out\" pattern which independents have settled into in recent election cycles looks likely to be reinforced in the upcoming mid-term elections, unless Democrats can significantly increase the energy level of their voters and their turnout. Pew surveyed 2,800 registered voters, 37 percent of whom were independents. KOHUT: The number of independents in the countries is at one of the high points in the last 20 years. Only 34 percent were independent in 2008. it's a growing category of people who aren't comfortable with either party. ROBERT: But it seems like they're especially uncomfortable with the Democrats this year. KOHUT: They are uncomfortable with the Democrats because they represent the party in power. And they say they are going to vote for Republican candidates by a 13 point margin, 49 (percent) to 36 (percent.) But in the two previous elections they voted Democratic, voting against the party of power, 52 (percent) to 44 (percent) in 2008 and (in 2006)\u00a0voting for the Democrats rather than the Republicans who controlled the House, 57 (percent) to 39 (percent). ... They've been untethered lately. The most we can say about them consistently is they haven't been pleased and they are certainly not pleased in 2010. Much of what's dragging down congressional Democrats is unhappiness with the man in the White House, President Barack Obama, according to Kohut. Since he's not up for re-election, independents indicate they intend to take out their frustrations on Democrats, which underscores why many Democratic candidates would prefer not to campaign with him. KOHUT: Among independents, only 40 percent approve of President Barack Obama. And what we see is a significant number of independents -- 29 percent -- saying they will be casting a vote against President Obama when they vote for congressional representatives in November. That's almost as many who said that about George Bush four years ago when he was so unpopular and that unpopularity led to Republicans losing control of the House. Unlike Bush, who faced opposition because of the Iraq War and the controversial methods his administration used to combat terrorism -- Guantanamo, secret renditions etc., Obama's problems stem mainly from the economy. ROBERT: Do the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan play any significant role in forming people's opinions? Foreign policy and social issues are pretty low on the public's agenda. This is about the economy and national conditions. You know we have in this poll 50 percent of the independts we poll saying that someone in their household was either unemployed or looking for job in the last 12 months. That's a pretty powerful number. While the Tea Party movement is by various measures growing in power, it doesn't necessarily hold sway over many independents, according to Kohut. KOHUT: They're divided on the Tea Party. Almost as many say they agree with them -- \u00a032 percent -- as say they disagree with them except among the independents who are disposed to the Republicans... For many independents, the Tea Party just doesn't measure up. Pew picked up a tendency towards increasing conservatism and a desire for smaller government within the population of independents as well. For many of these voters, it seems the health-care overhaul legislation may have pushed them over the edge, he said. In four years, the percentage of independents who call themselves conservative grew to 36 percent from 29 percent. Kohut indicated that was a significant increase. KOHUT: Independents lean against health care by a small margin. But health-care reform for many of the independents who are conservative, raised the profile of large government... So it is a very significant player both with regard to views about health-care reform specifically and how it changed in one year, Barack Obama's first year, the disposition to see an activist government take on the nation's problems. The only hope for Democrats, considering the headwind they're facing from the shift of independents away from them is to raise the number of Democratic-leaning independents and Democrats who turn out to vote in November. ROBERT: Republicans looking at these numbers would obviously be encouraged about November. Is there any faint encouragement somewhere in their for Democrats. KOHUT: The hope for Democrats is that they can energize independents who are disposed to the Democratic Party and Democrats themselves because both lag in terms of their inclination to vote. If they do that they can draw closer to Republicans and reduce the number of seats that they seem likely to lose.",

            "article_content": "The question is not why they were gone so long amidst recession and myriad problems from deficits and tax rates to housing and energy. We know why they were gone. Congress always takes most of August off and many members spend a lot of that time connecting to folks back home -- especially in election years such as this one. The question is why they came back. Did they come back because they wanted to accomplish something in the remaining weeks before the election? Or did they come back just to continue the politicking that has dominated the Hill in recent months in anticipation of that election? It's a bipartisan question. For the majority Democrats, of course, the question is most acute. As members of the party officially in power in difficult times, they have the onus of responsibility. That goes for the economy and every other source of voter dissatisfaction. So how should they use these final weeks before the reckoning with the voters? Should they scramble to pass President Obama's latest $50 billion stab at stimulating the economy? Many think so, although they cringe at the thought of calling it a stimulus. The last package so described may have done substantial good -- or not. But so far at least it has inspired far more derision than praise. Boehner, the target of some Democratic barbs.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Duncan/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption And what about the Bush tax cuts the Democrats mostly opposed back in 2001 and 2003? Now they are loath to let them expire, which would give Republicans a chance to hang a tax increase around their necks at a time when high unemployment is the dominant issue in the land. Republicans have an easier time, not being held responsible for much of anything these days. But they still face their own version of the question: What are you doing here? Plenty of Republicans would be as happy NOT to be in Washington. In the House, at least, they are unlikely to determine or even alter the course of any legislation. Under more normal circumstances, they might look forward to close votes on some of the spending bills that regularly dominate floor debate in the days before the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. This is not a normal year, and most expect the spending bills to be postponed until after the election. Funding will flow in the meantime through the continuing resolution mechanism, a familiar fallback in times of partisan standoff. But if we are going to keep the federal government open by such means for the foreseeable future, there's little need for Republicans to drop by and watch. So why are they here? Turns out there's an animating debate in Republican ranks as well. Should the minority party hold out for an extension of the Bush tax cuts of 2001-03 for all taxpayers, regardless of income? Is it worth the potential political fallout of holding hostage the lower tax rates of those making less than $250,000 so as to protect those of the top 3%? House Republican leader John Boehner said this past weekend that while his preferred choice is to extend the cuts for all taxpayers, he could see voting for legislation that preserves them only for the middle class -- if that's the only choice he's given. But there may be some in his party who see this as a compromise, and in the mood of the moment no compromise will be popular with the most resistant conservatives. Already, in fact, a spokesman for Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell has said Republicans in that chamber are firmly against any plan that excludes the wealthy from an extension of the tax breaks. Some Republicans may argue that Boehner is simply trying to outmaneuver the White House on the tax-the-rich issue -- refusing to be nailed to it as a kind of sacrifice. Boehner is clearly aware that the White House has targeted him for his ties to the old line Republican country-club image and his association with corporate powers. If he can be vilified in the weeks leading up to Nov. 2, perhaps the Democratic base can be re-energized and a few populist independents can be lured back to their votes of 2006 and 2008. It's a bit of long shot, and a late one at that, but it may be the best shot the Democrats are going to see before November.",

She was among the first vowing to fight for the repeal of what she calls the government's takeover of health care. And so far, New Hampshire Republican Kelly Ayotte, who's running for U.S. Senate, seems to be resonating with voters in a state known for its fiscal conservatism. Ayotte, the state's former attorney general, is one of four Republicans running for the seat being vacated by Sen. Judd Gregg. She has already caught the eye of the national GOP, which has dubbed her one of its up-and-coming stars. Adjusting To The Public Eye In New Hampshire, attorneys general are appointed to their position. That means Ayotte, 42, is waging her first-ever campaign.  She is still getting used to the campaign trail -- and the cameras and microphones swirling around her. \"It is quite a mike, isn't it,\" she said laughing, while speaking at a town meeting for the Republican Party Committee in Hudson, N.H.   \"This doesn't happen everywhere.  I want you to know that this is unusual,\" she said, referring to the presence of a national reporter. What Ayotte is already used to is making the seamless pivot from small talk and schmoozing to her principal campaign talking points. She compliments the town's new library, built with a large private donation, then eases into a homily on personal responsibility and the dangers of expecting the government to solve every challenge. Her stump speech centers on a promise to return the GOP to its core principles of less government and lower taxes. \"We have seen, unfortunately, [even] Republicans spend too much money,\" she said to voters. \"And we, I think, need to acknowledge that there are times when, as Republicans, we lost our way on that issue as well.\" Making Politics Personal Ayotte, a mother of two, likes to present her politics as personal.  She worries that the deficit will burden her own children -- who are 2 and 5. When she talks about supporting the military, she references her husband, Joe Daley, an Iraq war veteran. Her husband is also a small-business owner.  Ayotte often talks about helping him start his landscape company, saying she would shovel snow overnight before heading to her day job as attorney general. Ayotte said she decided she had to run for Senate last year, while watching what she sees as the government's assault on small businesses and middle-class families like hers. \"We were yelling at our television, just frustrated that they don't get it in Washington,\" she said. \"They think somehow the government is going to create the jobs.  And I think it's a failure of leadership.\" Ayotte is running against three other Republicans in the September primary: businessmen Bill Binnie and Jim Bender, and former gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne. She started the race with relatively good name recognition.  In her five years as attorney general, she developed a reputation as a tough prosecutor.  For example, she sought the death penalty for a cop killer.   But beyond that, her politics are relatively unknown. Moving Away From Social Issues Ayotte was first appointed attorney general by Republican Gov. Craig Benson, then reappointed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch. And she was apolitical in office -- leaving many voters with lots of questions about who Ayotte really is. \"Would you liken yourself more like a John McCain moderate or a Sarah Palin?\" asked Hudson Republican Party Chair Rick LeVasseur, after Ayotte's stump speech. Ayotte paused, and then said, \"I'm going to be -- to take a line from [Massachusetts' newly elected Republican Sen.] Scott Brown -- a Kelly Ayotte Republican.\" The ambiguity has left Ayotte open to knocks from Republicans skeptical of her conservative bona fides, as well as from Democrats who are already launching attack ads.  One ad features The Who singing, \"Who are you?\" Ayotte has called herself \"pro-life,\" and she opposes gay marriage -- in a state that's just made it legal. But she doesn't usually talk about those social issues out on the stump. Republican State Rep. Bob Haefner said it's a deliberate strategy, well-advised in a state that has turned younger and more to the left in recent years. \"I think the party's got to stay away from the social issues,\" he said.  \"I think the fiscal issues will attract independent voters, unless you start bringing in the social issues, and then you're going to lose them.\" The Problem With Being 'Chosen' Another thing New Hampshire's fiercely independent voters may not like is the way Ayotte seems to be the establishment's \"chosen\" candidate.  She was heavily recruited by party leaders in Washington, D.C., and has benefited from big-name fundraisers in D.C. and New Hampshire. Earlier this month, Arizona Sen. John McCain headlined an Ayotte rally and touted her as \"the next generation of leadership of the Republican Party.\" Both Republicans and Democrats have tried to use Ayotte's big-name backing against her. But she insists she is, and will remain, an outsider.  She vows that even if elected, she will not move to D.C. but will commute from New Hampshire. She likes to tell the story of the farmer in northern New Hampshire who gave her a bottle of what he called \"New Hampshire water.\" He told her to take that to Washington, D.C., because \"anyone who drinks the Washington water loses their common sense and forgets where they came from.'\" \"I'm going to remember that story,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose my common sense, or get too caught up in Washington and forget where I came from.\"",

            "article_content": "By most accounts, the two most vulnerable senators up for re-election this year are Democrats Harry Reid of Nevada and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. The problems for Reid have been well chronicled. He has to balance his role as Senate majority leader, shepherding a mostly liberal party in Washington to pass President Obama's agenda, while retaining appeal among more conservative voters back home. Reid has been trailing generic Republicans in the polls for months; his supporters insist that when the GOP nominates someone real and not generic, the senator will win. Lincoln's problems in Arkansas may be more severe. In her bid for a third term, she has been behind both generic and real Republican challengers, such as Rep. John Boozman and state Sen. Gilbert Baker. The state voted 59 percent for John McCain in 2008. Two of the state's three Democratic House members, Marion Berry and Vic Snyder, have already announced their retirement. More important, polls are showing tremendous skepticism in Arkansas over the health care bill. And Lincoln has taken heat for trying to be all things to all people on the issue, criticizing it and embracing it at the same time. In trying to satisfy everyone, she is satisfying no one. And that is especially true among progressives in her party, who have long been frustrated with her cautiousness. And now she has an opponent in the May 18 Democratic primary. Lt. Gov. Bill Halter announced his challenge to Lincoln today: I'm running for the United States Senate because Washington is no longer working for ... families all across Arkansas. Washington is broken. Bailing out Wall Street with no strings attached, while leaving middle-class Arkansas taxpayers with the bill; protecting insurance company profits instead of protecting patients and lowering health costs; gridlock, bickering and partisan games while unemployment is at a 25-year high. Enough's enough. Halter, who once worked in the budget office of then-Gov. Bill Clinton, is coming after Lincoln from the left, suggesting she is too unreliable for Democrats. Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee agrees. On his website, he calls Lincoln \"one of the worst corporate Democrats in Washington. She joined Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson in attempting to kill the public health insurance option after taking millions from health and insurance interests.\" Another anti-Lincoln screed comes from Charles Chamberlain, the political director at Democracy for America, the group founded by Howard Dean: Blanche Lincoln is a Wall Street puppet for the insurance industry that has contributed over $2 million to her campaign. While over 56% of Arkansas voters wanted the choice of a public option, Lincoln vowed on the Senate floor she'd filibuster healthcare reform unless the public option was stripped from the bill. Senator Lincoln stood up and the insurance companies won. ... Bill Halter is a solid Democrat, an Arkansas progressive, and a populist leader. He's fought for working men and women and delivered real change for Arkansas. His track record as Lt. Governor proves it. ... We told the Healthcare Villains we would not forget. We showed them how popular the public option was in their state and nationwide. We warned them not to choose insurance companies over the Americans people. Now it's too late for Senator Blanche Lincoln. MoveOn.org also endorsed Halter today, calling Lincoln \"one of the worst corporate Democrats in Washington\": With Bill Halter, our Arkansas members see a candidate who will stand up to special interests. Arkansans deserve someone who'll fight for them, not Wall Street. One gets the feeling that Lincoln could have her hands full on May 18. John Brummett, blogging in the Arkansas News, expects the GOP to \"celebrate the Democratic divisiveness,\" now that Lincoln \"must now deplete her mammoth resources in the primary.\" Here's how he sees the race: Establishment Democrats, meaning party insiders, didn't like Halter anyway, certainly don't like him now and will rally the apparatus, to the extent it exists with effectiveness, to push him back. Right away we need to see if Halter, whose impetus into this race is from the unlikely left, favors card check, cap-and-trade and the health care reform bill as advanced by Harry Reid and modified last week by the White House. Those are three good opening questions for him when he files tomorrow. The state's business establishment, meaning the chambers of commerce, the Farm Bureau, the utilities, will be scared to death of Halter. ... Politics is largely about passion, and I see none for Lincoln and the potential for some for Halter. This is a strange situation. Will conservative Democrats stay home and protect an incumbent senator they think is too liberal against an challenger who is more liberal? Or will they be lured by this multi-candidate Senate primary on the Republican side? Sam Stein, blogging in the Huffington Post, says the race \"is likely to become a proxy battle for the larger debate within the Democratic Party between progressives who believe sticking to core values is the best way to win office and the self-styled pragmatists who argue that they must adopt more conservative positions when running in traditionally more conservative states.\" Jim Geraghty, blogging at the National Review, seems to be enjoying the whole thing: Some lefty blogs are somewhat enthused about Arkansas's lieutenant governor, Bill Halter, a Democrat, challenging Sen. Blanche Lincoln in the Democratic primary. It appears he's aiming to challenge her from the left. ... But it's not clear how much this would improve the outlook for Democrats; a threat to beat someone in a primary is not all that menacing to a candidate who already looks like toast in the general election. Beyond that, it's not clear how much room there is to Lincoln's left among Arkansas Democrats. Yes, Lincoln's approval is only at 51 percent among self-identified liberals, according to Public Policy Polling, but it's lower among moderates (38 percent) and conservatives (10 percent). Comparatively speaking, it's the liberals who like her. And even if Halter beats her, in general election match-ups, he performs even worse than Lincoln does, no matter who the Republican nominee is. When 63 percent of Arkansas voters disapprove of congressional Democrats in general, their nominee will be in trouble, no matter who it is. Lincoln actually came to Congress in the first place by defeating a Democratic incumbent. Back in 1992, during another anti-incumbent mood, she knocked off Rep. Bill Alexander in the primary, focusing on his overdrafts in the House bank. Lincoln, a former receptionist in Alexander's office, ousted him in a 61-39 percent landslide. Fun facts: The last Arkansas senator to be defeated in the primary was J. William Fulbright (D), who lost to Gov. Dale Bumpers in 1974 ... John Boozman's late brother, Fay Boozman, was the GOP nominee against Lincoln in 1998, losing 55-42 percent.",

When President Obama was a candidate, the nation's problems were a wind at his back. Now he must solve them. Wednesday night's State of the Union speech is an opportunity for President Obama to reconnect to voters who are frustrated about the state of the economy and the progress he's been making toward fulfilling his campaign promises. The president has said he'll talk about economic growth \u2014 the top priority for voters, according to a new survey conducted by Republican Glen Bolger and Democrat Stan Greenberg. The poll of 800 likely voters also finds that opinion has soured on Obama's No. 1 legislative priority this year: an overhaul of the country's health care system. The poll holds plenty of danger signs for the Democrats. In one indicator studied closely by both parties ahead of midterm elections, likely voters chose an unnamed Republican candidate by 5 percentage points over the Democrat on a hypothetical congressional ballot. Rating Obama's First Year In Office And, Bolger points out, that edge is more pronounced among people whose interest in the midterms is high. \"So while it's a 5-point lead overall, among the most interested voters, that lead doubles,\" Bolger says. \"And we saw that take effect in Virginia; we saw it took effect in [the] New Jersey gubernatorial race; and we saw it take effect in the Massachusetts Senate race as well.\" The poll shows likely voters evenly divided about Obama's job performance: While 49 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. And Greenberg's Democrats have to be worried by the fact that by 2-1, voters think the country is on the wrong track. \"It's not hard to understand Massachusetts when you get a poll back like this,\" Greenberg says. \"That tells you a lot about the mood in the country.\" Health care is the most immediate political problem for the president. His new bill was just about to cross the finish line when Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts deprived the Democrats of their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. In the NPR poll, likely voters oppose the president's plan by 55 percent to 39 percent, with the problem concentrated among independent voters. Jack Raffa, a bank examiner from Pottsville, Pa., says he doesn't like how the health care bill was written. \"They seem to be making backroom deals and doing it behind closed doors,\" he says. \"If it's such a good thing, everybody should know about it and be happy about it. If they have to hide it, there's a reason they're hiding things.\" Roger Williams of Noble, La., describes himself as a not-so-strong Democrat. He objects to the fact that health care pushed everything else aside. \"That's all you see on TV: health care, health care, health care,\" he says. \"There's a lot on his plate, I understand that. The man inherited a good mess, but he's also made it even messier.\" Williams questions why the health care overhaul is so important. \"Go ahead and do that, but also worry about other things,\" he says. \"Don't just forget about the other problems that we've got.\" The survey suggests Democrats are being punished as much for not getting health care done as they are for what's actually in the bill. \"Had this passed before Christmas, we would be in a very different situation than we are now,\" Greenberg says. \"What people believe this bill is, is taxes on health benefits or special deals for Nebraska,\" he says. \"What they don't see is the barring insurance companies from discriminating, everybody being guaranteed they can't lose health insurance.\" There is one bright spot for the president in the poll's results: Obama's proposed bank tax. \"[The Wall Street bailout is] very much at the heart of problems plaguing incumbents and plaguing Democrats,\" Greenberg says, adding that more people think Democrats are responsible for the bailouts than helping the middle class. \"So the fee on the banks wins a lot of support,\" he says. Most of President Obama's agenda has united the Republicans in opposition, but a bank tax is one of the few things with the potential to drive a wedge through the Republican ranks. \"I think there is going to be a lot of pressure on them,\" Bolger says, \"because the push-back message, it's nowhere near as strong as the Democrat attack. The banks are in a tough spot on winning this policy fight.\" And so are Republicans, if they take up the bankers' cause. When he delivers his State of the Union address, Obama will have an opportunity to press his new populist charge against Wall Street and to speak directly to the concerns of voters like Jackie Yoon, a homemaker from Oklahoma City. Asked what she wants to hear from the president, Yoon says, \"how to help Americans get back to work. I'm not so concerned about the rich, because they're not hurting. But it's the middle class, the lower middle class that's hurting. It seems like nobody cares about us, so I hope he concentrates on that.\" The State of the Union is the kind of big set-piece speech the president has been able to use to good advantage in the past. But when he was a candidate, the nation's problems were a wind at his back. As president, he finds them very much in his face.",

Ferrell/Gongressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Berwick, the man who came to embody everything the GOP hates about the new health care law, finally got his first hearing before Congress. Since he was made administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services with a recess appointment by President Obama this summer, 134 days have passed, as Senate Finance Committee ranking Republican Charles Grassley ruefully noted. Berwick, trained as a pediatrician, had faced what promised to be a bruising confirmation battle. Republicans made it clear they would reopen the debate about health overhaul and also challenge some of Berwick\u2019s own voluminous writings as a Harvard professor and health policy expert. He has, for instance, professed admiration for the British health  system, which led to accusations that he wanted to import the same  approach to the United States. But Berwick had a simple answer when asked by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-KY), why he agreed to a recess appointment rather than brave through the nomination gauntlet. \"The reason I accepted is because the president asked me, and I want to serve this country,\" Berwick replied. Republicans who had been breathing fire over Berwick just a few months ago, cooled it a little at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. In fact, they spent much of their time complaining about how little time they had because of other scheduled Senate votes. \"Asking us to air all our concerns in an hour-long hearing with five minutes each is like asking us to drain the Pacific  Ocean with a thimble,\" grumbled Utah Republican Orrin Hatch. Much of the questioning from Republicans echoed themes from the midterm elections -- particularly whether reducing Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next decade will help or hurt the program. Grassley pointed out that Medicare's independent actuary predicts that if the cuts are made to health care providers, they could stop serving Medicare patients, who would then be disadvantaged. \"Do you agree with that?\" he asked Berwick. He did not. The actuary\u2019s estimates, said Berwick diplomatically, \"are just that, estimates. Our intent is to increase access to beneficiaries. I think they\u2019ll find themselves in better shape as the act is implemented.\" And when will Berwick be back to testify? Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT), who noted that the hearings are, and will continue to be, up to him to call, wouldn\u2019t say. But outgoing Sen. Bunning had a prediction that seemed pretty safe, given the takeover of the other side of Capitol Hill by the GOP, \"I suspect you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time testifying before the House of Representatives.\"",

Michael Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of Leviathan on the Right: How Big-Government Conservatism Brought Down the Republican Revolution. Having won a nearly unprecedented electoral victory, Republicans now find themselves in the position of the proverbial dog that caught the car, wondering what they should do next. Here are ten modest suggestions. 1. It's the Economy, Stupid. The top three issues in this election were: the economy, the economy, and the economy. Voters were willing to swallow their doubts about Republicans and give them another chance because Democratic economic policies had failed so miserably. This is particularly true among economically conservative, socially moderate suburban voters who backed Democrats in 2006 and 2008 but switched to Republicans this year. Now Republicans will be expected to deliver by cutting spending, taxes, and regulation to create more jobs. That needs to be Republicans' first, second, and third priority. Indeed, it could be argued that one factor in the Democrats' defeat was that they spent so much time in the last two years discussing issues besides the economy. If Republicans spend their first weeks in power debating \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" or abortion restrictions, voters are likely to treat them the same way they did Democrats this year. 2. Obamacare Must Be Stopped. Nothing soured voters on Obama's big-government agenda as much as the health-care bill. Democrats who supported Obamacare went down to defeat in disproportionate numbers. Republicans, who campaigned on repealing and replacing the unpopular law, must follow through on that promise. Of course, given the Democrats' ability to filibuster and the president's veto, repeal is highly unlikely. Still, Republicans must do more than hold a symbolic vote in favor of repeal and then forget about it. There are numerous incremental steps they can take, from defunding portions of the law to attacking unpopular provisions. 3. Cut Spending, Not Just Taxes. Republicans have promised to cut taxes, including extending all of the Bush tax cuts. That makes both political and economic sense, especially during an economic downturn. They should also follow through on other tax cuts, including those for businesses. While some types of tax cuts do increase economic growth, it is a mistake to pretend that all tax cuts simply pay for themselves. Nor is there any evidence that you can \"starve the beast.\" Unless we want to keep marching toward the day when government consumes 45 percent of GDP while the debt continues to grow, Republicans are going to have to make the tough choices to cut -- really cut -- spending. 4. Ban Earmarks. True, they don't amount to a lot of money, just 1.2 percent of federal discretionary spending. But earmarks are an important structural and symbolic component of government spending. Republicans imposed a moratorium on earmarks in 2010, but it expires next year. If that were to happen, voters could rightly conclude that Republicans were not serious about controlling spending. At the very least, Republicans should renew the moratorium. Even better would be a permanent ban on earmarks. 5. Level with the American People. One of the driving sources of the anger felt by so many voters this year was the feeling that government at every level lied to them. Republicans should take a lesson from their British counterparts and be honest with the American people. Balancing the budget and reducing the debt are going to require hard, painful choices. People are going to have to give up some of their favorite programs. But the American people are adults -- they can handle the truth. 6. Offer an Alternative. Republicans won this time simply by not being Democrats. But having even a share of governing power means that just opposing the worst of the Obama agenda won't be enough next time. Republicans need to develop and put forward a positive agenda. They need to do this even if they know that the bills will die in the Senate or be vetoed by the president. 7. Investigate\u2026Carefully. Certainly a little bit of oversight is long overdue in Washington. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) will be in charge of the Government Oversight Committee with its investigatory and subpoena power. But Republicans need to remember that overzealousness during the Clinton years hurt them. Too often, investigations appeared partisan and mean-spirited. They need to hold the Obama administration accountable, but in a careful and restrained way. Any discussion of impeachment or Obama's birth certificate is an automatic disqualifier. 8. Tackle Entitlements. It is impossible to seriously reduce government spending without tackling entitlements, notably Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Pre-election, Republicans were less than a tower of courage in this regard, but the report of the president's bipartisan debt commission, expected in December, provides an opening. 9. Don't Fear a Shutdown. Republicans in the House have the power of the purse, meaning that they can control taxes and spending if they stick to their guns. To counter that, the president can threaten a Clinton-style government shutdown. But Obama is no Bill Clinton. Republicans should not be prematurely deterred by a shutdown threat. 10. Remember, the Tea Party Is Still Out There. It became almost a mantra for Republicans to say that they understood that they \"lost their way\" during the Bush years. This time they were different, they insisted. They wouldn't get caught up in the \"business as usual\" ways of Washington. If they do -- if they fail to deliver on a smaller, less costly, less intrusive government -- then the same forces that swept them into power will sweep them right back out.",

The Tea Party's rise has shaken the GOP, as some Republican incumbents have been ousted in favor of more extreme Tea Party candidates.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The cheers that went up in Washington as Republican primary votes were totaled September 14 did not come from GOP headquarters. As former Bush administration spokeswoman Dana Perino acknowledged, Democrats had reason to be \"gleeful.\" Candidates GOP strategists had recruited for Delaware's open Senate seat and New York's governorship were upset by Tea Party extremists with heavy baggage. Karl Rove says the Delaware results did severe \u2014 perhaps irreparable \u2014 damage to GOP prospects for taking the Senate this fall. But before progressives breathe sighs of relief, they had better recognize that, although Tea Party victories have made it harder for Republicans to win some key races, they do not guarantee overall positive results for Democrats on November 2. It's probably true, as the Delaware Republican Party chair says, that Christine O'Donnell, the Palin-backed perennial candidate who upset moderate Mike Castle, is too scandal-plagued and ideologically \"out there\" to win. But Tea Party\u2013tied Senate candidates who elbowed aside seemingly more electable Republicans in Florida, Kentucky, Colorado, Connecticut, Alaska, Wisconsin and other states have much better chances. Many of them have substantial war chests and are tacking to the center. At the same time, polls suggest that Democrats continue to experience an enthusiasm gap (see \"Think, Prey, Vote,\"\u00a0by John Nichols). What to do? There's an argument to be made for a smart nationalization of the Congressional races, with an eye toward forcing all GOP candidates to answer for extreme elements of the Tea Party agenda, which include eliminating or at least slashing Social Security and Medicare, handing the election of senators back to state legislatures, giving states far more say over civil rights and rewriting the Constitution so that children born to immigrants are not afforded citizenship. The ugly truth is that some of these stances are popular in some places, but taken as a whole, the Tea Party program is an extremist one. Highlighting it and demanding responses from Republicans could create tensions in their ranks that benefit Democrats. Forcing a GOP Senate prospect like Connecticut's Linda McMahon or a gubernatorial candidate like New York's Carl Paladino to respond to the Tea Party creates a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" dynamic in which an embrace of extreme stances scares off moderate Republicans and independents, while a distancing from those stances offends the faithful. But scare tactics aren't going to be enough nationally or in many of the most competitive races. Progressives who are frightened by the prospect of a Tea Party\u2013defined GOP holding the balance of power may forget their frustrations with the Obama administration and rush to the polls. However, the broader base of casual Democrats and independents, whose votes elected Obama and produced overwhelming Democratic majorities in Congress, are deeply worried about high unemployment and retirement. A populist message that emphasizes job creation and protection of Social Security, along with tax cuts for the working and middle class instead of the wealthiest, would do a lot to answer those concerns, as would a tough stance against the depredations of Wall Street (President Obama could give a powerful signal on that front by appointing Elizabeth Warren as head of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). Such a campaign, combined with an explanation of the economic threats posed by a hard turn to the right, could yet provide Democrats with the numbers they need to keep a lid on the teapot.",

            "article_content": "With Republicans taking over the House, and the president's deficit commission ready to report, the country's two biggest entitlement programs -- Medicare and Social Security -- are in the cross hairs. The co-chairs of the deficit commission, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, have proposed a series of dramatic changes to the two programs: among them, higher retirement ages and premiums, and lower benefits and more taxes for the wealthy. Promises to \"cut spending\" are simple, resolute and popular on the campaign trail. But a deeper look at reform possibilities -- specifically for the country's ballooning entitlement programs -- raises complex questions. Two men facing those questions right now are Charles Blahous and Robert Reischauer. Each was appointed by the president as a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare. And each tells NPR's Guy Raz that he's worried about an impending day of reckoning. Trusting The Social Security Trust Fund For starters, when it comes to Social Security, how long until the government's coffers run dry? The Social Security trust fund should last until 2037.\u00a0 But the money in that fund is actually spent by the government to buy Treasury bonds.\u00a0 And when you think about it that way, the trust fund is more like a collection of IOUs the government has written to itself. \"A lot of people -- because there is this large Social Security trust fund on paper -- are tempted to believe that the financing problems are much further away than they actually are,\" Blahous says. In a book out next month, Social Security: The Unfinished Work, Blahous writes about what he calls \"the mounting cost of delay\" in dealing with the long-term solvency of Social Security. It's politically difficult to change or reduce benefits for people about to retire or who are already retired, Blahous argues.\u00a0 And with baby boomers reaching retirement age in droves, each year without reform excludes millions of Americans from reform. On Social Security: Act Now, Save Later Blahous says the government can ease the pain by enacting reforms that are very gradual -- such as the Bowles-Simpson proposal to raise the retirement age from 67 to 69 over 48 years after 2020. \"You can smooth out the changes so that any particular birth cohort or income group is not going to feel the changes terribly acutely,\" he says. The problem, he says, is that politicians have little incentive to enact changes that won't be felt for 30 years. \"One of the great difficulties is that the benefits of correcting the system are not felt until after the political action is taken to reform it,\" Blahous says. \"But what I would say to someone sitting in office now is that if you act today, you could fix the system without changing benefits for those in retirement, without raising taxes and without actually having benefits in the future that are lower than they are today.\" Blahous says that the next couple of months, as Washington digests the Simpson-Bowles recommendations, may be crucial. \"We're in a very critical period where we're going to see how much support [Simpson and Bowles] get from the White House,\" he says.\u00a0 \"We're going to learn a lot about where the president wants to go -- how much he really wants a Social Security deal.\" And the Simpson-Bowles proposal, he says, is a good place to start. \"Any solution is going to have to look roughly like what they did.\" On Medicare: Fewer Dollars, More Sense Robert Reischauer, the other public trustee and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, also says \"small, measured, phased in adjustments\" to entitlement reform are key -- if they're enacted over a long period of time. But the growth rates of Medicare and the economy are still too far apart for Medicare to be sustainable, he says. Medicare is growing by about 8 percent a year. The economy has been sputtering along at less than half that. Meanwhile, Medicare's largest fund -- the one that pays for hospital insurance -- will run out of money by 2029. \"People don't relate to a crisis that's going to occur 20 or 30 years from now,\" he says. One way to increase awareness, Reischauer says, is to reduce the subsidy provided through the tax system for employer-provided health care. In other words, taxing people for the health care they receive through their employer. \"That helps Medicare simply by making the whole system more cost-conscious,\" Reischauer says. \"Right now we're very ignorant of exactly the full costs of our health care, or what impact it's having on us.\" 'This Is Not About Today's Seniors' Both Blahous and Reischauer say one major hurdle to entitlement reform is misinformation about what reform would actually mean, particularly when it comes to seniors and Medicare. Voters over 65 broke 58 to 39 percent for Republicans in the midterm elections. And many of them saw ads like one from North Carolina congressional candidate Renee Elmers, which accused the president of \"cutting Medicare half a trillion dollars to pay for Obamacare.\" \"The Affordable Care Act did reduce Medicare spending by about half a trillion dollars,\" Reischauer says. \"But beyond that, the ad is a complete mischaracterization.\" The new health care law, he says, also closed a hole in the prescription drug plan, so that people who pay a lot for medication aren't denied insurance coverage. It provides for an annual physical, another new benefit. On Social Security, Blahous says seniors have nothing to worry about until closer to 2030. \"This is not about today's seniors,\" he says. \"We're basically making decisions about the rate of growth of future benefits and the rate of growth of future tax burdens.\" He adds, \"Unfortunately, a lot of our political discussion often is surrounded by scaring seniors.\"",

            "article_content": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi's supporters have hailed her plan to compete for House minority leader when Republicans take over the chamber in January, predicting that she'll \"play rough\" with the GOP. An interesting notion. After all, even Pelosi's detractors characterize her as a no-quit fighter, interested in preserving Democratic initiatives, including health care legislation, that she pushed through as leader. But history and House rules suggest the notion that Pelosi or any Democrat might be able to stymie Speaker-in-Waiting John Boehner and his Republican Party's agenda -- much less notch any legislative wins -- is far-fetched.

That's particularly true now, at what is effectively the start of the 2012 presidential election campaign. Republicans, focused on retaking the White House, have pledged to deny President Obama and his party any wins in the next two years. So what are the House Democrats' options? Well, they can certainly make a lot of noise and perhaps make some mischief in the minority, says former Democratic Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, who served in the House from 1979 to 2004. One arrow in the Democrats' quiver is a parliamentary maneuver known as \"motion to recommit.\" It allows the minority party to highlight unpopular or controversial elements of a bill and potentially send the legislation back to committee. If such a motion attracts enough support from majority party members it can delay or even kill a bill. At a minimum, such a motion can force the majority party to take a vote that puts its members on the record with an unpopular stand. It has been used frequently by Minority Leader Boehner, most notably to push back on Democrats' energy and jobs initiatives. Frost says that in the end, however, the House plays by casino-like \"house rules,\" meaning that \"the majority always wins.\" Dec. 19, 1998: House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt leads other Democrats in a walkout during the impeachment of President Clinton. Democrats argued for the lesser penalty of censure. Sometimes the minority party in the House, frustrated by the rules, uses such demonstrations to get attention its causes.\n                \n                    \n                    APTN photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption That's the reality -- no matter how tenacious Pelosi proves, or how much Democrats try to stir the political pot. House Rules Unlike rules in the Senate, where members may engage in unlimited debate on legislation and one member of either party can stop a measure in its tracks, at least temporarily, House rules allow the majority party to stipulate how every bill proceeds. That means the majority, through the House Rules Committee, controls whether or how many amendments can be offered on individual bills. The majority also determines how much time -- if any -- will be spent debating measures, and how that debate will proceed. That is, if any back and forth is allowed at all. \"That is the predicament of being the minority in the House -- the aggressive use of the Rules Committee to limit what the minority party can do,\" says Sarah Binder, an expert on Congress and legislative politics at George  Washington University. \"There's very little opening for the minority party to make a difference.\" Take the word of former Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, whose two decades in the House were spent in the Republican minority. \"As a purple-hearted veteran of the minority in the House, the Democrats simply don't have a lot of weaponry,\" says Frenzel, first elected in 1970. \"In the same way they were able to overrun Republicans, Republicans can now overrun them.\" \"No matter how skilled [Pelosi] is, she lacks the horsepower to deliver from the minority party position,\" says Frenzel, 82, who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Just ask House Republicans, who in the past session were reduced to making lots of noise but wielding little, if any, influence as Pelosi and her large majority pushed through the health care overhaul. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who will soon be in the minority.\n                \n                    \n                    Cliff Owen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Now it's Democrats, who have controlled the House since 2006, who will go from a position of incredible power to one in which they are at the mercy of the majority. More Open Rules? But what to make of Boehner's assertions that, as speaker, he would embrace a more open rules policy? It's happened before, and not so terribly long ago. In the mid-1990s, partly in response to four decades of firm Democratic House control, Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich initiated a \"big drop in restrictive rules,\" Binder says. Boehner, a Gingrich loyalist at the time, was part of the GOP's leadership team. But by the late 1990s the rules restrictions had ratcheted up again as the GOP sought to more efficiently pursue its agenda. The Rules Committee, established during the first Congress in 1789, hasn't always been used to concentrate power in the speaker's office, historians say. But it has become a tradition that has ebbed and flowed -- mostly flowed -- in the past 100 years. In a chamber as diverse and unwieldy as the House, it seems leaders of both parties have taken away the lesson that it takes a dictator, in the form of the speaker, to get anything done. \"One of the most appealing parts about Speaker-presumptive Boehner is that he's talked about letting the committees work again, and having some openness to the rules,\" Frenzel says. \"It's worthy of a try. I believe that was part of the secret of the old kinder, gentler Congresses.\" But, Frenzel adds, Boehner will be under tremendous pressure \"to do what Newt, [former Republican Majority Leader Tom] DeLay, and Nancy did: beat the heck out of the opposition and essentially choke them to death.\" Here We Go Again It only takes a quick look back to early 1995 to envision how debate, such as it will be, will unfold in the House come January. From a C-SPAN video (at left) taken on Feb. 2, 1995, during the traditional one-minute morning speeches in the GOP-controlled House: Boehner takes to the podium and espouses his party's \"Contract with America\" and efforts being made to pass a balanced-budget amendment, to ban \"unfunded mandates,\" to pursue welfare reform, term limits and the line item veto. And, of course, tax cuts. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he says, \"this is our contract with America.\" Shortly after, then-Illinois Rep. Richard Durbin, now a Democratic leader in the Senate, was at the microphone (below). Durbin: The Republican \"contract on America\" is a budgetbuster, with tax cuts for the wealthiest that will cost an estimated $900 billion over seven years. \"At a time we should put fat cats on a diet,\" he says, the GOP contract \"puts them on the gravy train.\" Frost advises House Democrats to attempt to force Republicans to vote on GOP initiatives, like Rep. Paul Ryan's economic proposal that includes major changes and cuts to Social Security and Medicare. And he foresees \"a lot of good guerrilla warfare\" opportunity if Boehner loosens rules of debate and amendments. Binder sees less opportunity for the minority party. \ufeff\"The best Democrats can do is coordinate their message as best they can,\" Binder says, noting that even that may be a challenge, given the party's House leadership struggles now playing out. \"Can they hone a message? Can they help the party's reputation?\" Binder says. \"The challenge here is that Democrats may not be on the same page, and President Obama is under some pressure to move to the center. \"What becomes of House Democrats amidst all that?\"",

After Republicans effectively portrayed her in the midterm elections as the poster child of alleged Democratic and liberal overreach, leading to the GOP's historic victory Tuesday night in which they attained the House majority, Pelosi isn't going away quietly. Her tweet: Driven by the urgency of creating jobs & protecting\u00a0#hcr,\u00a0#wsr, Social Security & Medicare, I am running for Dem Leader. HCR and WSR refer to the health care and Wall Street reforms. Many Democrats had hoped that Pelosi, age 70, would allow a new leader to come forward. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, also age 70 and now the majority leader, wasn't exactly a new face. But he was considered her natural successor as leader of House Democrats though he had let it be known that if Pelosi wanted to keep the top post, he would step aside. It's safe to say there will be much gnashing of teeth among many Democrats who believe Pelosi will offer the new Republican majority a handy pinata. She does have her supporters, however. She is very popular among liberals who see her as a bulwark against the tendency towards moderation of Democrats from less safely Democratic districts like the San Francisco one she represents. It just returned her to Washington with 80 percent of the vote. Also, Pelosi is known as a tough politician who doesn't shrink from a fight. So she is essentially issuing her own version of \"bring it on\" to the new Republican majority. And there's little doubt they will. What is the instant analysis for what this means for President Obama? It could actually benefit him in that it could give him political foils on the left (Pelosi) and the right (House Republicans) which would allow him to make a centrist appeal to the political independents he'll need to regain if he hopes to win re-election. But Pelosi was such a ready lightning rod in the recent mid-term elections, that she made Republican messaging simple. \"Fire Pelosi\" was pretty much all they had to say. If her presence proves a distraction to Obama's attempts to get his message across as he runs for re-election, she could wind up being a liability for him. ------------- Added at 2:28 pm ET -- MoveOn.org e-mailed members Friday morning asking them to contact Pelosi's office to urge her to run. Here's an excerpt: \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the  strongest, most progressive leaders in Washington. Her determination brought health  care reform back to life last winter, when the Senate and the White House were  ready to scale back. \u00a0She fought harder than anyone for bigger, better job  creation bills. And right now, she is the strongest voice in leadership for  ending Bush's millionaire tax bailout. But after Tuesday's elections, some  corporate Democrats are taking the wrong lesson\u2014saying that Democrats should be  less progressive and more like the Republicans. And they're pushing Speaker  Pelosi to step down. This would be a terrible loss for progressives, and for the  country. \u201d A spokeswoman for MoveOn.org said that now that Pelosi has decided to run for minority leader in the new Congress, the organization will be working to assure her of the support she needs from other Democratic lawmakers to keep the top post in their party's conference.",

Quick, what do you do? Egg him on in trying to  repeal the law, urge him to reverse course, or suggest he focus on something  else? Kaiser Health  News put the question to three dozen people across the country. Some of the responses were  snarky -- and included inevitable cracks about Boehner\u2019s smoking and perpetual  tan -- but most were serious. Some people urged him to keep his hands off the  newly enacted health law; others wanted him to go after it full bore. Even some  conservatives urged him to be selective in targeting provisions of the law.  Others advised him to focus on the big fiscal picture, including entitlements  like Medicare.

Ethan  RomeExecutive  director, Health Care for America Now. I didn\u2019t agree with  you when you shouted \u201cHell, no!\u201d on the House floor during  the health care debate. But given the outcome of the elections, that kind of  rhetoric will be useful now.\u00a0When the Tea Party types want to pursue a health  care repeal that everyone knows is going nowhere, you should tell them, \u201cHell,  no!\u201d\u00a0When your GOP comrades want to play politics by defunding the health care  law and holding up its implementation, tell them, \u201cHell, no!\u201d When the insurance  companies want to jack up our premiums at will, tell them, \u201cHell, no!\u201d -- and  then pass a strong rate-review bill.

Janet  TrautweinCEO,  National Association of Health Underwriters. You need to look at  what could be done to change the law to make it more workable and more business-  friendly so employers can continue to provide coverage to employees as they do  today.

The message from the  Tea Party, and from the swelling army of independent voters in your state and  elsewhere, is loud and clear \u2013 government spending has to be brought under  control. To do that, Congress must make some tough decisions about Medicare,  which is the biggest and most out-of-control part of the budget. And by  definition, tough decisions about Medicare will require real bipartisan  cooperation. Neither party is going to take the tough medicine alone, because  the political risks are too high.\u00a0 Leaders of both parties will have to jump off  the bridge together. ",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi waits to speak to supporters at an election night party in Washington on Tuesday. The California Democrat must relinquish the speaker's gavel after Republicans regained control of the House.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption During Nancy Pelosi's four years as speaker of the House, Congress approved the health care overhaul -- widely considered the most significant piece of domestic legislation since Medicare -- along with an $800 billion measure to stimulate the economy and a multibillion-dollar rescue of the banks. It is a legislative legacy that rivals the accomplishments of any speaker in modern times. It also most likely led to her downfall. From the moment she accepted the speaker's gavel, Pelosi understood her unique place in history as the first female speaker of the House. \"For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling,\" she said. \"To our daughters and our granddaughters now, the sky is the limit. Anything is possible.\" On Jan. 4, 2007, she became the most powerful woman in the country, second in line to succeed the president, in charge of the institution that set government spending and tax rates, the position that set the agenda for the 435-member House of Representatives. Pelosi's rise to power in the House was relatively swift. The daughter of a former congressman and mayor of Baltimore, Pelosi won a special election in her San Francisco district in 1987. She had a post on the Appropriations Committee and rose to become the Democratic whip and then minority leader. When Democrats won control of the House in the 2006 elections, the speakership was hers. She wryly hinted at the challenges that she discovered go with the post. \"I am impressed by all of the decisions that the new speaker has to make,\" she said. Challenges And Successes One of Pelosi's first decisions was to create an outside panel to review ethics charges. It was a key part of the Democrats' 2006 campaign platform. \"You have to first drain the swamp,\" she said, \"so our first order of business in the House would be a package for reform, for civility and for fiscal discipline.\" During Pelosi's first term as speaker, her biggest challenge was working with Republican President George W. Bush.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption During Pelosi's first term as speaker, her biggest challenge was working with Republican President George W. Bush.\u00a0 She also had to come to grips with what would remain an obstacle throughout her tenure: a Senate that, though also under Democratic control, had its own, slower way of doing things. One issue where those difficult relationships proved insurmountable was the war with Iraq. Pelosi and most House Democrats had run on their opposition to the war and their promise to withdraw U.S. troops. \"We put a bill on the president's desk that would have redeployed the troops out of Iraq within the next year. The president vetoed it. Since then, we haven't been able to get a bill on his desk because the Senate rules prevent that from happening,\" she said. \"The American people aren't interested in the Senate rules. They're interested in ending the war in Iraq.\" On other issues Pelosi had greater success. Democrats raised the minimum wage for the first time in a decade, and they increased gas mileage standards for cars. Spending on veterans went up, as did college aid. But those accomplishments were dwarfed by an urgent request from President Bush's Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson. He called on Congress to rescue the nation's biggest banks, many of which in August of 2008 were teetering on the brink of collapse. Pelosi went along. \"If even a fraction of what they were saying is really the case, there is really\u00a0 need for us to proceed. It's not anything you can take a chance on,\" she said. \"The only thing that was strange to us [is] that they had come in so late about a problem that was so vast. This was very, very, very bad news of a magnitude that spoke out for some of Congress' intervening.\" Congress ultimately approved what became the $700 billion TARP program. It was a vote that would come back to haunt Democrats, despite the fact that by most accounts it had succeeded in preventing the nation's largest financial institutions from collapsing. The Great Recession In November 2008, Democrats gained another 21 seats in the House, led by enthusiasm for their presidential candidate, Barack Obama, and helped by Pelosi's prodigious fundraising abilities. The heady days of the inauguration of the nation's first black president on the Capitol's West Front were soon tempered by the sober reality inside the building as Congress tried to deal with the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. At the president's request, the House took up a massive measure aimed at stimulating the economy. It passed without a single Republican vote. \"Today, we are passing historic legislation that honors the promises our new president made from the steps of the Capitol, promises to make the future better for our children and our grandchildren. We are moving the ship of state in a new direction in favor of the many, not the few,\" Pelosi said. \"With this vote today, we are taking America in a new direction.\" That spring, Pelosi faced another, more personal test: whether she was telling the truth when she denied ever having been briefed by the CIA about enhanced interrogation techniques used on suspected terrorists. The issue led to weeks of accusations and recriminations about which Pelosi refused to comment. When she finally did address the issue she leveled a serious charge against the CIA. \"They talked about interrogations that they had done and said, 'We want to use enhanced techniques, and we have legal opinions that say that they are OK. We are not using waterboarding.' That's the only mention that they were not using it. And we now know that earlier they were,\" she said. \"So yes, I am saying that they are misleading -- that the CIA was misleading the Congress.\" Health Care Overhaul The imbroglio soon passed, as Pelosi increasingly turned her attention to the massive overhaul of the nation's health insurance system. There were endless hearings, meetings between the White House and Democratic leaders, rallies and protests and vocal opposition from Republicans from the start. But Pelosi never lost sight of her goal. Universal health care had been a long-standing priority for Democrats, and after an arduous display of legislative sausage-making, it was finally approved in March of 2010. Pelosi looks on as President Barack Obama signs the health care overhaul bill in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I knew I came here to vote for health care for all Americans,\" she said. \"That has been a pillar of who I am and who we are as Democrats, but I didn't think I would be leading the way as speaker of the House, that's for sure.\" And as he signed the health care measure, President Obama had nothing but praise for the woman who guided its passage, calling Pelosi \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.\" But the cheers quickly faded, replaced by taunts of angry voters this campaign season, many of whom denounced Pelosi's biggest accomplishments. They labeled the health care overhaul \"Obamacare,\" a government takeover. They characterized the stimulus as a failure and bitterly denounced the bank bailouts. Pelosi was demonized by Republicans, as she had helped demonize an earlier speaker, Newt Gingrich. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, traveled the country on a \"fire Pelosi\" bus tour, and Republican candidates across the nation acted as though she was their opponent. Pelosi shrugged it off, saying the only thing that really mattered was winning. But not enough Democrats won in Tuesday's midterm elections to prevent Pelosi from having to relinquish the speaker's gavel.",

She couldn't avoid the inevitable questions however. It seemed everyone wanted to know what the only woman to ever rise to be second in the line of presidential succession has planned. Would the 70-year old San Francisco progressive leave the House leadership or Congress altogether, as other speakers who found themselves in similar positions have done, or would she try to hang on? An answer could be coming as soon as Wednesday evening. ABC News's Dianne Sawyer reportedly got an interview with Pelosi and would be airing it Wednesday evening. It was unclear whether she'd be making an announcement with Sawyer but the possibility was certainly hanging out there. Indeed, The Hill publication suggested she would be discussing her plans. House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio who is presumed to be the next speaker, said at a Wednesday news conference that Pelosi had tried to reach him and left a friendly voicemail. So it goes when power changes hands in Washington; the ascendant hold news conferences, the fallen leave voicemails. CNN's Dana Bash reported that she and other journalists staked out Pelosi's speaker's office. When Pelosi was spotted leaving the suite surrounded by her security detail, Bash said she and other reporters tagged along with the speaker firing off questions about her plans. The speaker didn't answer those questions. Instead, she led reporters on something of a slow-speed chase, Bash said, as she clearly tried to lose the journalists by traveling a circuitous route through the Capitol. Meanwhile, requiems for her career are appearing. For instance, Politico's John Bresnahan has a piece headlined \"The Rise and Fall of Nancy Pelosi.\" Her great failing, the piece asserts, is that she was so sure of the righteousness of the liberal causes she embraced she was insensitive to shifts in public sentiment. An excerpt: Although she wouldn\u2019t tolerate any internal challenge to her power \u2013 just ask former John Dingell, who clashed with her and ended up losing his chairmanship -- Pelosi made a point of reaching out to conservative Blue Dogs in her caucus, and she was the most accessible Democratic leader in modern times for the freshmen and sophomore lawmakers she helped elect the previous two cycles. And while a consummate politician, Pelosi disastrously misread the mood of the country following enactment of the health care package eight months ago. The California Democrat called it \u201cone more step forward in our drive to realize the promise of \u2018life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u2019 enshrined in our Declaration of Independence.\u201d \u201cHealth insurance reform will stand alongside Social Security and Medicare in the annals of American history,\u201d Pelosi declared confidently, predicting Democrats would be able to run on it in November. The expectation is that if and when Pelosi stands down as leader of the Democrats, Rep. Steny Hoyer, who has served as House Majority Leader, would present himself as her successor. But Hoyer could have competition. Rep. Heath Shuler, a centrist Democrat from North Carolina, had said that if Democrats had won, he would consider challenging Pelosi since her San Francisco liberal image was political poison for Democrats from more conservative districts. That desire for new faces to represent House Democrats may still run strong with some Democrats, especially given the kind of drubbing their party took on Tuesday.",

STEVE INSKEEP, Host: With the election just a day away, across the country, political campaigns are focused on one objective - mobilizing votes. MONTAGNE: On the airwaves and at rallies, candidates are trying to close the deal and energize their supporters to get out to the polls. INSKEEP: And this morning we're going to report on those last-minute efforts in three states, beginning in Florida with NPR's Greg Allen in Miami. GREG ALLEN: Bus traffic was up in Florida this weekend, not from Greyhound but from the political candidates. Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio, Independent Senate candidate Charlie Crist, and Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott are all on cross-state tours, holding get out the vote rallies at every stop. Even if they haven't chartered buses, the other statewide candidates are all doing the same. But the real congestion caused by Florida politics isn't on the roads, but on the airwaves. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) U: Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink. ALLEN: For weeks in his campaign ads, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott has relentlessly attacked his opponent, Democrat Alex Sink. And she's returned the favor. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) U: Take it from prosecutors who know, Rick Scott just can't be trusted. U: Scott claims he didn't know the company he led was systematically defrauding Medicare, ripping off seniors and taxpayers. ALLEN: Those ads have helped drive up the negative ratings of both candidates, but particularly for Scott. Two recent polls show more than half of Floridians view him negatively. So in the closing days of the campaign there's a new Scott ad on the air. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) MONTAGNE: This is our time. This is our time to change this state. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ALLEN: It's the same with Sink. Negative ads scored to dark, threatening music, have giving way to soaring strings and U2-inspired rock anthems. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) MONTAGNE: If you want honesty and integrity, if you're ready for a new day in Florida, then you come with me. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ALLEN: That means it's largely up to Republican candidates to get their voters out to the polls. To that end, Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio has also taken a break from attacks; seeking, instead, to inspire. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT) MONTAGNE: And that's why I'm running for the Senate, to change the direction Washington is taking our country, so that my four children can be a part of one of the great generations in American history.

            "article_content": "Nevadans vote early at the Meadows Mall in Las Vagas on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is locked in a tight race against Republican Sharron Angle, who is backed by the Tea Party.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty\n                    \n                \nhide caption No midterm election likely has higher stakes than the U.S. Senate race in Nevada where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is up against Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle, a former state assemblywoman who even some fellow Republicans find too extreme. Polls show a dead heat, and Nevada voters have until Friday night to cast early ballots; many already have. At an Albertsons supermarket in Las Vegas, shoppers could gamble their grocery money at the video poker machines lined up along one side of the lobby or they could mark an electronic ballot at a bank of portable voting machines lined up along the other side. Tepid Support One early voter, 59-year-old Mary Ann Smith, says she reluctantly chose Reid over Angle. \"I'm afraid of her,\" Smith said. \"She's out there, as far as I'm concerned. It's not that I like Harry that much, but, I'm just leery of Sharron.\" Casino dealer Larry Shepard also voted for Reid. The four-term senator, he says, has delivered for Nevada. \"He's brought jobs here,\" he said. \"As much as people think he hasn't, he has. There's been a lot of jobs brought here.\" That's not how Angle supporters see it. Robert Rendon, a registered Republican, says he was willing to vote for anyone, as long as it wasn't Reid: \"Look at the situation he put us in. I mean, the highest in unemployment, the highest in losing homes, people losing their houses, I mean, Jesus Christ, he ain't helpin' us, that's for sure,\" Rendon said. Mary Ann Sheldon, 78, also voted for Angle. \"Of course, I would've voted for almost anybody to try to get rid Of Harry Reid,\" she said. \"I do not like Harry Reid.\" Reid Defends Record Such resentment, says University of Nevada political scientist David Damore, is precisely why Reid, for all his power in Washington, could well be toppled by his fellow Nevadans. \"What we've seen in Nevada, I think, is [what] you've seen in a lot of other states ... just this sort of anger, this inchoate anger lashing out at the establishment; that if you're establishment, you are part of the problem,\" Damore said. At a recent get-out-the-vote rally in Henderson, Nev., Reid seemed to feel he had to defend his record even to supporters. \"We've been going through a lot in Nevada,\" he said. \"For 20 years, we were at the top of the economic food chain, and when Wall Street collapsed, we fell further than anyone else. \"But I want everyone to know here it isn't a secret, I didn't cause the financial collapse.\" The one determining factor for who's going to win is going to be about who has effectively made the election about the other person. University of Nevada political communications expert Joseph Valenzano Later, Reid explained why many voters believed he hadn't done enough for Nevada. \"I've done the best I can, doing everything I can to help the state of Nevada, but whoever is concerned about my not doing enough should understand that Sharron Angle has committed to doing nothing,\" Reid said. \"She wants to throw sand in the gears, she wants to slow things down, she wants to get rid of Social Security, Medicare.\" Reid continued listing what he called Angle's \"wild and extreme ideas.\" University  of Nevada political communications expert Joseph Valenzano says Reid cannot win by running on his own accomplishments. \"The one determining factor for who's going to win is going to be about who has effectively made the election about the other person,\" Valenzano said. While Reid has been going after Angle in public gatherings across the state, his Republican opponent did not respond to an interview request. GOP Opposition To Angle Angle has instead been flooding the airwaves with anti-Reid ads that hit the illegal immigration hot button. One released this week juxtaposes shots of dark-skinned, menacing-looking youths with scenes featuring threatened-looking white people. One out of four voters in Nevada is Hispanic, and some Republicans say Angle is doing their party no good by running such ads, which Latino leaders have condemned. Sig Rogich, who advised both Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, has organized more than 400 prominent Nevada Republicans to support Reid and oppose Angle. \"Her position on Hispanics is outrageous,\" he said. \"You know, she has no desire to bring them into the process, and I think the Republican Party recognizes that they have to move into that mainstream to be successful, and so I just think it would be a tragic mistake for Nevada to have that woman in the United States Senate.\" But Angle may also win over more voters than she alienates with her ads and as for who'll come out on top next Tuesday, all bets are off.",

But if they regain control of the House next month, will they be able to keep those promises?\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio held up a copy of the GOP agenda, \"A Pledge to America,\" last month in Virginia. From left are: House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, Boehner and Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana. A recent Gallup Poll found that 52 percent of Americans believe Republicans will win control of the U.S. House of Representatives after this fall's midterm elections. If their predictions are right and Republicans do win the House, how will they lead? Will  they be able to keep the promises made in their \"Pledge  to America\"? Lessons From 1874 If the Republicans win the House this fall, it would mark an important shift in power. But these kinds of shifts are nothing new. Take 1874, for example, when Republican President Ulysses S. Grant found himself in a situation President Obama might appreciate. Republicans went into the year controlling the White House and both houses of Congress. But the party was under siege because of legislation unpopular in many parts of the country, especially action that gave blacks the right to vote. There were even loud warnings about encroaching socialism. Democrats argued that Republicans wanted to spread the vote to people without property, education or any interest in working, says Heather Cox Richardson, a political historian who specializes in Civil War history. She tells NPR's Guy Raz that Democrats warned against \"electing people to office who will redistribute wealth, who will take in tax money and hand it back to these same poor people in the form of all sorts of benefits that they didn't have access to before the Civil War.\" Grant was a war hero, loved by nearly everyone, but the midterm elections still awarded Democrats control of the House. How Might Republicans Lead Today? In 1874, the Democrats campaigned on the idea that the Republicans were misusing taxpayers' money. In 2010, Republicans are using a similar argument, holding up their \"Pledge to America\" as a road map to fix the economy. Balancing the budget is a major part of that pledge, though exactly how Republicans will do that isn't clear from the 21-page document. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) says if the Republicans win one or both houses of Congress, Job 1 will be to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for both middle- and upper-income Americans. \"We have to provide the certainty to our small-business folks, our job creators, where their taxes are going to be in the next at least year, and on and on, so they can plan,\" she tells Raz. She also says that Republicans will have to take a \"serious look at Medicare and Medicaid and see what can be changed.\" But Capito warns that it can't just be the Republicans formulating this plan. \"When you talk about something as deeply personal to the American family as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, \" she says, \"this is where I think hopefully we can take down the hammers and try to find a bipartisan solution.\" Even so, Capito sees balancing the budget in the first year as a \"lofty goal.\" \"I think you'll see a movement toward that, but I don't believe that achieving a balanced budget in one year is realistically achievable,\" she says. So What Is Realistic? That's a sentiment shared by Maya MacGuineas, once described as \"an anti-deficit warrior\" by The Wall Street Journal. \"The Pledge to America, that's a campaign document -- and it's not filled at all with the real policies that are going to address the debt problems that we have in this country,\" she says. MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes fiscal restraint. She points out that entitlement reform is only mentioned twice in the document. Realistically, however, neither cuts in discretionary spending nor tax cuts will make a big enough dent in the deficit, MacGuineas says. Current discussion on the campaign trail isn't where it needs to be, she says. \"It's the two parties battling over whether to add $4 trillion to the debt or $3 trillion to the debt. So when the first step of every discussion is, 'Do you want to make the tax cuts permanent? Or just most of the tax cuts permanent?' -- you know that we really haven't woken up to the challenges ahead of us.\"",

Election Day is 11 days away, but already a lot of people in Washington are looking beyond Nov. 2 to next January -- when a new Congress comes to town. No matter which party ends up controlling the House and Senate, in January it will be a whole new world in Washington. There will be more Republicans -- and fewer Democrats -- and since many of the moderates in both parties are likely to lose on Election Day, the Republican caucus will be more conservative and the Democrats more liberal. Bill Galston, a former top aide to President Bill Clinton, says that new, superpolarized environment -- with neither side having a functional majority in Congress -- will present a brand new challenge to President Obama. \"The core of the legislative strategy in the White House over the past two years has been to unite the Democratic Party and then try to pick off one or two or three Republicans,\" Galston says. \"We know already, before we see any of the results of the November election, that that game will be up.\" After January, says Galston, nothing will pass unless it has a real bipartisan majority. \"Therefore, either there will be two years of gridlock, which I think would be a catastrophe for the United States because our competitors are not standing still and neither is the world, or there's going to have to be a different kind of conversation between the two political parties,\" he says. \"Those are the two choices. There is no third choice.\" Sharing Power And right now, you'd have to bet on gridlock, if only because of the rhetoric from either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Republican leaders and officials from the Democratic-held White House both say it's up to the other side to start that different kind of conversation. \"I think it depends on the president,\" says Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. \"If the president's going to maintain his ideological stance and try to jam things through to support the left in America, when we're still a center-right country, we're going to say no.\"  Meanwhile, David Axelrod, the president's top political adviser, sees things differently. \"Sen. Cornyn said they would move quickly to repeal the health reform and repeal financial reform. Sen. [Jim] DeMint [of South Carolina], who's going to have his own caucus within the Republican caucus, has said their goal is gridlock,\" Axelrod says. \"We've had people in the Republican leadership on the House side warning their Republican followers to prepare for a government shutdown. That's not an encouraging thing.\" Both sides may spend the next two years breathing fire at each other and getting in position for the 2012 elections. But, says Kenneth Duberstein, who was Republican President Reagan's chief of staff during a period of divided government, sharing power doesn't have to mean that nothing gets done. \"It seems to me that with all of the talk of gridlock and polarization that it will be incumbent upon the president and the Republican leaders of Congress to find some areas to cooperate,\" Duberstein says. Changes are already in the works. The president told The\u00a0New York Times that he regrets being painted not as a different kind of Democrat but as a typical tax-and-spend liberal. And White House aides are talking about more business-friendly tax breaks to encourage hiring, scaled-back bills on energy and immigration, and trying to find common ground on long-stalled trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. They point to education reform as another area where there should be bipartisan consensus. \"Perhaps the biggest area of opportunity is the deficit commission, which is coming out in early December, which will look at our midterm and long-term deficits and how to address them,\" Duberstein says. \"That's what the American people I think are looking for and it may fit in very well with President Obama's needs and the needs of the Republicans, ascendant as they are, to demonstrate it's not the party of stop but the party of let's work together on a few items that are important.\" Looking For Common Ground With power comes accountability. Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) -- the man who would most likely be speaker in a Republican House of Representatives -- seems to understand that Republicans need to avoid repeating the mistakes they made in 1994 when they lost a standoff with President Clinton over the government shutdown. \"I think the American people want us to find a way to work together to address the concerns that face the American people every day. We're going to drive for a smaller, less costly and more accountable government here in Washington,  D.C.,\" Boehner says. \"And to the extent that we can find common ground in that direction, I would welcome it.\" Democrat Clinton also faced a Republican Congress after his first two years in office. John Podesta, his former chief of staff, remembers that Clinton reached out to the Republicans to pass welfare reform and eventually a balanced budget. But he didn't compromise on Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. Podesta recommends a similar two-track approach for Obama. \"There will be a set of issues where he'll have to draw a line in the sand and say, 'You can't come across this line, and I'm going to stop you from doing it,' \" Podesta says. \"His whole experience in his life has been trying to bring people together, and hopefully he'll be able to do that. But he'll also have to be prepared, I think, to stop things that he thinks will harm the country.\" Those line-in-the-sand issues will include any GOP effort to repeal the president's health care or financial regulatory overhauls. Intraparty Dynamics But a larger Republican presence in Congress carries risks as well, says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who clashed and compromised with Clinton after the Republican takeover in 1994. \"The Republicans are going to have a fascinating challenge. John Boehner will probably have at least 80 and maybe 100 freshmen, counting the ones who will replace Republican retirees. They're all going to be more anti-Washington. They're all going to be more anti-spending. They're all going to think they were elected from back home to lecture the Republican leadership on its failings,\" Gingrich says. For instance, if Republicans do control the House next year, will they be able to round up the votes to raise the debt limit in order to avoid a government default and shutdown? That's hard to imagine, since so many of their Tea Party-backed candidates campaigned against doing that. Gingrich says that's just one of the challenges Republicans will face. \"They have two oddly opposite risks. They have a risk that they will be so chaotic and so unable to govern that they discredit the brand before the presidential election. And they have the risk that they will sell out in such a way that they will infuriate the base and end up with a genuine third-party Tea movement in 2012,\" Gingrich says. \"And so they've got to somehow balance those two.\" Gingrich says the Republicans will have to try to repeal health care, and that the party's base will go crazy if they don't. But it's still possible that the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will find a way to work together, says Galston, if the president is able to set the stage for a new dynamic. But he says it won't happen right away. \"Not in January or February or even June -- but by October or November and December, I think, it will begin to sink in that the president is being reasonable, conciliatory and forward-looking and the Republican Party has not reciprocated. And at that point they will have no choice,\" Galston says. So the safest prediction may be that the next two years will be unpredictable.",

            "article_content": "For the longest time, everyone following Florida politics seemed to be at the edge of their seats when it came to the Senate race. No longer.\u00a0 Now, the thing that they can't stop talking about is the race for governor. Marco Rubio is surrounded by supporters as he makes a campaign appearance outside an early voting location on October 20, 2010 in Miami, Florida.\u00a0 Marco Rubio is the frontrunner in the Florida Senate Race.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marco Rubio is surrounded by supporters as he makes a campaign appearance outside an early voting location on October 20, 2010 in Miami, Florida.\u00a0 Marco Rubio is the frontrunner in the Florida Senate Race. That was certainly my observation last week when I had the pleasure of visiting member station WFSU in Tallahassee and then heading over to speak to the folks at the Capital Tiger Bay Club, an organization of rabid political junkies who have just the right combination of political astuteness and wacky humor. I'll get to the Florida politics stuff in a bit.\u00a0 But first, here is just a sampling of some of the campaign buttons the Tiger Bay Clubbers made for the event, a ton of which were dumped on every table. There were funny buttons (and at least one scary one) distributed at the Tiger Bay Club event.\u00a0 Clockwise, starting at upper left: (1) \"Charlie Crist High School/Home of the Fighting Chameleons;\" (2) \"I Will Clean Sinks\" (picture of GOP gov. candidate Rick Scott, made to look like Mr. Clean, who is running against Alex Sink); (3) God help us all; (4) \"The Meek [Kendrick Meek] May Inherit the Earth, But Not a Seat In the U.S. Senate;\" (5) \"Show Us Your Birth Certificate\" (picture of Marco Rubio); and (6) \"The Axis of Taxes\" (pictures of Pelosi, Obama and Reid).\n                hide caption The current story line for the Senate race is far different from where it had started.\u00a0 Gov. Charlie Crist was the odds-on favorite to win the Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Mel Martinez.\u00a0 When Martinez surprised everyone and resigned in August 2009, Crist appointed a close adviser, George LeMieux, to hold the seat temporarily ... with the assumption being that \"temporarily\" meant until Crist won the election. But while Crist and the GOP establishment were measuring the drapes in the Senate, Marco Rubio, the former speaker of the state House and a strong conservative, was quickly lining up support from those who never liked Crist's brand of moderate politics, and who were further inflamed when it appeared that the governor actually \"embraced\" President Obama during a visit to Florida to sell his economic stimulus plan (see Junkie post, \"The Danger of Looking for Amanda Hugginkiss,\" Feb. 11, 2010). As complaints from the right about Crist escalated, Rubio's numbers shot up -- so much that Crist felt his only chance for redemption was to quit the GOP and run as an independent. For awhile, some were wondering if the split between Crist and Rubio might enable the Democratic nominee, Rep. Kendrick Meek, to squeak in.\u00a0 But now Crist seems to be seeking -- and getting -- much of his support from the \"D\" side of the political divide, including endorsements from former Democratic state chair Charlie Whitehead and ex-Rep. Robert Wexler (D).\u00a0 California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, came on board for Crist as well this week, but the Governator has long since worn out his welcome with conservatives.\u00a0 Rubio looks like a clear winner. But it's dead even in the gubernatorial contest to succeed Crist, a crucial race given that Florida will gain congressional seats in the next census and whoever is governor and controls the state legislature will draw the lines. State Attorney General Bill McCollum was expected to be the GOP nominee but found himself upended in the August primary by Rick Scott, a Tea Party-backed millionaire businessman.\u00a0 Scott is a charismatic and energetic campaigner, but as CEO of Columbia/HCA health care company he faced accusations of Medicare fraud.\u00a0 He was ousted by the company's board of directors in 1997, and Columbia/HCA eventually paid a $1.7 billion fine. On the Democratic side, the candidate is Alex Sink, the state's elected Chief Financial Officer.\u00a0 A Sunshine State News poll released Wednesday shows the two deadlocked at 45 percent each, with eight percent preferring \"other\" and two percent undecided.\u00a0 Independents are leaning in Sink's direction but Republicans seem more motivated to vote. In a debate Wednesday evening, reports the Miami Herald, Sink portrayed Scott \"as untrustworthy and unprepared to lead the nation's fourth largest  state,\" and Scott \"repeatedly sought to link Sink to President Barack Obama and called her a failed  fiscal watchdog.\" David Colburn, writing in the Gainesville Sun, likens the Scott-Sink race to the 1988 Senate battle in Florida between Republican Connie Mack and Democrat Buddy MacKay.\u00a0 A critical part of Mack's victory was his effective \"Buddy, You're a Liberal\" charge, and Colburn sees Scott emulating that tactic: Scott has harkened back to Mack\u2019s strategy by tagging Alex Sink with the  \u201cLiberal\u201d label in his ads. And once again we find the public deeply troubled by  the role and scope of the federal government. Scott lacks the name recognition  that Mack enjoyed and the public integrity of Mack. But he has millions of  dollars of his own wealth that he is spending to tar Sink as a liberal with  Florida\u2019s largely conservative voters. ... Although she  is not a liberal or a lifelong politician, Sink, like MacKay before her, has had  to battle the image Floridians have of the national Democratic Party. For both  MacKay and Sink, they found it extraordinarily difficult to escape the shadow of  their national party. Sink has wisely chosen to highlight her business and  banking background and her success in the private sector. Getting that message  out, however, has not been easy with so many Floridians angry about the state of  the economy and anxious about the future.

We also keep hearing  a lot of ominous music and seeing a lot of grainy, unflattering photos of Nancy  Pelosi.\" He tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep, \"You get the impression that there's an assembly line somewhere where virtually identical ads are being made for many, many congressional races. ... An ad in Milwaukee sounds virtually identical to an ad in Austin or Portland. They're cookie cutters.\" And many of them just aren't true. \"They find the most extreme things; they find a kernel of truth and just exaggerate it to a ridiculous extent,\" Adair says. What are some of the common, often exaggerated, claims? -- The charge from Democrats that Republicans want to \"privatize Social Security.\" According to PolitiFact's reporters, Adair writes, \"the tricky part this year is that Republicans have been careful with their  words and have not fully supported a privatization plan. So we've  rated many of these claims Barely True or Half True.\" -- My opponent is a \"career politician!\" According to PolitiFact, \"the claim doesn't always fit because in some cases, the targets of the attacks  actually have not been politicians for very long. Reid Ribble, the Wisconsin  candidate in one of those clips, has actually not sought elected office  before.\" -- Democrats are in favor of \"cutting Medicare.\" PolitiFact's analysis: \"The Republicans are referring to the Democrats' votes on the health care plan,  which was largely paid for through cuts in future Medicare spending. But we've  usually rated the Republican claims Barely True because the core benefits of  Medicare are not being cut.\" -- \"Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!\" In most ads, PolitiFact finds, Republicans charge their Democratic opponents with being responsible for tens or hundreds of thousands of job losses. \"The ads usually get the numbers right, but we've typically rated these claims  Half True because economists told us it's not completely accurate to blame one  politician for a state's economic predicament.\" -- \"Ants, a blueberry farm and Christmas.\" As Adair writes: \"Republicans love to point out government spending that they consider  wasteful, so we've heard lots of attacks against Democrats for projects that  sound frivolous. In some cases, such as the ants, the line is so good that it's  been used against several different Democrats in different parts of the country.  It's also been used in primaries against other Republicans. \"But we've  found the claims are often exaggerated because the target of the attacks didn't  actually vote for the ant study; they simply supported the $787 billion economic  stimulus, which in turn included money for scientific research through various  organizations, and one of them dedicated money to the ant study.\"",
