            "article_content": "Missouri's last clinic that provides abortions is close to losing its license. Oklahoma communities are in a standoff with the raging Arkansas River. New election technology sparks security questions.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Missouri's last health clinic that provides abortions is within days of losing its license. If it does, Missouri would become the only state in this country without an abortion provider. NOEL KING, HOST: Right. And unless a court steps in, the state's health department probably won't renew that clinic's license. It expires on Friday. Now, Planned Parenthood runs the center in St. Louis. Their president, Leana Wen, told NPR they've been fighting to keep it open. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) LEANA WEN: We have complied with every single regulation that politicians have thrown our way, but the goalpost keeps on changing. And this most recent goalpost is potentially subjecting physicians and training residents, fellows, to criminal prosecution. KING: That goalpost she's referring to is this requirement that clinicians submit to questioning in order to get the clinic's license renewed. INSKEEP: Why is that questioning a problem? Well, let's try to find out from Sarah Fentem of St. Louis Public Radio, who's covering this story and is on the line. Good morning. SARAH FENTEM, BYLINE: Hi, everyone. INSKEEP: I can imagine someone from the state saying, listen. We just want to ask some questions, and it's the rule. What is the reason that Planned Parenthood or the employees at this clinic give for not wanting to be questioned? FENTEM: So that's not 100% clear. Planned Parenthood reps said yesterday that they asked the state if what was said during these interviews could potentially be used against the clinicians, and the state said it couldn't rule it out. And also, several of the clinicians aren't technically Planned Parenthood employees. Like, for example, there are independent trainees or there are residents that work there, so Planned Parenthood said it couldn't compel them to be interviewed even if they wanted to do that. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. So there's some technicality of who's the boss. But when we heard the person from Planned Parenthood there say potentially subjecting physicians and training residents to criminal prosecution, that's what she's saying. She's essentially saying, we believe this interview would be to - for the purpose of gathering criminal information on somebody. FENTEM: I think they were worried that could potentially happen, yes. INSKEEP: But it is not clear, from the perspective of the state, that that's the purpose of this interview? FENTEM: As far as I know, that's all that they have told me. Yes. INSKEEP: OK. And the state says this interview is necessary - why? What is the reason they give? FENTEM: Well, they said that it was to investigate certain problems with the clinic. But beyond that, they did not give either reporters or Planned Parenthood workers any more information than they just wanted to investigate certain problems with the clinic. INSKEEP: OK, so some mutual suspicion here and some unanswered questions in this standoff. Now, we have to note that Missouri is one of the states that, at the same time, has been passing quite restrictive abortion laws. The governor of Missouri signed a bill banning virtually all abortions just last week. Is there a connection between that act by the legislature and the governor and this standoff with the abortion clinic? FENTEM: Sort of. So last week, as you said, Governor Parson signed a bill that would outlaw most abortions after eight weeks, and that makes Missouri one of the most restrictive states when it comes to abortion rights. But that law doesn't go into effect until the end of August. So it's not a direct effect of that law, but it is part of this larger anti-abortion movement that's happening in Missouri. The governor and many members of the legislature have been really tough on abortion. Mike Parson is a Republican who has said on Twitter he wants to make Missouri the most pro-life state in the country. And abortion rights supporters say the increased regulations on abortion clinics, including those annual inspections and license renewals, are a way to further that anti-abortion agenda. And abortion clinics have, indeed, closed across the state in recent years. The one in St. Louis that we're talking about is sort of the last one standing. INSKEEP: Sarah, thanks so much for the update - really appreciate it. FENTEM: Thanks for having me. INSKEEP: Sarah Fentem of St. Louis Public Radio. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. The tornadoes that swept through eastern Kansas last night were just the latest severe weather for that region. KING: That's right. A series of storms also flooded rivers. Parts of the city of Tulsa, Okla., have gone underwater. Governor Kevin Stitt is relying on levees - very old levees - to keep the damage from getting worse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN STITT: We just got to pray for no rain up north. And if we keep getting rain into that watershed, there could be some serious problems. INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Morris is in Tulsa covering this story. Hey there, Frank. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What have you been seeing? MORRIS: Well, the river, of course, is really high. There are a number of homes and businesses flooded, I mean, in the hundreds. And people are just on pins and needles here watching these levees start to deteriorate - these 70-year-old levees that have been under pressure for days and days. INSKEEP: Now, you just said start to deteriorate. We heard yesterday on NPR News from the mayor of Tulsa who said, wow. They've never been tested like this, but they're holding. Are you saying there are now some signs of weakness? MORRIS: I don't think that the signs of weakness have ramped up significantly, but they are leaking. And the water is just seeping through underneath some of these levees and causing all kinds of problems for businesses and homes in the - you know, in the shadow of these things and nearby. The ground is just turning to a kind of slurry in some places because the water is - there's been so much pressure on these levees for days now, and it's just going to stick for days longer. INSKEEP: What are you hearing from some people that you talk with there in Tulsa? MORRIS: Well, again, people are taking this pretty seriously, especially folks who live and work down in what would be the shadow of these levees if the sun was shining. Yesterday, I was down in an industrial part of Sand Springs, Okla. That's sort of a working-class suburb just west of Tulsa, right downstream from this Keystone Dam, where the Corps of Engineers is releasing huge amounts of water - 275,000 cubic feet per second. And I spoke with Val Silcox (ph) - I'm sorry - Val Silcox. She was rushing around to get her stuff out - the implements of this business - out of a warehouse. VAL SILCOX: We're evacuating. The water is rising behind us. It's coming up under the concrete. It's getting wetter and wetter. MORRIS: She's talking about water just bubbling up from the concrete - bubbles coming up through the concrete as the water comes up... INSKEEP: Wow. MORRIS: ...And destroys the business. INSKEEP: Not a thing you really want to see. Frank, I want to ask about something else. I know your hometown is Kansas City. Weren't there tornadoes in Kansas City last night? MORRIS: There were tornadoes in - near Kansas City. Kansas City itself didn't get hit. Lawrence took a pounding - Bonner Springs, Kan. Linwood looks terrible. You had some of the kind of damage just clearing the foundations in Linwood to some extent. Not clear of how strong those buildings were to begin with in the pictures, but the tornado looked to be about a mile wide last night. And so it was very serious. About two dozen tornadoes reported yesterday, mainly in Kansas. INSKEEP: Well, best to your friends and relations there. Frank, thanks so much. MORRIS: Thanks. You bet, Steve. INSKEEP: NPR's Frank Morris. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Standing in line to vote has become much less of an ordeal than it used to be. KING: Yeah, get this. No state in the 2016 election averaged a wait time longer than 20 minutes. That's according to the Elections Performance Index from MIT. One big reason for this is a new technology called electronic poll books. But now there are some questions about how secure that technology really is. INSKEEP: NPR's Miles Parks covers voting and election security. And, goodness, you have a lot to cover, Miles. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: There's a lot to mine here. INSKEEP: OK. So this technology that's supposed to make everything better, how's it work? PARKS: So, basically, you think about the old days. And you walk in your community center, and somebody opens this huge binder of names. They find your name. They check you off. This is basically that process only electronic, either on a laptop or on a tablet, like an iPad. This... INSKEEP: OK. I think I've seen that in a voting station somewhere. PARKS: Exactly. I mean, well, the technology has taken off. Almost - more than 50% of voters who vote in person in 2020 are going to sign in using this technology. The problem is that this technology also raises a lot of tough security questions because, in a lot of cases, it's either directly or indirectly connected to the Internet. INSKEEP: Oh, which means that a particularly clever hacker might find some way in there. PARKS: Right. We know that voting machines themselves are - one of the big selling points is that they are never connected to the Internet. But these machines - these electronic poll books - a lot of their benefits - which there are a myriad of benefits. They're - if a voter is in the wrong location and they go to sign in on one of these, a poll worker can, using this machine, tell them where their right voting location is. If a voter tries to vote twice in a place where you can vote at different jurisdictions, it will be able to catch that by talking to the other electronic poll books in that district. The election supervisors love this technology. They say it cuts down on voting times. And it cuts down on human error and on the amount of paperwork that election supervisors have to do. But that can also be a problem because these election supervisors who love this technology - they're supposed to be the ones who are asking the really tough questions. And a lot of security experts I've talked to are not convinced that those tough questions have been asked as this technology has truly started to take over. INSKEEP: Well, help me out here. Let's look at this from an election supervisor's perspective. You said the actual voting machine is not connected to the Internet. The tablet where people are checking off names is connected to the Internet. But the tablet just has public information - a list of registered voters. PARKS: Right. So what are the stakes here, right? The biggest thing is that, whether it's due to technical information or - excuse me - a technical malfunction, whether it's due to poor poll worker training or whether, in this worst-case scenario, a cyber attacker is able to get in there and make some mischief happen... INSKEEP: Mess with who's registered and who's not. PARKS: Exactly. You could see a situation where this can really screw up day-of-election voting. And we've seen this in real life. You look back at 2018 - I did a story yesterday on All Things Considered about Johnson County, Ind., which, basically, saw the company that was maintaining these poll books not provide enough bandwidth. And it meant that in-person voting on Election Day froze from 8 a.m., when people are trying to go right before work, all the way through lunchtime. That leads to delays. And it leads to people not voting. INSKEEP: Wow. So the technology that's supposed to shorten the line - in that case, anyway - lengthened it. Miles, thanks so much. PARKS: Yeah. Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Miles Parks. (SOUNDBITE OF NICOLA CRUZ'S \"SIKU\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Twenty Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination are addressing a forum on abortion rights in South Carolina.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Twenty Democratic presidential candidates were in Columbia, S.C., yesterday discussing an issue that is likely to be one of the most contentious in the upcoming elections, and that is abortion. While the Trump administration and Republican-run statehouses are trying to restrict abortion rights, advocates for reproductive rights are working to put the issue front and center in the Democratic presidential primary. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more from the Planned Parenthood forum. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: There was little disagreement among the Democratic hopefuls who gathered at the University of South Carolina. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I will repeal the Hyde Amendment to make sure low-income women - to make sure low-income women have access to abortion services. ELIZABETH WARREN: How about we repeal the Hyde Amendment? KAMALA HARRIS: This is why I'm opposed to the Hyde Amendment. MCCAMMON: Those were Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand referring to the long-standing ban on federal funding for abortion in most cases. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took the idea a step further. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL DE BLASIO: Can we just be clear that if you're a Democrat, you're against the Hyde Amendment, period? Period. No choice. You're against the Hyde Amendment, or, if you're not going to provide the economic support for real choice, if you think that choice is a matter of how much money you have in your pocket, then you're not really pro-choice. MCCAMMON: Those remarks follow a recent reversal by former Vice President Joe Biden, who once supported Hyde but now opposes it. Biden suggested he'd initially backed the policy as a compromise in an effort to help push through legislation that would improve access to health care for low-income people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here to make sure women still had access, you can't have access if, in fact, everyone's covered by a federal policy. MCCAMMON: During the daylong forum, Democrats took turns vying for support from abortion rights advocates. Several, including Gillibrand and Biden, called for codifying Roe v. Wade in federal law. Meanwhile, many Republicans are painting Democrats as extreme on the issue. Here's President Trump at a campaign rally in Florida on Tuesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Virtually every top Democrat also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to the moment of birth. MCCAMMON: He's referring there to legislation like a new law in New York which allows abortion later in pregnancy to protect a woman's life or health. However heated the political rhetoric may be, polls suggest a strong majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade but favor some restrictions on abortion. Michael Wear is a former faith adviser to President Obama who opposes public funding for abortion. He says Democrats could alienate moderate voters who have mixed feelings about abortion and are uncomfortable with President Trump. MICHAEL WEAR: The risk here is that instead of taking advantage of the vast center of American politics that has been left open by this president, that instead, we make the American people choose between two options that they view as morally repugnant. MCCAMMON: At the Planned Parenthood forum, Lyric Swinton, a college student, said given Trump's policies on issues such as abortion and immigration, Democrats should not be compromising on anything right now. LYRIC SWINTON: I think that maybe sometime in the past there might've been room for that, but not anymore. I think that because so many of our rights are under attack and so many of the ideals that our party holds near and dear are under attack, there's no room for any gray area. MCCAMMON: Even so, Swinton says her biggest fear is that by shifting to the left on issues like abortion, Democrats might lose in 2020. But she says it's a gamble that's worth taking.

Bevin has been a consistent and vocal opponent of abortion rights in Kentucky.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Gov. Matt Bevin campaigns outside the governor's mansion in Frankfort, Ky., with anti-abortion-rights activists. Bevin has been a consistent and vocal opponent of abortion rights in Kentucky. On a recent, cloudy fall afternoon, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin stood outside the governor's mansion in Frankfort, flanked by a couple dozen activists in blue T-shirts, holding signs that read, \"I Vote Pro-Life.\" \"It took me a while to figure out why I keep seeing these blue T-shirts,\" Bevin joked as he turned to the volunteers. \"I wasn't sure who you were, but I'm just grateful to you.\" These activists have been door-knocking across Kentucky on Bevin's behalf, to reach 200,000 voters before the election on Nov. 5. The Susan B. Anthony List, a national anti-abortion-rights group, is organizing the effort. The organization has worked to elect conservative U.S. senators and helped push through the confirmation of President Trump's Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser was at Bevin's event to endorse the governor and other Republicans running for statewide office. She and anti-abortion-rights activists like her say they are supporting politicians who will lead Kentucky and other states \"into this next chapter of the pro-life movement, which is the most important chapter of the pro-life movement since Roe v. Wade,\" she said. For the first time in decades, the Supreme Court may be on the verge of substantially rolling back the right to an abortion guaranteed in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, and others. A change like that would give governors and state lawmakers the final say for women living in their states. Volunteer Patrick Hall in Lexington, Ky., knocks on a door for Bevin on behalf of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion organization.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteer Patrick Hall in Lexington, Ky., knocks on a door for Bevin on behalf of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion organization. Bevin has been a consistent and vocal opponent of abortion rights in Kentucky. He's accused his Democratic opponent, Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear, of taking \"blood money\" because of his support from abortion-rights groups. Bevin signed a law this year that bans abortion as soon as cardiac activity can be detected. That law is currently tied up in litigation. At his event, Bevin told supporters he'd like to go further. \"It wouldn't bother me one lick if there wasn't an abortion provider in this state. It wouldn't,\" Bevin said. \"Our state wouldn't be less well-served by that.\" Bevin may need support from anti-abortion-rights activists as he runs for reelection. He's one of the least popular governors in the country, known for an abrasive style and for clashing with teachers unions over their pensions. Bevin is facing a formidable challenge from Beshear. Some prominent Republicans are breaking with Bevin to back Beshear. A recent retiree from Lexington, Chuck Eddy, is leading a volunteer group for Republicans who support Beshear. He's going door to door, handing out flyers provided by the Beshear campaign. Eddy says he opposes abortion in most cases but that Kentucky already has multiple abortion restrictions on the books. Eddy believes Bevin is using abortion to try to distract voters from other issues. \"He's pushing that so much because he doesn't have a local story to tell,\" Eddy says. \"People are so unhappy with what he's doing on education, health care and how he talks that they just don't want him.\" Chuck Eddy is leading a volunteer group for Republicans who support the Democratic State Attorney General Andy Beshear, who is running for governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Chuck Eddy is leading a volunteer group for Republicans who support the Democratic State Attorney General Andy Beshear, who is running for governor. Against that backdrop, abortion-rights opponents are trying to help Bevin stay in office. The SBA List is spending $750,000 in Kentucky to back Bevin, including digital ads, mailers and teams of door-to-door canvassers. One door they knocked on recently belonged to Mark Randle, a pastor of a church in Lexington. Randle said he thinks Bevin has made \"a million mistakes\" \u2014 including his fight with teachers, but he still supports him, in part because of his views on abortion. \"If he weren't pro-life, I wouldn't vote for him at all,\" Randle said. \"So that is a game-changer there.\" Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky journalist and political columnist, said the abortion issue could help Bevin in this conservative state. \"Abortion plays a bigger role in the governor's race this year than it ever has,\" Cross said. \"Bevin needs, badly, a base turnout among people who ought to be voting for him \u2014 many of whom are not because of his pugnacious personality.\" Meanwhile, the abortion-rights group NARAL has announced its five-figure digital ad campaign telling Kentucky voters that Bevin supports \"punishing women\" by criminalizing abortion. In Virginia, a similar fight is playing out in another off-year election for control of the state legislature. Republicans narrowly outnumber Democrats in a state that's trending increasingly blue. SBA List has sent out mailers attacking half a dozen Democratic state lawmakers who supported a failed proposal earlier this year to remove some restrictions on third-trimester abortion. Abortion-rights groups are fighting back \u2014 including Planned Parenthood and Emily's List, the latter of which is spending about $2 million on Virginia legislative races this year. In an interview, Dannenfelser of SBA List said the 2019 elections are the beginning of a larger push on the abortion issue in political campaigns to come. \"We are hoping and planning that there's gonna be a shift, where governors have more say \u2014 with their legislatures \u2014 over what abortion law is,\" she said. \"The left knows that; we know that.\" Glen Halva-Neubauer, a politics professor at Furman University, said the Supreme Court is likely to move in a direction that puts state legislatures and governors \"right at the crux\" of setting abortion policy \u2014 and that will be reflected in political campaigns for those offices. \"I think after many years of being relatively dormant as an issue, we are going to see a next big debate over abortion,\" Halva-Neubauer said. \"And it's going to infuse our politics in a way that we haven't seen, probably, for 15 or so years.\"",

Updated at 1:20 p.m. ET On Friday, as they have for decades, anti-abortion rights activists marched through Washington, D.C., to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 a location that symbolizes the long-held goal of reversing the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized the procedure nationwide in 1973. But this year's rally comes at a moment when many anti-abortion activists are feeling more hopeful about that goal, on the heels of the confirmation and swearing-in of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The March, which began in 1974 in response to the Roe decision, draws thousands of abortion opponents from around the country. In her opening address, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini asked supporters to keep pushing forward. \"Will you march until abortion becomes unthinkable?\" Mancini asked. \"Will you march so that one day soon we no longer need to march?\" Vice President Mike Pence phoned into the rally before making a surprise visit with his wife, Karen Pence. He praised President Trump's judicial nominees and told opponents of abortion rights that there is still \"much work to do.\" \"Know that we will stand with you until that great day comes where we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law,\" Pence said. Leanne Jamieson, who runs a crisis pregnancy center in Dallas that counsels women against abortion, says she hopes to see more restrictions on the procedure. \"Without the right to life, we have no other rights,\" she says. \"There's no point debating the right to free speech or the right to bear arms if we don't have the right to life.\" People march through Washington, D.C., to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 a location that symbolizes the long-held goal of reversing the Roe v.

New terrain in the abortion fight Religious and social conservatives have repeatedly pointed to the power to shape the Supreme Court as a reason to support President Trump, despite his history of statements and positions that might seem otherwise at odds with their values. Activists say that has paid off in the form of several Trump policies restricting access to abortion and contraception, and his judicial nominees, most notably Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. \"If you would've asked me during the 2016 campaign, that President Trump would be the one that would help ... in putting in these pro-life policies, I probably would've thought you were crazy,\" said Tom McClusky, vice president of government affairs at March for Life. \"But it's certainly a much different scenario with both Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the bench.\" Anti-abortion rights activists hold a banner with the words Love Gives Life.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anti-abortion rights activists hold a banner with the words Love Gives Life. \u201cThank you for standing for life.

Pence headlined the march in 2017, soon after President Trump's inauguration. Trump himself so far is not scheduled to speak, though he addressed the march via satellite in 2018. Seizing the opportunity to shift the Supreme Court to the right, conservatives have rallied behind Trump's judicial nominees. They continued to back Kavanaugh after sexual assault allegations surfaced during his Senate confirmation hearings. Now, with Kavanaugh on the court, activists are closely watching several pieces of legislation that are winding their way through the legal system as a possible test case that could set up an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reverse or weaken Roe and other cases guaranteeing women the right to an abortion. Abortion rights advocates say they're worried the new court will move to further restrict access to abortion and uphold state laws that would not previously have passed constitutional muster. A sign lies on the ground at the March For Life rally in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A sign lies on the ground at the March For Life rally in Washington, D.C. \"Everything is on the line\" \"This is a time where everything is on the line for me as a doctor,\" Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a physician, said in a recent interview with NPR. \"It's about my patients; it's about their lives ... With Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court we are facing a situation where, within the next year, Roe v. Wade could very well be further eroded or overturned.\" Anti-abortion activists like McClusky hope the new court will affirm state laws that more aggressively restrict abortion. That has both sides gearing up for battles over abortion-related legislation in statehouses across the country. \"A lot of it will be playing a lot of offense and defense, I think, in the states,\" McClusky said. Activists have pointed to legislation like Iowa's \"heartbeat bill\"; if it survives ongoing legal challenges, that law would prohibit abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected \u2013 often before many women know they are pregnant. Other goals of the movement include advancing bans on abortion based on the sex of the fetus or a diagnosis of fetal abnormalities such as Down syndrome.

Debating the science? March for Life organizers say a major focus of this year's rally is to promote the idea that the anti-abortion rights position is bolstered by science. \"Science is on the side of life,\" March for Life President Jeanne Mancini told supporters at a conference on Thursday that was streamed on the group's Facebook page. \"There've been so many advances in science and technology \u2013 especially radiology and sonography \u2013 so that the humanity of the child is evident more and more at earlier stages.\" That view has many critics in the abortion rights and reproductive health communities, including Dr. Sarah Horvath, a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The group supports legal abortion prior to fetal viability and describes the procedure as \"an essential component of women's health care.\" Horvath said abortion is sometimes required to preserve a woman's life or health, and said she's concerned about activists politicizing science. \"Claims of the pro-life movement to being 'pro-science' are actually a misuse and a manipulation of the facts,\" Horvath said. \"There are very real and harmful impacts on access to care ... that occur when facts are obscured or twisted to fit an ideology.\" March for Life organizers say a major focus of this year's rally is to promote the idea that the anti-abortion rights position is bolstered by science.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption March for Life organizers say a major focus of this year's rally is to promote the idea that the anti-abortion rights position is bolstered by science. Mary Ziegler, a legal historian of reproductive rights and law professor at Florida State University, said the emphasis at this year's March for Life reflects a larger, and growing, cultural divide. \"The focus on science in the March reflects what has been a decades-long shift away from arguments about a right to life \u2014 and toward claims about the costs of abortion for women and for society,\" she said in an email. \"That focus has only polarized the debate further \u2014 now those on both sides disagree not only about what the Constitution says but also about the basic facts about abortion. So the debate about truth, 'fake news,' and facts has pushed the two sides even further apart.\" Reproductive rights are also likely to be a focus of the third annual Women's March, planned for Saturday. The march is going forward in a year when the organization has been plagued by internal disputes and allegations of anti-Semitism against one of its leaders, prompting some sponsors including the Democratic National Committee to drop out. Planned Parenthood Action Fund is still listed as a partner for the Women's March.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is taking up an abortion case from Louisiana that could result in a rollback of abortion rights. It's the first major abortion case since Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The Supreme Court announced today that it will consider a Louisiana law that regulates how abortions are performed in the state. This is the first major abortion case the court has agreed to hear since the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year, which moved the court to the right. The law is nearly identical to one that it overturned three years ago. NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon covers abortion rights. She is here with me now. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there. KELLY: What are the stakes in this case? MCCAMMON: So the big picture is we're in the midst of a years-long effort by abortion rights opponents to restrict abortion at the state level in an effort to force the Supreme Court to reconsider this issue. In this case, the court is going to look at how heavily states can regulate abortion providers. So this Louisiana law at the center of the case requires hospital admitting privileges for doctors who perform abortions. Abortion rights opponents say it's about protecting women's health, but abortion rights advocates say the real purpose is to impose so many rules that it becomes very difficult or impossible to provide abortions. And advocates say that if this law stands, this Louisiana law, it would force 2 out of 3 of the state's clinics to close. KELLY: Now, what does it mean that the court is revisiting an issue that it ruled on so recently, just three years ago as we mentioned? MCCAMMON: Right. This case is nearly identical to a Texas law that was struck down in 2016, the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt case, and that had been seen as a real victory by abortion rights supporters. KELLY: I remember, yeah. MCCAMMON: Yeah. So as you said, this is the first major test of abortion precedent since Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the court. He is, of course, a conservative. He replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who'd been the swing vote on the abortion issue. So there is a real possibility here that this court, as it's now assembled, will take a different view of these kinds of regulations. KELLY: What's been the reaction so far? And let me have you start with antiabortion rights groups. MCCAMMON: Right. They're certainly hoping that this is an important step toward overturning Roe v. Wade and other precedent that guarantees the right to an abortion. I talked today to Steve Aden, the general counsel with Americans United for Life. STEVEN ADEN: The best thing for women and the best thing for our political system would be if the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade. This is a difficult, thorny political issue, and it should be decided by the people in the states. MCCAMMON: And Aden says if this Louisiana law is upheld, he believes there will be many more efforts to regulate abortion providers and clinics around the country. KELLY: Sarah, I'm guessing you're hearing a very different reaction today from abortion rights supporters? MCCAMMON: Of course. They have been warning of this for a while now. President Trump has been able to appoint these two justices to the court. That was something he campaigned on. So I'm hearing disappointment and concern but not a lot of surprise from abortion rights advocates. Alexis McGill Johnson is the acting president of Planned Parenthood. ALEXIS MCGILL JOHNSON: This is exactly what Trump and the antiabortion politicians want - a world where abortion is inaccessible. And what we're really concerned about is the impact, the impact not just in Louisiana, which will be left with one provider, one clinic and a million women of reproductive age; we're concerned about the floodgates that will be opened up. MCCAMMON: And Johnson says, whatever happens with this particular case before the Supreme Court, there are more than a dozen other abortion restrictions a step away from the court. And she says abortion rights advocates are really working at the state level. They're very focused on legislatures trying to repeal existing abortion restrictions or fight new ones that might be proposed. KELLY: All right, so a quick look at timing before I let you go. The Supreme Court starts its new term on Monday morning. This is all coming right up. What will you be watching for? MCCAMMON: Well, legal experts I spoke with today say it would be unusual for the court to revisit an issue like this so soon and not rule differently. So that might give us some clue of what to expect. And keep in mind, this is happening in an election year, likely to keep abortion front and center in front of the electorate heading into 2020.

On a recent Saturday morning at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, La., Kathaleen Pittman was preparing for a day of procedures, as a couple dozen patients sat quietly in the waiting area. Her clinic is challenging a law passed by Louisiana's state legislature in 2014, which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital in case of an emergency. The case, June Medical Services, LLC v. Gee, is scheduled to go before the U.S. Supreme Court next year, and the court's decision has the potential to chip away at existing precedent protecting abortion rights. \"The whole process of trying to obtain privileges is crazy,\" Pittman says. \"It's time-consuming. It could be a process of a few months to actually years. There are no guarantees.\" Admitting privileges: unpredictable, sometimes impossible to get Pittman has been working here since the early 1990s, when she started as a part-time counselor. Pittman says if the law stands, it would leave few doctors in Louisiana who perform abortions. The clinic currently has two doctors performing abortions \u2014 one who has admitting privileges, and one who does not. Pittman says the other doctor has been trying for years to get admitting privileges, without success. She believes concerns about the politics and stigma around abortion have made getting privileges difficult. \"We have discovered that not all hospitals will just outright deny privileges,\" Pittman says. \"They just won't take any action, which is the same thing. But it's not in writing. So what do you do?\" Not only are admitting privileges hard to get, but the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that requiring doctors who perform abortions to obtain them doesn't provide any substantial medical benefit to patients, but it does put a major hurdle in the way of patients seeking abortions. In its 2016 opinion, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, the court said a Texas law, which included a hospital admitting privileges requirement, \"poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an 'undue burden' on their constitutional right to do so.\" \"What's on the line is the continued protection by the Supreme Court of access to abortion services,\" says Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the Hope clinic. \"And what's on the line is the Supreme Court's integrity, because nothing has changed since they rendered their decision in 2016.\" A changing court and existing precedent What has changed is the makeup of court since that 5-to-3 decision in 2016. Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the swing vote on abortion, has retired, and President Trump has named two justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 to the bench. Northup warns that the law could force most of the state's few remaining clinics to shut down, and \"open the floodgates\" for similar rules elsewhere. Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill is defending the law. She says the case isn't about the legality of abortion \u2013 that was decided under the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, she notes. Instead, Murrill says it's about letting states set the conditions for the procedure. \"I don't think Roe was correctly decided,\" she says. \"But that's not my decision. That's the law of the land, and this case isn't going to change it.\" Abortion rights opponents who helped push through the law, such as Ben Clapper of Louisiana Right to Life, are hoping the court will allow state regulations like Louisiana's to stand. He argues abortion clinics should be regulated at the same level in Louisiana as a type of outpatient facilities called ambulatory surgical centers. \"There's no constitutional right to an unsafe abortion in America,\" Clapper says. \"And we think if ambulatory surgical centers have this set of rules when it comes to privileges, then abortion facilities should have the same set of rules. And if a physician can't meet those rules, then the same practice should apply that they shouldn't be able to operate in those arenas.\" At a crisis pregnancy center in Slidell, outside New Orleans, Cindy Collins counsels women against abortion and offers free baby clothes, diapers, and other assistance to new and expectant mothers. Collins says she had several abortions as a young woman in the 1970s, experiences that inspired her to become an opponent of abortion rights. Collins testified in favor of the hospital admitting privileges bill when it was working its way through Louisiana's state legislature in 2014. \"Women deserve [for their doctors to have] emergency admitting privileges, even if it's just one woman,\" Collins says. \"...I believe it's very important. [It] would bring up a level of accountability. The medical consensus But several major medical groups say hospital admitting privileges are not necessary for abortion providers and provide virtually no medical benefit to patients. In a friend-of-the-court brief earlier this month, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and others, say abortion is a safe procedure, and that there's no medical reason to require doctors who perform abortions to have privileges. \"It is a very rare instance where a patient would have a complication \u2014 and even more rare in a case where they would need to be hospitalized,\" says Dr. Maureen Phipps, ACOG's CEO. In such cases, Phipps, says, a woman should go to the nearest hospital for treatment. \"Serving God before man\" But in this conservative, Bible-belt state, those arguments don't always carry the day \u2013 even with Democrats, such as State Sen.-elect Katrina Jackson. She sponsored the bill as a state representative in 2014. Jackson says her views on abortion are deeply tied to her Christian beliefs, and acknowledges they're at odds with those of most members of her party. \"But it didn't matter...because what I had told my district when I ran, I told them I was against abortion,\" Jackson says. \"I told them that I wasn't perfect, but I was going to do everything I could to serve God before I serve man in the legislature.\" Jackson describes herself as a \"whole-life Democrat,\" which, she says, means supporting affordable housing, public funding for healthcare, and criminal justice reform. She insists that while she opposes abortion, the goal of the law she sponsored has always been to protect women, not ban the procedure. \"This wasn't about whether or not abortion was legal,\" Jackson says. \"It was just common sense.\" A \"taboo, overwhelming process\" At the clinic in Shreveport, none of the women in the waiting room want to talk to a reporter. \"It's already a taboo, overwhelming process for young women here in Louisiana,\" says Lillian Newton, 30, who started working here more than a year ago, after having two abortions at the clinic herself. She worries about what will happen if the law is upheld. In a region with many restrictive abortion laws and a declining number of clinics, Newton says the women she counsels often travel a long way to get here. \"We've had patients who drive from Mississippi, from Arkansas, from Oklahoma,\" Newton said.  \"We've seen patients from make four- or five-, six-hour trips.\" Newton says if Louisiana's admitting privileges law is allowed to stand, even if abortion remains legal, it will be harder for women here \u2013 and beyond \u2013 to get one. The case is set to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 4, with a decision expected just months before the 2020 election.",

Joe Biden, D-Del., center, was running for president and also chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, responsible for leading the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Robert Bork. In late 1987, Joe Biden was in the midst of two high-stakes battles: one for the Democratic presidential nomination, and another, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to try to stop President Reagan's nominee to the Supreme Court, Robert Bork. His fight for the presidential nomination would end abruptly, dealing Biden his biggest political setback up until that point. But Biden was successful in the other battle, as he thwarted Bork's nomination to the high court. Plagiarism charges against Biden It was Sept. 23, during a break in the Bork confirmation hearings, that Biden held a press conference announcing his presidential campaign was over. \"It seems to me I have a choice,\" Biden said. \"I have to choose between running for president and doing my job to keep the Supreme Court from moving in a direction that I believe to be truly harmful.\" There's a question of how much of a choice it really was. Had he stayed in, it's not clear Biden's campaign would have been able to recover from the scandal that had enveloped it since just before the hearings began. The month before, the Democratic presidential candidates debated at the Iowa State Fair. In his closing statement, Biden made a biographical turn, talking about why his family had remained working class for generations. Biden gestures during a Sept. 23, 1987, news conference to announce his decision to withdraw as a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. With him is his wife Jill.\n                \n                    \n                    Ron Edmonds/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Biden gestures during a Sept. 23, 1987, news conference to announce his decision to withdraw as a candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. With him is his wife Jill. \"Is it because they didn't work hard?\" Biden asked. \"My ancestors who worked in the coal mines of Northeast Pennsylvania and then would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours.\" It turns out he was paraphrasing a rousing speech-turned-campaign ad from a British Labour Party politician named Neil Kinnock. \"Was it because they were weak?\" Kinnock asked. \"Those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football.\" Biden had referenced it in speeches before, with proper attribution. But this time, he made it his own. Line after line, the similarities were unmistakable. It took a couple of weeks for the story to break, seeded by a rival campaign. But Biden had very little time to tamp down the controversy. The Bork hearings began three days later. Dropping out of the presidential race As a law professor, Bork had criticized the legal reasoning behind Supreme Court decisions on civil rights and abortion. Republicans saw his nomination as a chance to reshape the court and public policy. Democrats were determined to stop him. \"This nomination is more \u2014 with all due respect, judge, and I'm sure you agree \u2014 than about you,\" Biden said in his opening statement of the hearings. Now, hearings for Supreme Court picks last a couple of days and very little is revealed about the nominee's views. But with Bork, with Biden holding the gavel, the Judiciary Committee hearings went on for 12 long days. Bork went on at length about his judicial philosophy and his writings about the law when he was a professor at Yale University. He didn't do himself any favors. Meanwhile, Biden's campaign was in trouble. There were questions being asked about whether his slip-up with the Kinnock speech was part of a pattern, whether it said something about Biden's character. Biden went out and defended himself. \"You'll all be the judge and the people will be the judge,\" Biden said in a press conference that was at turns combative and sarcastic. \"I think this is much ado about nothing.\" There will be other opportunities for me to campaign for president. But there will not be many other opportunities for me to influence President Reagan's choice for the Supreme Court. Joe Biden He insisted he had done nothing wrong, but also said he would certainly remember to attribute the quotes to Kinnock in the future.  \"Shouldn't have made much difference anyway,\" Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader, said in an interview with NPR. \"But you guys, the press, jumped on him.\" Reid was a relatively junior Democratic senator at the time. But looking back, he said Biden did what he had to do. \"You could not be running for president and trying to overcome some of the things that had gone wrong and still chair that committee,\" Reid said. \"He had to get rid of the running for president or his running that committee would not have worked.\" And that's exactly what Biden did. On Day 8 of the Bork hearings, he announced his campaign was over. \"There will be other opportunities for me to campaign for president,\" Biden said, foreshadowing his runs in 2008 and now. \"But there will not be many other opportunities for me to influence President Reagan's choice on the Supreme Court.\" In a way, the Bork hearings allowed Biden to save face while quitting the race. He didn't have to stand there and say he was dropping out because of the plagiarism charges. No, he had something important to do.  \"This country's going to be lifted up and I'm going to play a big part in doing it,\" Biden said, referencing a refrain from his stump speech. \"But for now folks, gotta go handle the Bork hearings.\" \"Oh, Joe, you just forget that stuff\" At some point during that difficult day, Biden called the Judiciary Committee members together behind closed doors. It was a gut check.  \"It was devastating,\" said Alan Simpson, then a Republican senator from Wyoming. \"He was ambitious, as he is now, and he was running for president of the United States. And he was quite filled with angst.\" Simpson says Biden told them he was embarrassed and hurt, but took responsibility, that the \"buck stops\" with him. Biden offered to resign his chairmanship, Simpson said, if he had embarrassed the committee in any way. There was silence in the room.  \"And then old Strom Thurmond, who was ranking member, leaned over and slapped his knee and said, 'Oh, Joe, now let me tell you, just forget that stuff,' \" Simpson said, adopting a Southern accent in an impression of the late South Carolina senator.  By Simpson's telling, the senators went around the room talking about all the mistakes they had made over the years and had a good laugh.  Biden had long known that trying to run the Bork hearings while running for president might end badly, said Mark Gitenstein, a longtime Biden friend and adviser who was then chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee. He remembers a contentious meeting Biden attended with civil rights leaders about the Bork nomination where they asked him: \"Which is more important, your presidential race or the Supreme Court fight?\" In Gitenstein's retelling, Biden said, \"Without a doubt, Supreme Court fight. I'll give up my presidential race if necessary to win this fight.\" The meeting happened months before the Kinnock controversy broke, said Gittenstein. \"And of course ultimately that's what happened.\" Bork defeated Supreme Court nominee Anthony Kennedy, right, shakes hands with Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Biden before the start of his confirmation hearing on Dec. 15, 1987.

Let's move on,\" Biden said after a couple of Senate colleagues piped up to offer him support. Ultimately Bork's nomination failed in the Senate. It was bipartisan. Biden was able to sway a handful of moderate Republicans to vote with Democrats against Bork.  Reagan went on to nominate Anthony Kennedy for that Supreme Court slot. Over his generation on the court, Kennedy became a swing justice. And when it came time for the next president, George H.W. Bush, to nominate a justice, he picked David Souter because he was less ideological, with less of a paper trail than Bork, in hopes that he would be able to get get bipartisan support. Gitenstein argues Biden was able to do more for progressive causes by sinking Bork than he would have been able to do as president.  \"It shaped the court for 30 years on everything from saving Roe vs. Wade to, you know, the gay marriage issue,\" Gitenstein said. And, as Biden said the day he quit the race, there would be other presidential campaigns, and he would be there.",

Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced on Wednesday that she will seek reelection, hoping to win a fifth term as New England's only GOP member in the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced on Wednesday that she will seek reelection, hoping to win a fifth term as New England's only GOP member in the Senate. Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is one of the few members of her party willing to buck President Trump, announced Wednesday she would seek reelection. Her announcement comes the same day the U.S. House of Representatives began debate on impeaching the president. \"The fundamental question I had to ask myself in making my decision was this: In today's polarized political environment, is there still a role for a centrist who believes in getting things done through compromise, collegiality, and bipartisanship?\" Collins said in an email to reporters. \"I have concluded that the answer to this question is 'yes' and I will, therefore, seek the honor of continuing to serve as Maine's United States senator.\" The news that Collins, 67, will launch a bid for a fifth term came a day after she told NPR that she was undecided on whether to convict Trump in a potential Senate trial, which could start as soon as next month, over his conduct with Ukraine. \"I have not made up my mind,\" Collins, one of 100 U.S. senators who would serve as jurors in the president's Senate trial, told NPR. \"And I think it would be inappropriate for me to have made up my mind before I hear the presentations from both sides.\" Collins could face a tough reelection. Americans remain deeply divided over impeachment and a host of other hot-button political issues. Although Collins has carried her state's tradition of political independence in the Senate, she has been assailed by her constituents in Maine for her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite her self-identification as an abortion-rights supporter. Critics to her left have also attacked Collins for her opposition to the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and for backing the Republican-sponsored tax cut, a measure that liberals criticize as a giveaway to the rich. Collins' role as a juror in Trump's impeachment trial will be closely watched. Unlike some of her Republican colleagues, who have said they will not be impartial in the process, Collins has repeatedly said she has an open mind. \"I think it's important not to prejudge the facts of the case or the evidence that is presented,\" Collins told NPR. Her announcement Wednesday that she will try to stay New England's only Republican U.S. senator comes hours before the House is poised to impeach the president on charges that he obstructed Congress and abused power. That move would set up a January trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, a process that is expected to acquit Trump. In her remarks to supporters, Collins acknowledged the political polarization of the moment, presenting herself as a someone who can work to build consensus. \"To say that these are difficult and contentious times is most certainly an understatement,\" she said. \"But our country has confronted much more challenging times in our history.\" At least four Democrats are expected to face off to win their party's nomination in order to face Collins in November 2020. Collins will enter the race with an $8.6 million reelection war chest, and she is running television ads statewide portraying herself as an independent, bipartisan senator. Collins, who says she did not vote for Trump in 2016, has yet to say whether she will support him in 2020.",

Brian Kemp plans to announce that he is naming Kelly Loeffler (right) as the state's next U.S. senator, replacing Johnny Isakson, who is stepping down for health reasons. Loeffler is an owner of the Atlanta Dream WNBA team and is shown here during a September game. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp plans to appoint Kelly Loeffler on Wednesday as the state's next U.S. senator, effective Jan. 1, according to two sources with knowledge of Kemp's decision. The businesswoman and Republican donor will fill the seat held by Sen. Johnny Isakson, who plans to retire Dec. 31 for health reasons. The pick comes despite strong opposition from prominent allies of President Trump, who is reported to have favored Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., for the seat. Loeffler's conservative bona fides have been questioned, with conservative talk show host Mark Levin referring to her as a \"RINO\" (Republican in name only) on Sunday. Loeffler is a wealthy businesswoman without political experience. The CEO of Bakkt, a Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., casts herself as a \"lifelong Republican\" and tells a personal narrative of working her way up the corporate ladder from her family's farm in rural Illinois. One of Kemp's most vocal critics over the weekend was Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a close Trump ally, who said Kemp was \"ignoring\" Trump because \"you THINK you know better than @POTUS.\" Another Trump confidant, Fox News personality Sean Hannity, also endorsed Collins last week. .@realDonaldTrump told you how to be supportive: Appoint @RepDougCollins. You are ignoring his request because you THINK you know better than @POTUS.If you substitute your judgement for the President\u2019s, maybe you need a primary in 2022.  Let\u2019s see if you can win one w/o Trump https://t.co/vtjT4CyLMI Kemp's director of communications, Candice Broce, fired back at Gaetz directly, calling him \"oddly submissive to #TheSwamp,\" and said the appointment was Kemp's to make independently. Kemp's adviser and former campaign communications director, Ryan Mahoney, wrote: \"mind your own business. We don't know you and we don't care what you think.\" Loeffler herself has faced backlash in the past week from some members of Georgia's conservative political community for past donations to Mitt Romney and ties to former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who did legal work for the WNBA team that Loeffler co-owns, the Atlanta Dream. Phil Kent, a conservative pundit and communications consultant who has worked with Loeffler, vouched for Loeffler's conservative politics, describing her as \"a big opponent of Obamacare,\" a supporter of gun rights and someone who's \"very tough\" on illegal immigration. \"So she would check some of those boxes with the president,\" said Kent. Kemp has generally been seen as a close ally of the president. First elected governor in 2018, Kemp helped secure the Republican nomination with Trump's backing. Amid the criticism, Kemp offered his own preemptive defense, writing on Twitter, \"The idea that I would appoint someone to the U.S. Senate that is NOT pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, pro-freedom, and 100% supportive of our President (and his plan to Keep America Great) is ridiculous.\" He added, \"Frankly, I could care less what the political establishment thinks.\" Loeffler takes the job following an online application process that Kemp opened in September. She submitted her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on the day of the deadline. Loeffler's company, Bakkt, offers a regulated market for bitcoin trading, and its parent company, ICE, owns and operates commodity and financial market exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. Loeffler previously worked as ICE's chief communications and marketing officer and is married to its founder and CEO, Jeff Sprecher. She grew up on her family's corn and soybean farm in Illinois and wrote in her cover letter to Kemp that \"From working on the family farm to creating jobs and opportunity in the business world, I have been blessed to live the American Dream. I am offering myself to serve hardworking Georgians as a political outsider in the United States Senate to protect that dream for everyone.\" \"If our country is to embrace the conservative values that made America great, women must play a key role in that dialogue,\" she said in 2013 to the Georgia Federation of Republican Women. \"This is where our voices are needed.\" Her name was floated as a possible Senate candidate at that time, an option she ultimately rejected to remain with ICE amid its acquisition of the New York Stock Exchange. In 2013, she told Atlanta magazine about her political experience, explaining that it amounted to \"running against my best friend for student council president in eighth grade. It was all about the campaign posters and how many of the kids you could talk to at lunch break.\" In her cover letter, she cast that as an advantage, writing about the importance, \"now more than ever before \u2014 to have leaders with significant life and business experience outside of politics representing Georgia families in Washington, D.C.\" If appointed, Loeffler will face reelection in November in an open race, without party primaries. Collins was noncommittal when asked Sunday on Fox News if he would run against Loeffler in the November election, saying, \"That'll be a decision that we'll have to make at that point.\" Collins is the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and is also playing a prominent role as one of Trump's defenders in Congress. 2020 is set to be a big political year for Georgia. Buoyed by rapidly changing demographics, Democrats believe they have a chance to win the state for the first time since 1992. In addition, both of Georgia's Senate seats are on the ballot in November. Sen. David Perdue, also a Republican, is defending his seat. At least four major Democratic candidates are vying in the primary to challenge him.",

Atlanta's Tyler Perry Studios has been home to Wakanda, the White House and The Walking Dead, but on Wednesday night it will host its most topical production yet: the next Democratic presidential primary debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. With less than three months before voters begin casting ballots, 10 candidates will walk out onto a sound stage named for Oprah Winfrey. The decision to stage the debate at Tyler Perry Studios is a sign of the political and economic power of Georgia's growing film industry, an implicit acknowledgment of the space that black voters occupy in the primary electorate and a nod to the state's potential battleground status in 2020. \"It shows how Georgia is ready to present on a national stage,\" said Kalena Boller, a retired location manager who spent 15 years scouting out locations around Atlanta to film movies, music videos and television shows. \"What's more Southern than that?\" The big, thick gates and tall fences outside the studios in southwest Atlanta resemble a fortress, which the facility once was in its past incarnation as a U.S. Army base, Fort McPherson, which operated from 1885 to 2011.

Filmmaker and producer Tyler Perry purchased part of the property in 2015 from the city of Atlanta to build his eponymous production facilities, larger than any studio in Los Angeles. He's the only African American to own a major film studio. \"It's 330 acres and 12 sound stages,\" Tyler Perry told late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after the studio's grand opening last month. \"And I dedicated them all this weekend to people who paved the way and motivated and inspired me, like Oprah, Whoopi Goldberg, Cicely Tyson, Will Smith, Halle Berry ... .\" Standing in the parking lot of a recent development up the street from Tyler Perry Studios, Boller, the former location scout, said Georgia's booming film economy is increasingly part of the political conversation too. This year, several Hollywood actors and production companies called for a boycott of the state after Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill tightening restrictions on abortion. Shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked the law from taking effect, Perry voiced his support for film industry workers in the state and said he couldn't just \"up and leave\" the place he called home. \"I mean, what's more Southern than that?\" asked Boller of Perry's decision to stay. Boller said the choice to locate this debate at Tyler Perry Studios shows where the Democratic Party is headed. \"What it's specifically showing is that you cannot look away from the black Democratic vote,\" she said. \"You cannot discredit and you cannot ignore how much of a contribution we're making to the country as a whole.\" Battleground Georgia Donald Trump won Georgia in 2016 by only a 5-point margin, far tighter than past Republican candidates. In 2018, Kemp squeaked out an even narrower victory over Democrat Stacey Abrams in the gubernatorial race. In a sign that both parties are preparing to fight for Georgia's 16 electoral votes in 2020, President Trump held a Black Voices for Trump coalition launch in Atlanta this month, while Democratic candidates have made regular stops at historically black colleges in the state, especially this week ahead of the debate. Georgia will also be a major Senate battleground in 2020, with first-term Republican Sen. David Perdue up for reelection and a special election to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican who's resigning at the end of 2019 for health reasons. \"There is this opportunity before Democrats in Georgia that we've not seen and likely won't see again for many years,\" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who lobbied the Democratic National Committee to bring the debate to the city. \"Atlanta is really this crown jewel of the South in so many ways \u2014 the diversity that it reflects, our economy and the metro area and just really the prominence of so many African American leaders and African American women who are leading cities throughout the South,\" said Bottoms. The debates aren't the only big-ticket item coming to the studios in this corner of southwest Atlanta. Several movies are actively filming there, and the Miss Universe pageant, once owned by Trump, is coming in December.",

Edwards defeated Republican challenger Eddie Rispone. Updated at 3:39 a.m. ET Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, held onto his seat Saturday after a tough challenge from his Republican opponent, Eddie Rispone, a wealthy businessman and political newcomer who was supported by President Trump. Edwards defeated Rispone by about 40,000 votes. Edwards benefited from strong support and high voter turnout in the state's more populated urban areas while Rispone carried most of Louisiana's rural parishes. Polls showed a close race in the final week. \"If this campaign has taught us anything, it's that the partisan forces in Washington, D.C. are not strong enough to break through the bonds that we share as Louisianans,\" Edwards said in his victory speech. Edwards is the only Democratic governor in the Deep South and is not a typical Democrat. He's a pro-Second Amendment gun owner who signed one of the country's strictest anti-abortion bills this year. This is the third and final gubernatorial election of 2019 and the second loss for President Trump, who campaigned for all three candidates. The president was in Louisiana this past week and framed the race as a personal referendum, urging voters to unseat Edwards. Trump traveled to Louisiana three times to support Rispone. About two weeks ago, Republican Tate Reeves won the open seat in Mississippi, but in Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear ousted Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin. Edwards' second term may be a bitter pill for Trump, who had much invested in this year's elections ahead of his own election in 2020. WWNO's Jessica Rosgaard contributed reporting.",

Matt Bevin speaks during a campaign rally in Lexington, Ky., on Monday. Bevin is in a tight race for reelection. Voters in four states head to the polls on Tuesday for general statewide elections of note. These off-year contests may not be as high profile as the 2020 presidential and congressional elections will be a year from now, but they could offer some important hints on how voters are feeling about President Trump, impeachment, guns and more. The main action is happening in three states: Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia. The first two have gubernatorial races in which Democrats have a chance to pull off upsets in states that went heavily for Trump. State-level contests have been the one place where voters have been willing to split with their party \u2014 choosing someone to manage state affairs may feel different to voters than choosing a representative to send to Washington, D.C., or picking a president. But in the hyperpartisan era of Trump, that may no longer be possible. Republicans are feeling better about both contests for governor given the congressional impeachment inquiry, which some believe may bring wayward GOP voters back into the fold \u2014 much like the Kavanaugh hearings did for Republican Senate candidates in 2018. A third governor's race in Louisiana will go to runoffs on Nov. 16, where moderate Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is trying to hold on. In Virginia \u2014 a onetime swing state that is becoming more blue with every election \u2014 Democrats have a chance to flip both the House of Delegates and the state Senate. Here's what to watch in the key races on Tuesday night: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has the ignominious distinction of being named one of the most unpopular governors in America. His low approval ratings \u2014 stemming from feuds he's picked with public school teachers, state lawmakers and others \u2014 are the biggest reasons Bevin is in danger in a state that Trump carried by 30 points. He's a brash, combative politician \u2014 Trumplike before Trump was even president \u2014 and that has alienated even many Republican voters in the red state. Some GOP strategists complain that Bevin has no one to blame but himself for his political peril. Attorney General Andy Beshear is his Democratic challenger who's running on returning \"Kentucky values\" to the commonwealth, as he says in his closing ad: \"We treat everyone with respect and we look out for our neighbors. Matt Bevin doesn't share our values.\" Beshear has his own political pedigree that could help him \u2014 his father, Steve Beshear, was a popular governor who preceded Bevin. But while his dad was seen as a folksy, moderate politician, the younger Beshear has had more trouble connecting with voters and isn't as centrist on as many issues, particularly abortion. In order to win, Bevin has nationalized his race maybe more than any other GOP candidate on the ballot Tuesday. His ads play up his anti-abortion, anti-illegal immigration stances, his allegiance to Trump and his opposition to impeachment. A recent Mason-Dixon poll in the state, which found the two candidates tied, also showed that 65% of likely voters also oppose impeachment. That, coupled with a Trump election-eve rally, may be enough to carry Bevin over the finish line, no matter how much some voters may personally dislike him. Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves is narrowly favored over state Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood in this open seat race where a swell against impeachment and a rally Trump held last Friday could help the GOP nominee secure victory. This is a Republican state at its core. Trump carried it by 18 points, and in a Mason-Dixon poll here the president had a 54% approval rating, along with 56% of voters opposing impeachment. But if one Democrat could pull off an upset, it's Hood. He's a pro-gun, anti-abortion centrist Democrat whose ads feature his pickup truck and talk about hunting, fishing and going to church. He supports Medicaid expansion in the state, though, while Reeves opposes that plan. Reeves is more of a policy wonk who had to overcome his own divisive primary and has worked to tie Hood to the national Democratic Party. All those factors could be enough to help Reeves win \u2014 along with a Jim Crow-era law that requires a candidate to win a majority of votes and a majority of state legislative districts. If a candidate doesn't meet both those benchmarks, the race is decided by the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority. There is real doubt that Hood could win a majority of the legislative districts, a mini-electoral college of sorts. But Democrats did get some good news last week as a federal judge wrote he has a \"grave concern\" that the antiquated law is unconstitutional and could cause \"irreparable harm if eventually applied\" \u2014 a signal perhaps they could intervene if Hood does finish first but falls short of the legislative threshold. This is likely to be Democrats' best state of the night, but the question remains whether it will be enough to carry them to a majority in the statehouse for the first time in nearly 25 years. In the House of Delegates, Republicans have a slim 51-48 majority, and in the state Senate it's only a 20-19 advantage. (Each chamber has a vacant seat.) New court-ordered lines redrawn earlier this year in the House also helped Democrats. And the possibility of flipping control has drawn celebrities out to campaign, including Alec Baldwin, Kerry Washington and Jason Mraz, who has written jingles to encourage getting out the vote. 2020 hopefuls have also stumped in the state, with former Vice President Joe Biden holding a rally to help Virginia Democrats this weekend. To underscore just how close the margins are, last time control of the House literally came down to drawing a name out of a bowl after the election was deadlocked; those two candidates are in a rematch tonight. The shifting suburbs are again the story in the commonwealth, where Democrats flipped three congressional seats one year ago. Now, they could do the same thing in the Northern Virginia, Richmond and Virginia Beach suburbs. In one race, gun control has become a major issue, as NPR's Melissa Block profiled, following a mass shooting there in May. A special session to try to address gun control in June was abruptly shut down by GOP legislators, and Democrats think Republicans could now feel the backlash in a state that has had several recent mass shootings. If Democrats win control, they have the chance to make those gun reforms happen and further expand Medicaid. They could also raise the state's minimum wage and pass the ERA \u2014 a U.S. constitutional amendment stating that \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\" The ERA was first proposed in 1923 and later gained steam during the 1970s but then stalled. Illinois was the 37th state to ratify it last year, and, after failing by one vote earlier this year, a Democrat-controlled Virginia legislature would likely give it the final vote needed. Republicans, however, hope that scandals among the three top statewide Democratic officials could give voters pause. Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring both admitted earlier this year to wearing blackface when they were younger, and two women have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, which he denies.",

            "article_content": "Voters in a handful of states go to the polls on November 5. The results could offer a preview of what to expect in 2020.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Tomorrow is Election Day. It is an off-year election but will be closely watched to see what it may signal for the 2020 elections. NPR national correspondent Sarah McCammon joins me from Virginia Beach, Va. That is one of the key states where voters will be casting ballots. Hi, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: All right, so you're in Virginia. You live in Virginia. Why don't we start there? What's at stake? MCCAMMON: Yeah. So Democrats made huge gains here in 2017, fresh off the Trump election, of course, in 2016. Republicans are still narrowly in control of both chambers of the statehouse, and they're trying to hold on to that, but Democrats are very hopeful that they can take over. They point to 2017 and also to gains in 2018 nationally as signs that they have the momentum. And there's been a lot of spending in these races, and a lot of it from national groups on behalf of both sides on issues like gun control and abortion, among others. KELLY: And as a reminder of the stakes, you've had some big names dropping by, campaigning as Election Day approaches. Who's been showing up? MCCAMMON: Right. Several Democratic presidential candidates have been to Virginia, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders today and former Vice President Joe Biden yesterday. And this election is being framed, really, by both sides as something bigger than just Virginia. You know, Virginia used to be more of a swing state. It's still kind of seen as a bellwether in these off-year elections, although it's been trending blue recently. But yesterday in Northern Virginia, former Vice President Biden said this election is about much more than just the Virginia General Assembly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: But this, in a sense, is all about Trump, folks. Look; the fact is that now we have to win again. We have to win again in '20. You have to win again in 2019, the off year. You really have to do it. But you'll determine what's going to happen in 2020. KELLY: All right. So that's what the Democrats have been up to. What about on the Republican side? MCCAMMON: Right. So Vice President Mike Pence was here in Virginia Beach over the weekend, and he, too, had a similar message for Republicans that this is about something more. This is about looking ahead. Pence told the crowd that Virginia should, quote, \"send a message to Washington, D.C., that enough is enough.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: And that Virginia is tired of their analysts, investigations and partisan impeachment. If you want to send a message to the do-nothing Democrats that the people of Virginia and America support President Donald Trump, then vote Republican. MCCAMMON: Mary Louise, I should mention President Trump has also been visiting a couple of the other states that are holding elections this week. He went to Mississippi last week. He campaigns in Kentucky tonight. Those, of course, are red states, where he's pretty popular. And he has not campaigned here in Virginia ahead of this election, which, again, is a purple state that's been trending blue. KELLY: Sarah, let me flip you back to Mississippi, Kentucky - some of those other states. MCCAMMON: Yeah. KELLY: There are a handful that are electing governors and other statewide officials. Which races are you keeping an eye on? MCCAMMON: So quickly, New Jersey is also holding some legislative elections this year. Democrats are expected to hang on to control there. The question is just by how much. And there are a few governors' races. In Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin is among the least popular governors in the nation. He's known for clashing with teachers unions, among other things. He's running against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. That race looks close. Mississippi - there's no incumbent in the Republican - in the governor's race. The incumbent Republican is term-limited out. That race looks close, too, between the Republican lieutenant governor and the Democratic attorney general. President Trump, of course, was in both of those states. And one more thing I should mention - Louisiana is also holding a gubernatorial election this year, but not until November 16. KELLY: OK. So a little bit of time to wait for Louisiana. And back to this question, the central question of how much we can read into what's going to happen this month that may tell us about 2020, how much can we glean from tomorrow's votes? MCCAMMON: Yeah. So prognosticators will, of course, pay attention. And you can certainly expect both parties will tout their successes as a sign that the tide is turning their way, whatever those successes are. Democrats tell me they're feeling really confident again because of the last couple of years that they've seen. Republicans seem a bit more reserved, especially here in Virginia. Some party leaders have been reticent to talk to me when I've asked for interviews about what they're expecting. But at the rally this weekend, Vice President Pence and other Republican leaders talked up the strong economic numbers we've been seeing, told voters to be sure to show up both tomorrow and in 2020. But it's important to remember that these are just a handful of elections in a handful of states. It'll give us a snapshot of what's happening in a year when there's really low turnout in off-year elections. But we are still a year away from 2020, and a lot could still change between now and then. KELLY: That is NPR's Sarah McCammon taking the snapshot there from Virginia Beach. Thank you, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Yeah. Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, and Democrat Attorney General Jim Hood are vying to be the state's next governor in Tuesday's election. Some say the race is surprisingly competitive.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Why do Republicans need to try so hard to hold a governor's seat in Mississippi? President Trump visits the state tonight before next Tuesday's election. He is supporting Tate Reeves, who is running for governor. Reeves faces Attorney General Jim Hood, who is the only Democrat holding statewide office in a very red state. NPR's Debbie Elliott is in Jackson, Miss. Debbie, good morning. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Is this state race for a state office being fought over national issues? ELLIOTT: Well, that's exactly what the Republican, Tate Reeves, is trying to do. If you listen to him, he talks a lot about this race being about Donald Trump, who's coming tonight to help him. Just listen to his campaign ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Do you stand with our president and Tate Reeves or with the liberals and Jim Hood? Mississippi, it's time to choose. ELLIOTT: And you see this screenshot saying reject the radical liberals. And it has these unflattering pictures of Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and others around Jim Hood. In a speech to business leaders yesterday, Reeves sort of stuck with that message, saying, you know, a vote for me is like a vote for Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TATE REEVES: If you believe that our country is headed in the right direction and you support President Trump, next Tuesday is critically important. ELLIOTT: You know, Reeves' overall theme has been, you know, small government, conservative policies that work for the nation and for Mississippi. INSKEEP: Is there a reason that Republicans would effectively nationalize this election? I'm just thinking a lot of voters in Mississippi are not going to favor a national Democrat. This is a state that President Trump won with 58% of the vote in 2016. ELLIOTT: Right. But Jim Hood, you have to remember, has been elected to statewide office four times now, a Democrat in reliably-red Mississippi. And... INSKEEP: Oh, so a state Democrat running on state issues can win in Mississippi? ELLIOTT: He has. We'll see if he can go to a higher office. And, you know, he's been sort of rejecting this idea that liberal labels, you know, define him. He's stressing his down-home roots in north Mississippi, the territory where Trump is headed tonight. His campaign ads show him, you know, with his pickup truck, his hunting dog, Buck, and his rifle. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) JIM HOOD: You all know me. I've worked for you for years. I do my job. And I'm a straight shooter. (GLASS SHATTERING) ELLIOTT: You know, that sound you hear is him shooting a target - a bottle - and it shattering. INSKEEP: OK. ELLIOTT: So, you know, he talks a lot about he has a moderate record. He's defended restrictive anti-abortion laws that have been passed by the conservative Mississippi legislature. And he is, you know, directly courting Republicans, asking them to step out of their comfort zone. Here's what he said yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HOOD: People in Mississippi have voted for me, and they've seen my record. And I think people will make a decision based upon my past. ELLIOTT: So we'll find out. INSKEEP: What makes this race so tight even with that particular guy's candidate? ELLIOTT: You know, Republican Tate Reeves had a really bruising primary and now does not appear to be generating deep enthusiasm. I talked with Elva Eubanks from Star, Miss., who's active in conservative politics here. And this is her assessment of the governor's race. ELVA EUBANKS: To say that we really don't have a good choice would put a bad reflection on one of them, and I don't really intend to do that. My only choice is to get Tate elected. ELLIOTT: Now, the president's rally tonight should help get people a little bit more fired up than that. We'll see. INSKEEP: Debbie, thanks. ELLIOTT: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Prime Minister Trudeau won a second term in Canada's national elections Monday, losing the majority but still delivering strong results despite having been weakened by a series of scandals.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: He apologized for a blackface scandal. He roiled his base by saving a controversial oil pipeline. And he was accused of bullying his attorney general. Despite all that, Justin Trudeau has won another term as Canada's prime minister. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: We will make life more affordable. We will continue to fight climate change. We will get guns off our streets, and we will keep investing in Canadians. MARTIN: Canadian voters yesterday delivered another victory to Trudeau's Liberal Party, but it did not come easily. It was a tight race against the opposition Conservatives. So tight, in fact, that Trudeau's Liberals lost their majority in the legislature. Journalist David McGuffin is covering all this from Ottawa and joins us now. Good morning, David. DAVID MCGUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So what does this mean, practically speaking? Trudeau wins, but he's not going to have a mandate like he did before, right? MCGUFFIN: No. It seems, basically, what voters did here was gave Trudeau a warning but not an outright rejection. I think there's a lot of concern about the scandals that he was embroiled in. His Liberals lost 21 seats and actually lost the popular vote to the Conservative Party. So he's had his majority in Parliament removed from him. And while he still will govern, he's effectively been put in check by the opposition parties. So that was certainly the message in the concession speech from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer that - which he gave last night in the early hours, very early hours of the morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW SCHEER: Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice. And Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win. (APPLAUSE) MARTIN: I guess from another perspective, you can say that Justin Trudeau does have incredible political staying power because he was able to win, despite all these controversies, right? MCGUFFIN: No. Absolutely. And there was an assumption right up until voting day, really, that the Conservatives would likely at least form a minority government. But voters didn't really seem to warm to Andrew Scheer, their leader. There was concerns about his social conservatism. He's against abortion rights and just not popular amongst Canadians. And he heavily downplayed the need to fight climate change. He was the only major party leader to do that. And that seems to have hurt him with many centrist voters, which he desperately needed to win, especially in the center of the country. Trudeau was also helped by strategic voting on the left, voters of the New Democratic Party, which had been surging under popular leader Jagmeet Singh, appear to have decided to vote Liberal as a way of preventing a Conservative government. But Trudeau also has genuine star power. I mean, he seems to thrive off the energy of crowds and vice versa. He pulled much bigger crowds than any of the other leaders throughout the campaign. I was at a rally just after the blackface scandal, and that was a very forgiving crowd. He just - he seems to be better at campaigning than he is, almost, in any other part of his job. It's pretty incredible to watch. MARTIN: So let's talk a little bit about U.S.-Canadian relations because the relationship between Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump hasn't exactly been warm. But President Trump did send him a little Twitter shoutout congratulating him on his, quote, \"wonderful and hard-fought victory.\" I mean, I'm just curious, did Donald Trump have any kind of effect on the Canadian election? MCGUFFIN: He definitely loomed over the campaign. I had plenty of voters here say to me in the past month or so that Canada needed to be wary about getting rid of Justin Trudeau 'cause you know how bad it can get. And that was in reference, certainly, to Donald Trump. I mean, Justin Trudeau played up the fact that he - how well he managed the relationship with Donald Trump, that he got a new NAFTA deal signed. So I mean, I think basically, you saw in a lot of ways a rejection of the sort of populism that Trump was playing out up here. MARTIN: All right. Reporter David McGuffin on the recent Canadian elections. Justin Trudeau has secured another term as prime minister while losing the majority. David, we appreciate your reporting. Thank you. MCGUFFIN: Thanks so much. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

With abortion-rights activists playing defense from statehouses to the Supreme Court, Planned Parenthood is unveiling a new campaign push focused on the 2020 elections. The organization is announcing its largest electoral effort yet \u2014 with plans to spend at least $45 million backing candidates in local, state and national races who support abortion rights. Kelley Robinson, executive director of the superPAC Planned Parenthood Votes, said advocates are pushing back against a \"coordinated level of attack\" from abortion-rights opponents. \"It's clear that all these attacks have one goal: to undermine and to gut Roe v. Wade,\" Robinson said in an interview with NPR. The first priority for 2020 is to unseat President Trump. The group also will work to help Democrats take over the U.S. Senate, maintain Democratic control in the House, and promote candidates in state-level races who support abortion rights, Robinson said. The group is targeting 5 million voters nationwide, with a focus on nine key states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The campaign will include digital, television and radio ads rolling out later this year; direct mail; and voter canvassing beginning in 2020. The effort is meant to build on a nearly $30 million push by the organization in 2018, a year in which Democrats saw substantial gains and took control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Robinson said. \"We've built some serious grassroots power in the states with millions of new supporters signing up,\" she said. Robinson said Planned Parenthood is heavily fundraising around the country for the campaign. She said the $45 million represents an initial investment, and she hopes to raise more. \"This year what we're finding is that people really understand exactly what's at stake,\" Robinson said. \"The stakes are higher than ever, and our donors and our supporters understand that very clearly.\" Planned Parenthood has long been a focus of efforts by abortion-rights opponents to cut public funding to abortion providers and restrict the procedure nationwide. The group has been fighting a series of particularly difficult battles since the election of President Trump in 2016; in recent weeks, the organization announced it was withdrawing from the federal Title X family planning program because of rule changes enacted by the Trump administration. Along with other reproductive-rights groups, Planned Parenthood was heavily involved in the unsuccessful effort to block the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination by Trump last year has tilted the court to the right. The organization also has been part of a coalition of groups fighting several early-abortion bans passed in multiple states during the 2019 legislative session. Abortion-rights opponents and other conservative groups are expected to launch their own efforts to support candidates who share their views. Those are likely to include door-knocking, voter guides and encouraging Christian pastors to urge their congregations to vote \u2014 within the bounds of federal laws restricting political speech by tax-exempt organizations, said Eric Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League. \"A lot of it happens at churches \u2014 passing out flyers,\" Scheidler said. \"There's an effort to educate pastors about what's allowed.\" The anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List, which has played a major role in electing conservatives to the U.S. Senate and in supporting Trump's judicial nominees, is planning a $41 million effort for the 2020 campaign cycle. The group will support candidates who oppose abortion rights, including Trump. In a press release earlier this year, the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said the goal is to \"aggressively challenge, erode, and finally, overturn Roe v. Wade.\" Activists on both sides of the abortion debate will be framing the 2020 election as an opportunity to advance their cause. Abortion-rights opponents, pleased with Trump's policies and judicial nominations, will remind conservative voters of the importance of turnout; meanwhile, abortion-rights groups including Planned Parenthood will make the case that the only place to stop the erosion of those rights is at the polls in November 2020.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is taking up its first major abortion case since Brett Kavanaugh joined the court, renewing a major political and legal battle over abortion rights.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: It's been almost exactly a year since Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as U.S. Supreme Court justice, moving the court to the right. And now the court says it will consider the constitutionality of a Louisiana abortion law similar to one it overturned three years ago. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, the court will hear the case as the country prepares for the 2020 election. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Like the Texas law that was overturned in 2016, the Louisiana law requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. It's unusual for the Supreme Court to revisit an issue so soon, says Karen O'Connor, a political scientist at American University. What's different now, O'Connor says, are two new justices, both appointed by President Trump. KAREN O'CONNOR: It's almost like the witches of \"Macbeth\" stirring the pot because they've been waiting so long to be able to actually make substantive reductions in women's right to have an abortion. MCCAMMON: O'Connor says the case could open the door to an onslaught of new state restrictions designed to make abortion inaccessible. Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, is glad the court is revisiting the issue. She hopes the justices will allow states like Louisiana to regulate abortion as they see fit. ELIZABETH SLATTERY: In my estimation, I think this is an issue that should be left up to legislators rather than judges. Legislators are more, you know, accountable to the people and can be more responsive to changes in medical technology and things we know about what point a baby can survive outside of the womb and those sorts of things. MCCAMMON: If the Louisiana law is upheld, abortion rights advocates like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood fear a flood of new restrictions. ALEXIS MCGILL JOHNSON: We have to continue to fight within our state legislatures to empower, to educate voters and supporters around the real critical threat that's happening to women across this country. MCCAMMON: Advocates on both sides predict abortion will loom large in the 2020 campaign at the state and national levels. Mallory Quigley is with the anti-abortion-rights group the Susan B. Anthony List. MALLORY QUIGLEY: This issue is going to remain front and center. And this and the other pro-life laws that are in ongoing litigation right now will provide many opportunities for the candidates to speak into these issues. MCCAMMON: The Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday, and a decision in the Louisiana abortion case could come a few months before the 2020 election. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Washington.

Many heads got scratched this week when President Trump doubled down on his erroneous claim that Alabama had been in the path of Hurricane Dorian. Apparently relying on a map that warned of high winds, or another showing hypothetical paths for the storm, the president over the weekend insisted Alabama was \"in the crosshairs.\" At midweek, sitting in the Oval Office, he held up a map on which someone using a marking pen had ballooned the area of actual hurricane threat to include Alabama. The question had to be asked: Wouldn't it be enough to be worried about Florida, Georgia and the rest of the Southeastern coast without dragging in Alabama \u2014 a state outside the current danger zone? Perhaps. But in seeking to understand the moment it was tempting to observe that Alabama is arguably the cornerstone of the president's base of support in seeking a second term. While 17 states have consistently shown the president at 50% job approval or better, according to Gallup, Alabama is one of just three states where Trump's approval has often topped 60% since Inauguration Day. According to the Morning Consult tracking poll, Trump's approval is 18 points positive in West Virginia and 21 in Wyoming. In Alabama, it is 26, and Alabama has more votes in the Electoral College than those two other states combined. Do such things matter to a president seeking reelection? They just might, especially when that president is struggling to raise his public approval nationwide. The president is setting his course on issues, from guns and trade to immigration and abortion, and his stances on those make it clear he is playing to his base. All politicians want as many voters as they can get, and all begin their calculations by relying on a core of support. But in American presidential politics, the ultimate question is not just how many voters one has but where they live, because in American presidential politics, the Electoral College rules. While much time and attention is devoted to tracking the president's approval rating nationwide, and his supporters can be found in any part of the country, all that matters in the end is the president's standing state by state. Examining trends in individual states offers a clearer picture of Trump's reelection prospects a little more than a year from now \u2014 and a rationale for his strategy. It also highlights the degree to which the country's issue conflicts and partisan rivalries are defined by differences in population density. Where the urban- and inner-suburban metro areas are politically dominant, Democrats prevail; otherwise, the president and the Republican Party hold sway. And where the city-country balance is closer to even, we have a swing state. That sets the landscape for 2020 \u2014 with President Trump hoping to again win the 30 states he won in 2016 with 306 votes in the Electoral College. That gives him a margin of 36 Electoral College votes, because it takes 270 to win for a majority 538 electors who make up the Electoral College. So how's he faring in the effort to do it again? When being \"popular\" isn't the answer It's nice to win the popular vote, and the popular vote usually underscores the final decision. Not always, though. See 2000 and 2016. In reality, the national popular vote has no role in the choice of the president. That choice is determined by the Electoral College, guided by the popular vote in each state. (Note: If no one gets a majority in the Electoral College, the choice is made in the House of Representatives, where, for just this one decision, each state gets one vote.) With this in mind, defining Trump's base requires both defining his voters and counting the states where they will cast at least a plurality of the 2020 vote. In 2016, Trump won those 30 states with 306 electoral votes, though there were two \"faithless electors\" in Texas who voted for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, leaving Trump, technically, with 304. Looking ahead to 2020, though, Trump looks to only be able to count on a little more than half of those states to continue backing him, come what may. Trump's approval rating averaged just 40% nationwide in 2018, according to Gallup, and his approval rating was above 50% in 17 states \u2014 all of which he had carried in 2016. The Trump 17 are: Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Utah, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, West Virginia, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska and Wyoming. In 2018, 17 states gave President Donald Trump approval ratings of 50% or higher, while 16 gave him ratings below 40%. https://t.co/bcXeMLm0fT pic.twitter.com/cXAAbRkUHm These numbers are based on the Gallup tracking poll that takes soundings 350 times a year. It is generally corroborated by the readings done by Morning Consult. Although Morning Consult had sub-50 readings for Trump in Utah at several points in the first two years, it was above 50% this summer, as are Texas and Missouri. In the first weeks of 2019, during the government shutdown, both Gallup and Morning Consult found Trump dipping below 50% by a point or two in some of the larger states in this core. But in each, the rating quickly snapped back above 50% when the shutdown ended and has remained there since. These 17 states then would have to be regarded as the purest definition of Trump's geographic base, the firmest foundation for his reelection. Beyond that, they easily provide most of the senators who make Republican Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader. The current Senate has 53 Republican members, 31 of whom hail from those same 17 states. As a measure of how American politics has changed, consider that there were 15 Democrats from these states when Bill Clinton became president. One Democrat from that era, Richard Shelby of Alabama, is still around, but he switched to the GOP in 1994 right after that party became the Senate majority. He symbolizes how populists from largely rural states in the South and West have migrated from one party to the other and become the hard base for Trump. It has long been noted that Trump, a former Manhattan socialite and billionaire, makes an odd champion for these voters and these regions of the country. But his willingness to take up their causes has largely won them over. And in 2016, his emergence from a field of 17 candidates to win the Republican Party nomination installed him atop a party that now commands the loyalty of rural America as never before. The more rural, the more pro-Trump Within the states, and across the national map, party loyalties can be perceived as a function of population density. \"All the social changes that have pulled cities and rural areas apart since the 1930s have come to be expressed in the party system,\" writes Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist at Stanford University. \"American geographic polarization has emerged in large part because our political institutions have created a strict two-party system that has gradually come to reflect a set of social cleavages that are highly correlated with population density.\" And Will Wilkinson, vice president for research at the Niskanen Center, a Washington think tank, has added: \"The filtering/sorting dynamic of urbanization has produced a lower-density, mainly white [rural] population that is increasingly uniform in socially conservative personality, aversion to diversity, relative disinclination to migrate and seek higher education, and Republican Party loyalty.\" Trump's most loyal 17 states have in common a relatively low population. The two largest, Tennessee and Missouri, rank just 16th and 18th among all states in the Census Bureau estimates for 2018. Each has two major cities that vote Democratic, but the urban characteristics of Nashville and Memphis, and St. Louis and Kansas City, are not enough to counterbalance the exurban and rural characteristics of those states overall. More typical of the group in population is Kansas. With a little under 3 million residents last year, and ranking 35th nationally, Kansas is still more populous than half the rest of the 17 states. Next in size is West Virginia with 1.8 million. Five states among the 17 qualify for only a single seat in the U.S. House: Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska and Wyoming. A glance at these 17 pro-Trump states on a map makes them appear to dominate the landscape, and indeed they do in a strictly geographic sense. They comprise some of the largest expanses of sparsely inhabited land America has to offer. That impression only strengthens when you add Texas, a megastate where Trump has not always been above 50% approval in the Gallup but has never been far from it. While the state is becoming more competitive, few doubt it will be in the president's column again in 2020. Tacking on Texas also greatly expands the footprint of Trump's hardcore states in the Electoral College. Without Texas, their collective contribution is only 102 electoral votes. With Texas they reach 140, just over half of what Trump will need to secure a second term. On the contrary The other side of the coin in the Gallup approval map is the group of 16 (plus the District of Columbia) states where Trump's approval was below 40% in his first two years in office. Here again, the Morning Consult tracking data generally corroborate these findings and extend them into 2019. Not surprisingly, these 16 have a lot more people than the core Trump 17, as the below-40 states include three of the nation's most populous five (California, New York and Illinois) and nine of the top 22. That translates to 201 electoral votes, or nearly three-fourths of what a Democrat might need to win. It is tempting to say this is the built-in base of Trump's opponent, whoever that may be. But that still leaves a whopping 235 electoral votes in the 17 states that are not distinctly pro-Trump or con, the states where he has been at 40% to 49% approval (again, relying primarily on the Gallup tracking). In 2016, Trump was able to pick off just enough states in the Great Lakes region \u2014 starting with pivotal Ohio \u2014 to win despite losing the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. He could win again, even losing by millions in the popular vote, if he can reassemble the same bloc of states \u2014 or close to it. There seems little point in campaigning at all in the deeper blue states such as California, New York and Illinois. While millions of voters live there, the president has little or no chance of translating their votes into the electoral votes he needs to supplement his base in the rest of the country. The president will campaign in the states where he has been polling in the 40s, including previously reliable blue states he shocked the world by winning in 2016 (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). He won those three by fractions of a percentage point each (just under 78,000 votes aggregate total). All three states elected Democratic governors in 2018. But the president maintains a loyal Republican base in each and will again appeal to non-Republicans who found him the better choice in 2016. He hopes they hold and lift him again next year. Needless to say, the president will emphasize that strategic handful of \"purple states\" that have swung back and forth in recent presidential cycles. Most important are the ones he captured last time: Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona and Iowa. But he will also be looking to compete in swing states he lost to Hillary Clinton: Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire. With all this predictable effort, however, Trump will not neglect the 17 base states that have stood by him most loyally so far. And he should find it natural enough to enlarge this group with the states that have at least kept him near 50% approval through his first 32 months in office. These include the megastates of Texas and Georgia (No. 2 and No. 8), plus Louisiana and Indiana. He has held rallies in these states and stressed their issues and concerns from Inauguration Day forward. And he knows that without all these states on board, all other strategies and outreach will not be enough to ensure a second inauguration.",

When Jessy Rosales was a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside, she had a boyfriend and she was taking birth control pills. Then out of nowhere, she started feeling sick. \"I just thought it was the stomach flu,\" she says. \"It turns out I was pregnant.\" Rosales was clear that she was not ready to have a baby. She wanted a medication abortion, where she would take one pill at the clinic and a second one at home a day or two later to induce a miscarriage. \"I just wanted the intimacy of dealing with it on my own, in the privacy of my own home,\" she says. \"And being able to cry if I wanted to cry or just being able to curl up in my bed right away.\" Public university health centers in California do not perform abortions. But state lawmakers are expected to pass a bill in the coming weeks that would require student health centers at all 34 state campuses to provide medication abortions. If the measure becomes law, it will be the first of its kind in the U.S. The bill's supporters say they want to remove the obstacles women face accessing medical abortion off campus. For example, Rosales was given three off-campus referrals for abortion providers by her student health center. But the first clinic she called didn't perform abortions after all. The second didn't take her insurance. By the time she could get an appointment at a third clinic, she was already into the second trimester of pregnancy \u2014 too late for a medication abortion, which can only be done up to 10 weeks. Rosales ended up having a surgical procedure. \"The doctor kept telling me to relax ... and I couldn't because it just hurt so bad,\" she recalls. \"I was just afraid and alone.\" Rosales graduated last year and is now advocating for the bill (SB 24) as a reproductive justice activist with the Women's Foundation of California. She wants other students to have easier access to the abortion pill than she did. It took too long for Jessy Rosales to find a clinic near the University of California, Riverside, that would provide a medication abortion and accept her insurance. She's now advocating for a state bill to make the pills available at public university health centers in California.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Planned Parenthood\n                    \n                \nhide caption It took too long for Jessy Rosales to find a clinic near the University of California, Riverside, that would provide a medication abortion and accept her insurance. She's now advocating for a state bill to make the pills available at public university health centers in California. Opponents of the bill have organized several rallies against it. In August, about 60 protesters in yellow T-shirts gathered outside a church in Sacramento, Calif., their heads bowed as a priest led them in prayer. Then they marched around the state's Capitol, chanting, \"Don't kill babies! Don't kill babies!\" While a consortium of women's groups that support abortion rights has promised to pay for all the required ultrasound equipment and upfront training costs of providing the abortion pill on campus, eventually universities would likely need to dip into tax dollars or student fees for ongoing costs. Abortion opponents such as Michele LaMonica object to that. \"Not on my dime, not on my dime,\" LaMonica says. \"Tax me to help the homeless. Tax me to help social services, but don't tax me to pay for the disposal of human life.\" Insurers are already required to cover abortion under California law, and state tax dollars do go toward abortions provided through Medi-Cal, the state version of Medicaid for low-income patients. However, none of the UC campuses and only some of the CSU campuses get reimbursed for health services through Medi-Cal. University officials testified during legislative hearings on the bill last year that it could be an administrative or fiscal burden to establish billing systems to provide the abortion pill on campus. They predicted that some clinical costs, as well as security and liability costs, could fall directly to the universities and get passed on to students. Up to 519 women at public universities seek a medication abortion every month in California, according to a study published last summer in the Journal of Adolescent Health. The same research found that off-campus abortion providers were an average of 6 miles away from public university campuses in California. Former Gov. Jerry Brown cited this stat when he vetoed a version of the same bill (SB 320) last year, saying the legislation was not necessary. \"Six miles away \u2014 that's like a $5 Uber ride,\" said abortion opponent Nick Reynosa, the Northern California regional coordinator for Students for Life of America. He says the campaign is more about politics than need. \"Over the last decade, many pro-choice activists feel that in red states, there's been a lot of momentum toward more abortion restrictions. This is a way to say, 'No. Here, in blue California, we're going to affirm or expand [the right to an abortion],' \" Reynosa says. The bill's supporters don't deny it. Phoebe Abramowitz was part of the student team that launched the campus campaign for medication abortions at UC Berkeley four years ago. \"Now that we're doing statewide advocacy, we're hoping to set a national precedent that we can, even in these really hostile times to women and queer people, move access to abortion forward,\" she says. \"It's more important now than it even was a year ago.\" When Brown vetoed the bill last year, then-gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom said he would have supported it. He won the election about a month later, and advocates are optimistic that he will side with them this time around. The state Legislature has until mid-September to pass the bill, and the governor has a month after that to sign or veto it.

Democrats elected last November have pushed through two laws that expand access to abortion in the state. While abortion bans in Republican-led states dominated headlines in recent weeks, a handful of other states have passed laws to expand abortion access. Maine joined those ranks in June with two new laws \u2014 one requires all insurance and Medicaid to cover the procedure and the other allows physician assistants and nurses with advanced training to perform it. With these laws, Maine joins New York, Illinois, Rhode Island and Vermont as states that are trying to shore up the right to abortion in advance of an expected U.S. Supreme Court challenge. But what sets Maine apart from the other states is how recently Democrats have taken power. \"Elections matter,\" says Nicole Clegg of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. \"In 2018, we saw the largest number of women get elected to our legislature. We saw an overwhelming majority of elected officials who support reproductive rights and access to reproductive health care.\" The dramatic political change also saw Maine elect its first female governor, Janet Mills, a Democrat who took over from Paul LePage, a Tea Party stalwart who served two terms. LePage had blocked Medicaid expansion in the state even after voters approved it in a referendum. Clegg and other supporters of abortion rights have hailed the new abortion legislation as a big win. \"It will be the single most important event since Roe v. Wade in the state of Maine,\" Clegg says. Taken together, the intent of the two laws is to make it easier for women to afford and find abortion care in the rural state. Nurse practitioners like Julie Jenkins, who works in a small coastal town, say that increasing the number of abortion providers will make it easier for patients who now have to travel long distances in Maine to get the procedure from a doctor. \"Five hours to get to a provider and back \u2014 that's not unheard of,\" Jenkins says. Under the law set to go into effect in September, physician assistants and nurses with advanced training will be able to perform a surgical form of the procedure known as an aspiration abortion. These clinicians already are allowed to use the same technique in other circumstances, such as when a woman has a miscarriage. Maine's other new law will require all insurance plans \u2014 including Medicaid \u2014 to cover abortions and is supposed to be implemented early next year. Kate Brogan of Maine Family Planning says this legislation is a workaround for dealing with the U.S. law known as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions except in extreme circumstances. \"That is a policy decision that we think coerces women into continuing pregnancies that they don't want to continue,\" Brogan says. \"Because if you continue your pregnancy, Medicaid will cover it. But if you want to end your pregnancy, you have to come up with the money [to pay for an abortion].\" State dollars, not federal, will pay for the abortions performed through Maine's Medicaid program (in general, Medicaid is funded by both state and federal tax dollars). Though the bill passed in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, it faced staunch opposition from Republicans, including state Sen. Lisa Keim, during floor debates. \"Maine people should not be forced to have their hard-earned tax dollars [used] to take the life of a living pre-born child,\" Keim says. Instead, Keim argues, abortions for low-income women should be funded by supporters who wish to donate money. Otherwise, she said during the debate, the religious convictions of abortion opponents are at risk. \"Our decision today cannot be to strip the religious liberty of Maine people through taxation,\" Keim says. Rep. Beth O'Connor, a Republican who says she personally opposes abortion but believes women should have a choice, says she had safety concerns about letting clinicians who are not doctors provide abortions. \"I think this is very risky, and I think it puts the woman's health at risk,\" O'Connor says. In contrast, advanced-practice clinicians say the legislation merely allows them to operate to the full scope of their expertise and expands patients' access to important health procedures. The measure also has the backing of physician groups, including the Maine Medical Association. Just as state laws restricting abortion are being challenged, so are Maine's new laws. Days after Maine's law regarding Medicaid and abortion passed, organizations that oppose abortion rights announced they would mount an effort to put the issue on the ballot for a people's veto.",

Former Vice President Joseph Biden said in Atlanta on Thursday that he now opposes the Hyde Amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortions through programs like Medicaid. He attributed his change in stance to Republican legislators' passing bills to limit access to abortions and efforts to topple the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized the procedure. \"If I believe heath care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone's zip code,\" Biden said at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Georgia, among the states that have have recently passed laws restricting abortions. Biden, who has been consistently leading in the polls for the Democratic primary, has been a longtime supporter of the Hyde Amendment, just as it has been challenged by some in his own party. Many of the 2020 Democratic contenders are united in wanting the amendment to be repealed. The Hyde Amendment is a 43-year-old law that prohibits taxpayer-supported health care programs from utilizing federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save a woman's life. Just earlier in the week, Biden's campaign affirmed the candidate's support for the ban, setting off criticism from abortion rights supporters, who called on Biden to reverse his long-held position. Biden, 76, a Roman Catholic, told the crowd that he voted for the Hyde Amendment as a senator because he thought women could still have access to abortions even if federally-backed programs did not provide funding for the procedure. \"There was sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right, women of color, poor women,\" Biden said. \"It was not under attack,\" he said. \"As it is now.\" Now, Biden says, there are too many legal obstacles to seeking an abortion, which has prompted a turnaround on his position. \"I can't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right,\" Biden said. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood, applauded Biden changing his mind on the issue, but she noted that his thinking on it has been lagging behind the women's rights movement. \"Happy to see Joe Biden embrace what we have long known to be true: Hyde blocks people\u2014particularly women of color and women with low incomes\u2014from accessing safe, legal abortion care,\" Wen said.",

Three-quarters of Americans say they want to keep in place the landmark Supreme Court ruling, Roe v.

What the survey found is a great deal of complexity \u2014 and sometimes contradiction among Americans \u2014 that goes well beyond the talking points of the loudest voices in the debate. In fact, there's a high level of dissatisfaction with abortion policy overall. Almost two-thirds of people said they were either somewhat or very dissatisfied, including 66% of those who self-identify as \"pro-life\" and 62% of those who self-identify as \"pro-choice.\" \"What it speaks to is the fact that the debate is dominated by the extreme positions on both sides,\" said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, which conducted the survey. \"People do see the issue as very complicated, very complex. Their positions don't fall along one side or the other. ... The debate is about the extremes, and that's not where the public is.\" The poll comes as several states have pushed to limit abortions in hopes of getting the Supreme Court to reconsider the issue. Abortion-rights opponents hope the newly conservative court will either overturn Roe or effectively gut it by upholding severe restrictions. The survey finds that while most Americans favor limiting abortion, they don't want it to be illegal and don't want to go as far as states like Alabama, for example, which would ban it completely except if the woman's life is endangered or health is at risk. A total of 77% say the Supreme Court should uphold Roe, but within that there's a lot of nuance \u2014 26% say they would like to see it remain in place, but with more restrictions added; 21% want to see Roe expanded to establish the right to abortion under any circumstance; 16% want to keep it the way it is; and 14% want to see some of the restrictions allowed under Roe reduced. Just 13% overall say it should be overturned. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Even though Americans are solidly against overturning Roe, a majority would also like to see abortion restricted in various ways. In a separate question, respondents were asked which of six choices comes closest to their view of abortion policy. In all, 61% said they were in favor of a combination of limitations that included allowing abortion in just the first three months of a pregnancy (23%); only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the woman (29%); or only to save the life of the woman (9%).

Eighteen percent said abortion should be available to a woman any time she wants during her entire pregnancy. At the other end of the spectrum, 9% said it should never be permitted under any circumstance. More than half (53%) of Americans say they would definitely not vote for a candidate who would appoint judges to the Supreme Court who would limit or overturn Roe. Politically, abortion has been a stronger voting issue for Republicans than for Democrats. This poll found that abortion ranks as the second-most-important issue for Republicans in deciding their vote for president, behind immigration. But for Democrats, it is fifth \u2014 behind health care, America's role in the world, climate change and personal financial well-being. The poll also notably found the highest percentage of people self-identifying as \"pro-choice,\" those who generally support abortion rights, since a Gallup survey in December 2012. In this survey, 57% identified that way versus 35%, who called themselves \"pro-life,\" those who are generally opposed to abortion rights. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here The percentage self-identifying as \"pro-choice\" is an increase since a Marist Poll in February, when the two sides split with 47% each. The pollsters attribute that shift to efforts in various states to severely restrict abortion. \"The public is very reactive to the arguments being put forth by the more committed advocates on both sides of the issue,\" Carvalho said, adding, \"The danger for Republicans is that when you look at independents, independents are moving more toward Democrats on this issue. ... When the debate starts overstepping what public opinion believes to be common sense, we've seen independents moving in Democrats' corner.\" In the case of self-identification, 60% of independents identified as \"pro-choice.\" Asked which party would do a better job of dealing with the issue of abortion, a plurality of Americans overall chose Democrats (47%) over Republicans (34%). Independents chose Democrats on the question of which party would do a better job by an 11-point margin (43% to 32%). Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Asked if they'd be more likely to support state laws that decriminalize abortion and make laws less strict or ones that do the opposite, 60% of Americans overall, including two-thirds of independents, chose laws that decriminalize abortion and are less strict. What specifically do Americans support and oppose? The poll also asked a long series of questions to try to figure out what Americans support or oppose when it comes to potential changes to abortion laws pending in several states. Poll respondents were not told which states these proposals come from. The poll found that Americans are very much against requiring fines and/or prison time for doctors who perform abortions. There was also slim majority support for allowing abortions at any time during a pregnancy if there is no viability outside the womb and for requiring insurance companies to cover abortion procedures. A slim majority also opposed allowing pharmacists and health providers the ability to opt out of providing medicine or surgical procedures that result in abortion. At the same time, two-thirds were in favor of a 24-hour waiting period from the time a woman meets with a health care professional until having the abortion procedure itself; two-thirds wanted doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges; and a slim majority wanted the law to require women to be shown an ultrasound image at least 24 hours before an abortion procedure. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here \"What's most interesting here,\" Carvalho said, is that \"the extremes are really outliers. When they advocate for their positions and change the debate toward the most extreme position on the issue, they actually do the opposite. They move public opinion away from them.\" The more vocal advocates on either side, however, have had the ability to shift the debate and public opinion to their point of view. Consider that many of the specific items above, at one point or another, have been hotly debated. When does life begin? The poll also asked the very big question of when Americans think life begins. There was not an overwhelming consensus. A plurality of the six choices given, but far less than a majority, said life begins at conception (38%). Slightly more than half (53%) disagreed, saying that life begins either within the first eight weeks of pregnancy (8%), the first three months (8%), between three and six months (7%), when a fetus is viable (14%) or at birth (16%). Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here Gender gap? Try a stark party divide, particularly among women The most acute divide among Americans on the issue of abortion, arguably, is not a gender divide but between the parties \u2014 and of women of different parties. For example, 54% of men identified as \"pro-choice,\" compared with 60% of women. For women of the different parties, 77% of Democratic women identified as \"pro-choice,\" while 68% of Republican women identified as \"pro-life.\" (A lower percentage of Republican men, 59%, considered themselves \"pro-life.\") Throughout the poll, the divide was stark. On Roe, for example, 62% of Republican women said overturn it or add restrictions; 73% of Democratic women said keep it the way it is, expand it to allow abortions under any circumstance or reduce some of the restrictions. Eighty-four percent of Democratic women said they are more likely to support state laws that decriminalize abortion and make laws less strict; 62% of Republican women said they are more likely to support laws that criminalize abortion or make laws stricter. On requiring insurance companies to cover abortion procedures, 75% of Democratic women support that, while 78% of Republican women oppose it, higher than the 63% of Republican men who said the same. Republican women also stand out for the 62% of them who said they oppose laws that allow abortion at any time during pregnancy in cases of rape or incest. They are the only group to voice majority opposition to that. Fifty-nine percent of Republican men, for example, said they would support such a law. And Republican women are the only group to say overwhelmingly that life begins at conception. About three-quarters said so, compared with less than half of Republican men and a third of Democratic women. It's a reminder that Republican women, in many ways, are the backbone of the movement opposing abortion rights. The survey of 944 adults was conducted by live interviewers by telephone from May 31 through June 4. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Editor's note: The survey asked respondents to identify as either \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" This question wording, using the labels \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice,\" was included in the survey because it has tracked the public debate on abortion over decades. It is sensitive to current events and public discussion even though it does not capture the nuanced positions many people have on the issue.",

            "article_content": "Louisiana is the latest state where lawmakers have voted to ban most abortions with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The state's Democratic governor says he will sign the bill into law.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Today Louisiana's governor became the latest to sign a strict abortion ban into law with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. This is part of a long-term strategy by abortion opponents to get the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider its landmark Roe versus Wade decision legalizing abortion. NPR's Debbie Elliott is following this debate and joins us now. Hi. Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: OK, so the Louisiana Legislature passed this bill yesterday. The governor signed it into law today. What does it do? ELLIOTT: Well, it outlaws abortion once a heartbeat can be detected by ultrasound. Typically that can be as early as six weeks, in some cases before a woman would even know that she was pregnant. There are exceptions if a woman's life is threatened or if there's a serious and irreversible health risk, also if the pregnancy is diagnosed as medically futile. There are no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Here's the bill's House sponsor, Republican State Representative Valarie Hodges. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VALARIE HODGES: While we have tremendous empathy - tremendous empathy - for women of whatever age, especially for children that have been the victims of rape or incest - and it is a heinous crime - but if anyone should be put to death, it should be the perpetrator of the crime, not the child, not the baby. ELLIOTT: Republicans lead the Louisiana Legislature, but this bill picked up Democratic support as well. In fact, the Senate sponsor of the bill is a Democrat. SHAPIRO: And so is the governor who signed the bill this afternoon. What has he said about his decision to sign the bill into law? ELLIOTT: Well, his position is certainly a break with national Democrats. Edwards was not available for an interview, but in a statement, he described himself as pro-life. He also acknowledged that there are many people who feel just as strongly as he does on the abortion issue and disagree with me, he said. But I respect their opinions. One of the people that disagree with him is the chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party, State Senator Karen Carter Peterson. I spoke with her from Baton Rouge today, and she was very disappointed with the governor. KAREN CARTER PETERSON: I respect his religious beliefs. I, in fact, share a lot of his religious beliefs. But while I'm in this capitol as I sit right now, a woman's health is sacred. A woman should have the right to decide with her husband, with her family what she does with her body. ELLIOTT: The political reality in Louisiana is that Edwards, the lone Democratic governor in the Deep South, is up for re-election this year in a conservative, Republican-leaning state where the abortion issue resonates with voters. SHAPIRO: OK, well this ban comes as a lot of states are passing new restrictions on abortion. And most of these laws are tied up in court challenges. Take a step back, and tell us about the broader strategy here. ELLIOTT: Well, the broader strategy is to be in federal court on a path that anti-abortion activists hope will lead to the U.S. Supreme Court. They are emboldened by a conservative majority court now with two appointees from President Trump. And these laws are aimed at challenging Roe v. Wade. Louisiana's law uses the language unborn human being and defines that as from fertilization. The goal is to get the Supreme Court to overturn Roe and establish human rights for a developing embryo or fetus. Now, similar abortion bans by other states both in the South and in the Midwest have been challenged as unconstitutional. In fact, Louisiana's law is directly tied to a similar one in Mississippi that has already been blocked by a federal judge. The Louisiana law is written so that it would not take effect unless the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upholds Mississippi's law. SHAPIRO: There have been calls for boycotts of some of these states. Are we already seeing fallout even before the courts weigh in on these laws? ELLIOTT: Yes. After Alabama passed what was the most restrictive abortion ban in the country, the University of Alabama's biggest donor, Hugh Culverhouse Jr., called for a boycott of both the state of Alabama and the school. Now, the university attracts a majority of out-of-state students. It says it had nothing to do with the law and was already in a dispute with Culverhouse and may give him back a $21 million donation. That is a big investment to lose. In Georgia, several media giants including Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have indicated that they're reconsidering doing business in Georgia because of that state's law that bans abortions once a heartbeat can be detected. So Louisiana - also a place where there is a significant amount of television and film production as well as the music industry there. So that state could face similar pressure. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Debbie Elliott. Thanks, Debbie. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, by  a 7-to-2 vote, the Supreme Court upheld part of an Indiana measure that was signed into law when Vice President Mike Pence was governor of the state.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: We do not yet know how the Supreme Court might rule on state laws passed to restrict abortion this year. We now do know how the court addressed an abortion law passed a few years ago in the state of Indiana. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The renewed storm over abortion struck this week with repeated force. Today in Missouri, Planned Parenthood is in court over a standoff with state regulators that threatens to close down the only remaining clinic in the state that performs abortions. Yesterday, the Supreme Court, by a 7-2 vote, upheld part of an Indiana statute signed into law by Vice President Pence when he was governor. It mandates that aborted fetal remains be buried or cremated. In contrast, the court let stand a lower court ruling that struck down a different provision that banned abortions for reasons of fetal abnormality or disability as well as abortions based on race, gender or ancestry. In an unsigned opinion, the court said it would wait for other lower court rulings before weighing in on fetal characteristic provisions. The decision appeared to be a compromise between some of the court's conservative and liberal justices. Law professor Leah Litman of the University of California, Irvine. LEAH LITMAN: That has a solitary benefit of keeping abortion out of the court's docket in an election year and, in that respect, makes the court look less political. TOTENBERG: But keeping abortion cases off the docket will be difficult, as illustrated yesterday by the fire-breathing, 20-page opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas that leveled a broadside attack against Planned Parenthood, alleging that the group's founders had been enthusiastic supporters of eugenics. He said, quote, \"this case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics,\" close quote. While yesterday's opinion allows the court to tread water on abortion for now, still sitting on the court's docket is a lower court ruling temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court earlier this term. At issue is a Louisiana law that's nearly identical to a Texas statute struck down by the court just three years ago. The law requires doctors who perform abortions at clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. In 2016, the Supreme Court said that same kind of provision in Texas did nothing to promote the health of women seeking abortions but did impose barriers to abortion by imposing needless requirements on abortion providers. In any event, legal experts on the left and right see Roe v. Wade on the chopping block. With five conservative justices on the court now, all with outspoken views opposed to Roe, it would seem the only question is whether the landmark decision will be hollowed out so that abortions are, for all practical purposes, unavailable in a dozen or more states, or whether the court will actually reverse Roe entirely, handing the abortion question completely back to the states. George Mason University law professor Helen Alvare. HELEN ALVARE: All of the smart money, from what I've been hearing, is that the court would prefer an orderly and bit-by-bit giving back to states more of the authority to legislate on abortion restrictions. TOTENBERG: Professor Litman maintains that hollowing out Roe versus outright reversing it is, in practical terms, a distinction without a difference. But hollowing out Roe is better optics. LITMAN: I think it allows the court to kind of get off easy because it doesn't create the same kind of public rallying cry and issue around which to kind of motivate voters who care about this issue to go to the polls and make some changes. TOTENBERG: Don Verrilli, who served as the government's chief advocate in the Supreme Court under President Obama, however, predicts a direct ruling to overturn Roe in the next three to five years. He draws an analogy to the court's desire to go slow on gay marriage. DON VERRILLI: You know, there was a sense in 2013, well, this is going to be a while because the court isn't ready to address this issue yet. But then boom - it was there two years later, and I think that's because events forced the court's hand. And I think something parallel is likely to happen here too.

Mike Parson signed into law on Friday a ban on nearly all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed into law on Friday a ban on nearly all abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill on Friday that criminalizes abortions in the state after eight weeks of pregnancy, the latest in a series of sweeping restrictions passed by Republican-controlled legislatures that now threaten nearly 50 years of federal protections for abortion. Under the law, any person who performs an abortion after eight weeks \u2014 which is often before many women are aware they are pregnant \u2014 could be charged with a Class B felony punishable by five to 15 years in prison. The final version of the legislation does not have exceptions for victims of rape or incest. It does have an exception for medical emergencies. Parson, a Republican who has said he would like to make Missouri \"the most Pro-Life state in the country,\" is the latest conservative governor to sign a far-reaching abortion restriction into law, presenting yet another possible challenge to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling establishing a woman's right to have an abortion. The Missouri Senate approved the measure just one day after Alabama's governor, Republican Kay Ivey, signed a bill that bans nearly all abortions and makes no exception for cases of incest or rape. Supporters of the Missouri legislation say it is distinctive from the Alabama law in one significant way: It was not written to topple Roe v. Wade. Rather, its backers say, it's aimed at curbing abortions within the bounds of the law. \"We do not want to run through the courts and try to overturn Roe v. Wade like some of the legislators in other states, like Alabama. We just want to save as many lives as we can while withstanding judicial challenges,\" Missouri Rep. Nick Schroer, a Republican sponsor of the bill, told NPR. \"We want to get as close to the line as possible on what previous judges have thrown out.\" Other states, including Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia and Mississippi, have recently passed bills that forbid abortions when heartbeat activity is detected. The Missouri law stipulates that if an abortion within the eight-week window is performed, the woman needs to be given the opportunity to view an ultrasound, but it is not mandatory that she view it. The bill, HB 126, known as the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act, passed both chambers of the General Assembly last week. Under the bill, women will be able to terminate a pregnancy after eight weeks only if they meet the law's definition of a medical emergency, which lawmakers defined as something that \"so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert the death of the pregnant woman or for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment.\" Before the bill's passage, protesters' shouts of \"When you lie, people die\" filled the chamber before they were escorted out of the building. Over more than two hours of debate, Republicans and Democrats delivered forceful arguments about the bill, with Democrats \u2014 at times yelling and at other moments sobbing \u2014 attempting to persuade the body to reject the measure. \"This gives more rights to the rapists than it does to the mother,\" said Rep. Doug Beck, a Democrat. \"This law is barbaric.\" Rep. Barbara Washington, another Democratic legislator, criticized the law. \"This bill is not about pro-life; it is about anti-choice,\" Washington said. \"Any time we are so disrespectful and immoral that we would force a woman to bring to life a child that is the result of a rape, an incest or sex trafficking, we are not thinking about life.\" One moment of the debate lit up social media when Rep. Barry Hovis, a Republican and former police officer, shared his own experience investigating rape cases. \"Most of my rapes were not the gentlemen jumping out of the bushes that nobody had ever met. That was one or two times out of a hundred. Most of them were date rapes or consensual rapes, which were all terrible,\" he said. After a public backlash from Democrats and legions on social media, Hovis apologized, saying he misspoke. At a press briefing on Friday, reporters asked the governor why he supported an abortion ban that does not create exceptions for rape or incest victims; he deflected the question. \"Because I'm the governor of the state of Missouri, and that's what I do. If legislators send a bill to me, I'm going to sign it,\" Parson said. \"I believe in the pro-life side of the issue,\" he said. \"Does it meet what I believe to be constitutional in our state? I believe this piece of legislation does.\" President Trump promised in his 2016 campaign to appoint Supreme Court justices who would undo Roe, but whether the slate of state bills striving to do that will be successful is uncertain. With the U.S. Supreme Court now composed of five Republican-appointed justices who may be willing to reexamine long-standing precedent, the high court may someday accept a case that could alter the landmark case, though legal experts are doubtful the court will review such a case before the 2020 election.

Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., says if she becomes president she would only appoint judges and justices who would maintain Roe v. Wade. National attention is turning to issues that have been central to Kirsten Gillibrand's years of public service: equality and reproductive rights. The New York senator and presidential candidate joined several of her Democratic primary opponents and abortion-rights advocates at a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court this week after multiple states passed restrictive abortion legislation. And on Wednesday she released a plan that promotes investments in maternal and child health, paid family leave, and education. \"I think President Trump and these very extreme Republican legislators around the country, they are taking this country in a direction that it does not want to go,\" Gillibrand told NPR. \"I believe that if President Trump wants a war with America's women, it's a war he will have and it is one he will lose.\" Gillibrand announced her exploratory committee in January on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. A video released by her committee at the time highlighted Gillibrand's work on government transparency, her rejection of corporate PAC money and her help pushing through the Sept. 11 health bill. Two months after making her candidacy official, she's not yet assured to qualify for the first primary debate. Asked whether she was concerned about her campaign's momentum, she said: \"The truth is, it's a marathon and not a sprint.\" Gillibrand spoke with Morning Edition as part of the show's Opening Argument conversations, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. On abortion and women's rights Equality and reproductive freedom has been something that I have focused my time in public service on over the last 12 years, but as [a presidential candidate] I've already made a very significant platform surrounding these issues. I will only appoint judges and justices that see Roe v. Wade as settled precedent. I will codify Roe v. Wade legislatively. I will look to remove the Hyde Amendment, which is the law that prohibits federal money paying for abortion services in a full range of health care, particularly for poor low-income women. I will also make sure and guarantee that no matter what state you live in, you will have a right to access full reproductive services, including abortion services. On whether Democrats are shifting further to the left I think there's a perception [of a shift], but I think the truth is certainly the party that I've been part of has been working on a lot of these issues for a very long time. But some things the way they're talked about seem new and seem more radical. And I don't think that's the case. And I'll give you an example: global climate change. I think global climate change is the greatest threat to humanity that exists. So I think the Green New Deal is just a platform of ideas that have been around for a long time that are already bipartisan. ... And to be honest, I just see it as an aspirational goal that's not unlike when John F. Kennedy wanted to put a man on the moon. He said, \"I want to do this in 10 years, not because it's easy, but because it's hard.\" And it's exciting, and that's what leadership is. And it doesn't have to be partisan. On her idea for national public service People want health care as a right. They want better public schools. They want to know that their kids can go to college debt-free. So my idea to do that is national public service. I believe that if you tell every young person in this country that if you do a year of public service, you could have two years of community college or state school free. We know that we have needs and lots of service industries that are desperate for young workers. And so if you open up public service to all those industry groups and you incentivize young people to commit a year or two to that, it's going to not only create pipelines into new jobs and careers that will create economic growth, but it changes the heart of the country and the heart of these kids in a generation.

            "article_content": "Abortion has become a hot topic heading into the 2020 presidential election. The U.S. is near full employment, but what does that mean? And, HBO's Game of Thrones has aired its final episode.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The following states have something in common. Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia, Iowa, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Utah all have recently passed laws that, in various ways, restrict when a woman can have an abortion. NOEL KING, HOST: Meanwhile, lawmakers in Missouri and Louisiana have approved bills, but they haven't been signed into law yet. Each of them is more restrictive than the standard set by the Supreme Court in its Roe v. Wade decision, and that is not a coincidence. Republican-controlled legislators want the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe. This, of course, is all happening in the run-up to a presidential election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Any Democrat who expects to win the presidency must answer definitively where they stand on this issue. KING: That is New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand who, of course, is one of the Democratic presidential candidates. So how will Democrats answer? INSKEEP: NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow is covering the presidential campaign. Scott, good morning. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What is the proposal from Gillibrand, who is the candidate we just heard? DETROW: Yeah. She's one of several candidates who've been focusing on this in the last few weeks. And amidst this increased focus, you're hearing a couple relatively new policies from Gillibrand and other Democrats running for president. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and others are talking specifically about passing federal laws codifying protections from Roe v. Wade and other Supreme Court rulings. There's a real concern from them that increasingly conservative federal courts would overturn Roe v. Wade. You're also hearing Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, among other candidates, be much more explicit than we've heard before about the role that abortion would play in their federal court appointments. Both are saying I would not appoint a Supreme Court judge or a federal judge who would not uphold Roe v. Wade. INSKEEP: Well, this is really interesting. And the idea of legislation is interesting since one historic criticism of Roe v. Wade is that the courts made this change, that it didn't go through the regular political process. And so now, effectively, some Democrats are saying, let's run it through the process. What else are Democrats saying? DETROW: Well - and I think the fact that they're explicitly saying that this would be a litmus test is another way that Donald Trump has changed the way that people talk about how they would be president and how people would act as president because this has been, you know, an implicit thing before. I would likely do it, but, oh, no, I wouldn't have a direct conversation about it. Now you have Gillibrand and Sanders saying, no, this is a key thing and I would talk about it with my appointees. But you've had candidates going to states like Georgia and Alabama talking about this, urging their supporters to give donations to groups like Planned Parenthood. The NPR Politics Podcast recently interviewed South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Here's what he said about this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) PETE BUTTIGIEG: What you have here is an agenda that is radical, that is out of step with what most Americans - even Americans in conservative states - believe is the right thing to do. It's disturbing. I think it amounts to an assault on freedom. DETROW: So you have the Democrats using these new laws to frame the Republican Party as being out of step with what the majority of Americans want. And you've seen some Republicans be a little uncomfortable with these new laws. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, says the Alabama law, in specific, goes further than he believes. Over the weekend, President Trump implied that, as well, saying that he has an agenda that opposes abortion rights but that he still supports exemptions for cases of rape or incest or the health of a mother. The president tweeted, if we are foolish and do not stay united as one, all of our hard-fought gains for life can and will rapidly disappear. That's the president over the weekend. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks so much. DETROW: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. The United States is at - or near - full employment. KING: Yeah, at least that's what economists call it. The idea of zero unemployment - literally everyone working - is very unlikely because people do change jobs. But the current rate of 3.6% is getting closer to that. It's the lowest level in nearly 50 years. So what do these numbers really mean for people looking for jobs, for people looking for raises? INSKEEP: NPR chief economic correspondent Scott Horsley is here to tell us. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How tight is the labor market when the unemployment rate is 3.6%? HORSLEY: Well, it's pretty tight across the country with that rate. But Steve, it's really tight in some places. In Ames, Iowa, for example, it's only 1.5%. INSKEEP: Wow. HORSLEY: NPR's Jim Zarroli visited Ames to find out how employers are coping there. And he spoke to restaurant manager Elizabeth Kopecky, who says it's a real struggle. ELIZABETH KOPECKY: We, last year, had a call from a restaurant down the street asking if we had any extra staff that they could share. That's how bad it's getting. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: And what did you tell them? KOPECKY: We didn't have enough for ourselves. HORSLEY: Wages are going up in Ames, but they are still having trouble attracting workers. Even though Iowa is a real nice place to live, Steve, there are just not many people moving there. We do find other parts of the country, though, where people are moving to take advantage of new opportunities. INSKEEP: For example? HORSLEY: Places like Atlanta, Tallahassee, Charlotte, N.C., have all seen an influx of workers, many of them coming from up north looking for better jobs, more affordable housing. For African-Americans, in particular, this is kind of a reversal of the Great Migration we saw in the 20th century. INSKEEP: Yeah. HORSLEY: NPR's Daniella Cheslow spent some time in North Carolina talking with African-American workers, both newcomers and longtime residents, like Nicole Muse-Dennis (ph). Muse-Dennis is a single mother of two who's working 65 hours a week. She says she's just barely getting by. NICOLE MUSE-DENNIS: I'm what I call over-employed. I have two jobs, and I'm still trying to make it. HORSLEY: The unemployment rate among African-Americans is low by historical standards. But at 6.7%, it's still nearly twice the national average. INSKEEP: Also, we just heard someone say there, Scott, she's working two jobs and still just trying to make it would suggest the jobs are not paying quite so well compared to her expenses. How is it that employers are managing not to massively raise wages and still finding people to hire? HORSLEY: One thing that is happening is that people who had been out of the job market, either by choice or otherwise, are being lured back in by the near-full-employment magnet. And employers are getting more creative about tapping into that hidden workforce. As a result, groups that had been on the margins in the past are also finding more opportunities, people with disabilities, for example, or a prison record. Things that might have been disqualifying in the past are not anymore, says Christopher Dickerson (ph). CHRISTOPHER DICKERSON: I don't care what your background is. I don't care where you came from. I don't care what color you are. I don't care as long as you come to work every single day and give me everything that you can give me. HORSLEY: Over the last couple of years, Steve, about 7 in 10 new people finding job were coming off the sidelines, not from the ranks of the unemployed. INSKEEP: But statistically, does this really mean higher wages for the people who already have jobs? HORSLEY: For a lot of very long economic expansions - expansion, wages did not move very much, they've just barely kept pace with inflation. But that is finally starting to change. You know, we're seeing wages pick up and accelerate, and that's especially true for people at the bottom of the income ladder, which is encouraging. There's no question workers have more negotiating power now. One thing we're looking at is collective bargaining and the demise of two-tier wage scales that some unions grudgingly went along with during the Great Recession. INSKEEP: Scott, thanks so much - appreciate it. HORSLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Who won the Game of Thrones? KING: We finally know. (SOUNDBITE OF RAMIN DJAWADI'S \"'GAME OF THRONES' THEME\") KING: The show wrapped last night after eight seasons. And fans had a strong reaction to the finale, which is not unexpected given the show's rabid fan base. INSKEEP: To tell us more about this moment is NPR TV critic Eric Deggans. Eric, good morning. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Now, before we start, we have to warn - we tried to keep you safe all season, but we can't anymore. DEGGANS: (Laughter). HORSLEY: ...You're going to be hearing some spoilers. I believe Noel is going to be sticking her fingers in her ears. DEGGANS: (Laughter). KING: That's correct. INSKEEP: OK. So she's... DEGGANS: I hear her saying, la, la, la, la. (LAUGHTER) DEGGANS: I hear it. INSKEEP: I can't hear you. But for those of us who are listening, what about the ending? DEGGANS: OK. So once again, just like winter was coming on \"Game Of Thrones,\" spoilers are coming here. I guess what I would say is that TV's most epic series failed to deliver on an epic ending. For the record, Bran Stark, a young man who lost the use of his legs when he was pushed out of a window in the first season, became the king. He won the Game of Thrones. But big moments, like the death of heroine-turned-despot Daenerys Targaryen, they happened quickly, and they kind of seemed anticlimactic. Now, let's remember last week's episode, where Daenerys used her dragon to burn down the town of King's Landing even after it surrendered. And then, on Sunday's episode, her lover and supporter Jon Snow had this argument with her adviser Tyrion Lannister. And their back-and-forth kind of sounded like two fans arguing over whether that scene when the dragon attacks the town... INSKEEP: (Laughter). DEGGANS: ...Actually made any sense. So let's check it out. Tyrion is played by Peter Dinklage, and he starts the argument. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \u201cGAME OF THRONES\u201d) PETER DINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) The moment the gates fell, the battle was over. KIT HARINGTON: (Jon Snow) She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky. DINKLAGE: (As Tyrion Lannister) And she burned down a city for it. Would you have done it? DEGGANS: Now, Jon knows he wouldn't have done it. So he decides that Dany is a dangerous tyrant who must be killed, which he does. INSKEEP: Well, maybe this really was an argument over the earlier episode... DEGGANS: (Laughter). INSKEEP: ...That accidentally got in the way that coffee cup accidentally got into one of the scenes. DEGGANS: There you go. There you go. INSKEEP: Who knows? DEGGANS: Exactly. INSKEEP: Now, I'm hearing you say what has been a common complaint about this season, that there's just too much plot crowded into too few episodes. DEGGANS: Yeah. I think part of the problem is that the last two seasons have had fewer episodes than the typical 10 that they used to have. In 2017, they aired seven episodes. And then these final six came almost two years after that. So maybe it feels kind of rushed because the setup episodes aired so long ago, and then we get the climax of the story now. I also think people expected to see the story of this heroine rising to free the oppressed. And instead, they saw this story of a rebel becoming a brutal dictator and getting killed, and that might have thrown fans off a little bit. INSKEEP: Has this series, in some fundamental way, changed TV? DEGGANS: I think it has. It's brought movie - epic-level filmmaking to television, and it proved that you could create a huge hit with it. Of course it's affected the culture. And people who haven't even watched the show - like you, Steve - know who these characters are. And it came along at a time when geek culture was taking over pop culture and rode that trend to massive success. And so we've seen now, you know, shows about zombies and superheroes. And now sword and sorcery characters are among the most popular shows and movies out there. And \"Game Of Thrones,\" I think, is the ultimate example of that in television. We'll see if any other series follow their lead. INSKEEP: Yeah. You can be a show nerd now and just get deeply, deeply involved in extraordinarily complex plots. DEGGANS: Of course. INSKEEP: Eric, thanks so much. DEGGANS: Always a pleasure. INSKEEP: That's NPR critic Eric Deggans. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 1:08 p.m. ET Missouri's Senate has passed a bill that would ban abortions at eight weeks of pregnancy or later, except in cases of medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. It's the latest in a series of sweeping abortion restrictions passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures aimed at pushing abortion challenges to the U.S. Supreme Court. The measure, which saw a series of changes before passing, will now return to the state House. If approved there, it would head to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Parson. \"Thanks to the leaders in the House and Senate, we have the opportunity to be one of the strongest pro-life states in the country,\" Parson said on Wednesday. The bill passed the Senate early Thursday morning by a 24-10 vote, as NPR member station St. Louis Public Radio reported. The text states that performing abortions in violation of the measure would be considered a felony. The legislation states that \"any person who knowingly performs or induces an abortion of an unborn child in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a class B felony, as well as subject to suspension or revocation of his or her professional license.\" Women who undergo abortions would not be prosecuted. In addition to having no exceptions for rape or incest, the bill also bans all abortions because of race, sex or a diagnosis of Down syndrome. As St. Louis Public Radio reported, Democrats succeeded in changing a provision that would have required in most cases that the second parent be notified before a minor has an abortion. \"Now, that second-parent notification only applies to the 'parent of a minor who has been awarded joint legal custody or joint physical custody' by a court,\" the member station writes. A previous version of the bill also would have prohibited abortions after heartbeat activity could be detected \u2014 which is about six weeks into a pregnancy. The Missouri Senate vote comes less than 24 hours after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law what is considered the most restrictive abortion law in the U.S. It bans nearly all abortions, at any stage of pregnancy. The only exceptions are when a woman's life is threatened or if there is a lethal fetal anomaly. Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio have also recently passed laws banning abortion after heartbeat activity is detected. Prior to the Missouri vote, Republican state Sen. Bob Onder said, \"The time for negotiations is over. Every provision of the Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act ... is a provision that would protect innocent human life, protect pregnancy care centers and ensure that they get the resources they need to perform their valuable mission, and measures to protect the health and safety of Missouri women.\" Asked about the possibility that Missouri women might seek less-safe forms of abortion, Republican Sen. Andrew Koenig told NPR's Here & Now, \"I think there's a low risk. ... The abortion rate is plummeting, even in places where there is access to abortion and the Constitution says that every person has a right to life and it should be protected.\" Some Missouri Senate Democrats spoke out against what has been called an \"extreme\" bill. \"This language four years ago would be unthinkable. But elections have consequences,\" state Sen. Lauren Arthur said, according to the member station. \"And with new Supreme Court justices, there is a renewed attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. And with that, there is a push in this Legislature to pass what I would characterize as very extreme legislation.\"",

            "article_content": "Gov. Kay Ivey has signed into law the nation's toughest anti-abortion law. It bans abortions except in cases of a serious health risk to the mother. There is no exception for rape or incest.  NOEL KING, HOST: In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey has signed into law the country's toughest anti-abortion law. It bans abortions except in cases of serious health risk to the woman. The law makes it a felony for doctors to perform abortions with a penalty of up to 99 years in prison. NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The Alabama law caps a crescendo of anti-abortion legislation that began last fall, when Brett Kavanaugh became the fifth hardcore conservative on the U.S. Supreme Court, replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired. Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, along with other now-retired justices appointed by Republican presidents, voted repeatedly to uphold the central part of Roe v. Wade. But Kennedy's retirement and Kavanaugh's appointment means there are now five conservative justices on the court whose records suggest they could someday reverse decisions that have stood for 46 years and protected a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. When? Well, probably not as soon as anti-abortion state legislatures would like, so states like Alabama are upping the ante. Florida State University law professor Mary Ziegler is author of the forthcoming book \"Abortion In America: A Legal History.\" MARY ZIEGLER: Anti-abortion legislators in Alabama hope to do this by kind of forcing the court's hand, in other words, giving them the bill that would be impossible to uphold without overturning Roe. I think whether that's the smartest strategy really remains to be seen, and I'm pretty skeptical. TOTENBERG: It's not just Alabama. In recent months, states all over the South and parts of the Midwest have enacted new restrictions on abortion, laws that clearly are unconstitutional under Roe's central holding. Among them are state laws that ban abortions any time after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat - that's usually around the sixth week of pregnancy, which is before many, perhaps even most women know they're pregnant. Even staunch abortion opponents like George Mason University law professor Helen Alvare acknowledge that these laws are unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedents. HELEN ALVARE: Very likely, these laws would fail. TOTENBERG: Meaning these laws would almost certainly be blocked by the lower courts, which are required to follow the Supreme Court's lead. And the Supreme Court might well decline to review those lower court decisions, leaving them intact. If Roe was to be overturned, most experts agree, it's more likely to happen at a slower pace. Moreover, the court doesn't like being in the nation's political crosshairs. Almost certainly, Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as other justices, would prefer not to have a direct challenge to Roe in the middle of the 2020 election campaign. All of the recently appointed Supreme Court justices have repeated the mantra at their confirmation hearings that deference to prior decisions is important because the law is built on the notion of following precedent. The idea is that people organize their lives, their businesses and their governance by relying on what the Supreme Court says the law is. Here's Justice David Souter in 1992 announcing part of an abortion decision and talking about the importance of following precedent, even if one might disagree with the original Roe v. Wade decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID SOUTER: A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the court's legitimacy and to the nation's commitment to the rule of law. TOTENBERG: The court even has rules for when precedent can be abandoned. And when the court decides to change course, it usually does so gradually over time. The court, for instance, took 16 years to switch directions and strike down legal segregation of the races, moving from law schools to colleges to secondary schools. The dismantling of abortion rights could begin next term in a case from Louisiana. NANCY NORTHUP: It is the same type of law that they struck down just three years ago. TOTENBERG: That's Nancy Northup, who heads the Center for Reproductive Rights. As she notes, while in the aftermath of the 2016 decision, all similar laws were being struck down by the lower courts, one appeals court did the opposite. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that doctors who perform abortions at clinics must also be accredited at nearby hospitals. So Northup and her group went to the Supreme Court. And by a 5-4 vote, the justices temporarily blocked the Louisiana law from going into effect. Chief Justice Roberts cast the fifth and decisive vote. Two things make that vote extra interesting. One, Roberts was on the other side and in dissent in the 2016 nearly identical case. And, two, the Louisiana case is still awaiting final decision. The court could summarily reverse the lower court next term, or it could begin the process of chipping away at Roe on a more gradual basis instead of in one fell swoop.

Almost a decade later, Weinstein and her husband are the parents of three active children \u2014 a boy and two girls. She's 48, living in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and working for a nonprofit. She still tears up when she talks about that diagnosis and the difficult decisions that surrounded it. Fearing a short and painful life for their baby, Weinstein and her husband chose to travel to Boulder, Colo., to end the pregnancy, at one of the few clinics in the country that offer third-trimester abortions. Weinstein has been speaking publicly about her experience for years. But she decided to tell her story again recently, amid renewed national debate over decisions like hers. \"I just don't understand why and how this is so front and center in the national debate,\" Weinstein said. \"I would have given anything to have been able to help our baby live if she could have lived. But she was going to be incapable of that.\" With two of President Trump's picks now on the U.S. Supreme Court, activists on both sides of the abortion debate have taken the fight to state legislatures this year. Fearing a short and painful life for their unborn baby, Dana Weinstein and her husband chose to travel to Boulder, Colo., to end the pregnancy at one of the few clinics in the country that offer third-trimester abortions.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fearing a short and painful life for their unborn baby, Dana Weinstein and her husband chose to travel to Boulder, Colo., to end the pregnancy at one of the few clinics in the country that offer third-trimester abortions. Anti-abortion-rights activists are hoping the court will reconsider, and perhaps overturn, the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In several states they've pushed through legislation banning the procedure from happening as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, hoping one of those bills will find its way to the Supreme Court. In more liberal states \u2014 among them Vermont, Massachusetts and Illinois \u2014 lawmakers are pushing in the other direction, working to enshrine abortion rights in state law or remove existing bans. A failed proposal in Virginia to remove some restrictions on later abortions sparked heated rhetoric earlier this year, including claims that supporters were condoning infanticide. \"What we're seeing in some states is a complete overreach on the part of the abortion lobby,\" said Mallory Quigley, with the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List. During his State of the Union address this year, President Trump weighed in on the issue, condemning a law passed in New York that removed some restrictions on the procedure, including later in pregnancy. \"These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world,\" Trump said. At the federal level, abortion-rights opponents also are promoting proposals in Congress aimed at restricting later procedures. A recent bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, to ban the procedure nationwide after 20 weeks, appears unlikely to go very far \u2014 but it provided an opportunity for a Senate hearing on the issue. Quigley said she believes opposition to abortion later in pregnancy will be a winning political issue for Republicans who oppose abortion rights. \"I think that the increased clarity that these types of debates are providing are going to help President Trump and pro-life senators, representatives, people on the ballot in 2020,\" she said. Polling suggests that while a majority of Americans support access to abortion earlier, most oppose it by the third trimester. The issue already is popping up on the 2020 campaign trail. At a recent campaign stop in Ohio, Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke was asked for his views on third-trimester abortions. He responded that it \"should be a decision the woman makes,\" before moving on. However polarizing third-trimester abortions might be as a political issue, as a medical procedure, they are relatively rare. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, a little more than 1 percent occur sometime after 21 weeks, which is still well within the second trimester. Dr. Warren Hern, who runs the clinic in Colorado where Weinstein traveled for her procedure, said many of the women he sees are in similar situations. \"These are tragic situations, and there's a tremendous sense of pain and loss and anguish for the woman and their family to end the pregnancy. So this is not something they want to do,\" Hern told NPR. \"They want to have a baby; they don't want to have an abortion.\" Some abortion-rights opponents argue that women facing life-ending fetal diagnoses should still go through with the pregnancy. \"If any other family member had a terminal diagnosis, there's no other circumstance where we would say, 'You know what, we should just kill them now; they don't have a chance for a meaningful life,' \" said Dr. Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN with the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \"And yet we do this with a fetus with a terminal diagnosis.\" Skop acknowledged that these are difficult decisions for pregnant women and their families and said she still advocates giving birth. \"The woman would have the opportunity to hold the baby, to say her goodbyes to the baby. And I think that's a much more humane situation for that woman and for that baby,\" Skop said. Skop said she worries that some women may seek abortions in the third trimester for other reasons, such as \"coercion\" by a former partner. For Tara Mendola, the decision to end a third-trimester pregnancy after a devastating fetal diagnosis felt complicated \u2014 medically and morally. \"It was going to be bad enough for my children not to come home with a baby,\" Mendola said. \"I really, really did not want to expose them to watching a sibling die immediately after they were born.\" Mendola, 34, is a freelance writer and editor from Brookline, Mass. She has two children and is expecting another baby soon. In an essay for the website Rumpus last year, Mendola wrote about the moral complexity she felt around that decision in 2017, and how her Jewish faith guided her. \"I think the alternate viewpoint on this is you can't escape suffering; it's the easy way out to have an abortion,\" Mendola said in an interview with NPR. \"It certainly was not easy ... but I think it was less traumatic for my family.\" Whatever the circumstances surrounding the decision, women seeking the procedure in the late second or third trimester have few options, said Jen Villavicencio, an OB-GYN and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \"She can't just show up at any clinic and decide to get an abortion. She's moving through tons and tons of barriers and hoops to be able to do this,\" Villavicencio said. That was true for Beth Vial, a college student from Portland, Ore., who didn't learn she was pregnant until she was about 26 weeks along, in the summer of 2017. \"I just [burst] out crying. I didn't believe them because I was told that wasn't a possibility for me,\" she said. Vial has some health issues \u2014 including a condition that disrupts her menstrual cycles \u2014 which can make conception unlikely and a pregnancy harder to diagnose. Doctors in Portland told her she was too far along for an abortion there. Vial was 22 at the time. She had recently ended her relationship and said she was sure she did not want to continue the pregnancy. \"I was already having a tough time in my life in a lot of other ways and it just felt like one more thing I really couldn't bear, or provide for, and I was panicked, I guess,\" Vial said. Vial found a clinic in New Mexico that told her they would end her pregnancy up until 28 weeks \u2014 the beginning of the third trimester. She scrambled, with the help of family, friends and a nonprofit that helps women pay for abortions, to pull together the fee of more than $10,000. \"[There were] a lot of people telling me how they felt about my situation without me asking \u2014 friends, family, strangers,\" Vial said. \"I mean, you tell someone that you're seven months pregnant and having an abortion, they've got some things to say.\" \"People I thought were my friends made it clear to me that they disapproved,\" she said. \"And that's fine. It wasn't changing my mind.\"",

            "article_content": "Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa conservative evangelical who heads a group called The Family Leader, has invited seven top Democratic presidential candidates to a July forum that is a typical stop for Republican candidates.\n                \n                    \n                    Paul Sancya/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa conservative evangelical who heads a group called The Family Leader, has invited seven top Democratic presidential candidates to a July forum that is a typical stop for Republican candidates. As Democratic presidential hopefuls work to position themselves as the candidate to unify the country and win over supporters of President Trump, an influential Iowa evangelical leader is inviting them to a forum on religion and politics traditionally reserved for Republicans ahead of Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. Bob Vander Plaats, president of The Family Leader, said he's sending invitations Friday to the top seven Democratic primary candidates in current polls. \"A lot of them are using faith as kind of a focal point, as a centerpiece,\" Vander Plaats said. \"So we'd like to find out what makes them tick.\" The invitees to the Family Leadership Summit, scheduled for July 12 near Des Moines, are California Sen. Kamala Harris; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. NPR reached out for comment to all seven campaigns, but most declined to respond on the record. A spokesman for Buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative Christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending. In a statement to NPR, a spokesman for O'Rourke said the former congressman would not accept the invitation. \"Vander Plaats and the Family Leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate speech on numerous occasions,\" Chris Evans said. \"They are the antithesis of the unifying, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that our campaign prides itself on in Iowa and across the country. We will not be participating in this forum.\" The event has loomed large in past Republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate Donald Trump famously criticized the late Republican Sen. John McCain's military service at the event. It's the first time The Family Leader has invited candidates actively seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. Vander Plaats acknowledged that the group \u2013 known for fighting same-sex marriage \u2013 is \"an unlikely venue\" for Democrats, but added, \"If you're going to cast a vision of unity, I think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.\" Vander Plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. Warren has made the case that her Christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. Harris opened her campaign by calling for \"unity\" and speaking of her \"faith in God\" during her announcement speech in January. Buttigieg has spoken openly about his Episcopal faith, his sexuality and his marriage to his husband Chasten \u2014 and has sparred with conservatives including Vice President Pence. This week, Franklin Graham, son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, questioned Buttigieg's claim to Christianity in a series of tweets, saying in part, \"As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.\" \"I agree with what Franklin tweeted; my guess is the base that is gonna show up at the Family Leadership Summit is gonna agree with what Franklin tweeted,\" Vander Plaats said. \"But why run from that conversation?\" Large majorities of Christians in the U.S. support same-sex marriage, though a majority of white evangelicals oppose it, according to a 2018 survey by PRRI. Vander Plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in Iowa, where the conservative Christian vote is a vital voting bloc for Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Vander Plaats sparked criticism \u2014 including from within the Republican Party \u2014 for asking candidates for the GOP nomination to sign a \"marriage vow\" promising fidelity to one's spouse, \"rejection of Sharia Islam\" and support for \"robust childbearing and reproduction,\" among other things. Mayor Buttigieg says he\u2019s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman\u2014not two men, not two women. 2/3 After widespread condemnation, The Family Leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery \"had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President.\" VanderPlaats also has been, at times, a critic of Trump's character and rhetoric \u2014 though he has largely supported Trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion. Daniel Hoffman-Zinnel, executive director of One Iowa, an LGBTQ rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to Democratic candidates. \"I would be a little surprised if any of them really took him up on this offer to engage in this conversation,\" Hoffman-Zinnel said. But he added that if a candidate like Buttigieg were to accept, it could open a door to important conversations. \"It potentially could show the audience of The Family Leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land,\" he said. \"So maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds \u2014 or at least get them to think more broadly.\" Hoffman-Zinnel added that if candidates accept the offer, Vander Plaats has \"a responsibility to create a very safe environment where folks feel comfortable being there.\" During a recent visit to Iowa, Hoffman-Zinnel noted, Buttigieg was met with anti-gay hecklers. At one stop, a protester dressed as Buttigieg pretended to whip a man dressed as Jesus Christ while he carried a wooden cross, while another protester dressed as the devil looked on. After those protests, The Family Leader said in a tweet, \"Shouting protests, namecalling are NOT how Christians are called to engage with our culture.\" Vander Plaats said that it \"would not be our intent\" for candidates to face a hostile audience and that he hopes to \"model civil conversation, even in areas where we have deep disagreements.\" \"You get points just for showing up,\" Vander Plaats said. \"And so I think our audience would embrace them.\" Jenna Ellis, an evangelical attorney and adviser to Trump's 2020 campaign, said she would like to see Democrats engage in a public conversation about faith. But she doesn't think many conservative white evangelicals would be won over. \"Their position is completely hypocritical to what it actually means to be a Christian,\" she said. \"If they're reaching out to evangelicals and saying, 'I am a Christian, but I support gay marriage; I am a Christian, but I support abortion,' that's being hypocritical.\" Despite the opposition Democrats may face in such a crowd, Christopher Hale, a faith adviser to President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said he hopes they will reach out to religious voters in \"surprising places.\" Hale noted that more than 80% of white evangelicals supported Trump in 2016 \u2014 and evangelicals make up a significant share of voters in many key Midwestern states. \"I don't know a pathway forward for a Democratic candidate to win back the states we lost in 2016 without winning a higher percentage of the evangelical vote,\" Hale said. Hale believes the Democratic Party has largely failed to speak the language of religious voters but says some of the 2020 candidates are making overtures. \"Democratic candidates oftentimes talk about Jefferson, and Madison, and founding ideals \u2013 but we need candidates that can talk about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\" Hale said, referring to the first four books of the Christian New Testament. \"A Democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.\"",

Cory Booker, D-N.J., answers questions during a presidential forum held by She The People in Houston on Wednesday. Updated at 6:05 p.m. ET Eight Democratic presidential candidates faced the same basic question today in Houston: Why should women of color vote for them? The first-ever She The People Presidential Forum \u2014 organized by and centered on questions from women of color \u2014 served as a repeated reminder of the key role that minority women play in Democratic politics. \"Women of color voters in this country are 20 million strong. Our votes matter,\" Democratic operative Leah Daughtry warned the candidates. \"You put us last on your list; we put you last on our list.\" \"Remember: We're a powerful voting block,\" She The People founder Aimee Allison said at the beginning of the event. \"Our hope is to advance a national conversation to help voters distinguish which candidates stand with and stand for women of color in our communities. And let me tell you something: The candidate that does that best and most consistently will win the nomination and the White House in 2020.\" The questions put forward to California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and others made it clear that many women of color may not be won over by campaigns tailoring their message toward moderate and independent white voters in swing states. Topics included abortion rights, gentrification, voter suppression, transgender rights, racial disparities in criminal sentencing and police shootings of unarmed black men, among others. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker repeated his pledge to choose a woman as a running mate, should he become the Democratic nominee. \"Women of color can trust me,\" he said. \"My fights have been fights that have shown who I am and shown my loyalty.\" Amid the policy deep dives, every candidate faced the same basic question: Why should women of color back them in a field about to top 20 declared Democrats? The question created a couple of moments of awkwardness for some of the men in the field, including former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who paused for a moment before answering, \"It's not something I'm owed, not something I expect. It's something I fully hope to earn.\" Most candidates answered the question by asking the crowd of activists to look to their track records. \"I have dedicated my time in public service to making sure that people like my grandmother and mother can do better,\" said Castro, and have \"delivered for communities that were vulnerable, that were struggling.\" Repeating a promise first rolled out at a CNN town hall this week, Harris vowed to take \"strong executive action\" on gun control within the first 100 days of her administration, if Congress hasn't passed gun measures first. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, told the forum that when police are being investigated for shootings, \"I think the investigation should not be done by the police department where the officer worked. You have to have a fair process when you investigate these cases.\" The cheering Houston auditorium underscored just how hungry Democrats' progressive activists are for detailed policy plans that, up until recently, would have been viewed as far too liberal for a candidate to run for president on: single-payer health care; legalized marijuana; reparations for slavery. As the increasingly large candidate field has, for the most part, shifted left en masse to appeal to these voters, the moderate wing of the party has worried whether Democrats will be able to appeal to the Midwestern swing voters who put President Trump in the White House. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, expected to launch Thursday, will be centered on the bet that most Democratic voters want a more centrist candidate. But speaking to the forum, Klobuchar argued it is possible for candidates to satisfy progressives and win back independents. \"I can't pretend to be in your shoes. I'm in one of your shoes, as the first woman in many of the jobs that I've had. And I know what it's like to be in the room when people aren't taking you seriously,\" she said. \"What I can tell you is that my entire life I have fought for justice.\"",

            "article_content": "The anti-abortion, Christian movie Unplanned is in theaters at a time when there's renewed debate about abortion. The film's creators accuse Twitter of suppressing their account.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Conservatives who say they have been censored by tech companies are going to be on Capitol Hill today. Among those testifying at the Senate hearing is one of the creators of an anti-abortion Christian film that recently opened in theaters nationwide. It is called \"Unplanned,\" and it tells the story of a former Planned Parenthood clinic director from Texas who is now an anti-abortion rights activist. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"UNPLANNED\") ASHLEY BRATCHER: (As Abby Johnson) Hi. My name is Abby Johnson. I used to be the director of this clinic. I quit because my conscience wouldn't let me stay. MARTIN: It's a small-budget film, and it is exceeding expectations at the box office. NPR's Sarah McCammon joins us now to talk about the movie and its impact. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Just introduce us to the story here in \"Unplanned.\" MCCAMMON: Well, it's based on the autobiography of Abby Johnson, and we just heard that clip. She says that in 2009, after having worked at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan, Texas, for several years, she witnessed an abortion procedure that led to a change of heart about abortion. And this film has earned already close to $13 million, which isn't bad for a film that just had a budget of $6 million. It's been in the box office for a couple of weeks, and it's stayed in the top 10. And, Rachel, Abby Johnson, whose character's portrayed in the film, she now leads an organization called And Then There Were None that encourages other clinic workers to leave their jobs. Now, about this hearing - anti-abortion activists accuse Twitter of censoring the film's account by temporarily blocking it a couple weeks ago. Twitter says the account was mistakenly blocked by an automated system but was put back online right away as soon as that mistake was brought to their attention. MARTIN: And who's behind the film? I mean, who are the producers? Who's making this film happen? MCCAMMON: Right. Some of the creators include the same team behind another relatively high-profile Christian movie that some folks might have heard of called \"God's Not Dead.\" And it got some funding from some prominent conservatives. Also, it's been getting a lot of support from abortion rights opponents who would like to see more restrictions on the procedure and would like to see all public funding to groups like Planned Parenthood cut off. And its supporters include Vice President Mike Pence, who's tweeted support for it. MARTIN: The film portrays Planned Parenthood in a negative light, I think it's fair to say. What's the organization - how are they responding to this? Are they responding? MCCAMMON: Well, Planned Parenthood has disputed some of Abby Johnson's claims for a long time. She wrote an autobiography by the same name, \"Unplanned.\" And they dispute the circumstances that led to her resignation as well as the portrayal of some of Planned Parenthood's facilities and procedures. I talked to a former vice president of Planned Parenthood who now runs a communications firm, Elizabeth Toledo. She describes this film as propaganda. ELIZABETH TOLEDO: It's a drama. It's not a documentary. It's not a real-life account of what actually happens at Planned Parenthood or any medical provider. MCCAMMON: And Toledo says she believes the timing of the film is meant to tap into the renewed political battles we've been seeing around abortion rights. MARTIN: Well, is this about politics? Because, you know, the election, 2020, is around the corner, and Christians in particular have long felt like Hollywood has just ignored them, that that is not a space for them, that pop culture is not a place where they can get their political views out there. MCCAMMON: That's right. And so there is a lot of excitement, a lot of grassroots excitement, among church groups, conservative groups, again, conservative leaders about this film. And this is out at a moment where abortion rights are sort of - there's a battle about them being waged in a lot of state legislatures that was sort of sparked by the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who, of course, has tilted the court to the right. There's a lot of - a lot of eyes are watching what will happen with abortion rights as some of these restrictive measures that have passed in state legislatures in recent weeks, including banning abortion as early as six weeks, as those work their way through the court system, potentially to the Supreme Court. And it is, of course, coming up in the 2020 presidential campaign. President Trump has used it as a - the issue of abortion as a rallying cry. So it's not clear, Rachel, whether this film, \"Unplanned,\" will change any minds about abortion, but it is certainly rallying some members of the Republican base at a key time. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon for us this morning. Sarah, thanks. We appreciate it. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Bill Weld told an audience in New Hampshire that he is launching a 2020 exploratory committee. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said Friday he is thinking about challenging President Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. Weld, a moderate Republican, was twice elected governor. He supports abortion rights and was an early proponent of gay rights. He resigned his post as governor after being offered the ambassadorship to Mexico, but the nomination stalled in the Senate after opposition from other Republicans. Weld then ran as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 2016 on a ticket with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. According to The Washington Post, Weld told the Politics & Eggs breakfast in Bedford, N.H., on Friday that Trump \"acts like a schoolyard bully\" and that Republicans in Washington who support him \"exhibit all the symptoms of Stockholm syndrome.\" \"We don't need six more years of the antics we have seen,\" Weld said. Weld faces an uphill battle in taking on Trump, who remains popular with Republican voters. He also isn't the only Republican who has mused about challenging the president. But a primary challenge, even if unsuccessful, could conceivably weaken Trump, as past primary challenges hurt George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford, both of whom fought primary opponents before losing the general election for another term.",

There has been no shortage of reaction to former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's declaration that he is seriously considering running \u2014 as an independent \u2014 for president. Democrats have warned that he would get President Trump re-elected if he goes through with it. Trump seemed to be baiting him into running, tweeting that he doesn't have the \"guts\" to do it. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod tweeted that it would be such a \"gift\" to Trump that the president should give Starbucks free rent in Trump Tower. For his part, Schultz believes there is an opening in the middle. \"I can't think of anything that is a more quintessential expression of our democracy than providing the American people with a choice that doesn't have to be binary between a Republican and Democrat,\" Schultz told NPR's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Tuesday on Morning Edition. Schultz said he wants nothing more than for Trump to be defeated, but he fears Democrats will nominate someone too far to the left. \"If there is a choice between President Trump and a progressive, liberal-minded person on the Democratic side, it would kill me to see President Trump be re-elected,\" Schultz, a \"lifelong Democrat,\" said in his interview on NPR. \"And I believe that's what would take place.\" Schultz is afraid Democrats will nominate someone radical, but what he's proposing, of course, is pretty radical, too. There are lots of hurdles to an independent bid for the president. And there are reasons why George Washington, the country's first president, was the first and only \"independent\" to serve as president. The political parties are entrenched in the United States, and it's not just because of money and power. It's also because the 12th Amendment of the Constitution requires a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes to be president. (If they don't, in short, the House decides.) That American political structure lends itself to a binary choice; it's much easier to get a majority when picking between two than among more than that. Schultz makes the case that some 40 percent or more of the country identifies as independent. \"Did you also read that of 42 percent of the electorate, 42 percent, 30 percent are registered independents and 12 percent currently affiliate themselves with the independents?\" Schultz stressed on Morning Edition. \"Also, I believe that there's never been more dissatisfaction, certainly in my lifetime, with both parties.\" While it's certainly true that both parties are publicly viewed with disregard, it's also misleading to suggest that 4 in 10 voters are truly swing voters in America or that they are potentially winnable as a single block. One study, for example, found that about 11 percent of people who voted for Trump in 2016 had voted for President Barack Obama four years earlier and that about 4 percent of voters for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 had voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. That's millions of people, but hardly nearly half the electorate. Party identification remains one of the strongest indicators of how someone will vote, political scientists have found. \"The misconception around his campaign is there's this big proportion looking for a third candidate,\" said Samara Klar, a professor at Arizona State University, who studies independents. She co-authored the book Independent Politics. Klar notes that only about 7 percent of people who identify as independents truly don't like either party. About 90 percent, she said, \"almost never don't vote for that party\" that they do like or with which they align ideologically. The parties are viewed about as poorly as they've ever been viewed, and few Americans see the country as headed in the right direction. That certainly lends itself to the idea that there's an opening for a third party. But \"independents\" are not a monolith; they don't collectively agree on the issues. A Pew Research Center political typology released in 2017 showed that Americans are more cleanly divided into eight political segments. Pew noted at the time: \"Nearly a year after Donald Trump was elected president, the Republican coalition is deeply divided on such major issues as immigration, America's role in the world and the fundamental fairness of the U.S. economic system. \"The Democratic coalition is largely united in staunch opposition to President Trump. Yet, while Trump's election has triggered a wave of political activism within the party's sizable liberal bloc, the liberals' sky-high political energy is not nearly as evident among other segments in the Democratic base. And Democrats also are internally divided over U.S. global involvement, as well as some religious and social issues.\" Schultz argues that the biggest problem facing the country is the ballooning national debt. That's something Ross Perot trumpeted in his unsuccessful, but attention-grabbing, bids for the presidency 1992 and 1996. Perot, a lifelong Republican oil man, was able to get almost 1 in 5 votes in 1992, which some believe, cost George H.W. Bush re-election; although not everyone agrees. Our first president, George Washington, was also the last to not be officially affiliated with a political party.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Our first president, George Washington, was also the last to not be officially affiliated with a political party. Schultz believes Democrats want to go too far on health care, saying the country can't afford free health care for all. (Not all Democratic candidates are proposing that.) But Schultz also supports the Affordable Care Act, is critical of Trump's immigration policies and is in favor of same-sex marriage and abortion rights. That doesn't cleanly fit with any party \u2014 or with any of the groups within the Pew typology. \"Running as independent, you don't have a natural base,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was an adviser on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign and who has worked for the Republican National Committee. \"He is literally starting at zero compared to a Democrat or a Republican, both of whom are going to start at around 35 percent in the polls. And so he's got a very low floor, and frankly a lower ceiling, because you've got about 70 percent of the country that's always going to vote for one or one of the two major parties.\" As many hurdles that exist, is Schultz the kind of candidate who can galvanize enough voters to his side? He certainly has enough money to undertake the difficult task of getting on the ballot in all 50 states and be a threat. And, some argue, there is an opening for someone who can exploit it well. \"You can't discount an independent candidate at this stage in American politics,\" said Luis Miranda, a Democratic consultant and a former communications director at the Democratic National Committee. \"You have a much weaker party system today\" than in the 1990s when Perot had a degree of success. Miranda argues, \"It's as diffuse a landscape as it has ever been in terms of money, in terms of participation, in terms of party loyalty. ... You could see a credible independent candidate who, if the parties get too far to the extremes, runs a credible centrist campaign.\" Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the center-left Washington think tank Third Way, disagrees and thinks a Schultz campaign would backfire and help Trump to re-election. \"The opposition to Donald Trump is as solid as granite,\" Kessler said. \"The only thing that can splinter it is if more than one candidate can lay claim to that block, and that's what an independent can do that is running from the center.\" In this rocky period of American politics, anything is possible, and if Schultz runs, this debate won't be theoretical.",

With Democrats now in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, it might appear that the fight over abortion rights has become a standoff. After all, abortion-rights supporters within the Democratic caucus will be in a position to block the kind of curbs that Republicans advanced over the past two years when they had control of Congress. But those on both sides of the debate insist that won't be the case. Despite the Republicans' loss of the House, anti-abortion forces gained one of their most sought-after victories in decades with the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Now, with a stronger possibility of a 5-4 majority in favor of more restrictions on abortion, anti-abortion groups are eager to get test cases to the high court. And that is just the beginning. \"Our agenda is very focused on the executive branch, the coming election and the courts,\" says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion organization Susan B. Anthony List. She says the new judges nominated to lower federal courts by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate, reflect \"a legacy win.\" The Republican majority in the U.S. Senate is expected to continue to fill the lower federal courts with judges who have been vetted by anti-abortion groups. Meanwhile, abortion-rights supporters believe they, too, can make strides in 2019. \"We expect 25 states to push policies that will expand or protect abortion access,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, who took over as president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in November. If the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade is eventually overturned, states will decide whether abortion will be legal, and under what circumstances. Here are four venues where the debate over reproductive health services for women will play out in 2019: Congress The Republican-controlled Congress proved unable in 2017 or 2018 to realize one of the anti-abortion movement's biggest goals: evicting Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for people who have low incomes. Abortion opponents don't want Planned Parenthood to get federal funds because, in many states, it functions as an abortion provider (albeit with non-federal resources). Though Republicans have a slightly larger majority in the new Senate, that majority will still be well short of the 60 votes needed to block any Democratic filibuster. Because Democrats generally support Planned Parenthood, the power shift in the House makes the chances for defunding the organization even slimmer, much to the dismay of abortion opponents. \"We're pretty disappointed that, despite having a Republican Congress for two years, Planned Parenthood wasn't defunded,\" says Kristan Hawkins of the anti-abortion group Students for Life of America. \"This was one of President Trump's promises to the pro-life community, and he should have demanded it,\" she says. Another likely area of dispute will be the future of various anti-abortion restrictions that are routinely part of annual spending bills. These include the so-called Hyde Amendment, which bans most federal abortion funding in Medicaid and other health programs in the Department of Health and Human Services. Also disputed: restrictions on grants to international groups that support abortion rights, and limits on abortion in federal prisons and in the military. However, now that they have a substantial majority in the House, \"Democrats are on stronger grounds to demand and expect clean appropriations bills,\" without many of those riders, says Wen of Planned Parenthood. While Senate Republicans are likely to eventually add those restrictions back, \"they will have to go through the amendment process,\" Wen says. And that could bring added attention to the issues. With control of House committees, Democrats can also set agendas, hold hearings and call witnesses to talk about issues they want to promote. \"Even if the bills don't come to fruition, putting these bills in the spotlight, forcing lawmakers to go on the record \u2014 that has value,\" Wen says. The Trump administration While Congress is unlikely to agree on reproductive health legislation in the coming two years, the Trump administration is still pursuing an aggressive anti-abortion agenda \u2014 using its power of regulation. A final rule is expected any day that would cut off a significant part of Planned Parenthood's federal funding \u2014 not from Medicaid but from the Title X Family Planning Program. Planned Parenthood annually provides family planning and other health services that don't involve abortion to about 40 percent of the program's 4 million patients. The administration proposal, unveiled last May, would effectively require Planned Parenthood to physically separate facilities that perform abortions from those that provide federally funded services, and would bar abortion referrals for women who have unintended pregnancies. Planned Parenthood has said it is likely to sue over the new rules when they are finalized. The Supreme Court upheld in 1991 a similar set of restrictions that were never implemented. Abortion opponents are also pressing to end federal funding for any research that uses tissue from aborted fetuses \u2014 a type of research that was authorized by Congress in the early 1990s. \"It's very important we get to a point of banning [fetal tissue research] and pursuing aggressively ethical alternatives,\" says Dannenfelser. State capitols Abortion opponents having pushed through more than 400 separate abortion restrictions on the state level since 2010, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights think tank. In 2018 alone, according to Guttmacher, 15 states adopted 27 new limits on abortion and family planning. \"Absolutely some [of these are] an exercise in what they can get to go up to the Supreme Court,\" says Destiny Lopez, co-director of the abortion-rights group All* Above All. \"Sort of 'Let's throw spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks.' \" But 2018 also marked a turning point. It was the first time in years that the number of state actions supporting abortion rights outnumbered the restrictions. For example, Massachusetts approved a measure to repeal a pre-Roe ban on abortion that would take effect if Roe were overturned. Washington state passed a law to require abortion coverage in insurance plans that offer maternity coverage. Federal courts The fate of all these policies will be decided eventually by the courts. In fact, several state-level restrictions are already in the pipeline to the Supreme Court and could serve as a vehicle to curtail or overturn Roe v. Wade. Among the state laws closest to triggering such a review is an Indiana law banning abortion for gender selection or genetic flaws, among other things. Also awaiting final legal say is an Alabama law banning the most common second-trimester abortion method \u2014 dilation and evacuation.

            "article_content": "Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. One hundred twenty-seven. That's how many women will be in Congress this year, up from 110 in the previous Congress. It's a jump that's simultaneously so big and so small. On the one hand, there are 15 percent more women in this Congress than there were last session. There are now a record number of women of color in the House. There are also a slew of firsts: Congress will get its first Native American women, Muslim women and youngest female member ever. On the other hand, this year's record-setting number of women will bring the share of women Congress members up from 20.6 percent ... to 23.7 percent. Overwhelmingly, these women are in the House. While the number of Senate women will increase by two, the number of House women will grow by 15 compared with those elected in the last Congress. Here's a series of charts to help you understand exactly how big a deal that change in the House is and what it might mean for how the new Congress does its job. Almost entirely Democratic women A defining feature of the record-setting wave of women coming into Congress is that it is nearly entirely Democratic. While there are 35 Democratic women freshmen in the House, there will be only one on the Republican side: Carol Miller of West Virginia. Altogether, the number of Democratic women in the House will increase by 25 this year, while the number of Republican women will decline by 10. Two (interrelated) things happened in 2018: Voters elected a blue wave, and that blue wave had a lot of women in it. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Starting in January 2017, it was abundantly clear that Democratic women were furious that Donald Trump had been elected president. That helped push a record number of Democratic women to run for office. That led to a record number of Democratic women nominees and ultimately a record-setting freshman class of them. About 30 percent of Republican men who left their seats (either through retirement, resignation or defeat) have been replaced by Democratic women. And almost half of Republican women who have departed were replaced by Democratic women. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swears in members on Thursday at the Capitol, including a record number of women in the House of Representatives.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Nancy Pelosi swears in members on Thursday at the Capitol, including a record number of women in the House of Representatives. So now, as the new Congress starts, there are only 13 Republican women in this House, down from 23 last session. There are a lot of reasons for this. There are relatively few Republican women in state legislatures, for example, and a lower share of women are Republicans than Democrats. But there's also a sense within the party that they may need to adopt different policies. Former Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, expounded upon the need for more contraceptive availability as an example at a December panel hosted by Politico. \"I mean seriously, I am pro-life. I'm unapologetically pro-life. Why not give women the option of having their choices when it comes to health care before they have to choose between keeping a life and ending a life?\" she said. \"And the fact that I've got more issues with Republican men on this is absolutely absurd to me.\" Aside from that, when it comes to promoting female candidates, Republicans lack a massive outside spending machine like Democrats have in Emily's List. In addition, the Republicans' House fundraising arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, doesn't participate in primaries, as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee does. Some in the GOP, like New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, believe that boosting women in primaries is essential to ultimately boost GOP women's congressional numbers. That's why, in December, Stefanik said she was stepping down from her recruitment post at the NRCC \u2014 to focus on using her own leadership PAC to help women in her party win. More bipartisan? Not necessarily There's a conventional wisdom in Washington that women are more bipartisan than men \u2014 that once they're in Congress, they will be more willing to make compromise legislation. There's anecdotal evidence of this. Women were instrumental in ending the 2013 shutdown. Women like Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski have a reputation for being open to crossing party lines on key votes. It's a particularly seductive idea at a time when partisan rancor in Washington seems to regularly hit ever-new highs. But it's not necessarily true, according to recent research (and as NPR reported last summer). A late 2018 study found that while women on the Hill are more sociable, in the sense that they participate more in interparty congressional events like Secret Santas, those lawmakers remain first and foremost partisan when it comes to their votes, amendments and even official travel. Across those measures, there are virtually no gaps between women and men. Step back from the data, and this conclusion looks pretty logical. After all, the number of women in Congress has been increasing slowly over the past couple of decades, a time when polarization has also increased. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. That said, research has shown that women do legislate differently than men do. There is evidence that women and men introduce bills in different issue areas \u2014 women more often in education, health, and civil rights and liberties; men more often in agriculture and energy. (That same study also found that those bills in \"women's issues\" areas tend to pass less often than other bills, particularly when sponsored by women.) In addition, women in the minority party have been shown to keep their bills alive longer than men in the minority do. All of which is to say that the bills on Congress' docket next year may well look different than usual. As for lawmakers' willingness to compromise on those bills? Don't count on it. Loading...

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., speaks during a rally for presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders in Queens, N.Y., on Saturday. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York officially endorsed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at a rally in Queens, N.Y., on Saturday. Addressing an estimated crowd of more than 25,000 supporters, Ocasio-Cortez said she was proud to join the Vermont senator in bringing \"a working-class revolution to the ballot box of the United States of America.\" Sanders, who was holding his first campaign event since having a heart attack earlier this month, told the crowd, \"I am back.\" He called Ocasio-Cortez an inspiration to young people across the country \"who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.\" The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez comes at a pivotal time for the Sanders campaign. While Sanders raised more money than any other candidate in the Democratic primary field last quarter, he has struggled to gain traction in polls. Sanders now trails former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in most polls. Even before Sanders' heart attack, \"the conventional wisdom was that the Democratic primary was essentially winnowing down to a two-person contest between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren,\" NPR's Asma Khalid recently reported. In an effort to energize the campaign, Ocasio-Cortez emphasized her personal story at Saturday's rally and said she is supporting Sanders because he fought for progressive policies, even when they were not politically popular. \"When I was a baby, my family relied on Planned Parenthood for prenatal care,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Then, Bernie Sanders fought for me. When I was growing up and education was being gutted for kids in the 'wrong ZIP code,' Bernie Sanders fought for us. When I was a child that relied on CHIP [Children's Health Insurance Program] so that I could see a doctor, Bernie Sanders fought for a single-payer health care system ... Bernie Sanders did not do these things because they were popular, and that's what we need to remember.\" The two politicians \u2014 who both describe themselves as Democratic socialists and both support \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal \u2014 spoke with NPR's Michel Martin following the event. Sanders, who had two stents inserted in his heart to clear a blocked artery, said he is \"feeling great.\" Ocasio-Cortez said calling Sanders when he was in the hospital after his heart attack was a \"gut check\" moment for her. \"I feel decided,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It would be dishonest of me not to let folks know how I feel about this race.\" When asked why she chose to support Sanders over Warren, a progressive female candidate, Ocasio-Cortez said her decision was less about the gender of the candidate and more about \"feminist values in the campaign.\" \"For me, this is not about 'Why not any other candidate?' \" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"The fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.\" Earlier this week, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota also announced her endorsement of Sanders. Ocasio-Cortez and Omar make up one half of \"the squad,\" a group of four first-term congresswomen who have attracted attention for their progressive politics \u2014 and for President Trump's racist tweets about them. As for whether an endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a district that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016, would move the needle in a general election, Sanders said, \"it's not just Alexandria's district \u2014 it's what she is fighting for.\" \"If you look at the ideas that she is fighting for, it will resonate in every state in this country,\" Sanders said, citing her support for progressive policies on climate change and health care and an increase to the minimum wage. Sanders also said he believes his campaign does not have to choose between persuading undecided voters on the issues and energizing his existing supporters on the far left. \"It's all of that and more,\" he said, adding that \"virtually every credibly national poll\" currently has him defeating President Trump in a general election. Sanders does have an edge on Trump in polls, and a September NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that his favorability rating among Democrats had increased to 66%. But when looking at the broader electorate, the poll found that just 38% of the electorate had a positive view of him, with 55% of voters saying they have an unfavorable view. Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that she is encouraged by Sanders' polling and added that her \"passion as an organizer is in talking to people who don't vote.\" \"One of the things that's so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it's far larger than a presidential campaign,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"This is about creating a mass movement.\"",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood has removed its president less than a year after she was appointed as the organization's president. Leana Wen wrote on Twitter that she was ousted during a \"secret meeting.\"  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What really happened at Planned Parenthood? The reproductive health organization is forever in the middle of a white-hot battle over abortion rights, and now it is in the middle of a leadership change. Dr. Leana Wen is out as president. People who follow the news may think, wait, didn't Planned Parenthood just recently get a new president? And you wouldn't be wrong because Dr. Wen did not serve all that long. NPR's Sarah McCammon covers reproductive rights and joins us now. Good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How does Wen say she was ousted? MCCAMMON: Well, first of all, you're right. She was just there about 10 months, and she said on Twitter that she was pushed out after a secret meeting. She said that came after what she described as good faith negotiations over her exit. So she was planning to leave, but she didn't expect to leave in this way. She released a long letter after that in which she says she was on her way out over philosophical differences with Planned Parenthood. At one point, she said she'd come there to work on a broad range of health care issues but that, quote, \"the new board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.\" And Wen did go on to say that she understands the reasons for that shift given the political moment, and she'll do everything she can to ensure a smooth transition. INSKEEP: Well, that's interesting because it suggests that there is a much larger issue at play here, that there's a big question about how this organization wants to confront the moment when many states are cracking down on abortion rights. What is Planned Parenthood saying about why she left? MCCAMMON: There's been no official explanation from Planned Parenthood other than just to say she's out, has been replaced on an interim basis. And they thanked her for her service, wished her well. But I've spoken to several people close to the organization, Steve, who tell me a number of things. They say there were issues with Wen's leadership style from the beginning, that she wasn't a great fit with the organization. A lot of key leaders and other staff left Planned Parenthood after Wen came in. And another factor I've been told is Wen's background as a public health official and a physician. Sources say she seemed more comfortable at times talking about a broader range of health issues than advocating for abortion rights, which she sort of indicates in her letter. INSKEEP: Yeah. MCCAMMON: And this, again, is at a time when reproductive rights advocates feel very much under attack. I did reach out to Wen's team, her communications team, for a response. They released a statement to NPR that said she was making big changes, that she'd been hired to realign the organization and saying the board essentially knew who she was and should have stood by her. And they also referred me to several former, you know, professional colleagues and associates who praised her work and leadership style. INSKEEP: Well, it is fair to ask. I mean, she was only hired 10 months ago. A lot has happened in 10 months. But it was approximately the same political moment. Why did they think in the beginning that she was the right person? MCCAMMON: Right. Well, I've been told, again, by sources close to the organization that when she replaced Cecile Richards, the former president who was a longtime president, high-profile advocate for abortion rights, hiring a physician was seen as a good way to position abortion as part of the larger battle over health care, not just a political issue. But at the same time, this source said Wen and a lot of staff at Planned Parenthood saw Wen as essentially shying away from the abortion issue. And people at Planned Parenthood, many of them are very proud to advocate for that. And there were some frustrations, I'm told, about her willingness and ability to do that, again, in this moment. INSKEEP: Is this an awkward moment for the organization to be casting about for new leadership? MCCAMMON: I would say so, given the challenges we've seen to abortion rights at the state level, potential Supreme Court battles looming in the next couple of years. Heading into a presidential election, this is a pivotal time. There are a lot of battles on both sides of this issue right now. And I think it says a lot that the organization has chosen to so quickly replace its leader at this moment. That does tell you a lot about what was going on under the surface. The interim leader is Alexis McGill Johnson, a longtime Planned Parenthood board member. I'm told she's well-liked. But she's going to have a lot of challenges ahead, and so will the new permanent director, whenever that person is chosen. INSKEEP: Really interesting story. Thanks for your reporting on it, Sarah.

            "article_content": "Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right by Anne Nelson Hardcover, 394 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? It's always election season in America, which means that even people who only casually keep up with politics are bound to know the names of some of the organizations that influence our democracy. You don't have to be a political junkie to know the names of the NRA, Institute for Legislative Action, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, American Civil Liberties Union or the Club for Growth PAC. But unless you breathe politics like it's oxygen, you're unlikely to have heard of a conservative organization called the Council for National Policy. The group isn't a political action committee; rather, it's a 501(c)(3) educational foundation that dates back to the first Reagan administration. And as Anne Nelson writes in her fascinating new book, Shadow Network, it's had an outsize effect on the modern American political landscape. Nelson seeks to document the connections between \"the manpower and media of the Christian right with the finances of Western plutocrats and the strategy of right-wing Republican political operatives.\" Many of these connections, she writes, were made possible through the CNP, whose members have included such familiar names as Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, the Christian Coallition's first executive director Ralph Reed and NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Nelson traces the group from its founding in 1981 \"by a small group of archconservatives who realized that the tides of history had turned against them\" \u2014 specifically, activist Morton Blackwell, commentator Paul Weyrich and direct-mail pioneer Richard Viguerie. (Other founding members included Phyllis Schlafly and Left Behind author Tim LaHaye.) The CNP's structure, Nelson writes, was similar to a group called the Council on Foreign Relations (of which Nelson herself is a member) \u2014 like that group, the CNP organized as a tax-exempt educational institution, although it was \"designed to serve as the engine for a radical political agenda.\" The CNP soon realized it could reach prospective voters through the media that many of its members owned. That included the radio broadcasting company Salem Media Group, co-founded by CNP members Stuart W. Epperson and Edward G. Atsinger; and would later include online publications like the Daily Caller. The programming of these various outlets, Nelson writes, \"is not uniform, but it harmonizes.\" Driving the success of the CNP was, Nelson claims, anxiety brought about by demographic changes. In the past century, more Americans have moved to cities, and fewer citizens are white and Protestant. \"The mores of the new America created an unbearable tension,\" Nelson writes. \"These demographic trends \u2014 and the anxiety they provoked \u2014 contributed to the forces that brought Trump to power.\" But you can't convert anxiety into votes without cash, and Nelson does an excellent job following the money. She profiles some of the group's funders, both past and present, including businessman Foster Friess and controversial Texas oil heir T. Cullen Davis. Perhaps most prominent among the donors, though, are two families: the DeVos clan (\"CNP royalty\") and the Koch brothers, who donated widely to groups headed by CNP members. Nelson follows the CNP through the 2016 election, in which most of its members, initially horrified by Trump, supported Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. But their distaste for Trump was no match for their fear and hatred of Hillary Clinton. \"[T]he Republicans fell into line as soon as Trump's nomination was confirmed, and the CNP media complex responded to a central command,\" Nelson writes. Shadow Network is bound to appeal to those whose interest in politics run deep, but it's not so inside baseball that lay readers will be stuck in the weeds. Nelson doesn't assume that her readers will be intimate with the ins and outs of how money influences politics, but she also never condescends to her audience \u2014 she does an admirable job providing context for the CNP and groups like it, and introducing readers to some of the lesser-known names with ties to the organization. Nelson is not a neutral political observer, nor does she claim to be, which means Shadow Network will appeal much more to progressive and moderate readers than to conservative ones. She doesn't hide her animus for what she calls the \"shrewd, remarkable and sometimes unscrupulous characters\" who have made their mark on the American right, but she never descends into conspiracy theorizing \u2014 she makes her case soberly and with a historian's scrupulousness. Shadow Network is a fascinating book, and readers curious about how the American right gets its message out will find much to admire in it. It also serves as a grim warning for progressives who might already be counting their chickens before the 2020 election: \"The CNP and its partners have spent over four decades studying their audience and mastering the written and unwritten rules of American politics,\" Nelson writes. \"Its moralists have little regard for the rights of minorities; its financiers lack concern for social welfare; and its strategists have no respect for majority rule. If it is fully realized, their combination of theocracy and plutocracy could result in a dystopia for those who fall outside their circle.\"",

Hungary's government is pushing back against European Union assertions that it is putting democracy in danger, says Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. The fierce loyalist of hard-line, right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban is also calling the U.S. intention to restart Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in the country an \"insult.\" Run by the independent federal U.S. Agency for Global Media, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's mission is to broadcast uncensored news and open debate in countries where press freedoms are scant and repression is growing. Szijjarto is adamant that the move is unwarranted. \"It's fake news about Hungary. There is absolutely a media freedom in [the country],\" he tells NPR's Noel King. Szijjarto, who spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, asserts that the largest outlets in the country are critical of the government. But as NPR has reported, the Orban government and its allies have taken control of the majority of Hungary's media, which routinely amplify the government line. The Orban administration has portrayed itself as a defender of Europe's borders and what it considers to be a Christian way of life. It staunchly opposes EU plans to resettle hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking asylum in Europe each year. Yet the country is facing a worsening labor shortage. Hungary could lose more than 12% of its population by 2050, according to a United Nations estimate, as younger citizens seek higher wages and better working conditions in other parts of the EU. Instead of integrating migrants to fill the empty jobs in Hungary's economy, forecast to grow 3.6% this year, the government is banking on expanded family programs such as a lifetime income tax exemption for mothers who have at least four children. \"We want to support our own families instead of supporting migrants,\" Szijjarto says. Critics have derided the government's anti-migrant policies as well as its moves that they say have eroded judicial independence, free press, free speech and other democratic norms in the former communist country. Last year, the European Parliament launched an investigation of what it called Hungary's \"systematic threats\" to democracy. The Hungarian government ardently denied the charges, calling them a biased attack on the country's conservative Christian values. Orban has responded to EU assertions that he's eroding liberal democracy by declaring Hungary an \"illiberal\" one. On press freedom There is absolutely a media freedom in Hungary. You cannot name one sector of media \u2014 be it Internet, be it radio, be it television \u2014 where the market leader would be pro-government. How can you say 90% of the media would be in favor of the government when I told you very, very clearly ... that you find no sector, no section of media where the top outlets would be in favor of the government? On Hungary's relationship with the EU You know we are a country which respects the sovereignty of other countries. We always respect the decisions of the citizens of other countries regarding their own country, and we expect others to respect the decisions of the Hungarians about the future of Hungary, so mutual respect. This is very important: Don't put pressure on the others and let them decide about their own future. On labor shortages, migrants and family planning We want to support our own families instead of supporting migrants. You have not seen those 400,000 illegal migrants who marched through the country back in 2015. Thank you very much. We don't want them to stay in Hungary. You know the European Union would like to apply obligatory resettlement quotas in the framework of which they want a couple of thousand to be received in Hungary. But thank you very much. We don't want that and we reject that and you'll never receive any kind of illegal migrants in Hungary [as long as we] are in office. We are really proud of our family policy. We are really proud that we support our families. I don't agree that migration would be the solution here. I simply don't agree. Because if you look at the Western European countries, migration was not the solution. Migration created ... parallel societies. They have not found any kind of answer to their labor market challenges, and I'm pretty sure that we are not going to find any kind of solutions.",

            "article_content": "A record number of women were elected to Congress during the 2018 midterm elections. A new organization, called Supermajority, is trying to ensure that women's voices are heard in politics.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: After the 2018 midterms, Democrats celebrated the record number of women they had elected to Congress. And then attention promptly shifted to the presidential race. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports, a group that launched this week is trying to make sure women's voices in politics continue to get louder. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: When you're starting a new political organization, your agenda matters. Your experience matters. Your funding matters. But having a snappy intro video doesn't hurt. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Because one of us can be dismissed. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Two of us can be ignored. But together... UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: We aren't just the majority. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: We are a super-majority. And we are unstoppable. KURTZLEBEN: And the leaders of Supermajority, a new group that focuses on mobilizing women, aren't new to the organizing game. The co-founders include Cecile Richards, who led Planned Parenthood for more than a decade, Ai-jen Poo , director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. Garza spoke to NPR via Skype. ALICIA GARZA: We will be traveling across the country, talking to women about what their priorities are and what are the issues that they want to fight around. And that information will be turned into an agenda for women, which you can think of simply as a women's new deal. KURTZLEBEN: While Supermajority isn't specifically partisan, it's leadership and the issues they have highlighted, like the gender pay gap, are more associated with progressives. The group will focus on issues but also on helping women be more effective advocates. GARZA: We'll be training women on activism skills, everything from phone banking to bird-dogging to running and winning campaigns. KURTZLEBEN: The birth of a new political group isn't necessarily a major development. Lots of left-leaning groups sprouted up or saw renewed energy after Donald Trump's election. But the birth of a new women-specific group led by huge names does raise the question of what Democratic women view as their next step. DEBBIE WALSH: I think this is indicative of what a lot of the groups and a lot of women around the country are trying to figure out, which is how do we keep the momentum going? KURTZLEBEN: Debbie Walsh is director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. She points out that women still only account for under 1 in 4 members of Congress. And so left-leaning women's groups are emphasizing that they have more to do. Christina Reynolds is vice president for communications at Emily's List. CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: I think we are always worried that people think, OK, we're done. And this is why we reject the idea of just a year of the woman or just a pink wave. I go back to the last Year of the Woman, or so-called Year of the Woman, in 1992. I think it was Barbara Mikulski who rejected that title and said, that's like the year of the aardvark. KURTZLEBEN: Actually, Senator Mikulski's exact words were both year of the caribou and year of the asparagus. But the point is the same. There's a fear that 2018's wave made electing women seem like a mere fad. Supermajority joins a large constellation of other women-focused groups, like Emily's List, as well as Emerge and She The People, to name just a few. Walsh lists the concerns that arise when different organizations have overlapping goals. WALSH: How these different organizations work together, how not to step on each other's toes and give each other the space to do the work that they're doing. KURTZLEBEN: That may be a logical concern. But Reynolds at Emily's List said that for now, more groups just equals more getting done because there's so much to do. And as Garza adds, there's still plenty of enthusiasm. GARZA: Women are on fire. And Supermajority is really positioned to add oxygen to that fire so that it spreads all over the country. KURTZLEBEN: It's a fire that Donald Trump helped set ablaze. And his spot at the top of the ticket next year will likely add even more fuel. Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik is deeply worried about her party. \"We are facing a crisis level of Republican women in Congress,\" Stefanik said on Thursday, noting that there are only 13 Republican women in the U.S. House, down from 23 last session. Stefanik stepped down as House Republicans' recruitment head last month. But with a new group she's launching, dedicated to boosting women candidates, she still has top Republicans' full attention. At a Thursday launch event for her group, E-PAC, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney, and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer gathered with candidates, pollsters and strategists to talk about answers to this problem. The top three Republicans in the House, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, attended an event on Thursday where Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., warned of a \"crisis\" of lacking GOP women in Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The top three Republicans in the House, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, attended an event on Thursday where Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., warned of a \"crisis\" of lacking GOP women in Congress. Fundraising was a major focus of the launch event, along with recruitment tactics and overcoming sexism towards candidates. However, there was some dispute among attendees about how much President Trump \u2014 who pollsters say has driven some women from the party \u2014 has to do with the party's appeals to both women voters and potential women candidates. \"I think if you're thinking about 2020, it is a presidential election year, and the top of the ticket is a big factor when people are turning out and voting,\" said Betsy Fischer Martin, executive director of American University's Women & Politics Institute, citing a December poll. \"Among Republican women, 51 percent said they found [Trump's] tone concerning.\" Not only that, but among white suburban women \u2014 considered a key swing voting bloc that helped Democrats prevail in many 2018 races \u2014 51 percent found his tone very concerning, Martin added. Speaking to reporters after the event, Stefanik shrugged off Trump's effect on recruitment, noting that women \u2014 particularly single and young women \u2014 have long tended to vote far more Democratic than men. \"This has been a problem that predates President Trump, and it is going to be a problem post-Trump,\" Stefanik said. \"Regardless, it is a problem for the party.\" Stefanik has strong recruitment bona fides, and until recently she was recruitment chair for the NRCC. During her NRCC tenure, the number of Republican women congressional candidates spiked. However, many of those women didn't make it past the primaries, helping fuel Stefanik's conviction that promoting women in primaries would boost the party's numbers. She publicly feuded with Chairman Emmer over whether or not to fund primary candidates. Emmer stressed on Thursday that the NRCC typically stays out of primary races, and that he sees Stefanik's PAC as \"an enhancement\" of the party's existing recruitment activities. At her event, Stefanik emphasized the importance of this effort. \"I believe that one way we can attempt to change this trend is by supporting strong women candidates pre-primary,\" Stefanik added. \"As any candidate will tell you, this investment is critical.\" It's true that Republican women in particular can face bigger obstacles than their Democratic counterparts, as NPR recently reported \u2014 for example, in fundraising, infrastructure and the party's belief that it's important to elect more women. That said, Trump and his policies in particular may be keeping women from wanting to be Republican candidates, said Christine Matthews, a GOP pollster who spoke at the event. \"Women candidates typically come out of a cohort of college-educated women. And there are far fewer college educated women identifying as Republicans these days,\" she told NPR after the event. While college educated women were already becoming more Democratic before Trump was elected, his presence appeared to accelerate that trend. \"I think that is a result of the 2016 election and the tone and some of the policies the president has set,\" Matthews said. Her observation points to a few potential solutions for Republicans. One is that the Republican Party could expand its search beyond the usual pool of candidates, and recruit women who are not college graduates. But as Matthews also noted, boosting women's presence in the party may require some policy shifts, or at least different policy priorities. She named areas where the party might benefit from broadening its spectrum of views \u2014 climate or immigration \u2014 or ramping up an issue's visibility, like paid leave. She's certainly not the first to suggest this; recently-ousted GOP Rep. Mia Love has been calling on her male counterparts to boost issues like contraception that she believes will help women feel more included. \"I mean, seriously, I am pro-life. I'm unapologetically pro-life. Why not give women the option of having their choices when it comes to health care before they have to choose between keeping a life and ending a life?\" Love said at a December Politico event. Then-Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, speaks during Politico's Women Rule Summit in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 11, where she advised her party to make women feel more included with its policy focus.\n                \n                    \n                    MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, speaks during Politico's Women Rule Summit in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 11, where she advised her party to make women feel more included with its policy focus. But any policy shifts would also have to be undertaken on a case-by-case basis, Matthews said. \"You're going to have to be competitive in these suburban districts. That means you're going to have to come to the center on some of those issues in those districts if you want to be competitive,\" she said. Meanwhile, in more conservative districts, candidates would need a different tack. \"There are Republican women who are very happy in where the party is in terms of 'build the wall,' in terms of pro-life, whatever else,\" Matthews added. Stefanik said that in terms of agenda, she thinks GOP women lawmakers' efforts in areas like trade and combating human trafficking need more emphasis. But she also indicated that she isn't worried about the party's overarching priorities. \"We are a party that supports economic opportunity, that supports freedom, that supports constitutional liberties, and I believe that resonates with women voters in this country,\" she said. \"That's what I find in my district. Every district is different.\" \"I am a believer that all issues are women's issues,\" Stefanik added.",

            "article_content": "For the third time since President Trump's inauguration, women have gathered in Washington, D.C., for the Women's March, bringing attention to social justice issues.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Earlier today, thousands of progressive women and their allies rallied in Washington, D.C., in New York and elsewhere for the third annual Women's March. The group, which organized the first march in 2017 in response to President Trump's election, has been plagued by internal divisions and accusations of anti-Semitism against some of its leaders. But the march went on today despite the controversy and the damp, cold weather. NPR's Sarah McCammon was at the march in that damp, cold weather here in Washington. She joins me here in the studio. Sarah, welcome. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Melissa. BLOCK: Go through a bit about what these allegations were all about and how the leaders of the Women's March have been addressing them. MCCAMMON: Well, several of the leaders have faced accusations of anti-Semitism in part because of ties to the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who's made multiple anti-Semitic remarks in the past. And those ties prompted several groups, including the Democratic National Committee this year, to pull out from being listed as a partner for the Women's March. One of those leaders, Tamika Mallory, addressed this during the rally today. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) TAMIKA MALLORY: And to my Jewish sisters, do not let anyone tell you who I am. I see all of you. MCCAMMON: This, Melissa, isn't the first time that these issues of race and identity have come up at the Women's March. The first year it was organized, right after the 2016 election, there were a lot of concerns, really from the right and the left, about whether the march was inclusive enough both of conservative women and of women of color. BLOCK: And when you talked to the marchers about all this, what did they say? MCCAMMON: Well, obviously those who came today were not disturbed enough by these allegations of anti-Semitism to stay home. Several told me they'd heard about the controversy, but it wasn't their focus. For example, Christine Betters (ph) came to the march with her daughter from Takoma Park, Md. CHRISTINE BETTERS: And I know there's some controversy around this march, but for us, it's not about the leaders. We don't know their leaders' names. We don't know anything about them. And we, frankly, don't care. We're here to be - as we say in our house, we're here to be one with the sisterhood. So here we are. And we're excited. MCCAMMON: And I did speak with one woman who described herself as a Jewish feminist. She said she had second thoughts about coming to the women's march in light of the controversy but felt it was important to stand in solidarity with other women for racial and economic equality. BLOCK: Sarah, if we think back to the first Women's March right after President Trump's election, are the issues that we're hearing about in this march the same as they were back then? MCCAMMON: You know, this has been a challenge for the women's march to sort of define itself and shape its identity. And there have been disagreements about what that should be. They've always tried to address a lot of issues - immigration, poverty, racial inequality among others - along with more traditional feminist concerns like reproductive rights. And that last one was on a lot of people's minds this year with the newly configured Supreme Court, which now includes two Trump nominees, including most recently, of course, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. I talked to Ellie Hackney (ph) of Pasadena, Md. She says she's very concerned about the future of women's rights. ELLIE HACKNEY: It's actually a very scary time for women and for reproductive rights. We just support candidates who are pro-choice. We also really support Planned Parenthood. But, again, it's a very, very scary time. HACKNEY: And, Sarah, this march is coming on the same day of - that President Trump addressed the nation about the government shutdown and plans for border security. Were you hearing from people at the march that that was on their minds? MCCAMMON: Right. This was just before he was expected to speak. And, of course, the Women's March is a very anti-Trump crowd so, not surprisingly, a lot of people I talked to today in D.C. were angry. They blamed the president for keeping the government from reopening. A few told me they hoped to see some compromise and some progress but, at least as of a few hours ago, weren't feeling too hopeful about that. And a couple of people, Melissa, here in D.C. said they were federal workers, and they were very frustrated to be without pay. But they didn't want to go on the record because they're worried about their jobs. BLOCK: OK. NPR's Sarah McCammon - thanks so much. MCCAMMON: Thank you.

But it's unclear whether that outreach will resonate with voters who make up the religious middle.\n                \n                    \n                    A-Digit/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrats are hopeful they can mobilize a religious left to counter the religious right. But it's unclear whether that outreach will resonate with voters who make up the religious middle. Exit polls from the 2016 presidential election suggest that only 1 of 6 white evangelical voters supported Hillary Clinton. It was the worst such performance of any recent Democratic nominee. \"She never asked for their votes,\" says Michael Wear, who directed religious outreach efforts for Barack Obama's successful reelection campaign in 2012. Democrats this year are making a more determined effort to reach voters whose political preferences are driven in part by their religious faith. Two presidential candidates \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker and Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 are recruiting faith advisers to help in their campaigns, and the Democratic National Committee has hired a new \"faith engagement\" director, the Rev. Derrick Harkins. \"We're having these conversations in the summer of 2019 as opposed to the fall of 2020, because it helps faith leaders understand that we're serious about this,\" says Harkins, formerly senior pastor at the historically black Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. \"We're not scrambling at the last minute to try to cultivate relationships that will get us over the finish line.\" The new efforts have Democrats hopeful they can mobilize a religious left to counter the religious right, long a bedrock Republican constituency. Less clear is whether the outreach will resonate with those voters who make up the religious middle. Among them is child advocate Kelly Rosati, a Colorado-based evangelical activist who promotes adoption, foster parenting and orphan care. Rosati abandoned the Republican Party after concluding it was insufficiently compassionate, but neither does she identify as a Democrat, largely because of the party's stance on abortion issues. \"I feel incredibly discouraged,\" she says. \"I am extremely disappointed at how far the Democratic candidates have come from 'safe, legal, and rare' and [their] position on government funding of abortion and late-term abortion. At the same time, I have the exact same feeling when I look at those in the Republican Party who seem to have a similar callousness as it relates to immigrant children or people without access to health care.\" Rosati is not alone. Among Christians, many Catholics and mainline Protestants see themselves as neither liberal nor conservative. Wear, who identifies as an evangelical and works now as a political consultant, sees the religious middle as fertile ground for his fellow Democrats, if they approach it carefully. \"There are large numbers of faith voters who are looking for bolder approaches on voting rights, on immigration, on pro-family policies,\" he says. \"I do think there's a cohort of swing voters who are religious who Democrats risk losing with their move to the left on abortion.\" One candidate moving hard in that direction is New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who during a recent campaign stop in Iowa compared the restriction of abortion rights to racism. \"I think there are some issues that have such moral clarity that we have as a society decided that the other side is not acceptable,\" she said. \"There is no moral equivalency when it comes to racism. And I do not believe there's moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women's reproductive freedom.\" Wear, who has not yet aligned with a Democratic candidate in this election cycle, was not impressed with Gillibrand's comment. \"That's a fast track to losing an election that should be almost unlosable,\" he says. Wear advises Democratic candidates to follow the example of Barack Obama in their outreach to religious voters, a story he relates in his book Reclaiming Hope. He says such an effort can be successful even without abandoning core progressive principles. \"We met them where they were,\" he says. \"There were voters who knew that Barack Obama was pro-choice, who knew that he supported same-sex marriage, but thought that he was a good guy who wasn't out to get them [and] that he understood the concerns that those who disagreed with him might have.\" Such an approach is endorsed as well by Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of those in the Democratic Party who argues it should work harder to connect with faith voters. Coons says: \"I don't think the average voter looks at a score card of where a candidate stands on issue A and issue B and issue C as much as they listen and watch and say, 'Do I like him? Do I believe her? Do I connect with them? Would they be a good leader? Would I feel safe with that person running our country?'\" The answers to such questions come with the \"gut feeling\" a voter gets from a candidate, Coons says. \"To like someone, to engage with someone, and to ultimately support them and be comfortable with their leadership means knowing their heart,\" Coons says, \"which I think means knowing their faith.\" As a regular participant in Capitol Hill prayer breakfasts, Coons advises his Democrats to speak more openly about their own faith, an appeal he explained in a recent article in The Atlantic magazine. To Coons' surprise, the article was met with a decidedly mixed response. \"Some folks were quite offended by it,\" he says. \"[They] said politicians have no business talking about their faith at all, that this is dangerously against the separation of church and state.\" Such feelings, he says, may explain why Democrats have been less comfortable than Republicans in talking about the values that led them into public service. \"As a result,\" he says, \"there is a misperception in middle America that the folks who are religious and elected are Republican, and the folks who are Democrats and elected are not [religious].\" At the Democratic National Committee, the work of changing that reputation now falls, in part, to Harkins, who served most recently as a senior vice president at Union Seminary in New York. \"Square One is making sure people know they are being heard and not being dismissed,\" Harkins says. He will meet soon with faith leaders around the country from across the political spectrum to find out about their concerns and priorities. \"And then the responsibility falls on me and our work here, to act on those issues in the way that we can.\"",

Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and champion of women's rights, is no stranger to selfies. This week in Vancouver, Canada, she's surrounded by fans at Women Deliver's 2019 conference on gender equality \u2013 and it's clear that she's a celebrity. It seems like every few moments, some of the event's 8,000 attendees \u2013 mostly young women \u2014 approach her for a photo or stop by to chat. And with good reason. Clark, 69, has spent years advancing gender equality and encouraging women's political leadership \u2014 and has been an inspiration to women. Besides heading New Zealand from 1999 to 2008, she helmed the U.N. Development Programme until 2017 and was in the running for U.N. Secretary General last year. She now sits on a variety of advisory boards, including those of Women Deliver and the World Economic Forum's health council. Clark has also been known for using social media to engage with young people. At the conference, for example, she has been posting photos and videos to Snapchat, a social media platform popular with Generation Z. Her snaps include a Beyonce reference (\"Who runs the world?\"), a photo of a sunset in Vancouver and a video clip of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaking at an event. NPR talked to Clark about gender issues, being a role model for young women and the power of social media. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Are people tired of talking about gender equality? The talk around it has been going on for years. Well, women aren't tired because we're not there yet. In New Zealand last year, we celebrated 125 years of women's suffrage as the first country in the world where women fought for and won the right to vote. But we still have a pay gap. We have a bad rate of domestic and family violence. We've got to get on top of that. There's still plenty to fight for. What is one of the biggest obstacles that women face right now? This issue of some men wanting to control women's fertility and take away from them the choice [they have] over their own lives, how many children they want, if they want children, when they have them and so on. If you don't have access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health and rights, you are a disempowered person. If you could change one thing right now about the inequality that women and girls face in today's world, what would it be and how would you do it? That girls complete their education. If you can complete your education, you're likely to have seen off any attempt to have you forced into an early marriage, into childbearing before you're ready for it. You will have much more choice and determination over your life. So, education for every girl all the way would be No. 1. How would you bring education to every girl? I think technology holds some of the answers in equal access to education. [In] a lot of countries, girls transitioning to and completing secondary education is not easy. [Some schools] don't necessarily have the provision for it. I was just trekking in remote regions of Nepal, where you have [to get] a scholarship to go to a school that will [only] take you to Grade 10. I put a lot of hope in distance education because Wi-Fi connectivity is starting to come up in all those valleys [in Nepal]. [Some] schools are starting to get donors putting computer banks with the curriculum loaded on. Add the Wi-Fi, and you can have a teacher anywhere in the country supporting you to complete your further education. What is the biggest step in the advancement of women that you've seen lately? I was really quite excited by the last U.S. Congressional elections, seeing all those women from the diversity of U.S. society coming into Congress. Some of them are having quite a hard time, but hey, they're there. They are standing their ground, they're having a go. How about on the international scene? The global scene is challenging at the moment. The raft of populist or authoritarian male leaders who are pushing back on women's rights [is] problematic. But every reaction gets a counter-reaction, and if that helps mobilize women to say \"we're not going to put up with this.\" That's going to be a good thing. What do you think about all your young fans? I'm honored by it, really. That young women would notice I'm around, still fighting, still advocating for causes. I think girls and women are looking for people they can identify with [in the] government. It's hard to be what you can't see. I hope I am that sort of role model who [people] think, \"Hey, I could do that, I could be that person.\" Maybe it's all the Snapchatting you're doing. Probably the Snapchats.

First daughter Ivanka Trump wants to help 50 million women around the world \"realize their economic potential\" by 2025. Experts who work with women's issues in the global development community are hopeful about the new initiative \u2013 but raise questions about the timing of the announcement and the lack of specifics. Trump, a senior adviser to President Trump, announced the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative last week in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. It aims to get all U.S. foreign assistance agencies \u2013 including the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Peace Corps and six others \u2013 to give top priority to push for women's economic development. And it sets up a $50 million fund for USAID to invest in new programs that can help make it easier for women to find jobs, start their own businesses and do business. A White House press conference about the initiative identified the range of women who might be helped, from a dairy farmer in Georgia to the founder of a women's group in Malawi. \"This new initiative will for the first time coordinate America's commitment to one of the most undervalued resources in the developing world \u2013 the talent, ambition and genius of women,\" Trump wrote in the Journal. In a memorandum, President Trump said the initiative will build on his administration's \"growing portfolio\" of women's economic empowerment programs, including the \"Ivanka Fund\" \u2013 a World Bank project that she created to award grants to development banks to support women entrepreneurs around the world \u2013 and other efforts at USAID and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). The initiative has three main focuses, or \"pillars,\" as the administration calls it: providing women with the education and skills training they need to enter the workforce; helping them succeed as business owners through financing, access to markets and networks; and addressing other barriers \u2013 legal, regulatory and cultural \u2013 that keep them from working. According to the World Bank, 2.7 billion women in 112 countries are legally excluded from certain industries, like mining and construction or other jobs deemed \"morally inappropriate,\" like serving alcohol or working in casinos. It's also legal in 18 countries for husbands to prevent their wives from working. The presidential memorandum calls on U.S. foreign assistance agencies to dedicate at least $300 million annually to programs that advance the three pillars, while the $50 million USAID fund will finance additional programs. The initiative also plans to advance its goals through partnerships with non-governmental organizations and private companies, like Pepsi and UPS. Nancy Lee, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former U.S. Treasury official, says the initiative could be truly transformative if it actually brings women's issues to the forefront of all development efforts \u2013 whether that means including women in the efforts of farmers to bring food to market or inviting them to be leaders in a peace-building efforts. \"At USAID, we're thrilled,\" said USAID Administrator Mark Green at a press briefing last week. \"We've been working on women's empowerment, but now we have an across-the-board interagency effort, the full force of the U.S. government behind this.\" But some \u2014 especially development experts who have designed such initiatives \u2014 are concerned that without specific goals and more details, it's just a political show. \"All I've seen about this initiative is a whole lot of generic talk of the importance of empowering women without actually setting out a plan or a clear roadmap how to get there,\" says Brett Bruen, president of the Global Situation Room and former director of global engagement in the Obama administration. He believes the initiative is just a way to enhance the administration's reputation ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, especially in the wake of cuts to global women's programs from the Trump administration. Last year, President Trump proposed a 35 percent funding cut for global gender-equality programs, though Congress eventually rejected the cuts. The Trump administration has also reinstated what's known as the global gag rule to block U.S. aid money from funding any organizations that perform abortions, offer information about the procedure or support more liberal abortion laws. Development experts, on Twitter and beyond, say that if this initiative must address topics like reproductive rights and health or else women will not have the freedom to fully participate in the workforce. Global women's empowerment means looking at the many ways they are disempowered daily - violence, lack of choice when it comes to their own bodies, and discrimination ... and then changing those things that hold them back. That is meaningful empowerment. https://t.co/k8tdCmyZgH The bedrock of a woman\u2019s empowerment is the human right to decide when and if to have children. No full participation in the work force or eco empowerment without access to #familyplanning, sexuality education, safe #abortion. Must be included if new #WGDP is to be a success. https://t.co/t7IGDjQZZO It has not yet been disclosed what kind of proposals will be submitted by whom for the benefit of which 50 million women. Even if USAID targets the most vulnerable women in developing countries with that fund, so far, there have been no official public stipulations to ensure that they \u2013 not elite women in those countries \u2013 will receive the rest of the aid. \"Making sure that the poorest and most marginalized populations are reached is a critical piece of this initiative,\" says Aria Grabowski, senior policy adviser for Oxfam America. \"We're hopeful that it will target some of the women who need it most.\" Joanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequity.

            "article_content": "1 of 6 It seemed like a mistake: When President Trump touted women's gains in the job market during his State of the Union address Tuesday, it sent the contingent of Democratic women to their feet in enthusiastic applause. Many of those women, after all, had new jobs as a result of a record-smashing midterm election that was widely seen as a rebuke of Trump. And their white attire, in observation of the 100th anniversary of Congress voting to grant women the right to vote, highlighted their celebration even more. Trump seemed to have unintentionally given them the opening to gloat. \"You weren't supposed to do that,\" Trump jokingly told the women. And then the president went on to praise the women \u2014 this time, intentionally: \"Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.\" Trump isn't known for applauding Democrats for much of anything. But here, he was applauding Democratic women, who are the reason for that new record. While the number of women in Congress smashed records after the 2018 elections, the number of Republican women fell. \"Congratulations; that's great,\" he said, as the women renewed their loud applause. Jobs and electoral victories were a couple examples of a theme running through Trump's State of the Union address: outreach to women. Beyond job creation and electoral success, Trump announced an initiative to improve conditions for women in developing countries. He also touted the fact that a plan for paid family leave appeared in his budget. On top of all that, women were central to Trump's message on immigration, his signature issue. The president stressed that many women attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally get sexually assaulted during the journey. In addition, Trump brought ICE agent Elvin Hernandez, who works to rescue women from sex traffickers, as one of his guests. The pointed outreach to women may come in part from the president's awareness that a tough re-election fight is looming \u2014 and that getting re-elected might mean having to gain substantial ground with female voters. Female lawmakers dressed in white, in observation of the 100th anniversary of Congress voting to grant women the right to vote, watch as Trump delivers the State of the Union address.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Female lawmakers dressed in white, in observation of the 100th anniversary of Congress voting to grant women the right to vote, watch as Trump delivers the State of the Union address. Republicans already face a deficit with female voters, who preferred Democratic candidates in 2018 House races by 19 points, helping to create one of the largest gender gaps in that vote in decades. College-educated women in particular appear to be flocking to the Democratic Party. And women disapprove of the president far more than men do \u2014 the latest poll from CNN shows that women disapprove of Trump by a roughly 2-to-1 margin. Men, meanwhile, are evenly split. (Other recent polls show similarly large differences between men and women on the president.) A recent poll from The Washington Post and ABC News showed that on a variety of traits \u2014 whether the president is a \"strong leader,\" whether he has the right \"personality and temperament,\" whether he \"has brought needed change to Washington,\" whether he is \"good at making political deals\" \u2014 women are about 20 points less likely than men to view the president favorably. And on the question of how Trump has done on \"handling issues of special concern to women,\" 44 percent of men said \"excellent\" or \"good,\" compared with 23 percent of women. But then, even while the president may have to win over some unconvinced voters in 2020, he also will have to hold onto his base. Abortion is an issue that excites many conservatives \u2014 especially white, self-described evangelicals \u2014 and in Tuesday's speech, Trump appealed to that demographic with sharp criticism of new, controversial abortion measures in Virginia and New York. However, that issue might also energize Democratic voters \u2014 women in particular \u2014 in 2020. It's true that there is little to no gender gap on whether abortion should be legal, as Pew found in 2018 polling. However, women are slightly more likely than men to say abortion is a \"critical issue\" to them, according to 2018 polling from the Public Religion Research Institute. In addition, the issue is more important to other major Democratic constituencies \u2014 younger Democrats are more likely than younger Republicans to say abortion is important to them, and minority voters are more likely than white voters to say the same. All of which means that to the extent Trump and other Republicans highlight reproductive rights in 2020, that could end up energizing Democratic-leaning demographic groups. It's true that Trump won the election in 2016 with one of the largest gender gaps in modern history (notably, with far more support among white women than nonwhite women). But then the 2018 election showed that female voters were ready to put Democrats into office. Tuesday's address may have been Trump's attempt to stop that from happening again.",

Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg react on stage during the Democratic presidential debate at Otterbein University. The fourth Democratic debate was a long one, about three hours, and ended after 11 p.m. ET. You might not have made it through the whole thing, but there were some potentially consequential moments. Media no longer available Credit:  NPR Here are six takeaways: 1. The scrutiny came for Warren, and her vulnerabilities were exposed some Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was under fire Tuesday night from several opponents, and when that happens to a candidate, you know they're a front-runner. Last week, Warren caught up to former Vice President Joe Biden in an average of the national polls, and on Tuesday night she found herself hemmed in, particularly by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Buttigieg attacked Warren for promoting \"Medicare for All,\" while not having a detailed plan or saying how she would pay for it. \"Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\" Buttigieg told Warren. \"Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this.\" \"I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\" Warren said. But while a similar line from Warren at an earlier debate got thunderous applause, it didn't land the same way this time, and Klobuchar was ready with a response, going after Warren for, in her view, dismissing others' plans because they weren't hers. \"You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're [not] fighting for regular people,\" Klobuchar said. The criticisms strike at Warren's core vulnerability \u2014 that she's less electable than others in the race because, one, her policies are too liberal and, two, the former Harvard professor is dismissive and elitist. 2. The Biden versus Warren Rorschach test An exchange later in the debate certainly caught the attention of social media, but it was one that was in the eye (and ear) of the beholder. Here's that Biden vs. Warren exchange on the CFPB >> pic.twitter.com/NE2fPCwvZO Warren was touting her role at the inception of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration when former Vice President Joe Biden objected. \"I agreed with the great job she did and I went on the floor and got you votes,\" Biden contended, his voice starting to rise. \"I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let's get those things straight, too.\" The fight over the CFPB was my daily beat for basically a year. I don't remember Joe Biden being involved whatsoever. His adviser Jared Bernstein was a strong supporter but Biden was 100% AWOL. It was well known he and Warren clashed, so it made sense he stayed out. #DemDebate Warren paused and responded, \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\" Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., (left) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang (center) listen as former Texas Rep.

Beto O'Rourke speaks during the fourth Democratic primary debate. Not exactly thanking Biden. The reaction to this moment was swift and fierce. (Just see the replies in this tweet.) Some saw Biden as yelling, \"mansplaining\" and trying to take credit for something Warren did. Some saw Warren, though, as ungracious, petty and ungrateful. It's not clear what Biden's role was exactly in whipping up votes for the CFPB. Ryan Grim at The Intercept noted that he covered the agency's creation and recalled that while a top Biden adviser was involved, Biden was not. It should be noted that Biden and Warren have a history on economics and, especially, bankruptcy law. Biden, a former senator from Delaware, home of many of the nation's credit card companies, has been accused of protecting them, and Biden and Warren clashed when she testified on Capitol Hill about bankruptcy law in 2005. 3. Buttigieg may be back in the game The small-town mayor, who has become a darling of the donor class, controlled multiple exchanges and had a very strong night. In addition to taking on Warren on health care, he also went after former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke on his proposal to take away privately owned guns and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on her support of President Trump pulling U.S. troops out of Syria. In exchange after exchange, Buttigieg appeared to be trying to rein in Democrats from getting too far afield with policies that don't poll very well. For example, Medicare for All as an option to private health insurance, which Buttigieg supports, polls far better than Medicare for All as a replacement. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from July found that 70% of Americans thought Medicare for All as an option was a good idea, while just 41% approved of completely replacing private insurance. Only three candidates \u2014 Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 have been polling in double digits nationally for most of this campaign. Those three encapsulate the progressive (Warren, Sanders) versus moderate/incremental wings (Biden) of the party. But Buttigieg positioned himself a little differently, saying there was a \"false choice\" being presented. He said he disagreed with Biden that Trump is an \"aberration,\" arguing that the president is a symptom of what he sees as the challenge of a changing country. Buttigieg also criticized Warren for what he called \"infinite partisan combat.\" \"Yes, we have to fight,\" he said. \"Absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand. But it's going to take more than fighting. ... Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things that we've attempted in my lifetime.\" Can he sell his third way? He's at least positioned himself for the pragmatic lane if Biden falters, and he could pull from Warren's support given their overlap with college-educated white voters. 4. Questions about Hunter Biden were over and done with surprisingly quickly The candidates \u2014 and, frankly, the moderators \u2014 didn't seem to want to go very deep on Biden's son Hunter and his business ties. It's somewhat surprising there wasn't more follow-up given just how much this has been talked about in recent weeks since Democrats opened their impeachment inquiry into Trump after the president's phone call with Ukraine's president. In that call, Trump asked Ukraine's president to investigate the Bidens, after withholding military aid to the country. Democratic presidential hopefuls California Sen. Kamala Harris and Vermont Sen.

I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.\" Asked in a follow-up whether he'd made a mistake letting his son serve on a board of a Ukrainian gas company while he was handling Ukraine policy in the Obama administration, Biden said, \"I never discussed a single thing with my son on anything having to do with Ukraine.\" And that was essentially the end of the conversation. None of the other candidates wanted to touch it. 5. The previously taboo issue of age was broached It's been a thing since the start of the Democratic primary campaign and, honestly, before \u2014 given the age of the Democratic Capitol Hill leadership and the relative youth of the Democratic activist base. The top three Democratic candidates \u2014 Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 are all septuagenarians. Sanders is 78, Biden 76 and Warren 70. In the runup to the debate Sanders had a heart attack that took him off the campaign trail, and that became a reason for the moderators to ask about age. Minnesota Sen.

Amy Klobuchar speaks as former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro looks on during the debate. \"I'm healthy. And feeling great,\" said Sanders, who looked healthy and rested, and who, by the way, polls best of the candidates with young voters. Sanders then used the moment to plug an upcoming rally in Queens, N.Y., where he will officially receive the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Biden was asked about being 80 and handling the duties of president. \"Look,\" Biden said, \"one of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom.\" But it's a real issue of who's next for the Democratic Party. For no matter how many candidates are running, the bench is seen as pretty thin for national candidates of the next generation. 6. Health care was again dominant, while immigration, climate change and race didn't even come up Once again, Democrats showed the biggest fissure in the party is on health policy. It has dominated Democratic debates for a decade, and it continuously rates as the top issue for Democrats. An earlier debate was criticized for not addressing women's health and reproductive rights. But Tuesday night the candidates discussed it. And foreign policy received arguably the most serious treatment so far of the Democratic debates. Other policy areas of interest to the party were left off the table. Namely immigration, climate change and race. It's not as though the candidates don't discuss these topics (there was a multihour climate change candidate forum on CNN last month), but it was notable that those subjects were left out Tuesday night.",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., spoke to the NPR Politics Podcast about abortion access, the economy and trade, on Sunday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. California Sen. Kamala Harris says that if she's elected president, her administration's Department of Justice would likely pursue criminal obstruction of justice charges against a former President Donald Trump. \"I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,\" Harris told the NPR Politics Podcast, pointing to the 10 instances of possible obstruction that former special counsel Robert Mueller's report detailed without making a determination as to whether the episodes amounted to criminal conduct. \"There has to be accountability,\" Harris added. \"I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor. Well, I'll tell you one of the reasons \u2014 I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.\" The former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general said she wasn't dissuaded by the prospect of a former American president facing trial and a potential prison sentence. \"The facts and the evidence will take the process where it leads,\" she said. \"I do believe that we should believe Bob Mueller when he tells us essentially that the only reason an indictment was not returned is because of a memo in the Department of Justice that suggests you cannot indict a sitting president. But I've seen prosecution of cases on much less evidence.\" Referencing the Supreme Court Building's fa\u00e7ade, Harris said, \"On one side etched in the marble are the words 'equal justice under law.' It doesn't say 'except for the president.' There you go.\" Potential criminal charges against Trump were just one of several topics addressed during the half-hour interview. At a time when many of the other Democrats in the presidential race are starting to make more explicit arguments against former Vice President Joe Biden's positions, Harris declined to criticize Biden for his abrupt shift against his prior support for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits most federal funding for abortions. \"Listen, I'll speak for myself,\" Harris said. \"The bottom line on the Hyde Amendment is that it is directly, in effect, targeting poor women and women who don't have money.\" The NPR Politics Podcast episode is the fourth in an ongoing series of interviews with presidential candidates. The Harris interview took place in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the midst of the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame Celebration, an event that drew 19 White House hopefuls on Sunday. Harris had just finished her five-minute speech to the room of Democratic officials, volunteers and activists. It ended with a call for Democrats to \"prosecute the case,\" politically, against the Trump presidency. Harris cited Trump's attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his repeated dismissal of the U.S. intelligence community's concerns about Russian interference in the 2016 election, among other things. Trump insists that the strong economy will top all those issues in next year's election. In the interview, Harris dismissed that view. \"There are pretty much two indicators for this president of the supposed greatness of his economy. The stock market,\" said Harris. \"Well, that's fine if you own stocks. Or the jobless numbers, the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people are working in our country. You know what? They're working two and three jobs, and in our America, people should not have to work more than one job to be able to put food on the table and have a roof over their head. And so when we talk about the lives of real people in our country, they're not doing better under this president and his policies.\"",

The Department of Education has been inundated with approximately 100,000 public comments on its proposed new rules for how campuses handle cases of sexual assault. Secretary Betsy DeVos opened the public comment period two months ago, after unveiling her plan to replace Obama-era rules with regulations that, she says, would better protect the accused. The window for comments closes Wednesday at midnight. Many who have weighed in praise the new rules for \"restoring sanity\" and fairness to the process but many more are critical. Those comments range from short expletives and insults aimed at DeVos, to personal and sometimes graphic accounts of sexual assaults,and pleas not to return to the bad ol' days, when victims were not believed and incidents were swept under the rug. The deluge of comments comes as survivor advocates have been mobilizing their troops on social media, at comment-writing pizza parties, and through crash courses in commenting on college campuses. At a recent meeting of the Boston University Students For Reproductive Freedom club, Sage Carson with the survivor advocacy group, Know Your IX joined in by video conference, updating students on what the proposals would do. \"I'll be blunt,\" she says, \"It's devastating.\" She tells the students the proposed rules would mean schools don't automatically have to investigate incidents alleged to have occurred in private, off-campus apartments, or misconduct that is reported to a coach or resident advisor, for example, instead of the official Title IX officer. She then instructs students how to formally file their objections through the  Hands Off IX website. A Mad Libs-type of template makes commenting easy, and then forwards submissions on to the official regulation comment website. Students first fill in their name, and identify as a survivor or concerned citizen, for example. Then they can pick from a list of rules they take issue with, and then from a list of studies and data that bolster their case. Carson urges the students to make it their own. \"As long as you submit something that is personal, and you say why this is important, the department is legally required to respond,\" she says. \"It takes about 5-10 minutes ... It's super simple and can have real-world implications.\" After the meeting, sophomore Blaire Thomas launches the website on her phone, checks out the \"sentence starters\" and decides to write about the off-campus exclusion. \"Most of the places that me and my friends spend time on nights and weekends are off campus,\" she explains. \"And I feel like this is a direct attack on the protections that students have a right to.\" \"It's incredibly disturbing,\" says Julia Mullert.  \"I live off campus and the fact that I could be few minutes away and that would change everything, is really devastating. But it also motivates me to push back against it and fight harder.\" Activists hope the sheer volume of comments will force officials to pay attention. Support for the regulations There's no official count of supporters and opponents, but even those who favor the new rules concede they're getting beat. \"We know we'll never match the number of comments of victims' advocates,\" says Cynthia Garrett, co-president of Families Advocating for Campus Equality, a group representing those who say they were wrongly accused.  \"But the Department [of Education] is smart enough to understand that quality is more important than quantity.\" Garrett has been encouraging comments from accused students who say they were victims of an unfair system, that left them kicked out of school with dashed prospects, ruined reputations, and in many cases, severe depression. \"We have a kid who planned to paddle out on a surfboard with a concrete block,\" says Garrett. \"We have another one [who was found in his garage] standing on a stool with a rope in his hand. I mean this is very devastating.\" Garrett says the new rules better protect the wrongly accused,  for example, by allowing schools to demand more proof of wrongdoing, by guaranteeing the right to cross-examine accusers, and by narrowing the definition of sexual harassment. Will public comment sway policy? Fighting these issues through agency regulations \u2014 once the domain of wonky lawyers \u2014 is something of a newer frontier in political activism. Harvard Law School Professor Jacob Gersen, an expert in the administrative law process, and a proponent of many of the changes DeVos has proposed, says most regulations still get just a smattering of comments \u2014 certainly not a hashtag campaign on social media. But it's increasingly a part of political strategy. \"Parties and activists have gotten good at this over the years,\" Gersen says.  \"They recognize that the bureaucracy and the administration is actually where the power is and that's a much more effective place to spend your political energy. And they're right about that.\" Jess Davidson, executive director of End Rape on Campus, that's part of the Hands Off IX partnership, agrees. \"We have really revolutionized the way that people can participate in this process ... and we're making this incredibly powerful democratic tool one in which you can clearly sue the department if they don't listen to you and take your voice seriously.\" The regulations.gov website discourages mass-generated submissions, warning that \"some agencies may choose to 'redact, or withhold' submissions containing duplicate/near duplicate examples of a mass-mail campaign.\" A tip-sheet further advises that \"Many ... mistakenly believe that their submitted form letter constitutes a 'vote'\" but in fact, while public opinion may guide policy, decisions are made on \"sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes. A single, well-supported comment may carry more weight than a thousand form letters.\" (NPR reached out to Education officials with additional questions, but did not receive answers before deadline.) Davidson dismisses suggestions of a \"copy-and-paste campaign.\"  The website template gives people \"the tools ... to write unique, substantive comments. We're democratizing [the process] and making it more accessible to the people who are disproportionately harmed by [DeVos' proposed] rules.\" I think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. Women deserve that. Michele Dauber Success however, is hardly certain. Past efforts for example the one that generated millions of comments on net neutrality, ultimately failed to sway administration officials' minds. Mass mailings can also be the victims of their own success, as the overwhelming quantity of comments forces officials to use machines to read them. It's a prospect that infuriates activists, like Stanford Law School Professor Michele Dauber. \"How insulting,\" she says. \"I think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. Women deserve that.\" It's one of the reasons Dauber, who also chairs the Enough is Enough Voter Project PAC,  helped distribute tens of thousands of postcards at womens' marches around the nation. She's hoping hand-written notes will force a human read. The Women's March in Kern County, Calif. was one of many around the nation where postcards were distributed, encouraging people to submit comments opposing Secretary DeVos' plan to change Title IX regulations .\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy Kimberly Kirchmer\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Women's March in Kern County, Calif. was one of many around the nation where postcards were distributed, encouraging people to submit comments opposing Secretary DeVos' plan to change Title IX regulations . If the department doesn't read \u2014 and heed \u2014 the comments, Dauber says, a legal challenge will follow. But Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education says comment quantity should not drive policy. \"Constitutional rights aren't decided by majority vote,\" he says. \"Due process is not subject to the whims of the masses.\" Officials may take months to review the comments and respond. They will likely give schools some lead time before enacting the new regulations, and inevitable legal challenges may bring further delays. That means it could be close to the 2020 election before any new regulations take effect. Activists say that may ultimately be how the issue is decided. As Dauber put it, \"the way to get rid of these regulations, is to get rid of the people who wrote them.\"",

            "article_content": "Jenny Mills and Vanessa De Leon have participated in past women's marches. NPR's Scott Simon asks them how they feel about marching today, and about the progress women have made in the Trump era.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The first Women's March was two years ago, the day after President Trump was inaugurated. It proved to be one of the biggest protest days in U.S. history. Since then, we've seen some stops and lots of starts in the push for more equitable treatment for women - Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose - but also silence breakers as TIME's Person of the Year and a record number of women elected to the U.S. Congress. We'll hear about the mood on the streets today as women gather, once again, elsewhere on this program. But for the next few minutes, a step back with two women who've marched before. Jenny Mills lives in western New York. Thanks so much for being with us. JENNY MILLS: Thank you. SIMON: And Vanessa De Leon is from Worcester, Mass. Thank you very much for being with us. VANESSA DE LEON: Thank you for having me. SIMON: Jenny Mills, you've just moved to New York from Alaska. You organized the local march for your city of Nome, Alaska. You're not going to be affiliated with the national march today, I gather. MILLS: I made the decision to distance myself from the national organization because of the issues that have come up regarding the leadership's link with Louis Farrakhan and the failure to fully repudiate or denounce his anti-Semitism, homophobia and misogyny. SIMON: Vanessa De Leon, how do these allegations, these charges about anti-Semitism and other charges against some organizers and some sentiments of the - against original organizers of the Women's March - how do they affect you? DE LEON: My experience at the Women's March in Boston was amazing. And, I mean, there was a lot of diversity, a lot of unity and people from all walks of life and men and kids, all religions, all ethnicities. So from my personal experience, it was incredible. I would like to learn more about these allegations in order to be able to give you an educated opinion, I guess. SIMON: Two years ago, we had the election of Donald Trump, following what was heard on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape where he talked about - well, I think we all remember what he talked about and other remarks that were made during the campaign quite publicly and quite openly. That seemed to provide a lot of energy and focus. What do you feel has happened over the past couple of years? MILLS: I think we've expanded the discussion about what's going on with women in this country, talking about various different issues that have come to the forefront - wage discrimination and wage inequality for working women, issues with access to health care - reproductive health care. Obviously, the #MeToo movement exploded over the past couple of years. So we're talking a lot more about sexual violence towards women, sexual harassment. So I think the landscape has really opened up to have a lot of really important conversations. And I work in the field of sexual violence against children. I am a forensic interviewer. So that's kind of what I deal with on a daily basis. And just being able to see people talk about this in public and have the ongoing dialogue has been really outstanding. SIMON: Vanessa De Leon. DE LEON: I am a victim of domestic violence so this - the Women's March, you know - and when I heard everything that the president said, you know, it touched me so deep. And I'm like, wow. I mean, this is not right. This cannot be normal. This cannot be how things are going to be, you know, in the country. So if I have to go to a hundred march - you know, marches - I will do that because it is not OK. SIMON: And what about activities other than marching? Are those kinds of avenues open, too? MILLS: Absolutely. I mean, letter writing campaigns, calling your senators, calling your representatives - there are so many different activist routes that we can take. But the Women's March just happens to kind of get the most attention because it is such a large event. But there are so many things just on a daily basis that activists are continuing to do. SIMON: Well, I have to ask. Are there people who confuse tweeting with activism in this day and age? DE LEON: Yes. But it also gets the word out. I mean - and you're, you know, you're right. Some people do confuse, you know, tweeting with activism. But, you know, social media has become a great tool, you know. A lot of people - that's all they do, you know. They - many people stop watching the news, watching TV, and they just go on social media. That's where they get their information - not always accurate information. But it is a good tool, you know, to use and take advantage of. SIMON: Jenny Mills and Vanessa De Leon, thanks so much for being with us. DE LEON: Thank you for having us. MILLS: Thank you, Scott.

All social classes have unspoken rules. From A-list celebrities to teachers, doctors, lawyers, and journalists \u2014 there are social norms that govern our decisions, whether we realize it or not. Researcher Elizabeth Currid-Halkett studies social networks, and has observed certain patterns across swaths of American culture. In her book Starstruck: The Business of Celebrity, she looks at the super elite: the celebrities who populate the Hollywood Hills and the tabloids in our grocery stores. She makes a distinction between fame and celebrity. \"Fame is simply people knowing who you are,\" she says. \"The sheer number of people who know who someone is, is very different from a public being fixated upon someone.\" For example, we all know who Bill Gates is \u2014 but we aren't all wondering what Bill Gates ate for breakfast today, the way we might wonder that about Beyonc\u00e9, or Barack Obama, or Jennifer Aniston. This week on Hidden Brain, we look at the invisible qualities that all celebrities have in common, and how our interest in them builds because of cues we get from one another. Later in the episode, we look at another elite group: the yoga-loving, Whole Foods-shopping, highly-educated group that Elizabeth Currid-Halkett calls The Aspirational Class.

            "article_content": "Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's new film tells the story of  an artist who grows up in Nazi Germany, comes of age in East Germany and travels to the West to find freedom for himself and his art.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The new film \"Never Look Away\" is about an artist, a painter, who's first exposed to modern art as a child growing up in Nazi Germany. He's taken by his aunt to an exhibit of modern art that was curated by the Nazis to show what degenerate art looks like - the kind of art the Nazis are banning. By the time the boy is an art student, the Russian Communists have taken over East Germany, where the boy lives. And all art is expected to be propaganda, showing images of happy, working people. As a young man, he flees to West Germany and attends an art school known to be avant-garde. The artists there consider representational painting, the kind of painting he does, to be obsolete. Implicit in the movie are questions like, why make art? What is art for? And who is it for? The movie is inspired by the life of Gerhard Richter, one of the most famous German painters of his generation. My guest is the film's writer and director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His 2006 film, \"The Lives Of Others,\" won an Oscar for best foreign language film. That film was set in East Germany, about a playwright and an officer of the Stasi, the state secret police, who spies on the playwright. The new film \"Never Look Away\" was nominated for an Oscar. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, welcome to FRESH AIR. The film starts with an exhibit of degenerate art. It's Dresden, 1937. The Nazis have taken power in Germany, and this was an exhibit that actually happened in Nazi Germany when non-representational modern art was considered a threat, was considered subversive, was considered a sign of mental illness. Tell us what you know about this exhibit of degenerate art. FLORIAN HENCKEL VON DONNERSMARCK: You know, it was one of the most successful exhibits ever staged. Over 2 million people came to see the exhibit. And it was the German government - Goebbels - going into the individual museums - he and his people - and finding art that they considered didn't match the aesthetic ideals of Nazi Germany. So anything that didn't show beautiful, realistic landscapes and people, anything that they didn't consider uplifting was pulled out. And the least craft-like of those artworks were shown in this exhibit for people to make fun of. And in a time of great poverty in Germany, they would put next to each artwork a number of marks that it had cost - so they said, oh, you know, this individual painting here, which only consists of lines and blotches or a blue horse or something ridiculous like that - a guy who can't even get the color of a horse right was paid 2,000 marks for this painting at times where you guys were all starving. It was supposed to really create a hatred of people who didn't toe the party line in arts in Germany. And I think - you know, many people did see it that way. But one thing that you also find in the biographies of some artists is that many people used it as a last chance to see great and free art because this was amazing art. And then - actually, after that exhibit was done and over 2 million people had seen it, the Nazis sold what they could in Switzerland, and the rest they destroyed. So a lot of these paintings were actually destroyed. And I always felt that it was such a massive cultural loss. And so our painters worked with the archives of these persecuted painters to try and reconstruct the paintings that were shown at that exhibit. So we rebuilt them from little black and white photographs, trying to figure out what colors people had used. And so we really made all those artworks come to life again. So actually, you know, although it's a fairly short scene in just the first few minutes of the movie, it was actually a very complicated production. GROSS: Because you had to make all the art. VON DONNERSMARCK: We had to make the art. And actually, now we have to destroy this art. The crazy agreement that we have with the Collecting Society is that after we're done filming, so they don't suddenly appear somewhere as forgeries, we actually have to destroy them again. So I haven't yet found in myself the strength to do it, so they're still in my mom's cellar in Berlin. But at some point, I'm going to have to go down there and destroy them. GROSS: Why is it so hard for you to destroy - I mean, they are - they're fakes. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah, but they're as close to the real thing as we have. And that's also why they have to be destroyed - because in 50 years' time, someone could find them and think, oh, great. Here is Otto Dix's \"War Cripples.\" It wasn't destroyed after all. Here's the real thing. And suddenly, you have a forgery in circulation. And that's why they want it destroyed. But, you know, I still feel that, you know, there's something - this - these paintings have been destroyed once before. And how we've reconstructed them at great - with great love, and now we have to destroy them again - it's a little sad. GROSS: What really just strikes me as so odd about the Nazi degenerate art exhibit - I mean, in the - there were very famous artists in there. I think Picasso was in there - right? - and Kandinsky and Paul Klee. How crazy is it to warn people about how horrible this art is when it's, like, great art, and you're exposing people to it who never would've seen it otherwise? VON DONNERSMARCK: No, it's - I mean, it really is one of the crazy, crazy chapters in art history - I mean, in human history, all of everything having to do with what the Nazis did. When these - for example, the expressionists between the two world wars showed the crime and depravity and despair that was in Germany and made paintings of, you know, prostitutes and terrible living conditions and of murders and of, you know, war cripples. The Nazis said, oh. Well, look. This is what these artists want for our country. This is what they consider beautiful. This is how deranged these people are that that is actually their agenda for Germany, when of course, they were - this was a cry of sorrow and despair. So it's so interesting that they could not even imagine that other people had a completely different philosophy. Not only did they persecute people who thought differently, they couldn't even imagine what it was that led to those different thoughts. GROSS: But, you know, the thing that you have to say, too, about the degenerate art exhibition is that it showed that the Nazis thought art was really powerful and that that power had to be banned when it was in the hands of artists who they considered, you know, deranged or mentally ill or not politically correct, to put it in today's terms. And it's instilling a lot of power in art when a lot of people are so indifferent to art, they wouldn't have cared one way or another. VON DONNERSMARCK: No, I mean, I think that's one thing that you find. I mean, in all dictatorships that I've looked at, I find that they have exactly what you're talking about - this fundamental belief that art is something that has to be kept under control. And I thought for a long time, why did these primitive people take art so seriously? It's the last thing that they care about. But I think that in their incredible survival instinct, these dictators know that art has the power to change the way that people see the world. I mean, I've almost come to find that that's the definition of art. GROSS: Well, you know, a contrast that you make and a similarity that you draw is, you know, that the Nazis are trying to ban art and control art and keep art to, like, realistic, uplifting paintings. And the World War II ends, and then the Russians move in, take over East Germany. And it's very similar. And so the main character, the artist in your movie - first, he sees the German - you know, the Nazi exhibit of decadent art. And then as he becomes an art student, the only thing you're allowed to paint is, like, uplifting things in service of, like, the people with capital letters. And instead of, for instance, like, a nude model for the art students to draw to learn anatomy, they're drawing a man and a woman. One of them's holding a sickle, and the other has a handful of wheat because they're showing, like, the people working in the fields, you know? And so, like, you're - you know, they're in opposition, the Nazis and the communists. They were at war together - you know, the Russians and the Germans. But their attitude toward art is pretty much the same. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah, it's really interesting. I think as soon as you try and control art, art disappears. And, you know, the Nazis had this terrible philosophy of art. And then the communists came to power and said, well, look. We're going to do things all differently from the Nazis. And actually, now, if you look at some of the Nazi paintings and some of the communist paintings, it's almost hard to tell the difference. And they were so convinced they were doing the exact opposite. But what they were doing was just keeping tight control on art and thereby destroying it. GROSS: And - so there's a third view of art in your movie. You know, the character who is born in Nazi Germany comes of age in East Berlin, then flees to West Berlin. And he goes to an art academy there. He goes to an art academy in Dusseldorf, which is known for being avant-garde. And there he's told painting is passe, especially representational painting. And that's what he does - is representational painting. And the artists there are doing things like art with potatoes or art where you, like - you take an object, and you just nail nails into the whole outside of it so it's a sculpture of nails or taking a canvas and slashing it with paint kind of coming out of the slashed end. And some of this is based on real art. But do you consider that part of art - like, an opening up of art or another version of a shutting down of art because, again, it has a philosophy. And, you know, the philosophy is, in part, anything goes. But the philosophy is also, representational art is dead. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah, I mean, it's - after 1945, for a while in Germany, there was complete confusion over how art could even continue because everything was tainted. There was no way that artists could continue in the tradition of what had come before 1945 because, you know, that had either been tainted by those 12 Nazi years or had been something that led up to those 12 Nazi years. So I actually saw an exhibit recently of German art from 1945 to, I think, about '55. And it's really one of the most depressing exhibits I ever saw because there was nothing interesting there. And so then the first person, I think, who really changed things around was this great sculptor, philosopher, shaman Joseph Beuys, who said, you know, let's not just throw content overboard. Let's also throw craft overboard. Let's - you know, that might be tainted, too. You know, if you cut out a cancer, you don't just cut out right around the cancer. You go as far as you have to make sure it never comes back. And so he created a new style of art and then, actually, became a professor of monumental sculpture in Dusseldorf. But these were truly very strange sculptures that were very closely tied to his biography. So one of the stories that he told was that he was shot down as a pilot in World War II and was nursed back to health by indigenous people that found him and wrapped him in felt blankets and covered his wounds with animal fat and grease. And then he made these huge sculptures out of rolls of felt and mountains of animal grease and told this story and, in a way, made you feel his universe the way that he felt it. And that was a very liberating approach. And so people started flocking to Dusseldorf, where he became professor. And he was this hugely controversial figure. Even when he died in the '80s in Germany, I remember the main headline in the biggest German tabloid paper read (speaking German) - Germany's greatest charlatan has died. So he was this controversial figure, but he encouraged people to use whatever they had. And I think that he became a very important figure in helping Germany rediscover its identity. And, you know, a lot of the great, great names who really mean a lot in the German and now international art world went to Dusseldorf to study there. And the place was greatly influenced by him. And over time, people realized that this philosophy was maybe even useful for places outside of Germany, even if the country had not committed such terrible crimes or if - it was still important to find out who you really were and free yourself from any kind of art historical or government or fashion influence. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. And his new film is called \"Never Look Away.\" He also made the 2006 movie \"The Lives Of Others,\" which won the Oscar for best foreign language film. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE'S \"OUT OF THIS WORLD\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is screenwriter and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His new film \"Never Look Away\" is set in Germany between 1937 and 1966. And it looks at the life of one artist who is inspired by the German artist Gerhard Richter. We were talking about Joseph Beuys as being this kind of, you know, radical figure in German art. You have an art professor in your movie in Dusseldorf, who's so modeled on Joseph Beuys that he's even dressed in the kind of khaki vest that you always see in Joseph Beuys photographs with the brimmed hat that he always wore. And he tells the story in the film that you told about being saved by nomadic Tatars after getting shot down in a plane during World War II and getting wrapped in felt and animal fat. My favorite shot in the movie is when he's delivering a lecture to his lecture class of art students. And on either side of him is an easel - an art easel. And on each easel there's a poster. On one side is the poster of the SPD party and the other side of the CDU party, the opposite - the opposing party. Apparently, there's an election coming up. And the professor asks, who will you vote for, the SPD or the CDU? Then he answers his own question by telling them, never vote for a party again. Vote for art. Only in art is freedom not an illusion. After the Nazi catastrophe, only art can give people back their freedom. If you aren't completely free, then nobody else will be. By making yourselves free, you are liberating the world. You are priests, revolutionaries, liberators. Make your burnt offerings. And he takes out a cigarette lighter and sets each of these political posters on fire. And so my favorite shot is of the professor with his hands on his hips, standing in the middle of these two posters that he set on fire. Flames are shooting out of the poster. And he's just standing there, staring at his class. And you hold the camera on him for an extended period while that happens. When he sets the posters on fire, did you worry about the fire catching onto anything else? VON DONNERSMARCK: You know what? It was really - I wanted to hold it really, really long. And I said to the actor, you know what? And, obviously, we had firemen there and people checking the temperature and all that so the actor wouldn't really hurt himself. But I said, you know, try and stay as long as it really doesn't start hurting you because I just really wanted to feel the heat. I wanted to, you know, make it very real. And it was a wonderful theater actor who's been through a lot worse on the theater stage. So... (LAUGHTER) VON DONNERSMARCK: He was game for staying quite a while. GROSS: So you grew up in Germany. I mean, you're German. You live in Germany and LA now, if I have that right. VON DONNERSMARCK: Actually, no. I live only in LA at the moment. GROSS: OK. VON DONNERSMARCK: But for the past two years, I was living in Germany, making this movie. GROSS: Right. OK. So you were born in 1973 and grew up in West Germany. So you're post-World War II. And your childhood is during the era of the Berlin Wall. And I know you had family in East Germany. So having become an artist yourself, how did the Nazi history of Germany and the communist present of East Germany affect the kind of art you were exposed to and the attitudes toward art that you were exposed to, 'cause attitudes don't die even when regimes change. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah, I mean, it's - in Germany - growing up in Germany - and I grew up mainly in Berlin, so yes, it's, you know - the western part of Berlin, but it's right in the middle of the East. So to get anywhere, you actually have to drive through the East. And you live with the constant presence of the Berlin Wall. You know, you're living with history at every moment. You are - you know, yes, I'm - I was born in 1973, so almost 30 years after the end of the war. But the war is present every single day. I mean, actually, you know, my first art exhibit was in the Martin-Gropius exhibition hall. I saw a big Picasso show there in - I think it was 1982 or so. And that was still destroyed by the war. The building still had real bomb damage, and the wall went right by there. And you walk through any street in Germany, and you still see the scars of the war everywhere. So you have that present. You live with history in a way that I think you don't in - or with the recent history that I think that you don't in other places that have been around for many hundreds of years. GROSS: So your movie \"Never Look Away\" is inspired by the life of the German artist Gerhard Richter, who developed a style of, like, photorealism in which the realism was - I don't know what word to use - a little modeled, a little distorted in the final part of the process. But he has objected to the film. Apparently, you interviewed him for many hours. And once the film came out, he did his best to distance it - distance himself from it, saying things like, you know, it's... VON DONNERSMARCK: Well, he hasn't seen it. I mean, that's the thing. GROSS: Oh, he hasn't seen it. Oh. Oh. VON DONNERSMARCK: No, he hasn't seen it. He didn't like the trailer. That was what I showed him. He didn't like that because he felt it was, you know, kind of too loud or so. I mean, he - I really tried to get him to see the film. I said, you know, you can't judge a film based on its trailer. I mean, he - I kept him informed every step of the way, even read him the script when I was done with it. So - but I'd been warned by his biographer that he always turns on people after opening up to them. The same thing had happened to the biographer, so I was a little bit prepared. I thought it wouldn't really happen to me because I just kept him informed every step of the way, but it did happen. You know, I think it's too bad he didn't see the film. But in a way, I also understand him because it's about a lot of traumatic things, many of which have happened in his life, also. And if I put myself in that position, quite honestly, of thinking, OK. I'm offered by someone to relive the greatest trauma of my life on screen. I don't know if I'd - if I would want that, you know? You know, would I maybe want to talk through those things with someone who was really interested in getting to the truth of my feelings? Yes - probably yes. So, you know, maybe the film is for everybody except for him. GROSS: My guest is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, writer and director of the new film \"Never Look Away.\" After we take a short break, we'll talk about how the Nazis forced sterilization program figures into the movie, and we'll hear about von Donnersmarck's family. He comes from a line of counts. His grandfather had a castle, and his uncle was a Cistercian monk. Von Donnersmarck wrote his first screenplay at the monastery. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with screenwriter and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His first film, \"The Lives Of Others,\" won an Oscar for best foreign language film. His new film, \"Never Look Away,\" is set in Germany between 1937 and 1966. The main character is first exposed to modern art as a child growing up in Nazi Germany, where modern art is considered degenerate and is banned. By the time the boy is an art student, the Russian Communists have taken over East Germany, where the boy lives. And all art is expected to be propaganda. As a young man, he flees to West Germany and attends an art school known to be avant-garde. But the kind of representational painting he does is considered obsolete. So your movie \"Never Look Away\" is inspired by the life of the German artist Gerhard Richter. Richter's aunt was killed by the Nazis. And as the aunt is depicted in the film - and you could tell us if this was similar in real life - she suffered from schizophrenia as... VON DONNERSMARCK: Yes - could've been schizophrenia or a form of bipolar disorder. I mean, all her medical records are still there, but it's not completely clear which of those two illnesses it was. GROSS: And at the time, the Nazis had a program in which if you were not considered fit for reproduction because of any kind of, you know, mental health issue. Whether they thought that you were, you know, mentally deficient, cognitively, or if you had, like, a mental illness like bipolar or schizophrenia, they would sterilize you so that you couldn't reproduce and ruin the German bloodline. And then often, they would kill you afterwards just to make, like, double sure that you didn't infect, you know... VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah. GROSS: ...Infect Germany. And so you have this happen to her. Did you do a lot of research into this forced sterilization program? VON DONNERSMARCK: Goodness, yeah. I mean, it was - that was really a very depressing chapter of this. And you know, it only takes up a small part of the film, but it was an important premise. I mean, I took the whole crew to the place where these people were murdered, for instance. You know, it's a research center now, and there are wonderful historians researching this also. I mean, it - number-wise, of course it doesn't approach anything that - of the, you know, murders that came later where the Nazis ended up, you know, committing the greatest history of mankind in murdering the Jewish people. But this was a little bit of a - you know, like, a miniature dress rehearsal for that. They actually developed a lot of the techniques which were then later used in the Holocaust. They developed those in targeting those who were, you know, mentally disabled and... GROSS: Like the gas chamber. VON DONNERSMARCK: ...Also - yes - and also discovered through this that they had to completely keep everything in the hands of the SS. And when this - there was a lot of protest against this murdering of people with these hereditary mental disabilities. And they had to officially shut it down. Of course unofficially it went on, but then they realized, OK, we don't - it's not enough to have it in the furthest eastern corner of the Reich. We have to actually move it further east - and moved it into Poland and put everything in the hands of the SS when they went on to what their main goal was, the murder of Jewish people. GROSS: So the gas chamber was one of the things that was started for people with mental illness. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yes. They - that's where they developed all the techniques. Even the exact, you know, crematoria and all that - it's something which has only been - being researched now. But there's a government-funded research center there at Pirna-Sonnenstein. And we had all the historians work on our film, and we reconstructed those things exactly. And when we shot that one kind of really tough scene of the murder, we actually had those historians there. And we shot it on the day of the remembrance of the victims of the crimes of the Nazis and said, look; let's build a monument to - let's build a monument to these to these victims. GROSS: You grew up in Germany - in West Germany. Your family, though, was from a part of Germany that became East Germany. When and how did they get out? VON DONNERSMARCK: So actually I encountered the chapter of how my father got out of - in a massive way while shooting this film because we shot part of it in Poland in an area that's - used to be Germany, is now Poland. And it was a state called Silesia. And when the Russians pushed forward to that part of Germany in 1945, they put up notices because they knew that they wanted to give that part of Germany to Poland as reparation and said - it was at - you know, the morning they put up the notices that anybody who hasn't - who's German and hasn't left this part of the country by noon going west towards the other parts of Germany - and, you know, will be killed. And you were allowed to take one backpack with you of less than 20 kilograms, and you had to leave the key to your apartment or house or, in the case of my grandfather, castle from the outside in the door. And you were not allowed to take anything. So that's how from one day to the next - my father was 10 years old at the time - you know, lost his whole life and fled to the west. And he actually got lost in this in this chaos. They actually lost him. So he had to make his own way to Bavaria by foot in the craziness of the war. So that was a really very difficult chapter for him. After the war, he lived in - they suddenly lived in really great poverty. And with my mother, it was, you know, not quite as dramatic but also quite dramatic. They also had to flee. So basically I'm from a family of fugitive immigrants within their own country. But you know, it had one very positive aspect to it in that it really built a lifelong positive attitude towards the United States in our family because my - the Americans, when they took over parts of Germany in 1945, went into the schools and checked the German children for signs of undernourishment and found that my father had these massive signs of undernourishment and actually then came back for a period of two weeks every single day and force fed these children so that they wouldn't die on their watch. And so my father has this, you know, incredibly romantic - or had - he's been dead for 10 years - but this very, very romantic approach about how humanely people can be treated after a war. And I think many Germans experienced that at the hands of Americans. GROSS: You mentioned your grandfather had a castle... VON DONNERSMARCK: (Laughter) Yes. GROSS: ...Which the family had to flee. Your grandfather was a count. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yes, that's right. You know, so the - you know, theoretically the monarchy was abolished in 1918. So when my grandfather was 8 years old, he officially lost that title because he was - well, actually, no, a little older - he was from 1905. So when he was 13 years old, he lost the title. But de facto it went on. I mean, even in my passport is still the title graf, which means count. So I mean, it was played on as a game. You no longer had any legal privilege. We couldn't send people to prison anymore (laughter). I don't know what privileges my great grandfather still had. But you know, he still had the castle, the lands, all the property. And so he was a very, very wealthy man and then from one day to the next became incredibly poor because he truly had everything there in Silesia - the - all of the family's mining industries and agriculture and other companies and real estate. Everything was in Silesia. In fact shortly before the war, they'd even sold whatever they had in other parts of the world and concentrated all fully in Silesia because it seemed so promising in the industrial age to be right there. But of course then that was lost to Poland. And you know, he knew really what it was to go from great riches to great poverty. GROSS: Does the castle still exist? VON DONNERSMARCK: I mean, he had he had a few castles. One of them is still there. The main one was actually destroyed because they were such symbols of a capitalist era - that many of them were just destroyed so as to not remind people of (laughter) a chapter that they wanted to also forget. GROSS: What was it like for you - what is it like for you to come from a family that was connected to the monarchy and that many people saw as being, you know, an expression of capitalism? I mean, that doesn't strike me as what defines you (laughter), either capitalism or a monarchy. But... VON DONNERSMARCK: Well, no, no. GROSS: But you're connected to it. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yes. I mean, it - I think the one thing that it really does is it gives you a very live aspect, you know, or look into history. So, you know, an aristocratic family is no older than a non-aristocratic family. It's just the one difference is it has been recorded what people did over the centuries. So I can, you know, trace my ancestry back hundreds and hundreds of years and not just, you know, names. But, you know, I have the portraits and, you know, photographs as far as they reach back. And I know what these people did, what their positions were, how they felt about - I don't know - let's say a war that was going on, how they - I don't know - rebelled against the king here and, you know, were - how - in a way, whenever there's a chapter in European or world history for that matter, I can go back and look, what did my ancestors do at that time? And, you know - and they weren't unbelievably important people. You know, they weren't kings themselves. But they were close to all that. So it gives me a really interesting perspective into history. GROSS: Since your parents had to flee with just, like, a satchel, who saved the portraits? VON DONNERSMARCK: (Laughter) You know, it was actually - even though the aristocratic lords were portrayed as these savage exploiters, the population, actually, was very, very happy with the rule of my grandfather and my great-grandfather and, you know, as far back as we can go. And so, actually, the population around there saved these portraits and just hung onto them. And many of them only came back to us after the fall of the wall - can you believe it? - where people then from the communist parts would come and say, hey, look. We saved this portrait for you because my, you know, my grandfather still remembered how kindly you treated him and so on. And some of them came back - even were smuggled back out from the Eastern Bloc even during the Cold War. So every one of those portraits has a very, very adventurous story. And again, you know, it's living access to history. And just - in a way, if you have that access, you will never fall victim to cliches, you know, because you can always access, you know, historical archives or family stories that have been told over the generations. You can compare them with real history. It gives you a really interesting, I think, perspective, for which I'm grateful. So even if the money's gone (laughter), at least there's that other great treasure. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. He's a screenwriter and director who made the new film \"Never Look Away.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THEO BLECKMANN & FUMIO YASUDA'S \"DIE ALTEN WEISEN\") THEO BLECKMANN: (Vocalizing). GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is screenwriter and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who made the new film \"Never Look Away,\" which is set in Germany from 1937 to 1966 and follows one artist whose life is inspired by the real artist - the real German artist Gerhard Richter. That film was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign language film. And his first film \"The Lives Of Others\" won the Oscar for best foreign language film. So, you know, you mentioned your grandfather was a count and had a castle. Is this the same grandfather who was specializing - was a doctor of philosophy and specializing in the work of the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas? VON DONNERSMARCK: Yes, yes. GROSS: And so I read that when - that he was conscripted into the German army. And the first opportunity he had, he surrendered to the Americans. What's the story? VON DONNERSMARCK: You know, it was just - so he - his industrial and agricultural enterprise was, you know, considered important for the survival of that whole area. So he wasn't conscripted until the very last moment, where they just took in, you know, anyone, including children and senior citizens. And he - you know, he was really - I mean, he was the most peaceful, benign person imaginable. You know, in all the time that I knew him and all the stories that I've heard about him - since no one has ever managed to pick a fight with him. You know, he never - he was just one of those people who was constitutionally incapable of ever being anything other than polite and gentle. And so it was unimaginable to him, you know, to just be involved in any kind of war actions. And the Americans had a good reputation for treating officers kindly. He was automatically drafted into the army as an officer just by - because of his level of education. And then he - you know, as soon as he was put in uniform, he just - together with a cousin of his, they were - they just, you know, looked on the map to see, where were Americans stationed? - because you didn't want to be caught by Russians (laughter). They had a very different way with German prisoners of war - and made their way through the lines until they found American troops and surrendered to them. That was a fairly common thing at the time. But, you know, luckily, that way he was never in any kind of dangerous situation and, actually, made friendships with his American captors that lasted to the present day. GROSS: You wrote the first draft of your first film \"The Lives Of Others\" at a Cistercian monastery in the Vienna woods, where your uncle is the emeritus abbot. And my understanding is that this is an order that practices silence. And I imagine there's a lot of - it sounds like it's a pretty cloistered, you know, monastery. And I'm sure there's, like, some, you know, chanting or meditation involved. VON DONNERSMARCK: All the time. GROSS: So what was it like for you to write a film there? And were you - did you observe the silences and meditate and pray with the monks? VON DONNERSMARCK: Well, you know, it's really a beautiful and magical place, this monastery that was founded in the 12th century and has existed in the exact same way right to the present day. And there has not been a day since - what was it? I think 1190 or something like that where you did not have the exact same routine every single day. Actually, it almost died under the Nazis. They had arrested every single one except one of the monks. But he still kept that going. And then right after the Nazis were driven out, it all came back to full power. So there's an incredible power about the continuity of that observance there. And nothing has changed about the way that they live in those, you know, almost - you know, in those 850 years. And it's really a perfect place to work. I was given a monk's cell. And all these guys do is work and pray. And no, I didn't pray with them during the time that I was writing it there. But sometimes, I did go to the Gregorian chant prayer. But I said, you know, my prayer is going to be writing this screenplay. And my work is going to be writing this screenplay, but at least I won't be completely alone. You know, I'll get the food that the monks eat there. Monks eat quite well or at least a lot because they don't have that many other sensual pleasures that they can engage in. So very few of them are actually, you know, lean. So I enjoyed that part since I'm not all that lean myself. And it was a very good place to write. You know, there are just no distractions. You can't go to - I don't know - this dinner party or to, you know - I don't know - that interesting exhibition because there's truly nothing there. And it was a perfect way to focus. I recommend it to anyone. If you know a Cistercian somewhere, they actually have to - the great thing is it's part of the rule of St. Benedict that they have to take in guests. So if you go there and say, hey, will you invite me, they have to say yes. So they're very generous and very nice people. And hospitality is part of their code. So they will take you in. So if any of you want to write a symphony or a screenplay or a novel or just your dissertation, then go to a Benedictine monastery now. GROSS: Do you think that's better than a writers' colony? (Laughter). VON DONNERSMARCK: I've never tried a writers' colony. But I could imagine that there would be some kind of - I don't know - you know, let's say competition or dynamics or who is more important or, you know, is this person writing more than I am? In a monastery, you know, they're all praying more than you're writing, so... GROSS: (Laughter). VON DONNERSMARCK: You're - you've been outdone from moment one anyway. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, the director of the new film \"Never Look Away.\" He also made the 2006 movie \"The Lives Of Others,\" which won the Oscar for best foreign language film. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His new film \"Never Look Away\" is set in Germany from 1937 to 1966 and follows one artist whose life is inspired by the real German artist Gerhard Richter. So I read that you're a sleepwalker. Does that interfere with your life... VON DONNERSMARCK: (Laughter). GROSS: ...Or your work? VON DONNERSMARCK: Wow, you really researched very well. I mean, it certainly means that I don't sleep a lot because I'm always vaguely afraid of, you know, just running around or doing crazy stuff in my sleep. So you know, I still have the hope that at some point I'm going to cure that completely, but I haven't fully solved it yet. So yes (laughter), it does interfere with my life. GROSS: Do you remember sleepwalking episodes, or do they disappear? VON DONNERSMARCK: Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, it's - I mean, sometimes it's really led to very embarrassing situations. Like, my wife was - headed the international efforts of a big organization called Creative Commons that - you know, for example, Wikipedia is licensed under Creative Commons licenses. And she once had a conference where she invited people from all over the world who were adapting those license that they developed to their respective jurisdictions. And the conference was in Rio. And I went along as a babysitter. This was before \"The Lives Of Others.\" And we were all staying in this hotel, and I had, you know, my two children in the hotel room. My wife was out at a conference dinner with all these important lawyers from all over the world. And she was coordinating all this and giving the keynote speeches and all that. And suddenly, you know, then I fell asleep and had some kind of sleepwalking incident where I actually left the hotel room in my underwear and went down into the lobby and then found myself really waking up there in the lobby... GROSS: (Laughter). VON DONNERSMARCK: ...And had - you know, had nothing on me - no - obviously no identification - couldn't get back into the staircase - but as I'd gone up throughout the staircase because it was closed from that side. So I had to go to the receptionist. I was so praying that none of these lawyers would just show up there and then tell my wife that her husband is crazy or has disgraced her in some form. And then just had to convince them that - and it was also very dangerous. I had my two little children up in the room. And it was - then, actually, finally, I convinced them that they would come with me, you know, to bring me up there. And just as I thought that I'd escaped without anyone seeing, actually, the head of my wife's Japanese team came back early from that dinner and got into the elevator with us and, you know, to his credit, never told my wife a word. But now she knows. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: That sounds really horrible. VON DONNERSMARCK: Yeah, I don't know. I mean - so, you know, it leads to a lot of embarrassing situations. I mean, I never - even as a kid, I was never - you know, freedom we had - at a house that we had, there was this beautiful large, flat roof where - the other kids would sleep up there, and we'd have sleepovers and all that. And I obviously could never stay there because it was just, of course, much too dangerous. And, you know, I like to stay on the ground floor, maybe one floor up so that if something totally crazy happened, you know, at least I wouldn't be dead or something. So, you know, it's a little bit of an annoying thing to be a sleepwalker. But I - you know, I - there's an American comedian who actually had a show. I think he made a movie out of it called... GROSS: Mike Birbiglia. VON DONNERSMARCK: Exactly - called \"Sleepwalk With Me.\" And I went to that show because - and, you know, not a single one of the experiences that he describes there was - I mean, I'd been through every single one of those experiences. So I know that I'm not completely alone. And obviously, Birbiglia has never solved it. So, you know, maybe I will. But if not, it's - it gets a little less as you age - a little bit. You know, I used to have it several times a week. Now, maybe I have it, you know, maybe once a month or so. GROSS: All right. It's been so great to talk with you. And congratulations on your film. VON DONNERSMARCK: Oh, thank you very much, Terry. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thanks. GROSS: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck wrote and directed the new film \"Never Look Away.\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, my guest will be New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer. Her new article is about the close relationship between Fox News and the Trump White House. One of her revelations is that Fox News killed a story right before the 2016 election about Trump's relationship with Stormy Daniels. The story was squashed to help Trump win the election. I hope you'll join us. FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our technical director and engineer is Audrey Bentham. Our associate producer for digital media is Molly Seavy-Nesper.

Biden came under fire from fellow Democrats after his remarks on working with segregationists during his time in the U.S. Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in New Hampshire. Biden came under fire from fellow Democrats after his remarks on working with segregationists during his time in the U.S. Senate. Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET The day after former Vice President Joe Biden recalled his \"civil\" and productive working relationships decades ago with two longtime segregationist and racist fellow lawmakers, fellow Democrats are pouncing. At a New York City fundraiser Tuesday night, Biden told donors he has reached across the aisle throughout his career. \"I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,\" Biden said, according to a pool report. \"He never called me 'boy'; he always called me 'son.' \" \"Well, guess what? At least there was some civility,\" Biden said, also pointing to a working relationship he forged with Georgia Sen. Herman Talmadge, another segregationist Democrat. \"We got things done. We didn't agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore.\" Eastland represented Mississippi in the Senate for decades. He decried integration in public schools, the military and elsewhere and was a staunch opponent of civil rights legislation. At the height of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s landmark Montgomery bus boycott, Eastland told a segregationist rally that \"In every stage of the bus boycott we have been oppressed and degraded because of black, slimy, juicy, unbearably stinking n*****s.\" According to Robert Caro's Master Of The Senate, Eastland went on to urge the crowd to \"abolish the Negro race\" with \"guns, bows and arrows, slingshots, and knives.\" \"You don't joke about calling black men 'boys,' \" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of three black Democratic candidates for president, said in a statement Wednesday. \"Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone. I have to tell Vice President Biden, as someone I respect, that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together.\" Booker also said that he was disappointed Biden had not offered an immediate apology. Biden senior adviser Symone Sanders responded to the criticism in a series of tweets, saying in part that Biden \"did not praise a segregationist. That is a disingenuous take. He basically said sometimes in Congress, one has to work with terrible or down right racist folks to get some things done.\" .@JoeBiden did not praise a segregationist. That is a disingenuous take. He basically said sometimes in Congress, one has to work with terrible or down right racist folks to get things done. And then went on to say when you can't work with them, work around them. Booker wasn't the only other 2020 candidate to weigh in. California Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters at the Capitol, \"I have a great deal of respect for Vice President Biden. He's done very good work, and he has served our country in a very noble way. But to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong.\" Harris declined to say whether Biden should apologize for the comments. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that \"it's past time for apologies or evolution from Joe Biden. He repeatedly demonstrates that he is out of step with the values of the modern Democratic Party.\" It\u2019s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of \u201ccivility\u201d typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal &  that whites were entitled to \u201cthe pursuit of dead n*ggers.\" (1/2) pic.twitter.com/yoOOkpaTX2 Some of the sharpest criticism came from Connie Schultz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist married to Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. \"That segregationist never called you 'boy' because you are white,\" she tweeted. \"If you want to boast about your relationship with a racist, you are not who we need to succeed the racist in the White House.\" Throughout his career, Biden has said the civil rights movement was his motivation for entering politics. He has framed his 2020 presidential campaign as a rescue mission of sorts for the United States' national character, pointing to President Trump's response to the deadly 2017 Charlottesville white supremacist rallies as the moment he decided to enter the race. Polls repeatedly show Biden with far more support from voters of color than any other Democratic candidate, and many African American voters say their main reason for backing him are his eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. As Biden has maintained his double-digit lead on the rest of the 23-candidate field, fellow Democrats have begun to take increasingly vocal shots at Biden's moderate approach to governing. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both begun to routinely criticize incremental and \"middle ground\" Democratic policies, though both have made a point to, for the most part, avoid calling out Biden specifically. Biden's reminiscence for his \"civil\" and productive relationship with Talmadge and Eastland moved the criticism from implicit to explicit \u2014 and did so a week before Biden will appear on a televised debate stage with nine other Democratic candidates.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General William Barr took on a Senate committee to defend his summary of the Mueller report, even though Robert Mueller said Barr didn't get it right. Then, Barr skipped a House hearing.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump stands by his attorney general. Bill Barr took on a Senate committee to defend his summary of the Mueller report, even though Robert Mueller says he didn't get it right. Speaker Pelosi bluntly denounced the Barr testimony as lies, and then the attorney general didn't appear before a House committee. Ron Elving, senior Washington editor and correspondent, joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Glad to appear with you, Scott. SIMON: Oh (laughter) we have a bucket of fried chicken with your name on it here, my friend. In the maelstrom of all this political back and forth, the president had an hour-long phone call with Vladimir Putin yesterday, said it was very productive. ELVING: The president gave us the agenda for that talk in a tweet. He said they talked about trade, Venezuela, Ukraine, North Korea, nuclear arms control and then the, quote, \"Russia hoax.\" Now, that last phrase is a characterization of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. And it's been a characterization both Putin and Trump have been pushing for several years now. Of course, it's been flatly contradicted by the consensus of all U.S. intelligence agencies and the report of special counsel Robert Mueller. They all say it's no hoax. The Russians interfered in fact. So we can see why Putin denies all this. What's amazing is that Trump continues to take his word for it or at least say he does. SIMON: Attorney General Barr had a, as we noted, contentious hearing in the Senate and then didn't show up in the House, leading to some pictures of buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken that I believe Congressman Cohen seemed to enjoy chomping down on and angry words. ELVING: Yes. The attorney general said he would testify to House members but not if the committee was going to use practicing lawyers to question him, ask him courtroom-style questions, try to pin him down about the report that he's taken to calling his baby. This attorney general has been working hard to protect the president, or at least the office of the presidency, from the bad things in the Mueller report while repeatedly emphasizing there's no provable case of conspiracy with criminal content. And he does not want to get into a discussion of obstruction of justice, even though Mueller cited 10 potential cases of obstruction in his report. SIMON: Is this a certain amount of showing profile and posture on each side right now? Or will the House take action to compel the attorney general to testify? Because Speaker Pelosi did not mince words this week. She said that he had straight out lied to the Senate. ELVING: Lying to Congress is a crime, and refusal to comply with a subpoena - should the House issue a subpoena, which it may - is also something that can result in severe implications of a legal nature. And we are heading into weeks and months of confrontations, Scott. The House is simply not going to fold its case, or its multiple cases, just because the president doesn't want to cooperate or allow his aides and former aides to cooperate. And he's even trying to stop people who don't work for him anymore. This is what's called stonewalling. And this White House is stonewalling so aggressively, it suggests a desire to goad the House with greater and greater confrontations. SIMON: Which surprised me a little bit that the president spoke so much about Vladimir Putin yesterday when he met with the press in the Oval Office when you'd think he'd want to talk about the job numbers. ELVING: One hundred three months of job growth in a row - it's a new record. And now we should note that three-fourths of those months were under President Obama. But a good economy is a traveling trophy, and President Trump owns it now. Even inflation seems to be staying low. So this is a positive message that Republicans love and wish the president would focus on more exclusively or even more often than he does. SIMON: Ron Elving - senior Washington editor and correspondent. Thanks so much for being with us, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.
