            "article_content": "In 2016, Donald Trump captured 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia, a state hit hard by opioid overdoses.\n                \n                    \n                    BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 2016, Donald Trump captured 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia, a state hit hard by opioid overdoses. The fact that rural, economically disadvantaged parts of the country broke heavily for the Republican candidate in the 2016 election is well known. But Medicare data indicate that voters in areas that went for Trump weren't just hurting economically \u2014 many of them were receiving prescriptions for opioid painkillers. The findings were published Friday  in the medical journal JAMA Network Open. Researchers found a geographic relationship between support for Trump and prescriptions for opioid painkillers. It's easy to see similarities between the places hardest hit by the opioid epidemic and a map of Trump strongholds. \"When we look at the two maps, there was a clear overlap between counties that had high opioid use ... and the vote for Donald Trump,\" says Dr. James S. Goodwin, chair of geriatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and the study's lead author. \"There were blogs from various people saying there was this overlap. But we had national data.\" Goodwin and his team looked at data from Census Bureau, the 2016 election and Medicare Part D, a prescription drug program that serves the elderly and disabled. To estimate the prevalence of opioid use by county, the researchers used the percentage of enrollees who had received prescriptions for a three-month or longer supply of opioids. Goodwin says that prescription opioid use is strongly correlated with illicit opioid use, which can be hard to quantify. \"There are very inexact ways of measuring illegal opioid use,\" Goodwin says. \"All we can really measure with precision is legal opioid use.\" Goodwin's team examined how a variety of factors could have influenced each county's rate of chronic opioid prescriptions. After correcting for demographic variables such as age and race, Goodwin found that support for Trump in the 2016 election closely tracked opioid prescriptions. In counties with higher-than-average rates of chronic opioid prescriptions, 60 percent of the voters went for Trump. In the counties with lower-than-average rates, only 39 percent voted for Trump. A lot of this disparity could be chalked up to social factors and economic woes. Rural, economically-depressed counties went strongly for Trump in the 2016 election. These are the same places where opioid use is prevalent. As a result, opioid use and support for Trump might not be directly related, but rather two symptoms of the same problem \u2013 a lack of economic opportunity. To test this theory, Goodwin included other county-level factors in the analysis. These included factors such as unemployment rate, median income, how rural they are, education level, and religious service attendance, among others. These socioeconomic variables accounted for about two-thirds of the link between voter support for Trump and opioid rates, the paper's authors write. However, socioeconomic factors didn't explain all of the correlation seen in the study. \"It very well may be that if you're in a county that is dissolving because of opioids, you're looking around and you're seeing ruin. That can lead to a sense of despair,\" Goodwin says. \"You want something different. You want radical change.\" For voters in communities hit hard by the opioid epidemic, the unconventional Trump candidacy may have been the change people were looking for, Goodwin says. Dr. Nancy E. Morden, associate professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, agrees. \"People who reach for an opioid might also reach for ... near-term fixes,\" she says. \"I think that Donald Trump's campaign was a promise for near-term relief.\" Goodwin's study has limitations and can't establish that opioid use was a definitive factor in how people voted. \"With that kind of study design, you have to be cautious in terms of drawing any causal conclusions,\" cautions Elene Kennedy-Hendricks, an assistant scientist in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"The directionality is complicated.\" Goodwin acknowledges that the study has shortcomings. \"We were not implying causality, that the Trump vote caused opioids or that opioids caused the Trump vote,\" he cautions. \"We're talking about associations.\" Still, the study serves as an interesting example highlighting the links between economic opportunity, social issues and political behavior. \"The types of discussions around what drove the '16 election, and the forces that were behind that, should also be included when people are talking about the opioid epidemic,\" Goodwin says.",

End of year \"best of\" lists can be very revealing \u2014 in this case offering a peek into the world of our audience and what resonated with the most people. This year was filled with big news stories. The ones that grabbed the attention of NPR One listeners, the ones they spent the most time listening to, included President Trump's press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, and CNN's lawsuit seeking to reinstate correspondent Jim Acosta's White House press pass. Listeners in 2018 also showed a lot of affection for stories reporting on improving the lives of young people. A story that might help fix back pain also turned heads. These stories were marked as \"interesting\" or shared the most with others. But there was one story that stood out no matter what measure of success is considered: An interview with a writer who believes young people are avoiding intimacy. We know all this because the NPR One app collects data about listening. This information helps our curation staff and our algorithm (See details on our algorithm) present a mix of stories and podcasts specifically for you. And we can use this listening data to make these end-of-the-year lists! When listeners mark stories in the NPR One app as interesting, or share them, we can rank those stories by the amount of \"love\" they get. Here's what rose to the top. To Fix That Pain In Your Back, You Might Have To Change The Way You Sit Listen Read Perhaps your office is like the NPR newsroom in the number of standing desks that have appeared. Many of us are going to great lengths to try to keep our back pain at bay. NPR's science reporter Michaeleen Doucleff discovers the problem may be that we modern humans don't know how to sit properly. The trick is to imagine you have a tail that could wag!

For years, the standard advice has been that letting your baby sleep in bed with you was a dangerous practice that could cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS.) But Michaeleen Doucleff from NPR's science team takes a look at whether there is science back up the warnings. Young Americans Are Retreating From Intimacy Listen Read There are so many ways to connect with people these days from social media to the phones we keep by our sides (if not in our hands). You'd think it would mean we'd be more intimately connected to each other than ever before. But Kate Julian argues otherwise in her story in The Atlantic magazine. She talks with NPR's David Greene about her article \"The Sex Recession,\" which says young Americans are avoiding intimacy. Empowering Kids In An Anxious World Listen Read Back in my kid days, we had hours and hours of time to roam the neighborhood riding bikes and having adventures with nary a parent in sight. These days, though, free play is a thing of the past. Kids may be safer, but they aren't learning the social and emotional skills that develop when parents aren't there to protect them, direct them, and solve their problems. Corey Turner from NPR's education desk talks to the authors of two books that suggest that we need to empower kids by giving them the space to take risks and develop their own internal motivations. 5 Things To Encourage Brain Development In Your Little One Listen Read A researcher discovered five things parents and caregivers can do to give young children a head start in life.

His mentor is Elijah Taylor, a senior who grew up in Detroit.\n                \n                    \n                    Diane Weiss for The Hechinger Report\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cameron Russell (left) is a freshman at the University of Michigan from rural Louisiana. His mentor is Elijah Taylor, a senior who grew up in Detroit. Two students share a laptop in the atrium of the chemistry building at the University of Michigan. One, Cameron Russell, is white, a freshman from a rice-growing parish in Louisiana; the other, Elijah Taylor, is black, a senior and a native of Detroit. They are different, yes, but there is much that unites them. Both are the first in their families to go to a four-year college, a tough road Taylor has already traveled. Now he's serving as a mentor to Russell, whose rural background brings with it struggles that only a tiny handful of universities, including this one, are beginning to acknowledge and address. \"Most of the things he's asked me, I had exactly the same questions,\" says Taylor as the two discuss the tribulations of calculus and CHEM 351: Fundamentals of Biochemistry. (\"Once you get past 351, all is well,\" Taylor assures his mentee.) Taylor says neither student can \"call home and say, 'Mom, how do I navigate the college experience?' \" Many colleges and universities were caught by surprise when frustration among rural Americans spilled over into national politics during the 2016 election. That, in addition to steady declines in enrollment, has pushed some schools to pay more attention to rural students \u2014 and to recognize that these students need at least as much help navigating the college experience as low-income, first-generation racial and ethnic minorities from inner cities. Rural students graduate from high school at higher rates than urban students \u2014 and at about the same levels as their suburban counterparts. But only 59 percent then go straight to college, compared with 62 percent of urban and 67 percent of suburban high school graduates, according to the National Student Clearinghouse, which tracks this. And once they get to college, they're more likely to drop out. \"We never really came to terms with the fact that they needed extra support,\" says Naomi Norman, associate vice president for instruction at the University of Georgia, which in September launched a program to provide scholarships, mentors and other help to rural students. The University of Georgia is among a handful of four-year universities and colleges that provide financial and academic support to rural students along the same lines as what many offer urban ones. And most of these initiatives are recent. The Georgia program came about after a task force found that rural students have higher dropout rates than their classmates and couldn't afford the $1,500 fee for the existing summer program for incoming freshmen. The University of North Carolina system plans to increase rural enrollment by 11 percent by 2021, and several Pennsylvania universities and colleges have started scholarships for students from rural Schuylkill County, a onetime coal-producing area. \"It's fair to say that until fairly recently, we just took our rural students for granted,\" says Kent Trachte, president of Lycoming College, 20 percent of whose students come from rural Pennsylvania counties. (Lycoming recently received the second half of a $1 million grant to go toward scholarships for residents of two such counties.) The University of Michigan has begun extending the same kinds of financial and academic support to more and more rural students. Its Kessler Presidential Scholarship Program previously served mostly first-generation students from nearby Detroit and other cities; when the program started 10 years ago, that's where nine out of 10 of the participants came from. Now, nearly a third of this year's 36 new Kessler Scholars are from rural places. Life on campus Alexandra Rammacher finished high school with a graduating class of 180 in rural Charlotte, Mich. Her first impression of the 46,000-student Ann Arbor campus: \"There were so many people!\" She just wasn't used to it. \"Every day you would see a face you had never seen before \u2014 many faces you had never seen before,\" she says. \"I was used to seeing a group of people I already knew. It was just a huge there-are-people-in-the-world revelation.\" Alexandra Rammacher's first impression of the University of Michigan: \"There were so many people!\" Michigan is among a handful of schools extending special support to rural students.\n                \n                    \n                    Diane Weiss for The Hechinger Report\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexandra Rammacher's first impression of the University of Michigan: \"There were so many people!\" Michigan is among a handful of schools extending special support to rural students. Russell, the freshman from Louisiana, says his rocky start was academic. He had excelled at his small rural high school, but he failed his first college quiz while classmates from more privileged backgrounds sailed through. \"I was like, 'Holy cow. Whoa.' I had never made below a B on anything before. It was scary. It's not because I didn't know it, I just wasn't used to the way Michigan runs math.\" He asked his classmates for help, and his grades have since recovered. Setbacks like that perpetuate some of the many stereotypes that rural students say they face in college. \"They expect a yee-haw,\" Russell says. \"They expect me to be some extreme bigot.\" Freshman Lance Schwiderson came to Ann Arbor from Au Gres, Mich., where he was one of 55 students in his high school's graduating class. He says the people he has met in college \"always seem to think that I'm Republican. And poor. And a farmer.\" There are also genuine differences that make life on campus hard for rural students. One is financial. Students say they're acutely aware of the socioeconomic divide at the University of Michigan, where the median family income of students is $156,000, or three times the state average, according to the Harvard-based think tank Opportunity Insights. Ten percent come from families in the top 1 percent of earners, and only 16 percent from the bottom 60 percent. \"Everybody else has got the coin that I don't have. Those Canada Goose jackets? You're kidding,\" Schwiderson says, referring to the brand of parkas other Michigan students wear, which can cost up to $1,550. \"I'm walking down the road and I see people with Gucci or Versace.\" That's about more than fashion, says Kendra Beaudoin, a sophomore from Lake Linden, Mich., population 1,007 and about a 10-hour drive north of Ann Arbor. It's a reminder that some students have families with the resources to help them overcome the complexities of college, while others don't. \"It's almost like a sense of entitlement,\" Beaudoin says. \"Some students, they're comfortable, they're relaxed, they're OK with talking back to the teachers or arguing a grade.\" Beaudoin is the daughter of a single mother, and she helped raise her four younger siblings. Back home, she didn't know a lot of people with a bachelor's degree; fewer than 1 in 5 rural adults aged 25 and older have them, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. At Michigan, Beaudoin is majoring in biopsychology, cognition and neural science and has co-founded a club for first-generation students to give one another moral support and advice. \"I'm still intimidated by professors. Going to office hours is terrifying,\" she says. \"There were definitely moments when I was like, 'I'm only going here to fill a diversity quota and I don't really belong here and everybody else is so much smarter than me.' \" When Kendra Beaudoin first got to the University of Michigan campus, she didn't understand crosswalks: \"Those don't exist where I lived.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Diane Weiss for The Hechinger Report\n                    \n                \nhide caption When Kendra Beaudoin first got to the University of Michigan campus, she didn't understand crosswalks: \"Those don't exist where I lived.\" Other obstacles are more mundane. Take crosswalks. \"Those don't exist where I lived,\" Beaudoin says. She stops and waits for the light to change while other pedestrians brush past her. When her phone broke, leaving her without one for several months, she used a paper map to find her way around campus. She still has trouble figuring out the bus system. Yet, as someone from a rural place where self-sufficiency is valued, \"The idea of going to someone and asking how this works ... it was almost like I felt bad for not knowing.\" Universities have been slow to recognize these hurdles. \"There's still some way to go here,\" says Gail Gibson, director of Michigan's Kessler Presidential Scholars Program. In fall 2019, the program will add scholarships and academic support for up to 20 students from the state's predominantly rural Upper Peninsula. Also next fall, Cornell University is launching its own program, which it modeled after Michigan's. When rural isn't visible One challenge faculty and staff face in helping rural students: They often don't realize that rural students, who are predominantly white, need the extra help. \"If you are an instructor in a class looking out, you cannot identify [a first-generation rural student] in the way you might say, 'Well, I have an African-American student in this class,' or, 'I have a student of Muslim identity in this class.' So we start there,\" Gibson says. \"What the student is experiencing in a classroom situation or in a dorm situation may or may not be visible.\" There are other reasons universities are suddenly addressing this group. One is self-interest. As the number of 18- to 24-year-olds declines and a robust economy draws more people straight into the workforce, enrollment at universities and colleges has fallen by 2.9 million since its last peak in 2011. Institutions need to find more students, and rural America has an underutilized supply. Another reason is political. \"If we want to increase conversations across party lines and ideologies, we have to be exposed to one another,\" says Sonja Ardoin, assistant professor for student affairs administration at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, and a onetime rural student herself. Lycoming College's Kent Trachte adds, \"We in higher education had better be thinking about how do we bring together young people from these different backgrounds to a place where they can hopefully have civil discourse.\" Rebecca Goodman, a freshman, tells people she lives \"near Holland\" because hardly anyone at the University of Michigan has ever heard of her tiny hometown. An astrophysics major, she said she \"felt lost a lot of time the first few weeks on campus.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Diane Weiss for The Hechinger Report\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rebecca Goodman, a freshman, tells people she lives \"near Holland\" because hardly anyone at the University of Michigan has ever heard of her tiny hometown. An astrophysics major, she said she \"felt lost a lot of time the first few weeks on campus.\" Having conversations on campus doesn't always lead to dialogue back home \u2014 especially because many of the rural students we talked to at Michigan said they don't expect to return \u2014 even if they want to. \"I'd have this degree and want to do something with it, but there's not really too much of an opportunity to,\" says Beaudoin, the sophomore from the Upper Peninsula. Schwiderson, from Au Gres, Mich., told his mentor he didn't even want to go home for his winter break. \"I don't want to be back in small-town America,\" he says. \"It's right that a lot of people from rural towns are conservative, and that's not me so I don't love going home and butting heads with people who never leave and never open themselves up to something different. They're just going to stay on the same farm their whole life with the same values and do the same thing. I'm just trying to experience everything.\" Russell has a more nuanced take: \"I told my mom over the summer before I came here, I said, 'Mom I think this was my last year in Crowley.' And that made me cry thinking about it because I love where I'm from and I'm going to miss my family.\" But Cameron knows that if he wants to finish his degree and pursue a career in biochemistry, he's not going back to Crowley, La., any time soon.

            "article_content": "How Tragedy Sparked a Movement by March for Our Lives Founders Hardcover, 218 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Mass movements are rarely set into motion by the work of just one or two individuals. Instead, they generally rely on the skills and efforts of many. While one or two faces often serve as the group's mouthpiece \u2014 faces at which both admiration and condemnation are directed \u2014 behind them are many more who are equally responsible for inciting and sustaining the cause. In the case of March For Our Lives \u2014 a gun violence prevention movement born out of a mass shooting in Feb. 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 arguably the most easily recognizable faces and names are those of David Hogg and Emma Gonz\u00e1lez. But behind March For Our Lives, one of the largest youth-led movements in recent history, are many other names and faces. And in their new book Glimmer of Hope: How Tragedy Sparked a Movement, 25 individuals, identified by name as well as collectively as the \"founders of March For Our Lives,\" share a detailed account of the effort required to launch a mass movement. Parkland was the site of one of the worst mass shootings in American history, claiming the lives of 17 students and teachers and injuring 17 more. Almost immediately after, a group of students emerged who were focused on channeling the intense emotions they experienced in the aftermath into a rallying cry for social and political change. The book, which consists of individual and group essays, excerpts from speeches delivered at rallies and marches in the months that followed, the content of social media posts on Facebook and Twitter, and conversational dialogue provides a chronological account across a variety of perspectives. It includes writings about related aspects from the moments of confusion and terror on the day of the shooting, to the students' return to school two weeks later, to the march in Washington D.C. Along with their words are photos: some from professional services and wires \u2014 but many taken with cell phones, including group selfies. This collection also serves as a practical guide on how to launch a movement in the digital age. The students outline the approach they took to build a social media presence, channel attention from news outlets, raise funds, connect with elected officials, design merchandise, and lobby for gun control legislation. While many have argued that adolescents belonging to Generation Z have been negatively influenced by their digital upbringing, the success of March For Our Lives \u2014 in terms of building a movement and engaging others \u2014 is an example of tech-savvy teenagers who have effectively wielded what they have alluded to as their socioeconomic privilege, platform, and social media power. The timing of the book's release may help to return the subject of the Parkland shooting to national consciousness just in time for midterms elections, encouraging voters to elect officials who will fulfill some of the Parkland survivors' asks. (These asks, of which there are 10, are clearly listed at the end of the book.) It follows up on the June release of #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line, by siblings and shooting survivors David and Lauren Hogg, which acts as both a memoir and a manifesto. There are moments reading Glimmer when you may forget that the leaders of March For Our Lives are kids. Some of the book's authors are still too young to vote. But this book will also help you remember. They succumb to clich\u00e9s in their writing. At time their prose is redundant. But in their short lives, they have not only survived a mass shooting, they have also channeled their emotions into coherent writing. They are now published authors. The most powerful chapter of the book comes in the form of a transcript-like aggregation of conversational stanzas from 15 of the book's authors concerning their first day back at school on Feb. 28. It opens with a line from Adam Alhanti: \"There's no handbook for rebuilding after a school shooting. No one knew what to do.\" And that is exactly what the chapter conveys, the messy myriad of reactions and responses from students and the inability of the school district's actions to please everyone. It is in this chapter that the students also take the time to mention the reactions of their teachers, a perspective that has been under-discussed. Their comments are observational and pensive. They notice the unexpected moments of quiet. They toe the discarded Valentines that still litter the floor. Some students are comforted by the police officers in the halls cradling handguns. Others are horrified. Still others are fuming. Some feel protected. Others patronized. For some, the soft return to school complete with therapy dogs, Play-Doh, and coloring is appreciated. Others can't stop worrying about their grades. There is no one way to respond to tragedy. There is no one way to be a teenager. In allowing more than a dozen students to challenge one another, forming the structure of the book (they at times contradict themselves, sandwiching their comments one after another), the collection attempts to uncover the incredible complexity of addressing a community where each individual grieves differently. While the book is meant to follow the founders of a movement in the days, weeks, and months after an event that has permanently altered their lives, it draws attention to the voices that still need to be heard. After reading these stories, despite their diversity, they are still limited. The voices are almost exclusively older students, many of which have now graduated. What is life like at Parkland today for the students and teachers who remain? A lot has changed in the eight months since the Parkland shooting. Just last week, This American Life reported on how life has changed at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas. According to producer Robyn Semien, who spoke to teachers and students still at the school this Fall, there are new gates, new fences, and new cameras installed on campus. Students must submit to gym bag searches. Staff members use key cards to enter buildings. Trauma kits are stocked in every room. There are 15 campus monitors when last year there were only five. Marjory Stoneman Douglas is doing its best to move on. But Glimmer shows that many of their students are consciously choosing not to. They are deferring plans for the future, many have decided to take a gap year or two before starting college, in order to stay in the present. Yet at the same time, their work is focused on the future \u2014 aiming to ensuring that Parkland is the last mass school shooting in their lifetimes. It's fitting, then, that 100 percent of the authors' proceeds from the essay collection, as well as a percentage of Penguin Random House profits, are set to be donated to the March for Our Lives Fund.

Childhood obesity was on the decline, or so it seemed. Both scientific journals and media outlets, including from NPR as late as 2012, have reported within the last decade that its numbers were moving down. The numbers have moved \u2014 in the wrong direction, according to a prominent new study which shows the highest spike in obesity among children 2 - 5 since 1999 and recent NPR coverage. Listeners pointed to fad diets, genetics and food insecurity as reasons they've encountered childhood obesity. Dr. David Ludwig of Boston Children's Hospital has been studying these factors for decades. He spoke with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about these factors and what science got wrong about obesity. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. On how the media got the numbers so wrong The false numbers saying childhood obesity was on the decline seemed to make sense after Michelle Obama's Let's Move! program and other prominent public health measures \u2014 public health experts had hoped that obesity prevalence would respond to these efforts. Unfortunately, as we now know from these new statistics, those efforts were a mirage rather than a true glimmer. When you look at short-term studies, movement in the result numbers can go up and down without any real meaning. Looking back, public health experts now know that the changes we thought we saw were really just statistical flukes, and that obesity rates among children are the highest ever. On the different ways that children are susceptible to obesity Usually, what makes an adult gain weight will make a child gain weight, too \u2014 but there are some unique factors that apply to kids. Home environments and parenting practices are key for keeping children healthy. It's not enough to just tell a child what to eat; as parents, we need to model it ourselves. We need to create an environment that's conducive to healthy weight for everyone, but we've created an environment that's done the opposite. On how that \"opposite\" environment came to be We didn't get the science right. We told people to cut back on foods with fat, but many of those foods are actually healthy: Avocado, nuts and olive oil don't produce excessive weight gain, and are quite filling. We told people to load up on processed carbohydrates, and gave sugary beverages a pass. Foremost, we need to get the science right. Then we have to adjust our government's policies by putting public health over the political interests of the food industry. On why children of color experience different rates of obesity Rates of childhood obesity are unfortunately rising among everybody, and they're increasing fastest among children of color. That may have a lot to do with socioeconomic factors: In our modern world, it takes money to pursue a healthy diet and engage in safe, physical recreation activities after school and on the weekends. For low-income families, the obstacles to a healthy diet and lifestyle can be excessively high. On public health policy changes in the Trump administration There are many concerns with food and obesity policy today. First is that our current policy lacks a vision for how we can bring together all of the necessary forces to attack the causes of childhood obesity. It's not enough to give kids good, preventative healthcare in their childhood pediatric visits once a year. Kids need decent food at school, and unfortunately, many of the improvements made in school lunch programs are now being revised. Kids also need the opportunity to move their bodies every day, but for many kids, physical education classes are just once or twice a week. On what actions anyone can take to build a healthier world We all have to work together to make the world healthier for everyone. We can do that with the ballot, by voting for legislators that are willing to put public health ahead of special interest. Food science isn't rocket science \u2014 we know the steps needed to achieve a healthy lifestyle, we've just lacked political will. Until we can create an environment that supports everyone's health, it's up to parents to create a bastion of health in their homes. NPR&#x27;s Emily Sullivan produced this story for digital.",

            "article_content": "A majority of Americans didn't vote in recent midterm elections. Nonvoters tend to have less education and income, like those in McDowell County, W.Va., who feel overlooked by the political system.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Voters from both parties appear highly engaged this year. But in every election, tens of millions of people don't vote - either because of barriers to voting or apathy or inconvenience. NPR's Don Gonyea went to the county with the lowest voter turnout rate in one of the lowest turnout states, West Virginia, to find out why people there sit out. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: McDowell County is so steeped in coal culture that in the summertime the local theater group features a play about a true tale of murder, the miners union and the coal bosses in the 1920s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Well, I'm telling you to stand... UNIDENTIFIED ENSEMBLE: Stand. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: ...Fight... UNIDENTIFIED ENSEMBLE: Fight. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: ...Unite... UNIDENTIFIED ENSEMBLE: Unite. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: ...And declare war and justice on these evil coal barons and their political pimps. GONYEA: Coal still drives the politics here. Long a sure bet for Democrats, McDowell County has gone solidly Republican in recent national elections. Trump, with promises to save the coal industry, won 75 percent of the votes in the county in 2016. Forty-two-year-old Tammy Lester, who was downtown running errands with her 13-year-old daughter, says she likes Trump, but she's not seeing much good for the economy. TAMMY LESTER: He's doing pretty good, I guess. But, you know, he promised all these jobs. Where they at down here? You know, I think they just overlook West Virginia. GONYEA: Unemployment in the county is 9.3 percent. More than 1 in 3 live below the poverty line. Lester's support of Trump and her frustration with the economy make her a pretty typical resident here. She's got a lot of company in another area too. I'll just ask the question. Do you vote? LESTER: No, sometimes. GONYEA: No, sometimes - that means? LESTER: It's iffy. GONYEA: You're not really committed to it. LESTER: No. GONYEA: She is registered but can't recall the last time she voted. Turnout in McDowell County was the worst in the state, 36 percent, in 2016. Lester tells me she works at a fast-food restaurant. She says politicians, from the president on down, don't care what happens here. LESTER: Yeah, when our kids graduate, they have to leave. I just had my middle son graduate. He's got to leave. My daughter, when she graduates, where's she going to go? She'll have to leave. GONYEA: Thirty-two-year-old Josh Mullins is another nonvoter, but he is a Democrat. JOSH MULLINS: I just don't think we needed someone like Trump in office. I mean, he's got a mouth on him that may get us in trouble. GONYEA: Mullins is currently laid off from a restaurant job. MULLINS: I just - I don't think my vote matters. GONYEA: Not at all? MULLINS: No. I mean, Hillary won the popular vote, and we still have Trump for president. GONYEA: So that kind of makes you down on the whole... MULLINS: Yes. GONYEA: So the Electoral College fuels his cynicism about voting - finally to 26-year-old Brittany Jenkins, who sits in front of a floral shop she owns with her mom in the city of Welch. She is registered to vote but says she's only done so three times and only when she's actually known the person running for local office. She does not vote for president or governor - her reasoning... BRITTANY JENKINS: Because we don't matter. We're so small. It really don't matter. I mean, literally look. You look up and down the streets. There's nobody. GONYEA: She says it's like this place isn't even on anybody's radar - especially politicians'. So you feel kind of disconnected from the whole political process here? JENKINS: Yeah, I mean, disconnected from the world - period. I mean, we've just kind of been washed off the map. GONYEA: And when you see ads on television, or when flyers for candidates show up in your mailbox, what do you think of that? JENKINS: I've never got a flyer out of my mailbox. GONYEA: No flyers, no targeted direct mail - it's something I heard from several people in McDowell County. They just feel ignored by any candidate who's not local. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

Salvini said his right-wing coalition had the \"right and the duty\" to form a government after taking 37 percent of the vote in the weekend election. The Italian political world has been struck by a populist tsunami \u2014 50 percent of voters in Sunday's parliamentary elections chose candidates from anti-establishment, anti-immigrant and euroskeptic parties. However, no party amassed enough votes to form a government on its own, and this makes weeks of political instability likely while government negotiations are underway. \"Italy ungovernable,\" read a Monday headline in the daily La Stampa. The Italian populist parties' success is the worst blow to the European Union since British voters chose to leave the EU two years ago. The two big winners in Sunday's vote are now vying for control of Italy's next government: League leader Matteo Salvini was jubilant when he appeared before reporters Monday morning. \"I am proud to call myself a populist,\" he said. He claimed his party's strong showing gave him the \"right and duty\" to run the next government. An hour later, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio made the same claim for his party. \"We are a political force that represents the entire nation,\" he declared. \"We represent the entire boot, from Val d'Aosta to Sicily.\" Italy's populist 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio (center) is surrounded by bodyguards as he arrives to give a press conference on Monday in Rome.\n                \n                    \n                    Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Italy's populist 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio (center) is surrounded by bodyguards as he arrives to give a press conference on Monday in Rome. Should the two parties end up governing \u2014 either jointly or on their own \u2014 that could have a negative impact on Italy's traditional pro-Atlantic alliance stance and its relations with the United States. Both parties have little interest in a united Europe \u2014 the League's slogan is \"Italians First\" \u2014 and both are pro-Russia, calling for an end to economic sanctions. Both have praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the past, both parties had also called for a referendum on whether Italy should remain in the single-currency eurozone \u2014 although they backtracked on that during the campaign. On Monday, the League's Salvini said that \"the euro was a mistake\" and has proposed renegotiating Italy's many intricate treaties with the EU. Italy's center-left coalition is the big loser after Sunday's election. The Democratic Party, which has run the government since 2013, came in at less than 20 percent, its lowest showing ever. Italy's economy has improved in recent years, but the Democrats paid the price for a still-sluggish recovery and the migrant influx. La progression spectaculaire et l'arriv\u00e9e en t\u00eate de la coalition de La Ligue emmen\u00e9e par notre alli\u00e9 et ami @matteosalvinimi est une nouvelle \u00e9tape du r\u00e9veil des peuples !Chaleureuses f\u00e9licitations ! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb MLP#Elezioni2018 #Italie\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, a runner-up in last year's French presidential election and a strong critic of the European Union, welcomed Italy's election result, tweeting, \"The spectacular advance and top showing of the League coalition led by our ally and friend Matteo Salvini is a new stage in the awakening of the people!\" European governments, meanwhile, reacted cautiously. Along with France, both Germany and the Netherlands managed to push back major wins by their own populists in elections last year. As they digest Sunday's results, Italy's EU partners will have some soul-searching to do about having left Italy on its own to handle an influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants, and imposing draconian austerity measures that stymied the country's economic growth. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"cautious at this stage\" about the election results, but acknowledged Italy had been under \"heavy migratory pressure\" for a long time. The League blames the arrival of more than 600,000 migrants in the last four years on the outgoing center-left government. It campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of immigrants, and one of its slogans was \"I want back the Italy my grandparents left me.\" The 5-Star Movement wants the immediate repatriation of tens of thousands of migrants \u2014 which cannot be done without repatriation deals with the countries of origin, of which today there are very few. 5-Star's campaign promises included a so-called \"citizen's income,\" which would give Italians below the poverty line as much as 780 euros ($960) a month. And it wants to lower the retirement age for pensioners. Should either party \u2014 or both \u2014 end up governing, analysts say they are likely to increase government spending, which would only add to Italy's massive public debt, already at 130 percent of GDP. On Monday, Italy's stock market was down, while trading on global markets was higher. Italy's shares and bonds were weakened following news of the election results, as was the euro. It will be weeks before the political outcome of the elections is clear. First, the new parliament will be seated and it will elect Senate and House speakers. Italian President Sergio Mattarella will entrust someone with the task of trying to form a coalition. That could be the League's Salvini, as leader of the biggest coalition. Or it could be 5-Star's Di Maio, as leader of the single biggest party. The problem, however, is that 5-Star has always rejected the notion of power-sharing. Perhaps that will change in coming weeks. If no one can form a government, it's possible that another election will be held in the coming months. But that would not likely stop the populist wave. A sign of what is at stake in Italy was the presence in Rome over the weekend of Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. Before the vote, he was quoted in the New York Times as saying that Italy's election \"epitomizes everything, it is pure populism... The Italian people have gone farther, in a shorter period of time, than the British did for Brexit and the Americans did for Trump ... Italy is the leader.\" \"Oh yes,\" said one dejected voter in Rome. \"Italy is always ahead of the others. We created fascism, we had the biggest communist party in the West, and now our populists are taking over.\"",

The Senate bill would require the Census Bureau to protect all sexual orientation and gender identity information it collects.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Bowmer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marchers carry an LGBTQ pride flag during the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City in June. The Senate bill would require the Census Bureau to protect all sexual orientation and gender identity information it collects. A group of Democratic senators have introduced a bill on Tuesday that would require the U.S. census and the country's largest survey to start directly asking about sexual orientation and gender identity. If the Census Equality Act becomes law, sexual orientation and gender identity questions would have to be added to forms for the census by 2030 and for the American Community Survey \u2014 a survey that about 1 in 38 households are required by federal law to complete every year \u2014 by 2020. Forms for both the American Community Survey and the census \u2014 which the Constitution requires every person in the U.S. to take part in \u2014 have long allowed people to select \"male\" or \"female\" as their sex. In March, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that the 2020 census questionnaires will include new relationship categories differentiating between \"same-sex\" and \"opposite-sex\" couples. That change, some demographers say, could produce the most comprehensive national data yet on same-sex couples. The new bill \u2014 introduced by Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tom Carper, D-Del. \u2014 could expand that data set further to include LGBTQ people who are not in relationships as well as people whose gender identities do not align with the sex assigned to them at birth. \"The spirit of the census is that no one should go uncounted and no one should be invisible,\" Harris said in a written statement. \"We must expand data collections efforts to ensure the LGBTQ community is not only seen, but fully accounted for in terms of government resources provided.\" Harris and the other Democrats behind the bill say this information could help more LGBTQ people get access to Medicaid, Section 8 housing vouchers and food aid through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP. According to a 2013 report by the Williams Institute, income levels of lesbian, gay and bisexual people are more likely than those of heterosexual people to fall below the federal poverty line. More comprehensive data about LGBTQ people could also help better enforce civil rights protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and prove those cases in court. Still, some data privacy experts worry the information could be used against LGBTQ people, especially when many states do not have laws banning  workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Senate bill would require the Census Bureau to protect all sexual orientation and gender identity information it collects under the same privacy standards for other types of data. Federal law prohibits the bureau from releasing any census information that would identify individuals until 72 years after it is collected. But the agency can release anonymized data about specific demographic groups at levels as detailed as a specific neighborhood. While the bill defines sexual orientation as either homosexuality, heterosexuality or bisexuality, it is not clear what response options for sexual orientation or gender identity would appear on the Census Bureau's questionnaires. The agency would be asked to conduct research to come up with a plan to develop the new questions within a year after the bill becomes a law. During the Obama administration, federal agencies formed a working group to discuss how best to collect sexual orientation and gender identity, or SOGI, information on federal surveys. One of the group's reports notes the challenge in deciding how to word these questions given the varying terms used by different generations and cultures. \"Careful attention must be paid to the translation of SOGI questions because other languages may not have terms for the SOGI concepts or only have terms that are offensive,\" wrote members of the Federal Interagency Working Group on Improving Measurement of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Federal Surveys. Prior to the election of President Trump, four federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Justice Department, had asked to add these questions to the American Community Survey; the Census Bureau decided to not move forward with the requests, as NPR has reported. \"Valid, reliable, and nationally representative data on sexual orientation and gender identity are essential to HUD fulfilling its mission,\" then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro wrote in a June 2016 letter to former Census Bureau Director John Thompson. The Justice Department's request said that among the reasons it needed that data is \"to enforce the prohibition against unlawful employment discrimination\" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But after DOJ officials under the Trump administration stood down on the agency's request because it \"requires thorough analysis and careful consideration,\" Census Bureau officials concluded there was \"no federal data need.\"",

Voters in Nebraska may get to decide whether their state expands Medicaid this November. Supporters of Nebraska's Medicaid expansion campaign, Insure the Good Life, turned in petitions bearing more than 133,000 signatures to the secretary of state Thursday. If 85,000 are validated, the issue will appear on ballots this fall. \"Now people will speak out and get the job done that should have been done long ago,\" says state Sen. Adam Morfeld, a Democrat from Lincoln, Neb. He has introduced two failed proposals to expand Medicaid in the Legislature. If it places the issue before voters, Nebraska will join Utah, where a ballot measure has been certified, and likely Idaho, where signatures are expected to be submitted for certification Friday. Montana's voters may also vote on a measure to extend their existing expansion, which is set to expire in 2019. So far, 34 states have approved expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The expansion grants eligibility to many low-income adults who were previously excluded from the government-funded health care program. Last year, Maine residents bypassed the Legislature and voted to expand Medicaid, although that expansion has been held up by a funding dispute with Gov. Paul LePage. In Nebraska, multiple expansion proposals have been blocked over the past six years \u2014 by a coalition of conservative legislators. Thursday's submission of the petition signatures drew immediate opposition from the local chapter of the Koch Network-backed Americans For Prosperity, which vowed to oppose the pro-expansion campaign. \"Enrollment has far outpaced estimates in states where Medicaid was expanded,\" says Jessica Shelburn, Americans For Prosperity's Nebraska director. \"As a result, states are left scrambling for ways to cover budget shortfalls while still paying for other essential community services like education and public safety.\" Supporters of Medicaid expansion lug boxes of petitions to the Nebraska secretary of state's office Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Fred Knapp/NET News\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Medicaid expansion lug boxes of petitions to the Nebraska secretary of state's office Thursday. But Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a government- and foundation-supported policy research group, says such budget discussion should take into account increased tax revenues and economic activity. \"Of the states that have done detailed estimates of what effect does Medicaid expansion have on the budget generally it's been found to be a net gain for the state,\" he says. Supporters say expansion could bring health insurance to around 90,000 low-income Nebraskans \u2014 single people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or $16,753 a year, or $34,638 for a four-person household. By law, the federal government would be required to pay 90 percent of the cost of that additional coverage. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts questions that guarantee and has said many times that he opposes Medicaid expansion on fiscal grounds. \"We cannot trust the Federal Government's long-term financial commitment to state programs,\" Ricketts wrote in a column on his website. And opponents argue even the 10 percent state share of the cost could threaten other spending priorities, like education and roads. Ricketts said at a news conference Thursday he is concerned about shifting Medicaid's focus from \"the people who are truly vulnerable.\" He suggested the Medicaid expansion population's needs can be addressed \"through the private sector, by creating jobs that have those types of benefits.\" Though he is in the midst of a re-election campaign and his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Bob Krist, supports Medicaid expansion, Ricketts says he will not participate in a campaign against Medicaid expansion. He says he will focus on his own campaign instead. Nebraska county election officials are now starting to check the more than 133,000 petition signatures against voting rolls. It is likely to be mid-August before the results are made official, but supporters are confident they have enough for Medicaid expansion to be on the ballot. Many of those signatures were collected by paid petition circulators, paid out of Insure the Good Life's roughly $1 million campaign. The campaign's last spending report showed nearly three-quarters of its money came from Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit The Fairness Project, which is backed by health care labor unions. About two dozen Nebraska nonprofits supported the campaign.

Even if the proposed expansion makes it onto the ballot and voters approve it, the fight may not be over, says the Urban Institute's Buettgens, citing the continuing battle in Maine. \"The referendum will not be enough,\" he says. \"There has to be a practical, funded plan to implement it in the state. And that will require the Legislature and the governor to cooperate and go along with that.\" The states where Medicaid expansion has been most successful have state government support, Buettgens adds. Whatever happens next, the months-long process of gathering those signatures has had value beyond meeting the legal requirements, says initiative supporter Becky Gould. Gould heads Nebraska Appleseed, a legal advocacy group for low-income people that is part of the expansion campaign. On a sweltering summer evening a few days before the petition drive ended, Gould walked house to house in search of a few more petition signatures in the little town of Valparaiso, Neb., population 570. On the front porch of one house, after Gould made her pitch, the owner said she wasn't interested. Gould was undeterred. \"In these times, it feels like having those conversations is just as important as having the ones where people sign,\" she says. \"We can agreeably disagree on things and know that that's OK.\" And Gould says going door to door has reinforced her support for the issue. She talks about one woman she met who had been left uninsured and struggling when her husband died. \"I think those stories like that remind you of why you're doing this,\" she says. \"There's a lot of people out there who need access to just basic health care.\"",

            "article_content": "Still reeling from damages caused by Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico's financial situation is in major free fall. The federal oversight board ordered Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to cut public pensions by 10 percent.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We want to head to Puerto Rico now. The damage caused by Hurricane Maria is not the island's only crisis. It is also in the middle of a fiscal crisis. To start turning that around, this week, a federal board with power over the island's finances ordered the governor to cut public pensions. NPR's Adrian Florido reports that the governor said, no, setting up a battle for control of the island's financial future. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Shortly after the governor said no, Franciso Flores was sitting on a plaza near the governor's mansion. He's 64, a retired mechanic for the city of San Juan. He lives on his government pension. FRANCISO FLORES: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: He says, \"Puerto Rico's pensions allow you to survive, nothing more.\" But he says his pension is 600 a month at a few hundred in Social Security, and his monthly income is about $1000. That's right around the poverty line. FLORES: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: On top of that, Flores says, \"the price of utilities and food is going up.\" He says he probably couldn't live on less than he does now. But he may have to, and here's why. Puerto Rico has been massively in debt for years. In 2016, Congress did two things to pull it out of its fiscal crisis. It allowed the island to seek protection from its creditors, and it created the financial oversight board with power over the island's finances. This week, the board ordered a long list of cost-cutting measures, including cutting public pensions an average of 10 percent. To Flores, it came as no surprise. He holds a view held by many on the island. FLORES: (Speaking Spanish). FLORIDO: \"Here in Puerto Rico,\" he says, \"it's that fiscal board that has the power, not the governor.\" The governor, Ricardo Rossello, has said, not so fast. RICARDO ROSSELLO: On matters of public policy, it is the government that has the decision-making power. FLORIDO: Rossello has said he will implement many of the board's cost-cutting measures, but has refused to cut pensions or vacation or sick time or Christmas bonuses for workers. ROSSELLO: And so on those matters that we oppose - those are just not going to be seen in the legislature nor in my desk. FLORIDO: Puerto Rico is very much still recovering from Hurricane Maria as it prepares for the next hurricane. At the same time, an even larger struggle is playing out. Its governor and the federal oversight board are in a war of words over who has the power to set the island's fiscal policy. On Thursday, Jose Carrion, the federal board's chairman, issued a warning. (SOUNBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSE CARRION: (Through interpreter) We hope the government and the legislature will comply. We don't want to sue the government, but we have to fulfill the duties that we understand the law gives us. MARIELY LOPEZ-SANTANA: It's basically a question of sovereignty, autonomy and, in the end, who is ultimately responsible for making decisions in Puerto Rico? FLORIDO: Mariely Lopez-Santana is a political scientist at George Mason University. She says the question of who gets the last word on fiscal policy can't be answered yet. The board's powers haven't been fully tested in court. Professor Lopez-Santana points out that, in fact, the board and the governor agree on many policies - tax reform, cuts to the school system, consolidating government agencies and selling off the island's electrical grid. But politically, Lopez-Santana says the governor has to oppose the board. LOPEZ-SANTANA: The governor cares about winning election, so even if it's cheap talk, he's gonna say, well, I'm gonna protect my people. I'm going to protect pensions - all that. FLORIDO: Rossello has asked the members of the oversight board to reconsider their demands. If they don't, the governor says he's prepared to fight the board in court.

The results highlight the divide between voters, even in conservative states, who generally support providing health benefits to the poor, and conservative politicians who have rejected the expansion, which is a central part of the Affordable Care Act. With the approval of the measures in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska, about 300,000 low-income people will gain access to health care coverage, according to estimates from government agencies and advocacy groups in those states. \"People are enthusiastic about Medicaid expansion because they recognize that it's both good for health care but it's also a compassionate thing to do,\" says Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which worked to get the questions on the ballots of the four states. \"And it's a financially sound thing to do. It's a fiscally responsible thing to do.\" The Fairness Project is funded by the SEIU United Healthcare Workers West, a California health care workers union. Voters in Montana, however, appeared to reject a proposal to raise taxes on tobacco and e-cigarettes to continue funding the state's expansion of Medicaid, which is set to sunset next year, leaving 100,000 Montanans at risk of losing coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, the government health insurance for the poor and disabled, was reserved mainly for pregnant women, children, low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Since the law passed, 32 states, plus the District of Columbia, have expanded access to childless adults whose incomes are below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. That cutoff is $16,753 for a single person and $34,638 for a family of four. Maine voters approved an expansion in 2017, but Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, has resisted implementing the law, even vetoing a $60 million funding bill that passed the Legislature. LePage was barred by term limits from seeking another term. Democrat Janet Mills, Maine's governor-elect, has pledged to expand Medicaid on her first day in office. One person who stands to gain coverage in Utah is Grant Burningham, of Bountiful. \"Most of us are ecstatic,\" he said, referring to his friends who worked to get the measure passed. \"We were all together and hugging and kissing last night.\" Burningham has spent the past several years working for this day. A former financial adviser, he became seriously ill after having a severe reaction to a medication in 2001, lost his job, his home and his health care. Burningham now has a place to live, and hopes that access to health care will help him get back on his feet. Still, he's a bit wary that members of the Utah Legislature will try to do something to derail the results before the expansion of Medicaid can be implemented next spring. \"We had a win last night. But we still have the fourth quarter to go through,\" he said. \"A lot of us are deadly sick and we'll still wait until April (after the state's legislative session ends) to turn in our applications.\" Utah has come close to expanding Medicaid several times in recent years. But those efforts were blocked by conservatives in the state's House of Representatives. Burningham says it was necessary to put the question directly to voters \"because so many of our politicians have been out of touch with their constituents.\" That's why voters had to step in, says The Fairness Project's Schleifer, who helped organize the campaign to put the measure on Utah's ballot. \"This election proves that politicians who fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act got it wrong. Americans want to live in a country where everyone can go to the doctor without going bankrupt. Expanding access to health care isn't a blue state value or a red state value; it's an American value,\" Schleifer said in a statement. Utah will pay for its share of expansion costs by increasing the state's sales tax by 0.15 percentage points to 4.85 percent, which works out to about 1.5 cents for every $10 residents spend on nonfood purchases. The federal government pays for 90 percent of the health care costs incurred by those who get Medicaid benefits through the expansion measures. RyLee Curtis, campaign managers for Utah Decides, an advocacy group that campaigned for the expansion, says many of the 150,000 Utahans who will benefit are employed, and about a third are parents. \"They're working one or more jobs and they're unable to afford health care coverage,\" she says. Nebraska and Idaho also had Medicaid questions on ballots in their states. In Nebraska, about 90,000 people are now eligible for coverage. And a study by two University of Nebraska professors, commissioned by the Nebraska Hospital Association, concluded that the expansion would cost the state about $148 million over three years but bring $1.36 billion in federal health funding into the state over the same time frame. The Nebraska analysis is one of several that suggest expanding Medicaid can also help improve employment in a state by supporting health care jobs. In Idaho, Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican, endorsed the expansion initiative a week before Election Day. Montana, voters appeared to reject a ballot measure to continue that state's expansion, which originally passed in the state's legislature in 2015, but included a built-in expiration date. The Montana measure would have continued funding for Medicaid expansion with a combination of taxes on tobacco and e-cigarettes. The tobacco industry strongly opposed the measure. Tobacco giant Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, contributed about $17 million on cash and loans to Montanans Against Tax Hikes, which opposed the measure, according to the state's Campaign Electronic Reporting System.",

It was the summer of 2013 and Daniel Handel had just moved to Rwanda. He was unpacking boxes in his new house, when his wife walked over with her laptop and said, 'You have to listen to this radio story!' The piece she played him was by NPR's Planet Money team, and it profiled a charity that was testing a bold idea: Instead of giving people in poor countries, say, livestock or job training to help improve their standard of living, why not just give them cash and let them decide how best to spend it? Handel was fascinated \u2014 because for some time he had been mulling this exact question. He was an economist with USAID \u2014 the U.S. government's main agency for distributing foreign assistance. And although he'd only been with USAID for two years, Handel had already grown concerned over what he saw as an agency habit of spending enormous sums on programs to help poor people, only to boost their incomes by a fraction of the program's per-person cost. At this rate, Handel had often thought to himself, might it be better to just hand over the money to people directly? Now it turned out there was a charity doing precisely that. (Indeed the charity's name is GiveDirectly.) Handel wasn't ready to propose completely scrapping traditional programs in favor of cash aid. But at the very least it seemed reasonable to make sure that any given traditional program produced more benefits than simply giving people an equivalent amount in cash. In other words, he wanted to use cash aid as the benchmark by which all other forms of aid are judged. So Handel went to his bosses at USAID's Rwanda office and proposed an experiment: Take one of USAID's typical programs and test it against cash aid. His initiative has since grown to encompass six experiments in four countries. He is currently overseeing these tests from a new position, senior adviser on aid effectiveness at a USAID research unit in Washington, D.C. USAID would not grant permission for Daniel Handel or any other agency official to do an interview with NPR. The account of his wife playing him the radio story and his subsequent experiences launching the cash-benchmarking experiments were described to NPR by multiple sources, including former USAID colleagues who worked extensively with him on the experiments. It will take several years for most of the findings to become available. But on Thursday, the government released the results of the first study in the series: An evaluation of a program to improve child and maternal health in Rwanda by teaching families about nutrition and hygiene. The experiment found that the program met none of its main objectives. (Offering people the equivalent amount in cash \u2014 about $114 \u2014 also did not improve their nutrition or health. But providing a much larger cash grant of about $500 did make some difference.) Supporters of such \"cash-benchmarking\" exercises are heralding this particular one as a milestone. For years, anti-poverty advocates and researchers have complained that the U.S. government doesn't do enough to make sure its aid programs actually work. \"The number and quality of impact evaluations at USAID has risen over time, but it's still really small,\" says Amanda Glassman, the chief operating officer for the think tank Center for Global Development. Now, she says, USAID's nascent cash-benchmarking experiments suggest the United States \u2013 which is one of the world's largest donor countries \u2014 could be on a path to greater accountability. But the many hoops that Handel has already had to jump through may speak just as powerfully to the challenges of truly transforming how USAID does business. As does the reaction to the study's findings within USAID itself. Asked why USAID would not authorize an interview with Handel or any other official to discuss the cash-benchmarking experiments, an agency spokesman declined to comment but provided a statement. It said, in part, \"cash-benchmarking is not relevant to most of USAID's programs.\" The statement further noted that this particular experiment was \"very limited\" and commissioned \"under the Obama administration,\" and concluded that \"there is not sufficient evidence that this approach can be applied to development programs on a broader scale\" even as USAID \"is consistently looking for ways to develop, test and validate new and innovative approaches.\" Joaquin Carbonell, one of Handel's former colleagues interviewed by NPR, recalls being a little surprised when he first laid eyes on him. The two had started collaborating on the cash-benchmarking effort while Carbonell was based at USAID's Washington, D.C. headquarters and Handel was still in Rwanda. They spoke regularly over the phone for about a year before they finally met in person. \"I was expecting this big person and here's this five-foot-seven red-headed guy in a three-piece-suit,\" says Carbonell, who is now a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. \"He's so full of energy and he was pushing this thing with such verve, he's just larger than life in my mind. He likes to say that he's from New Jersey, so he doesn't take crap from anybody.\" It was a useful quality as Handel embarked on a quest that Carbonell says was \"quixotic from the beginning.\" He did, at least, have some key allies. Handel's bosses at USAID Rwanda were very much on board. As were the leaders of the division where Carbonell worked \u2014 the Global Development Lab, a unit within the agency that helps fund and evaluate innovative initiatives. The lab also provided Handel with some crucial connections. Another colleague there happened to know that Google's charitable arm was interested in funding further experiments with cash aid by GiveDirectly, the charity featured in the Planet Money radio piece Handel had heard. GiveDirectly, which was founded by four American graduate students of economics, was an appealing potential partner for Handel because it had already worked out an efficient system for identifying recipients and delivering cash to them through mobile phones. At that point its work was limited to Kenya. But Handel quickly hammered out a plan to collaborate with the charity on launching a cash aid venture in Rwanda that could be tested by USAID as part of what became a $4 million venture. From that point, however, the process ground to a crawl as the team began a months-long series of briefings of USAID higher-ups and members of Congress. Traditional-style aid programs with much larger budgets are often pushed through in far less time, says Carbonell. \"But when you talk about giving money to people straight up, with no conditions, people at USAID look at you kind of like you're a crazy person.\" To be sure, he says, there are reasonable questions about what the evidence suggests cash grants can actually accomplish. In fact it's the subject of a lively debate among experts well beyond USAID. Berk Ozler, lead economist at the World Bank's Development Research Group, is one of the cash-aid skeptics. Over the last decade, notes Ozler, cash aid has evolved from a niche idea to one of the hottest research topics among poverty researchers. The result has been a pile of studies suggesting that in many cases cash grants can provide a more effective safety net than other forms of aid. In the process, \"all of a sudden the narrative [on cash aid] became, 'This is the panacea.' \" The trouble, says Ozler, is that most of these early studies necessarily focused on short time frames. But when it comes to the ultimate goal of many aid programs \u2013 permanently lifting people out of poverty \u2013 \"unfortunately the recent slew of papers [on cash aid] that have been coming out are not promising.\" Still, Ozler says, this doesn't mean traditional programs are any better. So he's all in favor of using cash aid as a benchmark to ensure that all programs, whatever their type, are as cost-effective as possible. So why did the idea cause jitters at USAID? Carbonell says a lot of the concerns expressed to him while he was there seemed to be less about substance than about optics. \"In this country we don't like giving poor people money,\" he says. There's \"an inherent sense\" that they can't be trusted to spend it wisely. No matter, Carbonell adds, that the research strongly indicates that poor people don't spend cash aid on vices like tobacco and alcohol. \"We don't want to be seen as just giving handouts to poor people,\" he says. \"And that is a very deeply ingrained fear at USAID.\" It's also the reason, \"there was all this language wrangling that happened. The lawyers [within USAID] were saying, 'Well, we can't call these cash transfers. We've got to call it household grants.' It was a year of just bureaucratic jiujitsu to get this thing to a point where everybody had signed off.\" By then it was August of 2015. And in a certain sense the timing was lucky because it just so happened that USAID Rwanda was about to roll out a major nutrition and health program in cooperation with the Rwandan government. The country has made tremendous strides in improving its population's health in recent years. But one stubborn problem that remains is malnutrition among children. Large shares of Rwanda's kids are underweight and short for their age \u2013 a sign of serious nutrition deficits that cause health and cognitive problems into adulthood and that often contribute to keeping people in poverty. The new program would be sending USAID-funded teams from village to village, identifying at-risk families and educating the parents about practices that can make a difference \u2013 how to plant a more diverse range of foods to feed their kids, for example, or how to follow basic hygiene routines that prevent diseases like diarrhea, which contribute to poor growth in kids. \"They teach people about hand-washing practices. How where people go to the bathroom relates to the likelihood of getting sick afterwards, things like that,\" says Andrew Zeitlin, an economist at Georgetown University who was on the team that USAID commissioned to compare the program with cash aid. Zeitlin adds that there was a lot to be gained by assessing whether this particular program was effective. \"It's a nationwide program. And it's in sync with the way lots of aid agencies and national governments in neighboring countries and around the world try to tackle these problems.\" The experiment that he and his collaborators set up was a rare head-to-head, simultaneous comparison of cash aid and a traditional program. A pool of families from nearly 250 villages was selected based on the typical criteria for determining who was at risk of malnutrition, then randomly assigned to one of four groups. Those in the first were the \"control\" and received no help. Those in the second group were visited by the teams from the nutrition and hygiene program. Families in the third group were given small cash grants by GiveDirectly equivalent to the per-person cost of the nutrition and hygiene program, which ultimately averaged out at $114. In the final group, families got a much larger cash grant of around $500 \u2013 a figure chosen because this was the amount that GiveDirectly estimated was more likely to make an impact. Then independent evaluators employed by another partner, the research group Innovations for Poverty Action, monitored a host of measures over the course of a year: How much did the children weigh? How much food were they consuming? How diverse was their diet? Even as the study was being set up, it seemed so promising that officials back at USAID's Global Development Lab in Washington \u2013 specifically its Development Innovation Ventures, or DIV, department \u2013 agreed to help Handel launch similar experiments in other countries. Soon they hired him to oversee the effort. Anne Healy was working at the U.S. State Department when word filtered to her of this, as she puts it, \"stealth mode\" plan to introduce cash-benchmarking at USAID. Healy was so intrigued she decided to pursue a job as head of DIV. \"It was really an exciting moment to be able to say, 'Okay, this is not just one experiment happening in one place with one program. This actually has the potential to be a global initiative at USAID and really, with that, the potential for transformational change.' \" But as Handel and members of the DIV team traveled through about 30 countries pitching the USAID country missions on the idea, they ran into a new obstacle. Over and over again, Healy says, staffers at the country missions would say, this is politically risky. \"It was a theme that every mission had to grapple with,\" she says. \"If the results of a cash benchmarking experiment demonstrate that our non-cash USAID program was either lower impact or less cost effective ... that would open up USAID to criticisms from Congress and the American public.\" Such a reaction would be unfair, adds Healy, who has since left USAID for the nonprofit Evidence Action. She argues that a disappointing assessment shouldn't lead to the conclusion that foreign aid is wasteful and pointless. It's just a sign you need to figure out how to improve the program. But Healy doesn't fault USAID staffers for worrying about a possible backlash from Congress or the public. \"It's a real risk,\" she says. And she adds, the risk has only increased since the election of a president who has complained that the U.S. spends too much helping people in other countries instead of looking after its own, and whose proposed budgets have included deep cuts to foreign aid. \"I think it's a particularly challenging time for government agencies to pursue evidence-based policymaking,\" says Healy. Yet for all the qualms, by the fall of 2017 the USAID offices for three more countries \u2013 Liberia, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 agreed to set up cash-benchmarking experiments. And the Rwanda office agreed to a second experiment testing the effectiveness of a job-training program. Carbonell says he and Handel made a point of setting up these experiments on a timetable that ensured they would be well underway before the results from the study of the Rwanda nutrition program came in. There seemed a good chance that the program would compare poorly to cash aid on, at the very least, cost-effectiveness given how little overhead cash aid requires. \"We didn't want to give people the opportunity to get cold feet,\" says Carbonell. \"And you know these kinds of findings could really force a strong reaction from the leadership within USAID.\" In February of this year, the results of the Rwanda study came back. Zeitlin, the independent researcher, recalls his reaction as he and his collaborator, Craig McIntosh of University California San Diego, combed through the data: \"I mean, our hearts sank.\" A year on, the children who had been targeted by the nutrition and hygiene program were no more likely to eat a better or more diverse diet, and no less likely to be malnourished or anemic than children who had gotten no help at all. The program's focus on trying to change behaviors is one of the world's major strategies for ending malnutrition. And, at least in this example, it had failed to achieve any of its primary goals. But within USAID a pushback was brewing. Over the ensuing weeks experts on nutrition and other relevant areas questioned just how illuminating the study really was. Among the complaints, says McIntosh, \"there is a general sense that the time frame of the study being only one year is problematic.\" Running the study over a longer period wasn't an option because it would have required leaving the families in the control group without help for that much longer. And this was a program that Rwanda's government wanted to extend to the entire population. The World Bank's Berk Ozler, who has reviewed the study, agrees the time horizon was less than ideal. \"It's a good study. But there is that limitation,\" he says. But McIntosh says it's worth noting that when it comes to child nutrition programs time is of the essence. And the fact that the larger grant of $500 did improve children's health, albeit slightly, suggests it's not impossible to make a difference in a short period of time. He and Zeitler say perhaps the answer is to shift the focus from trying to change people's behavior in favor of getting them additional resources. Michael Faye, co-founder of GiveDirectly, the charity that ran the cash-aid arms of the experiment, emphasizes another takeaway. Giving people no-strings cash grants lets them pursue their own priorities. And so cash aid tends to point up when those priorities might be different from the goals of the donors who fund traditional programs. In this case, for example, people who were given the cost-equivalent grants used much of the money to pay down their debts. Perhaps in their view that was a more urgent need than giving their children more food. It doesn't mean they are right, says Faye. But if donors are going to override recipients' preferences, they should at least recognize that's what they're doing. \"For a long time the donor's vote has counted for almost everything,\" says Faye. \"In people's lives their vote should count for something.\" As for USAID's take, it remains unclear what, if any, material changes the agency is planning to its nutrition efforts based on the study's findings. They were published on a government website this week in accordance with a statutory requirement that the results of government-funded studies of foreign aid must be made public within 90 days of their completion. Healy says she's at once concerned and hopeful. As hard as it was to launch the cash-benchmarking experiments, \"the true test will be how USAID acts on these results.\"",

            "article_content": "We have a recap of elections in several states. Also, the latest in the Paul Manafort trial and a federal court decision with lasting repercussions for Puerto Rico's government.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Ohio voters went to the polls yesterday in the last special congressional election before the 2018 midterms. And David, it has turned out to be a bit of a nail-biter. DAVID GREENE, HOST: It sure has. And the outcome of this is going to determine whether a House district outside Columbus, Ohio, will stay in Republican hands for the rest of this year - which sounds like it's not the biggest deal in the world. But this race has been drawing a whole lot of national attention because of what it might signal about how the parties are going to fare come November's midterm elections. As things stand right now, Republican Troy Balderson leads Democrat Danny O'Connor by less than 1 percentage point, about 1,800 votes or so, not great for Republicans considering this is a district that President Trump carried in 2016 by 11 percent. Now, The Associated Press says this race is still too close to call. There are about 8,000 provisional or absentee ballots that still have to be counted. MARTIN: All right, let's talk with NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, Republicans obviously did not want this to be a close race. And yet, this is where we're at right now. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, look. That's why Republicans spent millions of dollars to try to win this race. It appears that Balderson, at this point, is at least in the lead. He's ahead by some 1,754 votes, as David noted, some 0.9 percentage points ahead. Now, that's important because if the gap closes to within 0.5 percentage points, it would trigger an automatic recount. There are some 3,400 provisional ballots that are out. So O'Connor's team hoping that he can make up a difference, needing a little over 700 votes, or about 60 percent of the remaining provisionals and absentee ballots. But regardless, this was a lot closer... MARTIN: Right. MONTANARO: ...Than Republicans would have wanted it to be. The Congressional Leadership Fund, for example, warning this morning - they're the group that kind of helps these guys win in some of these places, outside group - said that while they won tonight, it remains a very tough political environment and that they can't expect to win tough races when their candidate's being outraised. MARTIN: Right. So Democrats, even if they lose this seat, clearly, that'll be a loss that will hurt them. But the bigger picture is they're competitive in places they didn't think they'd be. MONTANARO: Absolutely. Look. There are 69 Republican-held districts that Trump carried in 2016 by less than the margin that he won in this area or that Hillary Clinton won outright. So that expands the map significantly... MARTIN: Right. MONTANARO: ...When Democrats only need 23 seats to take back the House. MARTIN: OK. There's another close race in Kansas that we're watching in the GOP primary for governor. What happened there? MONTANARO: Well, so far, for governor, you have Kris Kobach, who's the attorney general, running for governor who has the backing of President Trump. With about 95 percent of the votes in, Kobach is slightly ahead by only about 600 votes over the incumbent. Now, remember, Trump endorsed Kobach. He's the guy who ran Trump's Election Integrity Commission - so someone that Trump has some loyalty to. MARTIN: And a major upset in Missouri, a major win for organized labor in that state, right? MONTANARO: Right. With the right-to-work law that had been - looked like it was going to go into place and - unions pushed, spent millions of dollars and were able to get it removed. MARTIN: NPR senior political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much, Domenico. We appreciate it. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. Paul Manafort's lawyers got their chance to cross-examine Manafort's former business partner Rick Gates, and they pressured him to admit his own wrongdoings. GREENE: Which he did. He detailed all of his own crimes, years of embezzlement and the possibility that he might have stolen money from President Trump's inaugural committee. Plus, he was forced to reveal an extramarital affair. It was not all about him, though. Gates also testified that Paul Manafort personally directed the creation of false financial statements and hid income in order to evade taxes. MARTIN: NPR's Ryan Lucas has been covering the trial and joins us now. Hey, Ryan. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So all this admitted wrongdoing by Rick Gates gave Manafort's defense attorneys an avenue of attack that has been anticipated. Right? They are going after Rick Gates' credibility. LUCAS: Absolutely. Manafort attorney Kevin Downing took Gates and the jury yesterday through, really, a lengthy list of wrongdoing that Gates has acknowledged as well as new allegations that Downing threw at him. So Gates was forced to explain to the jury how he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from his former business partner Paul Manafort. Downing also brought up fraud allegations as well as what Downing repeatedly referred to as Gates' secret life. So that forced Gates to acknowledge, on the stand, to having an affair with a woman in London around a decade ago. Downing also dinged Gates on lies that he told the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators. And Gates struggled with this question, even though he's pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Now, Downing remarked at one point that Gates had excellent recall when questioned by prosecutors but can't remember much now when he's confronted with his own wrongdoing by the defense. Now, this line of questioning came to a head several hours into the afternoon when Downing asked Gates how, after all the lies that Gates has told and the fraud he's committed, how can he expect the jury to believe him? And Gates said the jury can believe him. And he said because... MARTIN: Can or can't? LUCAS: Can. MARTIN: Can. LUCAS: They should... MARTIN: Oh. LUCAS: ...because, he said, I'm here to tell the truth and take responsibility for my actions. Mr. Manafort, he said, had the same path. I'm trying to change. MARTIN: Right. Also, he loses whatever grace he's been granted by the feds when it comes to his own prison sentence if he lies on the stand. LUCAS: That's exactly right. The plea agreement was something that Downing dug into as well. Gates' plea agreement - he acknowledged actually under questioning - Gates did - that he could face decades in prison if convicted. And he did acknowledge that under his deal, he could receive a shorter sentence in exchange for his testimony. If he lies, though, as you said, that's out the door. MARTIN: So what happens now, Ryan? What happens today? LUCAS: Well, the defense has another hour or so of cross-examination of Gates this morning. We expect them to continue to really dig in on him. They have - really, their whole case is based around Rick Gates and trying to convince the jury that Gates is responsible for much of the trouble that Manafort finds himself in. After that, prosecutors will have another chance to question Gates to undo any damage that may have been done to his credibility in the eyes of the jury. And after that, we hear to expect from maybe a few more government witnesses, including an FBI agent. But we do appear to be coming closer at least to the end of the case. We expect the government to wrap up its case by the end of this week for sure. MARTIN: OK. NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thanks so much, Ryan. LUCAS: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Puerto Rico no longer has control of its fiscal future. GREENE: That's right. A federal court has ruled that Puerto Rico has to cede some powers to a fiscal oversight board, which was created by Congress two years ago, to try and manage the U.S. territory's tenuous financial situation. So you really have to ask what this all means for the island as it continues to try and rebuild after Hurricane Maria. MARTIN: All right. OK. NPR's Adrian Florido is joining us now from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Adrian, first, just start off by explaining what this fiscal oversight board is. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Well, it's seven people in charge of fixing the island's finances. Remember that Puerto Rico owes bondholders more than $70 billion, money which it cannot pay. MARTIN: We should say, it had a lot of debt even before the storm happened. FLORIDO: Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is an ongoing problem. It's been years in the making. And so two years ago, Congress allowed Puerto Rico to effectively declare bankruptcy, to restructure this debt. But it also created this board with huge power to make decisions about the island's finances in order to get it out of this debt. MARTIN: Yeah. FLORIDO: And so one way this board is trying to do that is by, essentially, trying to get the government to implement all kinds of spending cuts and reforms, something that is causing some tension - a significant amount of tension in Puerto Rico with the elected government there. MARTIN: So the government basically got frustrated and then sued over this. What were they arguing? FLORIDO: Well, they argued that the fiscal board has the authority to recommend fiscal policy and budget changes but not to force the government to implement some of these austerity measures. So one example - in Puerto Rico, public workers are entitled by law to a Christmas bonus. The board wants that bonus eliminated. So in its budget for the government, it didn't include enough money for it. And that's something the government has argued, you know, they can't do. And so the fundamental question - right? - is when it comes to fiscal policy, to fiscal reform, to the budget, who has the final say? And you know, yesterday, this federal judge ruled that it is this appointed board, not the elected government of Puerto Rico - that this appointed board has the power to overrule Puerto Rico's government. MARTIN: Wow. So you know, I can't imagine that the government in Puerto Rico is very pleased with this decision. FLORIDO: No. No, it's not. The governor, Ricardo Rossello, said it was proof that Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory, is in fact more like a U.S. colony. He called it a, quote, \"undignified relationship.\" On the other hand, you have members of this oversight board, some of whom, I should mention, are from Puerto Rico. But others are from the mainland U.S. They welcome the ruling. They said it was time for the governor to start implementing these cuts and austerity reforms that he's been resisting. And they called these cuts and reforms a roadmap for a better future for Puerto Rico. MARTIN: What are the practical implications of this for Puerto Ricans? FLORIDO: Well, there are the implications for governance on the island and also for people's lives, right? So in terms of governance, it obviously means that the island's elected governor and its legislature now have much less authority than they've been claiming to have. And in terms of people's lives, it means that, you know, people on the island can expect more cuts to services, benefits, even pensions possibly. Some of these cuts have already begun, like, to public education and to health benefits. And on an island, Rachel, where about half of its 3.4 million people live in poverty, these cuts can slice really deep. MARTIN: Right. NPR's Adrian Florido reporting from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Adrian, thanks so much. We appreciate it. FLORIDO: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF POPULOUS' \"CANOE CANOA\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In Baghdad's Qishla square, where the British crowned Iraq's first king almost a century ago, a young paramilitary fighter in a camouflage tent shows off a tabletop model of Iraq's recent battles against ISIS. \"We wanted to show people where the battles were in their country and how we liberated these areas from the terrorist ISIS,\" says Neuman Ibrahim. At 20, the slight young man is a veteran fighter with the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahel al-Haq militia. Ibrahim is part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly of Shiite militias that answered a religious call to fight ISIS four years ago. They are now nominally under command of the Iraqi government and are one of the factors that make Iraq's parliamentary elections on Saturday \u2014 the fourth since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 \u2014 the most complicated in the country's post-war history. \"God willing, everyone will vote, because we need to try to change the government,\" says Ibrahim. \"We will see whether it will be good for us or not.\" Much has changed since Iraq's last election, which took place four years ago. ISIS is mostly gone, and security has improved immensely. But past governments and a history of mismanagement and rampant corruption have left their mark. This year, the field is crowded with almost 7,000 candidates \u2014 including a former prime minister, a paramilitary leader and more women than ever before \u2014 running for 329 seats throughout Iraq's 19 provinces. The election features the biggest number of parties and coalitions since 2003, according to analysts. They range from Islamic religious parties to Communists. The large number is partly a result of increased rivalry among Iraq's dominant Shiite parties. While Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is expected to win enough votes to form a government, he faces strong competition from a Shiite former militia leader, Hadi al-Amiri. Former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who is from the same Shiite Dawa party as Abadi, is also running against the current prime minister.

Twenty-four million Iraqis are eligible to vote. Many of them are young. More than 3 million Iraqis have turned 18 since the last elections, according to election analysts, and they're eligible to vote for the first time. But almost a million eligible voters are still displaced by the battle against ISIS, most of them in Sunni areas \u2014 and it's unclear how many will be able to cast their ballots. With the loss of Kurdish territory to Iraqi government forces, this election will also mark a diminished Kurdish presence in parliament. At its height, ISIS controlled one-third of Iraqi territory. Now it controls less than 2 percent. The militias that stepped in when Iraqi army divisions collapsed are now under the nominal command of the Iraqi government and are an integral part of politics. Many have bypassed a ban on paramilitary forces fielding election candidates by creating separate political wings. Abadi's strongest rival Under a system established while the U.S. was in charge, Iraq's prime minister is from the Shiite majority, the parliament speaker is Sunni and the president, who holds a largely ceremonial position, is Kurdish. All three positions will be determined indirectly by Saturday's elections.

Amiri, the strongest rival to Abadi's bid for re-election as prime minister, is the head of the PMF. He returned to Iraq in 2003 after spending 20 years in exile in Iran, launching attacks on Saddam Hussein's forces. His close ties to Iran were evident during Iraq's recent fight against ISIS, when he was often seen on Iraqi battlefields with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard commander Qassim Soleimani. \"People appreciate the huge sacrifices by the PMF members to preserve and protect Iraq,\" Amiri tells NPR. A skilled politician and former Iraqi transport minister, Amiri has seen his political fortunes buoyed by victories on the battlefield. But driving out ISIS has come at a huge cost. He says 7,000 PMF fighters were killed fighting ISIS. Thousands of regular Iraqi security forces also lost their lives in three years of bitter fighting, after ISIS fighters took control of Iraqi cities in north and central Iraq in 2014. \"They want to see the state moving on from war\" Abadi was chosen as prime minister in 2014 as an alternative to what was seen as Maliki's deeply sectarian and divisive rule in his second term as prime minister from 2010 to 2014. A British-educated engineer who's viewed as a moderate, Abadi is also campaigning on the country's victory over ISIS. But he is seen as having more appeal to Iraq's Sunni Muslims than Amiri. He has also, unusually, campaigned in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, emphasizing his government's achievement in defeating ISIS and his promise to reconstruct the country. \"We are up to it,\" says the slogan on parliamentary candidate Hanan Nouri al-Rubaye's billboard in Baghdad.

Young men cheered as he raised his hands in a victory salute. The turnout was small. Sadr City bears the name of the revered family of Abadi's political rival Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric venerated by millions, and forms the urban base of Sadr's support. Sadr's militia fought U.S. forces after the 2003 invasion, but he disbanded his political wing for these elections and threw his support behind an unlikely alliance of secularists and Communists.

Iraq has some of the world's biggest oil reserves, but according to its planning minister, 30 percent of Iraqis are considered to be under the poverty line. Twenty percent of workers under 30 are officially unemployed, although the actual number is believed to be higher.

I can't pay the rent,\" he continued, wiping his eyes as he displayed the last few dinars in his shirt pocket. \"Look at all these young men. This is a country with oil and gas and people are going hungry.\" \"Whoever has a gun is right\" This election features more women running for parliament \u2014 almost 40 percent of candidates \u2014 than in previous polls. But according to diplomats and activists, the increased presence of female candidates has sparked a backlash in some quarters. Sex videos supposedly showing five female candidates have been circulated on social media during the campaign. At least one of the candidates dropped out of the race after a video was circulated, although she denied the video was real. \"I think the intention is to drive women away from the political parties,\" says Hanaa Edwar, a women's rights activist. \"It is not only that \u2014 I am sorry to say their parties have not defended them.\" Edwar, the founder of a humanitarian assistance organization called the Iraqi al-Amal Association, says the focus on the videos is aimed at diverting attention from real issues in the campaign. In a country routinely ranked as one of the most corrupt in the world, many candidates face an uphill battle to restore faith in Iraq's tarnished parliament. Many Iraqis say they won't bother voting this time. \"I voted three times, but nothing changed,\" says Yassar Jabar on a recent Friday in Qishla square. Jabar, 29, graduated from university four years ago but hasn't been able to find a job. \"I voted for people who didn't do anything for us,\" he says. Nearby, Shalan Zeidan stands over his books spread on the sidewalk for the Friday book market. Art books in English and Arabic, hardback novels and academic journals in English and Arabic lie in careful stacks. Zeidan has been selling books here for 20 years, including the years after the war, when downtown Baghdad was one of the city's most dangerous areas. Zeidan says when the U.S. removed Saddam, it didn't realize that the repressive system that he nurtured would remain. \"There is no government. They are a tribe,\" he says. \"From the Ottomans until today, it's the power of the gun. Rights are only in books. Whoever has a gun is right.

Sissi's widely expected victory in the March 26-28 polls is seen both as an endorsement by many Egyptians of his hard-line security policies and economic aims, and the effective crushing by state security institutions of almost all dissent. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is set to coast to a sweeping victory in Egypt's third presidential elections since the 2011 revolution. For many Egyptians going to the polls starting Monday, it will be a vote of support for Sissi's hard-line rule five years after he led a military coup toppling the country's first democratically elected leader. But he is also helped by the lack of credible candidates in the three-day election. In fact, Moussa Mustafa Moussa, the only rival, is quite clear about what drove him to make a last-minute bid for president. Moussa Mustafa Moussa talks during a press conference at his Cairo office in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Nabil/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Moussa Mustafa Moussa talks during a press conference at his Cairo office in January. \"The most important thing is to try to avoid that the election becomes a referendum,\" Moussa tells NPR at his campaign headquarters in downtown Cairo. \"That would be a catastrophic situation because the voters would not go to vote because there would have been only be one candidate.\" With his navy blue suit and gold-rimmed glasses, the 65-year-old architect looks like the businessman he was before his abrupt entry into presidential politics. He entered the race just hours before the deadline and says a one-candidate election would have hurt Egypt's image abroad and affected morale inside the country. Despite running against Sissi, the little-known politician is reluctant to promote himself as an alternative to the president. It puts the French-educated Moussa in an unusual position as a presidential candidate. But seven years, two elections and a military coup after Hosni Mubarak was toppled in a peaceful revolution, Egypt is still going through unusual times. In the run-up to elections, six potential candidates were either jailed or dropped out citing obstacles to registering and harassment by state security services. The most serious potential rival, former army chief of staff Sami Annan, was charged with breaking army regulations after declaring he would run for president. In 2005, the first multi-party elections under Mubarak's rule, while marred by allegations of wide-spread fraud, featured eight other presidential candidates. Sissi says he would have welcomed more competition. \"I was hoping to have with us one or two or three or even ten from the best, most virtuous candidates and you would chose as you wish,\" he said in a recent Egyptian television interview, his soothing voice belying the sweeping crackdown he has overseen. \"We are not ready yet. It is not a shame to say that.\" Sissi, a former army general, first won election in 2014, a year after leading a military coup to topple Mohammad Morsi, the country's first democratically-elected president. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood party was later banned, Morsi imprisoned and most of its supporters jailed or driven underground. The U.S.-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy details in a recent report the rollback of Egyptian rights and freedoms. It notes sweeping counter-terrorism laws allow the death penalty for \"crimes under a definition of terrorism so broad it encompasses civil disobedience.\" After ISIS attacks on churches last year, Mubarak also implemented a nation-wide state of emergency which allows detention without charge or trial. Sissi and other government officials say the measures are necessary to ensure Egyptian stability and counter Egypt's many enemies inside and outside the country. Sissi has warned that anyone who believes the 2011 revolution that forced out Mubarak could happen again does not know him. Sissi has not done traditional campaign events. He doesn't need to. But in speeches at ceremonies he has asked Egyptians for a mandate to continue his economic reforms and told them he needs the world to see the country voting.

Voting in Egypt is compulsory. But privately, many young Egyptians who believed the 2011 revolution would usher in social reforms and freedom say they will stay away from the polls in protest. With Egypt's 60 million eligible voters making elections a huge undertaking, fines for not voting are very rarely imposed. \"There is no election, it's a show,\" says Dalia Abdel Hameed, an activist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \"It's very depressing because it's much worse even than it was during the Mubarak days.\" \"The period of eliminating other candidates was very stressful for everybody,\" she says. \"The younger generation is generally more depressed and whenever they try to gear up for something they are more easily crushed now. So I don't think we will see many people there except those who are being pushed by the government.\" But there are many who will vote for Sissi. His supporters include business people seeking stability who credit the president with economic reforms that have stabilized the value of the Egyptian pound. Christian leaders side with him as a bulwark against the Muslim Brotherhood. And many Egyptians indisputably prefer his strong-arm tactics to the chaos they believe would follow in his absence. In Cairo's working class neighborhood of Fustat, at a recent Sissi campaign event, hundreds of women invited by a social service organization filed into a huge tent lined with festive satin panels. Many said they had never heard of Moussa. They sat on white metal chairs, resting tired feet in dusty plastic sandals while children chased each other between the aisles. Many of them said Sissi's expansion of the food program to provide an extra 50 Egyptian pounds \u2014 about $3 \u2014 worth of food a month has changed their lives. \"Sissi is a good man. God willing we will elect him for the second and even the third time if I am still alive,\" says Ahlam Abdul Rady, who came with four great-grand-daughters. Abdul Rady says her daughter was recently moved from a slum being cleared for development to a new furnished apartment paid for by the government. She says that never would have happened without Sissi. On the street outside Moussa's party headquarters, a loudspeaker on the sidewalk blares an upbeat campaign song with the refrain \"Moussa Mustafa Moussa.\" His campaign manager, Sayed Mahmoud Obeido, dressed in a white suit with blue lapels, hands out campaign fliers. Supporters of Egyptian presidential candidate Moussa Mustafa Moussa hang his campaign posters near his headquarters in downtown in Cairo on March 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Nabil/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Egyptian presidential candidate Moussa Mustafa Moussa hang his campaign posters near his headquarters in downtown in Cairo on March 21. Obeido says he is predicting Moussa will win 40 percent of the vote \u2014 a seemingly unlikely prospect. But even he won't go as far as to urge voters to chose his candidate over the Egyptian president. \"With all respect to Sissi, we are asking people to vote for Sissi or Moussa,\" he says. Moussa's economic platform promises to create jobs for young people and lift Egyptians out of poverty by distributing shares of state-owned enterprises. Amid an unprecedented crackdown on media and freedom of expression, few Egyptians are willing to criticize Sissi publically. Security services banned at least 93 news websites in Egypt over the last year with no explanation. Media and entertainment figures arrested include a singer who jokingly told fans the Nile river was polluted and a state TV host who mentioned a police family that was having trouble making ends meet. Last week, government censors demanded the deletion of five scenes from an Egyptian play Before the Revolution. The play explores repression and humiliation in the Mubarak era. Director and playwright Ahmed al-Attar cancelled the play's debut and asked the censorship committee to take another look. He staged it after they agreed to just two cuts. \"It didn't think it would be that sensitive,\" says al-Attar, 48. \"I don't think there's anything in there that should make it that sensitive. I think everyone's just on edge because the elections are coming up.\" The cuts included a scene about the assassination of the head of the Egyptian parliament and a series of Mubarak-era jokes. One of them referred to even a genie in a bottle being unable to remove Mubarak as president. \"It's a play about how we were living,\" says al-Attar. It's not a political play but everything is political anyway.\"",

The hashtag #Oprah2020 immediately began trending. Democratic strategists in Washington were impressed with her message, and even former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted that an Oprah 2020 run \u2014 and win \u2014 wasn't so crazy. I slept on it and came to the conclusion that the Oprah thing isn't that crazy Clearly Winfrey has some big advantages \u2014 she has high name recognition, lots of money and is well liked. In fact, the NPR poll found almost two-thirds (64 percent) had a favorable view of Winfrey, while less than a quarter (23 percent) had an unfavorable one. Even though people say they would vote for Winfrey over Trump, they aren't clamoring for her to run. In fact, a majority of Americans say she shouldn't.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"People clearly like her, but do they want her to get mixed up in this rough and tumble world of politics, which has certainly gotten worse by the minute?\" asked Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. \"That's not her style.\" And as well as she's polling now, any time anyone gets involved in politics, they become a partisan target. Winfrey's favorability would likely suffer soon after she were to enter the political arena \u2014 and she's untested taking political heat. Inside the numbers Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey are seated ringside for a June 1988 boxing match in Atlantic City, N.J. When asked this week about a potential challenge from Winfrey in 2020, Trump responded, \"Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Jeffrey Asher/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey are seated ringside for a June 1988 boxing match in Atlantic City, N.J. When asked this week about a potential challenge from Winfrey in 2020, Trump responded, \"Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.\" In the head to head with Trump, 11 percent of respondents were undecided, the same margin as Winfrey's lead over Trump. The respondents were predictably also split along party lines \u2014 91 percent of Democrats were on Winfrey's side, while 85 percent of Republicans said they would vote for Trump. While impressions of Oprah Winfrey are strong overall, they vary based on politics. *W.E. Christ stands for White Evangelical Christians.\n                \n                    \n                    Domenico Montanaro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Winfrey would win only 8 percent of Republicans, the same percentage Clinton won in 2016. (In addition, 7 percent of Trump supporters say they'd cross sides to back Winfrey.) Winfrey does, however, win independents by 9 percentage points, 46 to 37 percent. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won the group, 46 to 42, according to exit polls. Views of Winfrey were likewise split along partisan lines \u2014 89 percent of Democrats had a favorable view of her, while just 39 percent of Republicans did. When it comes to whether she should run, not all Democrats were on board \u2014 40 percent of Democrats said she shouldn't, compared with 47 percent who do. That could spell a potentially tough primary against a more politically qualified opponent. Patrice Bennet-Adler of Daly City, Calif., is one of those Democrats who likes Winfrey but isn't eager for her to run for president. It's the same reason she didn't think Trump was qualified \u2014 neither has any past political experience. Still, she would vote for Winfrey over Trump. \"Between the two, I'm more in alignment with her political and social views, so that's why I would choose her over him,\" said Bennet-Adler, 63. \"She's not just a businessperson \u2014 she also appears to have a social conscious that I'm aligned with. \"But that doesn't mean that I think it would be a good idea for her to run for the highest public office in the country with no political experience.\" That rationale wasn't uncommon.

Concerns over a lack of experience may not bode well for other celebrities who may be flirting with a 2020 presidential bid either, such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, or even Dwyane \"The Rock\" Johnson. \"We always like outsiders,\" Miringoff said, \"and those used to be governors. And now it's Donald Trump \u2014 the ultimate outsider. The question is, after Trump or against Trump, do we want someone who has executive experience in government?\" Or are we in a different time? Taliv Campbell of Chesapeake, Va., said he thought Winfrey would bring a \"change of pace\" to the Oval Office if she ran. \"She's strong; she's a go-getter,\" said Campbell, 37. \"I don't really know her political stances on certain things, but with how she operates in business, I'd trust her with what she could do.\" And Jonathan Wells from Florence, Ala., pointed out that while Winfrey is a celebrity and a multimillionaire, she has a much different background than Trump. Winfrey was born into poverty in Mississippi to a single mother, then lived a difficult upbringing in Milwaukee. She would eventually be raised, in part, by her grandmother. Winfrey has talked of being molested by relatives as a child and said she was raped by an uncle. \"Trump has been in a world where he was living with a silver spoon in his mouth from the time he was born up until now,\" said Wells, 21. \"She's experienced the worst of what many Americans face. She knows what everyone goes through.\" Winfrey could build a broad coalition if she did run \u2014 87 percent of African-Americans line up behind her, along with 61 percent of Latinos. Women voters also break for her by an almost 2-to-1 margin. White voters are split, with 45 percent saying they would vote for Trump and 44 percent for Winfrey. That would be an incredible accomplishment for a Democratic candidate \u2014 Clinton lost white voters by 20 points to Trump. No Democratic candidate has gotten that high with whites since Bill Clinton's re-election in 1996. (Obama in 2008 came close with 43 percent in his landslide win.) Trump does retain some advantages. Among white evangelical Christians, 68 percent would vote for Trump compared to just 22 percent for Winfrey. Just over half of white noncollege graduates also back Trump, with 38 percent saying they'd back Winfrey. And Trump still carries almost half of male voters, with Winfrey getting 40 percent. When asked this week about a potential challenge from Winfrey in 2020, Trump responded, \"Yeah, I'll beat Oprah.\" This poll was conducted January 8-10 and surveyed 1,350 adults with a margin of error of +/- 2.7 percentage points. There were 1,092 registered voters surveyed with a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.",

The Syrian city of Raqqa is blanketed in despair. Residents survive in a wasteland of war-warped buildings and shattered concrete. They sleep exposed to the elements in homes with blown-out walls. Amid the destruction, abject poverty has taken hold. Once a place of green parks and a thriving middle class, it's now common to see women and children scavenging Raqqa's debris-strewn streets for scrap metal to sell. A recent United Nations report finds that more than half of those who have returned don't have enough to eat. \"This is not liberation,\" says Abu Ward, who asks not to use his full name as he feels the city is too unsafe to speak openly. \"Liberation\" was the word that the Trump administration and its allied fighters used after they defeated ISIS in Raqqa in October 2017. \"It's destruction. Systematic destruction. This is what people believe \u2014 my relatives, my friends, my neighbors. No one can change their minds. How can you expect them to feel free when their lives are destroyed?\" A Syrian youth uses his cellphone to film the destroyed vehicles and heavily damaged buildings down a street in Raqqa on Oct. 20, 2017, after a Kurdish-led force expelled ISIS fighters from the northern Syrian city, formerly the group's \"capital.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption One year after the United States-led coalition of countries and militia fighters drove ISIS from its onetime capital Raqqa, the city remains in ruin.

In the recent two weeks that NPR visited Raqqa, an unnamed militia attacked the local police's security headquarters, prompting a gunfight, and there were reports of at least two roadside bomb attacks targeting coalition vehicles and the local security forces. A member of the Syrian Democratic Forces, backed by U.S. special forces, talks on the radio near Raqqa's stadium as they clear the last positions on the front line on Oct. 16, 2017.

The city was an important Islamic State group stronghold. Local officials attribute these operations to \"ISIS sleeper cells,\" and the militant group has claimed some of the attacks. Aid workers and other independent observers in the area, however, say the assaults may be the latest signs of the local majority-Arab population's growing anger at the city's new, Kurdish-led and American-backed administration. The military victory may be complete but that doesn't mean you then just leave. State Department official ISIS seized Raqqa in early 2014 and controlled the city for almost four years. After taking the city from them last year, the U.S. said it was committed to \"stabilizing\" Raqqa as part of its offensive against ISIS. The Syria Transition Assistance Response Team, or START, has been tasked with helping reopen schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure. \"We have a clear mandate to counter ISIS. The military victory may be complete but that doesn't mean you then just leave,\" says a U.S. State Department official working in Syria, who asks not to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. \"You need to stabilize the area so they don't return.\" But funding for this U.S.-led stabilization effort is limited and won't likely achieve the government's objectives. Even officials in the U.S.-backed Raqqa Civil Council say the help is negligible compared to the need. \"Of course we can't say the funding is enough because the city is big and needs more,\" says Ibrahim Hassan, who heads the Raqqa Civil Council's reconstruction committee. Trump freezes funds So far, START has provided $250 million toward Raqqa's recovery, largely channeled through U.S. contractors to local nonprofit organizations. But in late March, the White House froze more than $200 million from the budget. Much of that has been replaced with donations from other countries. According to the State Department official and Raqqa Civil Council members, this money has helped clear street rubble that blocked roads in much of the city. It has funded the removal of some mines and booby traps. It also pays some salaries for teachers and other public service workers. But in a city, where as many as 80 percent of the buildings have been destroyed, it's a tiny portion of the work still needed to make the city habitable. While no official studies have been published on the topic, locals involved in the stabilization effort say privately that they believe Raqqa needs billions of dollars.

The Trump administration then relaxed the rules of engagement to allow the military to bomb targets more quickly and fiercely. In May 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis boasted on CBS' Face the Nation that the coalition had changed from a tactic of \"attrition\" against ISIS to one of \"annihilation.\" The annihilation of ISIS' former Syrian capital is testimony to that. Whole neighborhoods were all but flattened. In others, where tower blocks still stand, it's hard to spot a building that didn't suffer some damage. A combination of Kurdish and Syrian Arab ground troops, armed and trained by the U.S., and American, British and French air power carried out the offensive. Some U.S. special forces also assisted the fight, manning artillery batteries \u2014 bigger weaponry than was given to the local forces. The coalition maintains that it fought one of the most \"precise\" wars in modern history, causing minimal civilian casualties. But in a report in June, Amnesty International said the coalition actually killed \"hundreds of civilians\" in its four-month operation to capture Raqqa. It said the coalition may have committed war crimes through its \"indiscriminate\" use of heavy weaponry. ISIS used civilians as \"human shields,\" often preventing residents from fleeing the city. But the anti-ISIS coalition knew that tactic before the Raqqa campaign, and Amnesty says coalition forces \"did not take adequate account of civilians present in the city and failed to take the precautions necessary to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects.\" \"An indescribable feeling\" At the headquarters of Raqqa's response team charged with finding dead bodies, desperate relatives are filing cases of missing loved ones and residents are reporting the stench of rotting corpses near their homes. Many in the city are still reeling in shock. In one bombed out school that still hosts classes for more than 500 children, the administrator almost breaks down as he describes seeing the city for the first time after the drawn-out battle. Like other residents interviewed, he doesn't want to use his name in this story for fear of his safety. \"It was an indescribable feeling. I'd been gone from Raqqa for one year and fourth months. I was psychologically destroyed and I really missed my city; I wanted to kiss the dirt of Raqqa,\" he says. Every day that passes the children play near these weapons. Raqqa school administrator \"But then I came back and I saw the destruction, I started to cry. Tears were falling from my eyes.\" Looking around a classroom, he says, \"This school used to have books and libraries and even a garden.\" Mortar shells are piled up in the back of a school playground in Raqqa, Syria.\n                \n                    \n                    Ruth Sherlock/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mortar shells are piled up in the back of a school playground in Raqqa, Syria. The roof collapsed in an airstrike. Classroom windows shattered, leaving jagged shards stuck to the frames. Hundreds of mortar shells lie piled against the back wall of the playground. \"We think most of these mortars are spent, but we're not sure,\" he says. \"We were told some experts would come and take them away. But that was weeks ago, and every day that passes the children play near these weapons.\" The school administrator is one of more than 150,000 people the United Nations estimates have come back to Raqqa since October 2017. The U.N. says the city's population was previously more than 220,000. He says that the signs of improvement in the city \u2014 of homes being rebuilt and stores opening \u2014 are the result of local resilience, and not outsiders' assistance. He explains residents' deep anger at the coalition: \"The person whose house is destroyed will be angry, and people who lost sons. Two of my cousins died in the airstrikes \u2014 and my uncle. Of course, I will be angry at the countries who have interests and players in this country.\" \"Life was better then\" Many locals even say, that despite ISIS' harsh dictates, it was easier to live in Raqqa then than now. \"ISIS is terrorism, there's no doubt about that,\" says one 38-year-old father, standing on the porch of his half-destroyed home. His young boy plays on a swing in what was once a well-tended garden. \"Despite this, life was better then. It's very expensive now. Bread under ISIS was cheaper. Now some families can't even afford that.\" He was a firefighter before the war. His wife has a university degree in English but also hasn't been able to find work. \"If things don't get fixed here then there will be no security,\" he says. \"If the U.S. and the local government here don't fix things, then in the end the people will rebel. The pressures will cause people to explode.\" As the NPR crew drives out of Raqqa, through its decimated northern suburbs, it finds graffiti that still looks wet. In Arabic, the writing reads: \"Whether you like it or not, ISIS is here.\"",

In El Paso, nearly a quarter of people live in poverty and are uninsured, yet many say they don't have the time or the will to cast a ballot.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In El Paso, Texas, only half of the registered voters went to the polls in 2016, and even fewer voted in the 2014 midterms. It is a city of immigrants and of the poor, and where many people say they don't have the time or the will to cast a ballot. NPR's Leila Fadel wanted to go find out why. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: At Bowie Bakery, customers choose from trays of Mexican sweet breads, tres leches cake and other treats that fill the glass cases. For decades, it's been the go-to spot to satisfy a sweet tooth. Christina Rodriguez (ph) orders cookies for her oldest daughter's Quinceanera. She barely knows when voting days are in El Paso. CHRISTINA RODRIGUEZ: You know, just the other day, I saw somebody post something on Facebook about one of the elections, and I was like, I don't even know who's running. I should, you know, look into it. FADEL: She can't really remember the last time she voted, but she remembers the line was long. So she opts out, especially because she doesn't want to go to the polls uninformed. She's a single, working mom, and she can't spare the time to figure out who's running and for what. RODRIGUEZ: But I really don't think about it. It's kind of sad to say, but I don't think about like, OK, well, what can be better in my life? It's like, I do what I can do to make my life better. I don't depend on them to change things for me. FADEL: By them, she means elected officials. It's how it's always been in her family. No one votes. Behind the counter, baker Jose Ramirez (ph) packs pastries for customers. The 20-year-old says he wants health care for all. He drives across the Mexican border for treatment there. He's upset about the separation of families. JOSE RAMIREZ: I'm really into politics and stuff. The thing is that sometimes it's not as efficient to go voting. It's just that only the time and work and stuff are things that do not allow me to do so. FADEL: So he doesn't do it. Almost every person I speak to in the bakery doesn't or rarely votes. And most don't know about a local guy that's caught the nation's attention, Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso challenging Republican Ted Cruz for his Senate seat. Lisa Wise is El Paso's election administrator. She says there are a lot of reasons people don't vote in this border city - corruption... LISA WISE: Their county judge has been imprisoned. County board members, school district members have been sent to prison for things like bribery and things like that. And that wasn't that long ago. And I do think some things like that take a while for voters to get past. FADEL: ...There are so many voting days, it gets confusing. WISE: And we have more elections than any state I've ever seen, at random times during the year. FADEL: Most of the population is first, second and third-generation. WISE: Voting is often taught, and it may take a couple of generations to become a habit. FADEL: So when Wise moved from Nebraska to El Paso, Texas, she turned her attention to the schools. The counties developed a curriculum for middle schools, high schools and, in some cases, elementary schools to teach the habit of voting. School is the only reason Jairo Pallares (ph) knows about the elections in November. We meet at a church block party. JAIRO PALLARES: I just took U.S. history so I'm pretty, like, knowledgeable about that 'cause our U.S. history teacher was, like, encouraging us to vote and stuff. FADEL: Come November, he'll be 18 and, if all goes as planned, a citizen. No one in his family has ever voted. He might be the first. Jimmy Moreno (ph) and his friend, Bernadette Aramoare (ph) are leaving the block party when I catch up to them. They're habitual voters, but Aramoare says they're not the norm. BERNADETTE ARAMOARE: I've heard that time and time again, English and Spanish, (speaking Spanish), what for? No matter if we vote or not, it's already rigged. Everybody knows who's going to win and regardless of what political party it is. FADEL: El Paso is a place where people say no one really fights for their vote. But there are signs things are changing. In the primaries, voter turnout was a modest 37 percent, but that was higher than it's been since 2002. Leila Fadel, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "White House press secretary Sarah Sanders apologized Tuesday for wildly misstating employment numbers for African-Americans under former President Barack Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption White House press secretary Sarah Sanders apologized Tuesday for wildly misstating employment numbers for African-Americans under former President Barack Obama. The White House was forced to backtrack this week, after wildly misstating the level of job gains by African-Americans under President Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. The false claim came during Tuesday's press briefing, which was dominated by questions about Omarosa Manigault Newman. In her new tell-all book and on an accompanying publicity tour, the former reality TV star and presidential assistant has accused Trump of being a racist. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tried to rebut that claim by arguing that Trump has done more to boost African-Americans' economic status than his predecessor. But her job statistics were as bogus as Trump's long-debunked claims about Obama's birth certificate. Here's what Sanders said: \"This president, since he took office, in the year and a half that he's been here has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans. That's 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren't working when this president took place. When President Obama left after eight years in office \u2014 eight years in office \u2014 he'd only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans. President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years.\" First, let's stipulate that presidents by and large don't \"create\" jobs. The strength or weakness of the job market depends on numerous factors beyond the control of the White House. But fairly or not, presidents are often judged by how the economy performs on their watch. So let's examine Sanders' numbers. She was right about Trump's record. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 700,000 more African-Americans working now than when Trump took office \u2014 708,000 more, to be precise. But when it comes to Obama's record, Sanders is off by a factor of 15. According to the BLS, there were 18.4 million African-Americans working when Obama left office in January 2017. That's 2.9 million more than when he was sworn in eight years earlier. Loading... Once reporters pointed out the error, Sanders issued a rare, albeit grudging, correction on Twitter. \"Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn't,\" Sanders wrote. \"I'm sorry for the mistake. But no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump.\" Correction from today\u2019s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump https://t.co/EXGvbliwlS So, is there a different time period for which the 195,000 figure Sanders gave for Obama would be correct? The number appears to be drawn from a chart compiled by the president's Council of Economic Advisers, which showed job growth for the 20 months following each of the last three presidential elections (including November and December of the year the election was held). From November 2008 until July 2010, 636,000 African-Americans lost jobs, as the nation sank into its deepest recession since the great depression. Four years later, in the 20 months following Obama's re-election, 831,000 African-Americans found jobs. Adding those two periods together produces a net total of 195,000. But this is a curious \"time period\" in which to assess Obama's record \u2014 the 20 months following his 2008 election, added to the 20 months following his 2012 re-election, ignoring the periods in between and afterwards. On Tuesday night, the CEA apologized for what it called its \"earlier miscommunication\" to Sanders. Perhaps a more reasonable yardstick with which to compare African-American job gains during Trump's first 18 months in office is what happened in the 18 months just before that, from June 2015 through December 2016. According to the BLS, 793,000 African-Americans found work during that period. In other words, about 85,000 more African-Americans found work during the 18 months before Trump took office than the 18 months since. The pattern is similar for the broader population. In the 18 months since Trump was sworn in, the U.S. has added 3.4 million jobs, about a quarter-million fewer jobs than were added in the previous 18 months. In no way is this to discount the strong job gains generally, and among African-Americans in particular, that the U.S. has enjoyed under the Trump administration. But those gains appear to be little more than a continuation of the healthy trend that Trump inherited. And no matter how much this president tries to reverse and discredit the legacy of his predecessor, the numbers are plain to see.",

Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and Isaiah (Joivan Wade) star in the fourth installment of the series, The First Purge, which opens July 4. What if, one night a year, all crime, including murder, was legal? That's the premise of an incredibly successful horror movie franchise set in the not-so-distant dystopian future. The idea of The Purge is: Let people blow off steam, and crime rates will go down. The fourth Purge installment \u2014 The First Purge \u2014 opens July 4. The Purge films have, on average, made almost 2,000 percent of their budget at the worldwide box office. What is it about these stories of society-run-amok that keeps audiences coming back? \"It's a cool idea,\" says Grady Hendrix, an expert on horror literature and film. And cool ideas in movies can be hard to come by, so \"when you find one, you may as well make as many sequels as you can,\" he says. The Purge movies are in the tradition of the urban menace movies that were big in the 1970s, Hendrix explains \u2014 think Death Wish or Taxi Driver. The idea, Hendrix says, is that \"our cities are just these horrible death traps and the second you let your guard down you'll get murdered by weirdos.\" At a moment when gentrification has changed the conversation about crime on city streets, the power of The Purge also derives from an older horror trope \u2014 the idea of blood sacrifice \u2014 played out in The Hunger Games series and Shirley Jackson's classic short story \"The Lottery.\" The idea is that \"for a society to be healthy, you just have to kill people sometimes,\" Hendrix says. The politics of The Purge haven't exactly been subtle. In one, the heroine is a crusading senator who calls out the National Rifle Association and insurance companies for profiting from the Purge. In a 2013 promotional interview about the first Purge film, writer James DeMonaco says he purposefully made the backstory shadowy. \"We kind of say that America was starting to crumble \u2014 crime, poverty, stock market crash, many wars \u2014 so everything kind of went haywire. [A] new government regime came in and got us back on track by creating the Purge.\" There are no safe spaces. Your house isn't safe, your store isn't safe, your family isn't safe. There is nowhere you can go to get away from, or be protected from, someone who wants to get at you. Grady Hendrix The worst villains in the series tend to be wealthy elites who enjoy private manhunts and deem certain citizens \u2014 such as homeless people or political opponents \u2014 expendable in their \"spring cleaning.\" \"Survival is the most important thing,\" Hendrix says, and that message resonates when so many people struggle just to make ends meet. In a climate where \"safe spaces\" are frequently ridiculed, the Purge is literally about having no space that feels safe: \"There are no safe spaces,\" Hendrix says. \"Your house isn't safe, your store isn't safe, your family isn't safe. There is nowhere you can go to get away from, or be protected from, someone who wants to get at you.\" Numerous polls have found that Americans are feeling more divided than ever \u2014 so a story about losing common humanity feels relevant. Regardless of politics, The Purge movies share a sense of a decay of the American dream, and if horror movies serve as catharsis \u2014 and The Purge films live up to their name.",

            "article_content": "Sally Merryman has taught middle school Spanish in North Carolina for more than 20 years. She, like thousands of teachers from all over the state, plans to march on the state capitol in Raleigh this week. \"I think a lot of us started to see, 'well shoot, if West Virginia can do it, North Carolina can do it,' \" she told NPR's Ari Shapiro. \"If Oklahoma can do it, North Carolina can do it. If Arizona can do it, so can North Carolina.\" On Wednesday, teachers in North Carolina will become the latest to leave their classroom posts and march on their state capitol, wearing #RedforEd T-shirts, in a quest for better compensation for themselves and more resources for their students. \"That energy spreads like wildfire,\" says Merryman, \"because people really feel now that there's some momentum in this movement and they can really affect change.\" Seamus Kenney, a middle school band and chorus teacher from Chapel Hill, will be there. So will his wife, Kerri Lockwood, who teaches elementary school art. Kenney comes from a family of teachers, he told NPR. Falling wages have driven some of his colleagues out of the profession, but others, like himself, are \"hunkering down and saying, 'No, I'm staying,' and demanding that it be improved.\" Kenney says he moonlights giving private music lessons to make ends meet, sometimes working 13-hour days with choir and band concerts. \"I'm not asking for everything all at once, but I do want to look down the road and feel that I'm progressing towards a better life,\" he adds. Tim Moore, a Republican who is the state's Speaker of the House, says North Carolina is already showing progress. \"The [National Education Association] just ranked us last year as the No. 1 state in the country for teacher wage growth,\" Moore says. \"Teachers are getting bigger pay increases than any other state employees.\" He sees \"a liberal political agenda\" behind the protests. This is the sixth statewide teacher protest since February. With the broad support of parents and other members of the public, teachers, through grassroots organizing, have notched some victories in a group of mostly Republican right-to-work states. Where this came from Agustina Paglayan is a political economist who studies how governments around the world choose education policies. She says teacher pay has been comparatively low in the protesting states at least as far back as the 1930s. And, Paglayan adds, she has the answer to an apparent mystery: Why have these statewide uprisings have taken place in places where unions are historically weak? Paglayan's research says you have to go back to the 1960s to understand. \"Before then, less than 5 percent of teachers belonged to a union,\" she explains. \"It was not an organized profession.\" In the midst of civil rights, feminist and anti-Vietnam protests, there were hundreds of public sector worker strikes per year between 1966 and 1968, Paglayan says. On the picket lines, teachers at times won better pay packages and more respect. But in 19 states including New Jersey and New York, in exchange for collective bargaining agreements, they also accepted severe penalties for striking \u2014 like losing two days of pay for every day they were out, or even having their union dissolved. So why are teachers marching now in places where unions are weak? Simple, says Paglayan. \"They have much less to lose.\" Without strong union structures in place, educators are winning concessions through grassroots and online organizing. This, Paglayan says, is a fascinating development considering the case now before the Supreme Court that would hobble the power of unions to collect any fees from nonmembers. \"If they rule something like that, that starts taking away some of the benefits teachers got in the 1960s, you could end up having a wave of strikes in a lot more states.\" Chicago, Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders Loading... Jane McAlevey is an organizer and labor scholar who pretty much predicted what's going on right now. She published a book in 2016, No Shortcuts, arguing that in reaction to decades of tax cuts and budget cuts, \"education and healthcare workers will create a woman-led new labor union movement.\" One of the book's case studies is the Chicago teacher strike in 2012, which she argues is the forerunner to this year's protests. She also points to the defeat of a ballot question on charter school expansion in Massachusetts in 2016 as a major recent teacher union victory. And she says the \"Bernie Sanders effect\" in states like West Virginia, which handed him a primary victory in every county, laid the groundwork for the populist economic message that is resonating now. Michael Hansen, a political economist at the Brookings Institution, also gets points for prescience. He wrote a blog post on April 13 naming North Carolina as one of the possible states at risk for teacher action. His criteria were: low-ranking salaries, salaries and per-pupil funding that's fallen in real terms since the Great Recession, and teacher pay determined at the state rather than district level, which makes state capitals the obvious target for an action. Where this goes next The other states on Hansen's list, if you're curious, included Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah. Hansen sees a \"domino effect\" in progress, helped along by some political \"tailwinds\": \"the Democratic midterm wave elections, the women's #MeToo movement. There are just a lot of big movements happening here.\" As he points out, women are a common thread in many of these movements. The partisan gap by gender \u2014 blue for women, red for men \u2014 is as wide as it's ever been. A record number of women are running for office this fall. And teaching is among the most female-dominated professions. A wave of blue candidates? So it's not too surprising that many teachers coming off their labor actions have been inspired to become candidates for office. Renee Jerden, a choir teacher, just filed to run for state senate as a Democrat in Norman, Okla. She calls the walkout \"the last straw,\" in her decision to run for office herself. Besides education, she says, \"my platform is, how is this issue going to affect the kids of Oklahoma? Poverty, health care, taxes.\" She says she's never seen her colleagues more engaged. \"The longer we see all these other states start to have the same similar movement, we realize we are waking up a sleeping giant and filling it with a terrible resolve.\" Jennifer Samuels teaches middle school in the Phoenix area, and just filed papers to run for the Arizona statehouse as a Democrat as well. She had originally planned to run in 2020, but after #Red4ED, \"I had a front row seat in the gallery overnight to watch the debate, and watching our lawmakers really have no interest in appropriately funding public education.\" Education and health care workers, McAlevey says, have an advantage over the factory workers of previous generations when it comes to building a broader political and social movement. \"They're mission-driven workers. They have an incredible relationship with the broader community. People love their teachers and nurses for good reason. They fight harder because they're not fighting for a raise, they're fighting over whether we're going to have public education.\" But the most fundamental motivation here, says McAlevey, is as simple as a pendulum swing. \"Everyone is just done with having no money. There's nowhere to go but up.\" Melissa Easley, a seventh-grade science teacher in Charlotte, echoes these words. \"The legislature has asked us to do more with less. We are at our max, we can't do anymore.\" Easley says she was wearing her Red for Ed T-shirt last week at the grocery store. \"I was stopped by four different people: Are you going to Raleigh? Yes. Good for you.\" Jolie Myers and Kat Lonsdorf edited and produced this story for broadcast.",

Mrs. Trump unveiled a new initiative Monday, called \"Be Best,\" which she said aims to educate children \"about the many issues they are facing today.\" As President Trump looked on in the Rose Garden, Mrs. Trump outlined the initiative's three pillars: well-being, social media use and opioid abuse. \"Children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence,\" the first lady said. The White House says \"Be Best\" will promote \"values such as healthy living, encouragement, kindness and respect.\" It will also highlight the importance of using social media and the Internet \"in positive ways.\" And it will support families and children affected by the opioid crisis. Following her remarks, the president signed a proclamation and said the nation is \"truly blessed to have a first lady so devoted to our country and to our children.\" Monday's announcement comes at a moment when the president is under intense scrutiny. Melania Trump rarely campaigned with her husband and waited months after his inauguration before moving to the White House. But she has made occasional appearances that offer clues about her priorities. Her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tells NPR there are \"many issues\" facing children today, and that the first lady's initiatives will try to help them to handle those challenges. Grisham says the first lady will continue to focus on many of the subjects she has addressed in the past. Social media, cyberbullying and opioid addiction Even before she became first lady, Melania Trump waded into what might seem like surprising territory for the wife of Donald Trump. \"Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,\" she said in a campaign speech in Pennsylvania just days before the 2016 election. There she talked about the downsides of the Internet, especially for kids who are bullied and mocked online. The irony was hard to miss, as she acknowledged at a White House forum in March. \"I'm well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic, but it will not stop me from doing what I know is right,\" Trump said.

Social media and its effect on children will be one part of Melania Trump's agenda, Grisham said before Monday's event. Children and opioid addiction will also be a priority. In a speech to the United Nations in September 2017, Trump talked about several issues affecting children, including bullying, poverty and addiction. In October, she traveled to West Virginia, where she visited a treatment center for infants exposed to opioids. She returned to that subject at a White House event on opioids later that month, where she said, \"addiction affects children in many different ways, and I have recently taken a larger interest in what I can do to help fight this epidemic.\" No playbook for first ladies Presidents' wives have often found both themselves and their platforms under intense scrutiny. Speaking in 2013, then-first lady Michelle Obama acknowledged the unwanted attention on her appearance \u2014 from her shoes to her bangs. But she said despite that, being first lady gave her a big opportunity. \"We take our bangs, and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see,\" Obama said. American first ladies have traditionally chosen a range of issues of public concern, often causes related to public health. Abigail Adams advocated for women's rights; Lucy Hayes, the wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes, was involved in the anti-alcohol temperance movement. More recently, Nancy Reagan was known for her involvement in the \"Just Say No\" anti-drug campaign. Obama tackled childhood obesity with her \"Let's Move\" campaign, which drew the ire of some of her conservative critics. Peter Slevin, who teaches journalism at Northwestern University and wrote a biography of Michelle Obama, says there's \"no playbook\" for how a first lady should operate. He says each presidential spouse must develop her own set of priorities and plan for executing them. Slevin says that may be especially challenging for Melania Trump. \"She's dealing with a White House that is not exactly good at delivering a consistent message,\" he says. \"And in her own case, she comes with no experience at all in politics; even as her husband was running for office, she was in the background.\" A harsh spotlight These days, much of the attention on the White House has focused on legal questions surrounding President Trump's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. He has denied those allegations. Even so, Melania Trump is pressing forward with her plans almost as if nothing has happened. 1 of 10 Myra Gutin, a historian of American first ladies at Rider University, says some president's wives would have been put off by the controversies swirling around the White House \u2014 but not Trump. \"She seems to sort of roll with whatever occurs, and the fact that she's going to get this initiative rolled out and finally moving seems to say to me that she's going to be focused on the good that she can accomplish while she's in the White House,\" she says. Gutin said the decision to focus on children is a good one, and in line with what past first ladies have done. \"She seems to be at her best when she's with young children, visiting them in the hospital, reading to them,\" Gutin says. \"It just brings out a naturalness in her that I haven't seen in other situations.\" Gutin said first ladies tend to be more popular than their spouses \u2014 which could give Melania Trump a chance make progress on her goals, regardless of what her husband is doing.",

U.S.-based company Bitfury has been accounting for much of the buzz.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew North for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cryptocurrency mining has come to Georgia. U.S.-based company Bitfury has been accounting for much of the buzz. Since long before anyone can remember, the big, fertile slopes of the Alazani Valley in eastern Georgia have been planted with grapevines. It's the heartland of winemaking in the country that invented it 8,000 years ago. But in recent months, the valley has been going through a new kind of ferment, because of bitcoin. \"You see that building there with the power line outside,\" says Bezhani Buzhaidze, pointing to an abandoned-looking, cinder block storehouse in his hometown of Telavi, the hub of Georgian wine country. \"That's being turned into a data center for mining cryptocurrencies.\" It's another sign of how this tiny former Soviet republic of fewer than 4 million people has become a virtual printing press for this new money you can't see. Cryptocurrency mining is the digital equivalent of minting real money, except that anyone with the right hardware and software can do it, by taking part in what amounts to a giant virtual competition. Think of it like a lottery, where computers linked across the Internet compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, with the number of players constantly rising. The owner of the computer that finds the right solution is rewarded with a \"block\" of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, which is then registered and verified on a decentralized database system known as the blockchain. In practice, it involves a kind of constant digital bombardment to find these solutions, 24 hours a day, consuming huge amounts of electricity. And thanks to its cheap hydropower and low regulation, Georgia is now ranked second in the world for cryptocurrency mining \u2014 behind only China. A single U.S.-based technology company called Bitfury has been accounting for much of this mining activity, from a vast data center filled with computer servers that it opened on the outskirts of the capital, Tbilisi. It has generated plenty of controversy too over claims that it received overly generous terms for its electricity bills. But scores of smaller data centers have now sprouted up, with many more people mining from home using processors bought online from China. One Georgian political party has even started raising funds by mining cryptocurrency via the computers of willing supporters. And because electricity has traditionally been more heavily subsidized in the Alazani Valley, wine country has been seeing a kind of digital gold rush. Hoodie-wearing Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors. He signed up last summer, as he watched the price of bitcoin surge, borrowing several thousand dollars from his father to buy three graphic cards, the backbone of any home mining operation. Ever since, they have been churning away 24 hours a day in the family living room, a constant low hiss emitting from their cooling fans. Bezhani Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors for cryptocurrency mining in Georgia.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew North for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bezhani Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors for cryptocurrency mining in Georgia. \"See, here, I've made about $14 so far today,\" Buzhaidze says, scrolling through brightly colored graphs and figures on an app on his smartphone. Late last year, he was making an average of $800 a month mining a currency called Zcash, with the extra electricity load costing about $80. His earnings are down now from the highs of last year, but it is still a healthy supplement to his monthly salary working at an online marketing company in Telavi. Part of the attraction, Buzhaidze admits, is \"easy money.\" Four of his friends also have home mining rigs. \"Everyone is doing it,\" he says, smiling. But he adds he is also attracted by the libertarian promise of cryptocurrencies. \"We won't need banks anymore,\" he says. \"It will be good for society.\" That is the question. Is this crypto boom going to help or hinder Georgia, a country still struggling with widespread poverty? \"Exercise caution\" Some see an opportunity for Georgia to vault ahead, by embracing the technology and libertarian philosophy underpinning cryptocurrencies. But skeptics fear the country has become an outsourcing center for the global crypto craze, creating few jobs and no lasting gain if it all comes crashing down. The National Bank of Georgia, the equivalent of the Federal Reserve, has issued a warning, urging people to \"exercise caution\" about investing in virtual currencies. \"This is high-tech gambling,\" says professor Gocha Tutberidze, a former regulatory official with the bank, who now teaches at the European University in Tbilisi. \"The profits just go offshore,\" he says, to big players like Bitfury. It certainly looks that way on Bitfury's website, which has videos showing executives enjoying ritzy gatherings on the private tropical island of British billionaire Richard Branson. The company reportedly earned over $90 million in revenue last year, though how much of that was profit is not public. It has positioned itself as a one-stop shop for all aspects of the business, making its own mining chips and software, and consulting other organizations that want to set up data centers or use blockchain technology. While it has offices in San Francisco and Washington D.C., Bitfury is registered in the Cayman Islands and releases only minimal financial information. A shop in Sandy, Utah, mints physical versions of bitcoins, with codes protected by tamperproof holographic seals.\n                \n                    \n                    Rick Bowmer/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A shop in Sandy, Utah, mints physical versions of bitcoins, with codes protected by tamperproof holographic seals. It has an outsize presence in Georgia. According to Bitfury's own figures, it was using around 28 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per month for its mining operations here, equal to the average consumption of 120,000 Georgian households, or 10 percent of the population. But it pays significantly less per unit, which has fueled charges that Georgia is getting ripped off. Opposition politicians have claimed that the country's richest man, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is a hidden beneficiary. An investment fund linked with the billionaire tycoon lent money to Bitfury when it first arrived. But the company's lawyer in Georgia, Eprem Urumashvili, says the loan was repaid, and he denies any financial ties remain. However, the vice chairman of Bitfury's board, George Kikvadze, also has a senior role on Ivanishvili's fund. Perhaps hoping to sidestep all this controversy, Bitfury recently announced it had sold its main data center to a Chinese concern. But its logo is still emblazoned on the building. And it remains the landlord, according to Urumashvili, as the company runs the surrounding tax-free zone where the data center operates. Bitfury has had unfair press, its lawyer says, insisting that it is looking far beyond mining bitcoin in Georgia. Last year, it helped the government become the world's first to start using a blockchain-based database to secure public records \u2014 with the company providing server space and technical expertise. As with cryptocurrencies, records encrypted on a blockchain are distributed across countless computers, with no single entity having control, making the system both more resilient and harder to tamper with. It began with a property registry. Next will come marriage certificates and other personal records. Bitfury has also been talking to the authorities in nearby Ukraine about using blockchain technology to run future elections there. Advocates say this will make it much harder to hack the voting process, in light of allegations that Russia tried to do just that in previous Ukrainian polls, even before accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. One small, ultralibertarian Georgian opposition party has more radical ideas. If it ever gains power, the party Girchi \u2014 which translates as \"pine cone\" \u2014 wants to issue a national Georgian cryptocurrency allowing citizens to buy unused state assets, including large areas of land. \"We want to privatize it all,\" says the party leader, Zurab Japaridze. Every Georgian citizen, he adds, would get an allowance of what the party is calling, no surprise, \"pinecoin.\" He sees longer-term political benefits too, helping the party build a new constituency of libertarian-minded supporters. Japaridze says the party has had discussions with an outside technology company he won't name about the mechanics of creating a pinecoin cryptocurrency. He envisions a day when there will be no central banks, and property deeds worldwide will be stored on a giant blockchain database with no government or other entity having control. That, he claims, will both give owners greater protection from attempts to disenfranchise them as well as boost overall transparency: \"I should be able to look up who owns a piece of land in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia,\" he says. Cryptocurrency mining rigs operate at the Golden Fleece company in Kutaisi, Georgia. The company uses a cargo container with Chinese-built computers inside a dilapidated Soviet-era tractor factory to extract cryptocurrencies using low-cost electricity generated by water flowing from the nearby Caucasus Mountains.\n                \n                    \n                    Daro Sulakauri/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cryptocurrency mining rigs operate at the Golden Fleece company in Kutaisi, Georgia. The company uses a cargo container with Chinese-built computers inside a dilapidated Soviet-era tractor factory to extract cryptocurrencies using low-cost electricity generated by water flowing from the nearby Caucasus Mountains. Girchi believes it is the first party to raise funds via cryptocurrency mining. When supporters log on to its website, they are given the choice of allowing their computer processors to be used to mine Monero, a newer virtual coin being marketed for its extreme anonymity. One of Japaridze's team came up with the idea. And when he attended a recent global conference of like-minded political groups, delegates there told him it was the first time any party had tried to raise funds this way, he says. It has only raised a few hundred dollars so far, he says, but \"it has also helped boost our reputation for innovation with younger voters.\" Such ideas are \"just the beginning,\" says Luka Kobalia, co-founder of a Tbilisi-based company called Blockmentor, which provides training for businesses seeking to use blockchain technology in their operations. Everything about the way the economy functions is going to change, he says. Too many people think you just plug in and make money. Luka Kobalia, co-founder of Blockmentor Facebook groups now regularly advertise conferences and gatherings to share ideas, addressed by people who call themselves \"blockchain evangelists.\" Recent events have been standing room only, with people actually listening to the speakers and not looking at their phones. Georgia's finance sector has been sitting on the fence over cryptocurrencies, but some institutions are already invested. The country's Liberty Bank now offers a means of buying and selling the best-known cryptocurrencies via its eMoney service. But it is still a long way from the point where this virtual money replaces so-called fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, or Georgia's lari. Crypto exchange Like the original Klondike, Georgia's digital gold rush has attracted some colorful characters hoping to make their fortune. Take Andrew Thornhill, an energetic financial entrepreneur from Chicago and founder of a cryptocurrency startup called Spotcoin. He first came to Georgia a decade ago to provide Internet-banking advice. In 2011, he was briefly imprisoned for fraud, but he says his conviction does not restrict him from running a financial business either in the U.S. or in Georgia. \"It's an unfortunate episode in my past, but I'm not trying to hide it,\" Thornhill told NPR, adding that his main backers and colleagues are fully aware of what happened. Now Spotcoin is issuing its own cryptocurrency and setting up an online exchange to make it easier to buy and sell other virtual currencies. \"There is nothing like this in the world yet,\" he claims. Concerns that cryptocurrencies are being used as a money-laundering vehicle have been overdone, Thornhill says when we meet at Spotcoin's Tbilisi headquarters. \"Criminals are using dollars and euros every day, but we don't blame the currencies,\" he says. And blockchain technology has the potential to make financial transactions far more secure, he maintains. But the world's central banks are right to proceed cautiously, Thornhill adds: \"Everyone wants some rules. I'm a digital revolutionary, not a digital anarchist.\" Bit of a bubble? While some people outside Georgia may have become multimillionaires thanks to the bitcoins processed inside the huge Tbilisi data center, just down the road is Gldani, one of the city's poorest suburbs. The main street is lined with pawnshops and discount stores. Unemployment is high, and many live on far less than the national average wage of $400 a month. It's a similar story in many rural areas. Against this economic backdrop, according to professor Tutberidze, it's not surprising so many Georgians have dived into the cryptocurrency craze, hoping for quick wealth. But he warns a \"mass psychology\" has developed, with people buying in as prices rise but then panicking and selling again as they fall. He sees it as one of several alarm bells that this could become a dangerous bubble for Georgia. Lenders have been putting ads on Georgian Faceboook pages offering $10,000 to buy bitcoin or mining equipment \u2014 with interest rates starting at 18 percent. Many people are spending savings or taking out loans to buy their own mining setups. Such is the demand, a secondary online market has sprung up for mining cards. But it's not hard to find stories of people who have overreached and overpaid, with little chance of ever recouping their investment. Meanwhile, shadowy lenders have been putting ads on Georgian Faceboook pages offering $10,000 to buy bitcoin or mining equipment \u2014 with interest rates starting at 18 percent. Kobalia, the training company co-founder, acknowledges there are dangers. \"Too many people think you just plug in and make money,\" he says. Tutberidze has tried to warn Georgians off it. \"Friends keep coming to me, asking what I think about investing in bitcoin or other currencies,\" the professor says. \"They sound disappointed when I tell them, 'Don't.' \" But the risks are part of the attraction of having left the Soviet planned economy behind, according to Bitfury's lawyer Urumashvili. \"This is a free country now,\" he says. Back in Telavi, Buzhaidze says even though his profits are down, he is sticking with it. \"I don't 100 percent understand how it works,\" he says. \"But I think it's the future.\" Andrew North (@NorthAndrew) is a journalist based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and a former BBC correspondent in the Middle East and South Asia.",

The musician and activist was kidnapped in late 2017 and wrote an album, 30 Days and Nights in the Evil Forest, about his experience. Performing for the Oba of Benin has practically been a day job for \"Ambassador\" Osayomore Joseph, a living legend of Nigerian highlife music. The concerts are usually held in the expansive courtyard of the royal palace in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria, former seat of the Benin Empire. While in honor of the king, Osayomore's shows were free and open to the public; his fans would pack the place while he blasted his timeless hits through massive walls of distorted speakers. Fans would show their love by \"spraying\" Osayomore with money, and, in return, he praised them on the microphone. He would take the extra \"financial love\" \u2014 equivalent to hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollars\u2014 and go home satisfied. But, after his performance on October 3, 2017 marking a year since the coronation of the new Oba of Benin, Osayomore didn't make it home. \"Bullets started raining on the car. Luckily enough, I escaped, but my wife was hit by a bullet,\" Osayomore tells NPR. He was dragged from his car into the forest by seven men armed with AK-47s, his wife left behind, he says. While his wife was taken to the hospital, Osayomore's ordeal was just beginning \u2014 he had become the latest name on an ever-growing list of kidnapping victims in the economically depressed South-South region of Nigeria. In Edo State, in the month of October alone, the director of a zoo and a Catholic priest were also kidnapped. (The kidnappers of the zoo director were later arrested.) \"They took me on a motorbike into the forest. We saw a small river \u2014 little did I know it was a branch of the sea. They put me on a speedboat and drove me very far into the sea. After a time, they branched into a swamp, a very big forest in a swamp.\" Although the exact location of the camp where he was held was never revealed to Osayomore, according to his best estimation, it was along the Koko River, south of the town of Sapele, in the Delta region. \"They now told me that they were kidnappers,\" Osayomore remembers, \"and that I needed to pay 200 million naira [approx. $556,000 USD] before I could be released. I said, 'Where will I get such money?' \" Finally, his family and supporters worked out an agreement to secure his freedom. They had to sell a student hostel he owned in Benin City and borrow money to raise the ransom. \"We got 11 million naira (approx. $30,500 USD) in a sack. [My people] hired a boat to meet us on the high seas. The money was handed over to [the kidnappers.]\" Osayomore left on the same boat his rescuers had hired, and he spent the next two weeks recovering in a hospital in Benin City. Just over a month later, in December 2017, he released a new album, 30 Days and 30 Nights in the Evil Forest (Supreme Disk) \u2014 a document of his experience in that swamp. The album has three long tracks, interspersed with spoken dialogue between Osayomore and a friend, produced in the current production style of Edo highlife: prominent, driving bass and drums, harsh vocals in the foreground of the mix. The first song, \"Aisiokuoba,\" uses a traditional Edo proverb: \"You dare not invoke the king's wars upon yourself, he is not alone.\" Osayomore explains: \"I now decided to tell those that understand my language my ordeal. What [the kidnappers] are trying to do does not please the monarch; the monarch was very concerned and was very bitter. Our monarch is swearing for them, all and sundry swear for them, curses reign on them!\" The title track is a collage of musical fragments, including a brief reprise of Osayomore's classic song, \"When There is Life, There is Hope,\" interrupted by dialogue in pidgin English and Bini in which Osayomore describes his kidnapping and dismisses the idea that the kidnappers are freedom fighters. \"It took a lot of guts to come out with an album like that. I just had to do it, to douse some tensions in some quarters. Some were attributing it to [politics], so in order to remove that from people's minds I quickly had to come out with some songs so people will know it was masterminded by these criminals in the creeks.\" At the end of the song, Osayomore sings, \"Ijaw, Ison, leave us alone,\" referring to minority tribes who live in the Niger Delta region. \"[The kidnappers] are in Ijaws, from very far in the Niger Delta, they're militants.\" In the Niger Delta, Osaymore says, those militants \"are fighting with the ex-patriots and the highly placed people in the society. They said ... that I must help them pay the price for taking oil. Meanwhile, I'm not a government official \u2014 I've never worked for any multinational corporation or government.\" The history of the oil-rich Niger Delta is a dark and complicated one. In 2005, an NPR series investigated the complicated, violent and corrupt structures around oil production in the country, revealing the many feet \u2014 oil companies, the government, militants \u2014 at which to lay blame for the circumstances that result in kidnappings like Osayomore's. Osayomore has a reputation as a freedom fighter, an activist musician with a long history of criticizing corruption in local and national politics. The respect he commands in his local community makes his kidnapping all the more surprising. Abduction for ransom has long been a problem in Nigeria, where widespread poverty, despite the country's oil wealth, has pushed the desperate into criminality. While there are no official estimates of the numbers of kidnappings and many are never reported, according to Control Risks, a specialist in global risk consultancy, 95 percent of the victims of kidnappings in Nigeria are Nigerian. In most cases, a ransom is paid, ending the ordeal. Abductees often include high-profile individuals or family members of prominent politicians. Artists are rarely targeted, as they are generally considered to be a voice for the voiceless. Osayomore, born in Benin City but raised in Lagos, is one of these voices, particularly for the Edo people. He first fell in love with music in the heart of a vibrating commercial and cultural center of Nigeria. A water way in the Niger Delta, photographed on June 8, 2016.

The oil-rich Delta region in Nigeria was, at the time, experiencing the rise of a new militant group vowing to cripple the economy. In 1969, at 19 years old, he joined the military at the tail end of the Nigerian Civil War, where he began his music training as a member of the military's band, studying flute, guitar and piano. Osayomore also learned a trick or two from Nigerian popular musicians of the time, especially Sir Victor Uwaifo, King Sunny Ade and Fela Anikulapo Kuti. \"Fela's Shrine was directly opposite my military school, in Lagos,\" Osayomore says, referencing the storied venue where Kuti regularly held ecstatic court. \"I was very close to him. I would sit with him when he was blowing his sax and I was blowing my flute.\" Beyond sharing a love for music, Fela also inspired Osayomore to use music in the service of activism. \"Only a few of us in Nigeria were attacking bad governments \u2014 [other musicians] wouldn't dare it.\" At that time, Fela warned Osayomore that the road would not be easy, but Osayomore was steeled. \"My heart was already hardened before I went into political songs, because I saw what those in front passed through.\" After serving his time in the military, Osayomore returned to Benin City to start his own band. \"When I was growing in music, I decided to come back home, where they would understand me better,\" Osayomore says. He applied his musical training to merging the popular music of the times \u2014 funk, Afrobeat and highlife \u2014 with the traditional songs and rhythms of Edo. \"Based on my background in the military and the kind of music I studied, I was able to infuse that into our traditional music. So that training gave me a kind of edge over the rest.\" Osayomore called his new style Ulele Power Sound, drawing on a rare form of traditional Edo music. \"Ulele is a type of dance that they use to perform those days, in the village. It was almost forgotten. So I decided this is how I play my music, like Ulele music.\" With this sound, Osayomore had a number of regional hits in the early '80s, including \"Efewedo,\" \"Ororo No Dey Fade\" and \"Soja Go Soja Come.\" The funky, percussion-heavy grooves formed a solid bed for Osayomore's hoarse voice and slippery flute lines, earning him fans across Nigeria and among the growing Edo communities in the U.S. and Europe. However, Osayomore's success came at a particularly difficult time in Nigerian history. The military dictator Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida ruled the country from 1985 until 1993, followed by the equally corrupt and oppressive Sani Abacha from 1993 until 1998. Babangida implemented harsh austerity measures while looting the national treasury for his personal enrichment, embedding corruption as a political standard and brutally silencing political opponents and journalists. In the early 1990s, Osayomore responded to the political situation with a number of critical songs, including \"Truth\" and \"Teacher.\" Osayomore mostly kept his criticism indirect, until Babangida annulled the results of the democratic election of June 12, 1992 that should have brought the popular politician M.K.O. Abiola to power. \"I was so bitter! I was so bitter that I had no option but to resort to musical violence. I said I would militate against any government that is there, through my music.\" Osayomore made a powerful statement, releasing an album entitled June 12th Is God's Mandate. On the biting, aggressive song \"Baba Na Wa,\" Osayomore calls Babangida \"evil,\" \"original criminal\" and the \"father of all disaster.\" \"It did not go down well with the military.\" Osayomore says. \"At any given time, the army would come and take me away. Sometimes for a month or two, nobody knew where I was.\" However, his outspoken criticism of corruption and wrongdoing, on songs like \"Son of a Thief,\" \"Army of Freedom\" and especially \"Baba Na Wa,\" gained him the lasting support and love of the Edo people and inspired an ongoing tradition of activist-musicians in Edo State. \"I knew that someday, somebody could shoot me \u2014 but so be it! That's the price we pay for activism! Yes, I was afraid for my life, but I'm lucky that so many people saw the truth in my songs, so they were always on my side.\" Ambassador Osayomore Joseph, center, and his band performing at a wedding ceremony in Benin City, Nigeria on December 31, 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Morgan Greenstreet\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ambassador Osayomore Joseph, center, and his band performing at a wedding ceremony in Benin City, Nigeria on December 31, 2016. Given his history as an activist musician and the respect he commands in Edo State, Osayomore's kidnapping had many people wondering if there was a political motivation to his sudden disappearance. But, despite the political rhetoric of the kidnappers, Osayomore was adamant: \"These are just criminals whose means of livelihood is kidnapping, and there are pockets of them all over the country. [There is] no political relationship at all \u2014 they're illiterates, they're trigger hungry, they don't know who is a freedom fighter, who is not! Very nasty people. It was a terrible experience.\" Osayomore usually releases a new album twice a year \u2014 104 so far. Although the production values are often rough, these albums are an important link between him and his fans, nationally and internationally, and an important source of revenue. Available locally at music stores in Edo State and internationally on YouTube, each album sparks debate and commentary and leads to performances at local and international community events. Osayomore's nickname, 'Ambassador,' was bestowed because he frequently travels to the United States and Europe to perform, primarily for Edo communities. \"I've been traveling to the U.S. since early 1992, and ever since then I go back virtually every year.\" On the last song on his new album, he appeals to the Edo diaspora in the United States for support, calling on individuals by name. He hopes to return to the U.S. this summer, depending on how quickly he can recover, emotionally and financially. \"My account is now minus zero; I have nothing left. But my people are trying to make sure I still keep my body and soul together, partially supporting my means of livelihood. That's where we are now.\"",

            "article_content": "Members of the small Jewish community of Whitefish, Mont., a resort town 60 miles south of the Canadian border, believe a line was crossed between free speech rights and credible threats of violence.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of the small Jewish community of Whitefish, Mont., a resort town 60 miles south of the Canadian border, believe a line was crossed between free speech rights and credible threats of violence. In the pristine resort town of Whitefish, Mont., members of the small Jewish community believe that neo-Nazi online trolls have crossed a line. They went right past free speech rights, residents say, and made credible threats of violence. It all began over a year ago with a reported argument between a local Realtor and the mother of one of Whitefish's most controversial part-time residents, the white nationalist Richard Spencer. The apparent dispute was over a high value commercial building Sherry Spencer owns in downtown Whitefish that had become the focus of a potential protest against her son. Many locals in this liberal pocket of northwest Montana say Richard Spencer \u2013 and by association his family - has brought unwanted attention and an undeserved image of hate politics to their tourist dependent town. The Realtor, Tanya Gersh, is Jewish. And local news reports about the dispute quickly caught the eye of a well-known, white supremacist from Ohio named Andrew Anglin. He's the founder and publisher of the neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer. Anglin published the personal information online of the Realtor and other prominent Jewish leaders in town and called on his followers, or \"stormers\" to come to the defense of the Spencers. He also called for an armed neo-Nazi march through the streets of Whitefish. Things got ugly quick. The resulting \"troll storm\" shed new light on an increasingly common \u2013 and unsettling \u2013 tactic of far-right extremists that have gained more prominence since the 2016 election. \"At the core of Anglin's campaign was an old story of Jewish hatred,\" says Francine Roston, the rabbi of Glacier Jewish Community in Whitefish. Roston says the Daily Stormer promoted a false narrative that Jews were \"taking over this white, pristine town\" of Whitefish and driving the Whites out. Roston was on the receiving end of harassing emails laced with racial slurs and frequent anti-semitic posts to her Facebook wall including memes with captions like \"you should go jump in an oven\" and \"We're going to come cremate you.\" Some of the \"trollers\" even named her 14-year-old son, and suggested her family should watch out. Rabbi Francine Roston's personal information was posted online about a year ago. She then received hateful messages about her religion.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPr\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rabbi Francine Roston's personal information was posted online about a year ago. She then received hateful messages about her religion. \"I understand free speech,\" Roston says. \"But imagery directed toward Jews because they're Jews relating to the Holocaust, the message there is 'we want you dead.'\" The \"storm\" put people on edge for weeks. Roston filed police reports, installed a home security system and even decided to get firearms training and purchased her first handgun. \"I wanted to make sure I could protect myself and protect my family,\" Roston says. Free speech or \"imminent\" threat? According to police, there was little that could be done at that moment because, for the most part, the threats were more general and vague, and the trollers weren't showing up at Roston's or the other victims' doors inciting imminent violence. Whitefish's police chief, Bill Dial, advised that the victims file police reports, but otherwise go dark and not engage. There wasn't a whole lot that could be done at that moment, the authorities said, because Anglin and his trollers seemed to know just where the line was between free speech and credible threats of harm. A year later, some in Whitefish think that line needs to be redrawn. The Realtor in the original dispute, Tanya Gersh, who is thought to have born the worst of the trolling, is suing Anglin and his website in federal court. The case is being brought with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"These are not informational opinion or any other kind of protected First Amendment communications, these are assaults,\" says John Morrison, Gersh's attorney, a Democrat and the former Montana state auditor. Morrison said the trolling amounted to personal attacks, including an allegation included in court filings that one call to Gersh's personal cell phone was a recording of gunfire. The SPLC did not make Gersh available to NPR for an interview, citing the pending litigation. Montana - and the Flathead Valley that surrounds Whitefish in particular - has long been a haven for white supremacists and other political extremists such as militias. In 1988, the state passed a strict anti-intimidation law, which Morrison says the trolling violated. That law is set to be tested. The courts have generally ruled that speech doesn't become illegal unless a threat is \"imminent.\" Marc Randazza, a prominent First Amendment attorney who's representing Andrew Anglin in the case, says it's hard to prove and for good reason. \"If you believe in freedom of expression, you have to believe in it for Nazis, Klansmen, pornographers and anybody else you might find to be objectionable,\" Randazza says. Randazza stressed that he too thinks the memes and the anti-Jewish slurs were horrible. Sherry Spencer also condemned the trolling at the end of this piece in Medium. But Randazza says when you put tools in place to restrict speech, it can backfire later. \"Mr. Anglin, all that he intended to incite, and all that he did incite, was people expressing themselves,\" Randazza says. Anglin's attorneys have filed a motion in federal court in Missoula to dismiss the case. The judge has yet to rule. Mixed feelings over what's next Folks in Whitefish seem torn over the lawsuit and whether it should move forward. The trolling eventually died down in January of last year. And Anglin's planned, armed neo-Nazi march through the snowy streets of Whitefish never happened. Instead, the town staged a large counter-rally denouncing the hate. Then Charlottesville happened and media attention shifted elsewhere. Whitefish, at the doorstep to Glacier National Park with its beautiful lake and famous ski resort, draws tourists from around the world. People here don't want any more negative attention. But, on the other hand, the trolling got so hateful and personal. The rabbi, Francine Roston, even said that she thinks one of the trollers was the father of someone she knew. She was diagnosed with PTSD and remains in counseling a year on. \"What I hope is that we look at the lines of free speech and I'm hoping that this case is able to, maybe, redraw the line,\" Roston says. The trolling didn't stop at the small Jewish community either. Anglin's followers started going after anyone in town they thought was Jewish, and local businesses that had \"Love Lives Here\" signs posted in their windows (the name of a local anti-hate and social justice activist group). Jennifer Runnels says she got targeted simply because she was featured on the local news organizing gift baskets to give to members of the Jewish community after the trolling. After the TV news report aired, she found her name featured prominently the next day on the Daily Stormer. Then came the ugly emails and the posts on Yelp about her local handmade soap business. \"I got fake reviews that said my soap was made with the fat of Holocaust victims,\" Runnels says. At first she was scared \u2013 she has two young kids. Then, she tried to shrug it off as nothing personal. But it was hard to take. \"They are very misogynistic,\" she says. \"They used names like whore and slut and bitch.\" People here like Runnels also seem partly resigned to the fact that there may be no recourse in the end for the trolling victims. They're also ready for the trollers to return, assuming the case moves forward. Runnels and Rabbi Roston promise to hold more counter rallies and peaceful protests. It's the one thing we for sure can do, they say.",

She has purchased over 450 flowering plants using donations to clean up city planters. Savanna Madamombe's life is very different than it was a year ago. Originally from just outside Zimbabwe's capital Harare, Madamombe moved to Manhattan in 2000, where she worked in hotels and restaurants \u2014 and watched from afar as her country slowly crumbled under the authoritarian rule of President Robert Mugabe. She felt helpless, like she didn't even recognize Zimbabwe anymore. So she got on Facebook and started speaking out, talking to other members of the Zimbabwean diaspora. She organized protests with hundreds of people when Mugabe visited the United Nations last year. And she live-streamed all of it on social media. Savanna Madamombe grew up in Harare but lived in New York for the past 17 years. Following Robert Mugabe's ouster, she returned to Zimbabwe's capital last December.\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption All of this meant that it was too risky to return to Zimbabwe to see her family while Mugabe was in power. Under Mugabe, who ruled for 37 years until last November, police routinely used excessive force to snuff out dissent, rights groups say. Law enforcement violently crushed peaceful protests and arrested opposition activists. Prominent critics were beaten and sometimes mysteriously disappeared. But last week, Madamombe, 49, sat in her sister's house in Harare, beaming as the low winter sun streamed through the window. When a military takeover resulted in Mugabe's ouster last November, he was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former member of Mugabe's cabinet. Despite concerns over Mnangagwa's own human rights record, the new leader has taken steps to lift restrictions on free speech and pledged for a more open Zimbabwe. He also promised fresh elections in July \u2014 the first without Mugabe's name on the ballot since the country gained independence in 1980.

She says she views this as a moment of opportunity for the country, and she wants to seize it to show people in Zimbabwe that they can hold leaders accountable. \"I know for sure that if it was still Robert Mugabe, I would never dare to do it,\" she says, referring to her activist work. \"The Mugabe era is gone, and it's something that can't ever be allowed to come back.\" Her videos in Harare are all about drawing attention to the ways the city has deteriorated in the past few decades, partially due to economic collapse, but also due to inaction in the city council. She walks through the center of town, live-streaming on Facebook, pointing out piles of trash and crumbling buildings. And she calls out city councilors by name, tagging them in her posts.

Her main focus: Giant concrete planters, once filled with plants, now full of trash and weeds. \"In good faith, I want to plant some flowers, do something small,\" she says. \"Blooming flowers to me speak of a new life.\" Amanda Murombo, Madamombe's niece, works in a planter in the center of Harare.

Hi Jacob. Hi Sam! Do me a favor, guys \u2014 share the video!\" The views and shares on her videos are routinely in the hundreds. One from a New York City protest last year drew more than 30,000 views. A short while later, the truck pulls over to a roadside flower nursery, and Madamombe hops out, instructing the staff to pile the truck bed full of flowers. Over 450 pansies, snapdragons, petunias, violets and marigolds are carefully lined up, ready for the journey downtown. Madamombe pays for all of it through donations, carefully counting out a mix of U.S. dollars and Zimbabwean bond notes \u2014 and, of course, live-streams throughout the transaction.

People crowd the sidewalks, leaning on the giant planters, eating food from street vendors. Madamombe and her team get to work, jumping on top of the planters, picking out empty liquor bottles and napkins, and hoeing the dry clumps of dirt. They're wearing matching T-shirts with \"Fix Zimbabwe or Die Trying\" stenciled on the front. Madamombe had them made at a local shop. In most cities, this would not be revolutionary. In Harare, it was unheard of, until recently. Any form of protest, however small, could elicit a violent response from authorities under Mugabe. Even planting flowers in a public space. Bystanders stop to stare and ask what's going on. They offer suggestions or give her words of encouragement. It doesn't take long until someone jumps in to help.

As the team starts to unload the flowers, he slowly puts away his headphones and quietly approaches Madamombe. She throws him a T-shirt and motions to the truck. Within minutes, his hands are covered in soil. \"No one would ever think of doing this, which is cool!\" he says with a laugh. \"It feels good to be helping.\" Madamombe and her guerrilla gardening crew work well into the afternoon, and she tirelessly interacts with people as they walk by. She hands out her phone number for people to join in next time, and asks business owners on the block if they'll help care for the plants and make sure to water them. \"In good faith, I want to plant some flowers, do something small,\" Madamombe says. \"Blooming flowers to me speak of a new life.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption By the end, the trash is gone and the planters are transformed into a rainbow quilt of new life. Samuel Nyawaranda, 44, works in the area, and he's out running an errand, counting coins on the side of the planter. He sees Madamombe at work and approaches her to tell her how much he appreciates it. He says he thinks this is all part of the new Zimbabwe so many people are hoping for, after elections next month. \"You know, when everyone is expecting a change, even the environment needs to be changed,\" he tells her. Days later, the flowers are still there. Madamombe has been watering them every day, with water from a broken pipe down the street. A man who runs a sidewalk stall selling shoes across the street is also helping protect the flowers. He picks out trash and says he wants to make sure the planters don't go back to the way they were.

Councilman Rusty Markham is one of the city councilors regularly tagged in Madamombe's videos to draw officials' attention to protest issues. He says he likes what she's doing, but warns that Zimbabwe is far from a free and open democracy. \"It's outspoken, it's activism in its truest form,\" he says. \"One of my slogans is, 'Just ask the question.' Because people stopped asking the question. Now, if you get stopped by someone who wants a bribe or a fine or something, say, 'Why do you want it from me? What have I done wrong? Show me.' No one does that.\" Zimbabwe has huge national problems \u2014 a cash shortage, corruption, a broken economy, to list a few. A recent explosion at a political rally for Mnangagwa left two dead, and several wounded. So what can a few flowers really accomplish? \"Forget the flowers,\" Madamombe says, shaking her head. \"It's a symbol. I'm hoping this will start a conversation. That's essential. That has been gone for a long time.\"",

But I have found some supporters, too. And everybody - it's pretty quiet, and everybody seems to be coming out to vote. We've seen a lot of long lines, and it seems pretty quiet so far. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What does that tell you when you go to these two areas and one for and one against? I mean, a lot of people have predicted that this election could really divide the country. KAHN: I think the country is polarized right now. We'll have to see how the vote comes out. Polls show Lopez Obrador with more than 50 percent of the vote. And that would be quite a mandate for him. So we'll have to see how the vote shakes out. And this country, toward the northern areas is more industrialized. People have very different voting records. He hasn't had that much of influence there. But polls show that he's doing pretty well there, too. His support is mostly in the center and down in the south. And then, we'll see how he does. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I mentioned the violence there in the run-up to this election. Are - is there a lot of security at the polling stations? KAHN: Well, the first polling station that I went to in the city of Mexico, it - there was three cops. And they said they were going to be there all day, and it was very quiet. This place - when we pulled up, there was one patrol car here, and they had all their windshields cracked. And they didn't seem like they were really ready if anything actually happened, but they've since gone. And there isn't any security here, but it just seems very quiet. People are lining up and coming in and just seems to be a very tranquil atmosphere right now. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is AMLO promising to do if, indeed, the polls are right and he wins? KAHN: Well, his big No. 1 issue is corruption. He says he's going to fight corruption. He says it is the problem No. 1 of this country, causes crime. It causes poverty. It causes inequality. He wants to fight what he likes to call the mafia of power that he says has ruined this country. He says he's going to do it by leading by example. He's going to be hardworking, honest. He's going to get up at 6 a.m., work 16 hours a day and have a very austere government. He also says - his stuff - what he talks about how he's going to fight crime, it's been sort of vague, not a lot of details. He's - he had talked about maybe amnesty for low-level drug offenders. But what - he really wants to strengthen the social fabric. He says that's what's needed in society today - better education, more jobs, strengthen the economy. He's promising quite a lot. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn in Mexico. Thank you so much. KAHN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Thousands of mostly Honduran migrants trek toward the U.S. Trump says the U.S. will withdraw from a nuclear treaty with Russia. And, why Georgia purges more than half a million voters from its rolls.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: A group of migrants has focused fresh attention on the flow of people from Central America. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: They've been labeled a caravan, some 7,000 people, many of them fleeing violence in Honduras. They're moving north, and some mean to reach the United States. Mexican authorities talked of stopping them, but let them pass into southern Mexico. Now, their journey comes amid a U.S. election campaign. And President Trump made a claim about what kind of people the migrants are with no evidence to back it up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are hardened criminals. These are tough, tough people. And I don't want them in our country. GREENE: We have a reporter on the line, James Fredrick, who has been reporting on this group and joins us now from Mexico. Hi there, James. JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So tell us where you are exactly at this moment, and tell us about the condition of the people in this caravan. FREDRICK: So I am in the central part of Tapachula, Mexico, right now. It's about 20 miles north of the border with Guatemala. People here are sleeping right now. I mean, they are just sleeping on the ground here. The central park is packed. It was a brutal day yesterday. They walked more than 20 miles from the border to get to this town. Temperatures got above 90 degrees. It's really humid, and there are tons and tons of children, some elderly people here. You know, yesterday was particularly hard for 34-year-old Gizelle Vasquez Cruz (ph), who I spoke to, because she's traveling with her three young children and a sister who has four children of her own. GIZELLE VASQUEZ CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). FREDRICK: So she says, \"it's really hard because the kids have to walk. So we brought suitcases so we can store water and food people donate to us for the kids.\" She also said they actually feel kind of lucky to have these little rolling suitcases because they can get the kids to sit on the suitcases. They can pull them along just to make sure their young kids don't get so tired on these really, really, long, arduous walks. GREENE: Wow. I mean, we're talking about weather, we're talking about exhaustion, we're talking about getting supplies. And in addition to all of those obstacles, it sounds like many questions about what governments were going to do in terms of letting them pass, right? FREDRICK: Exactly. And it's been really difficult to figure out so far what exactly the Mexican strategy or plan is here. So I was walking with the caravan yesterday, and then we went ahead a couple of miles because the Mexican police had set up a huge blockade with hundreds of riot police. We were worried there was going to be another clash. And then a couple minutes later, Mexican police lifted that blockade, and the caravan continued marching as normal. So it's been hard to figure out how Mexico (unintelligible) is going to continue responding to this. They're still in very far southern Mexico. We don't know if Mexico is going to try to use police to stop this caravan. GREENE: And then of course, we have President Trump saying that they're not going to be allowed to come to the United States. Let me just ask you, James, I mean, migrants from Central America. This is not a new development, but this is a huge group. Does that tell us anything about how this story might be changing? FREDRICK: Yeah. So you're right. Migrants from Central America, countries like Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador, have been coming to the U.S. for a long time in large numbers. But this thing of a caravan, talking to people here, what they say is that this is an opportunity to feel safer on this migrant route. So they have plenty of reasons for wanting to flee, of violence and poverty and things like that. And when they hear a caravan is happening, they said, this is a really good opportunity for us to not be so exposed on this migrant route that is really dangerous, and we can be in a big group and feel safer. INSKEEP: Worth underlining the difference between the sound bites and what James Fredrick just reported from there on the ground. The president describes hardened criminals. The reporter, looking at the people, describes a mother with three children, a mother with four children. And the complexity there is a lot - it's just different than the sound bite. Although we should underline also, they do not have permission to enter the United States. GREENE: Well, indeed. And that on-the-ground reporting came from James Fredrick, who is actually with that caravan in Mexico. James, we appreciate it. FREDRICK: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: President Trump is saying that the United States is going to withdraw from a nuclear treaty with Russia that has been in place now for decades. INSKEEP: Yeah. President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed that treaty in 1987. It's called the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or the INF treaty, and it banned the two powers from having particular kinds of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. This caused more than 2,500 weapons to be destroyed. Now, in recent years, the Obama administration, in addition to President Trump's administration, have accused Russia of violating this agreement starting back in 2014. President Obama, though, decided not to withdraw from the treaty then because some European leaders expressed concerns that that could trigger an arms race. GREENE: And let's bring in NPR's Lucian Kim, NPR's correspondent in Moscow. Hi, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what exactly is President Trump's argument here? KIM: Well, the Trump administration is saying that Russia has been cheating for years. As Steve already mentioned, Obama already accused President Putin of testing a new cruise missile that violated the treaty, which the Kremlin denied. So these accusations have really been around for some time. And in fact, someone who has criticized them a lot is Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton. And he just arrived in Moscow over the weekend and is expected to deliver this message to Putin. GREENE: That's interesting timing. So we might hear more about how the two countries are going to talk about this. Well, have the Russians said anything yet to this point after Trump made this announcement? KIM: Well, the reaction we've been hearing over the weekend has been quite predictable. We're hearing officials calling it very dangerous, continuing blackmail. And one of the signatories of that agreement, Mikhail Gorbachev, said the withdrawal is not the work of a great mind and that it's a mistake. But in fact, you know, this is not really a huge surprise. The recriminations are mutual. Russia has been saying that elements of the American anti-missile shield in Eastern Europe is in violation of the INF treaty. And some analysts here in Moscow say that Putin has actually wanted to end this treaty for a long time, but he wanted the U.S. to be the one to rip it up because there are a lot of other countries - first and foremost, China - that are developing these medium-range missiles, and Russia doesn't want to have its hands tied in countering those threats. GREENE: That's interesting. So if Putin wanted this anyway, is this that big a deal? I mean, is this going to have ripple effects or not? KIM: Well, it definitely has ripple effects. I mean, it feeds into this Russian argument that the U.S. is always taking unilateral action without consulting anyone else. There's really a widespread feeling in Russia that after the Cold War, the West, and especially the United States, didn't do enough to integrate Russia into some kind of new, overarching security agreement. So, you know, in 2002, the Bush administration left the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Now we have Trump leaving the INF treaty. And this could endanger the so-called New START treaty negotiated by Obama, which is up for renewal. GREENE: NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow. Lucian, thanks, as always. KIM: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. So in a single day in July of 2017, the state of Georgia purged more than half a million voters from its voter rolls. That's 8 percent of registered voters in the state. INSKEEP: Wow. More than 100,000 of those voters were removed from the rolls because of a so-called use it or lose it policy. That is a policy in Georgia and at least nine other states that eliminates voters for deciding not to vote in some prior elections. GREENE: And one reason we're talking about this this morning is because Georgia's secretary of state, who oversees voting and oversees the voter rolls, is Brian Kemp. And he happens to be the Republican candidate for governor. WABE's Johnny Kauffman is here to talk about this. He reported this story along with Reveal and APM Reports. Hey there, Johnny. JOHNNY KAUFFMAN, BYLINE: Hey there. GREENE: So tell us why this is significant. KAUFFMAN: Well, this is a really close historic race for governor here right now. There's lots of national attention on it, and it's kind of seen as this sort of test for the 2020 presidential contest. And Brian Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who would be the first black female governor in the country. And her strategy is all about boosting turnout among people of color, right? Democrats and civil rights groups say that these voters, they don't show up at the polls as regularly as Republicans. And so they say the use it or lose it purges disproportionately affect those voters and that really this is a new voter suppression tactic that Republicans are using to help them win. GREENE: Is this an issue that seems to be capturing the attention of voters as this election gets closer? KAUFFMAN: Yeah. This has become a big campaign issue. And we went to a small town in southwest Georgia called Moultrie. Most people there in the town are black or Latino, and turnout is really low. And we spoke to this man, named Reverend Cornelius Ponder, who's on the city council there. And he says part of that low turnout is because of all these obstacles to voting, including the purges. So here's a clip of ponder from our story that aired on the podcast Reveal. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"REVEAL\") CORNELIUS PONDER: It almost give people the mindset that this is a privilege, not a right. And so now anything that is a privilege has to get permission. And so if you don't do our way, we won't give you the permission to use this privilege. KAUFFMAN: And so when it comes to the purges, Ponder's aunt, actually, was someone who was removed for not voting. She didn't know it. Her nephew didn't know it. And her story is kind of that she voted for Obama in 2008. She hasn't voted since then and she's thinking about voting for Abrams, but unless she registered before the deadline earlier this month, she may go to the polls and won't be able to vote. And Georgia doesn't have same-day voter registration, unlike some other states. GREENE: Now, you actually spoke to Secretary Kemp, the Republican candidate who actually carried out this policy, right? I mean, what's his argument here? KAUFFMAN: Yeah. Kemp says he's just following the law. And this is legal. The Supreme Court actually approved policies like this earlier this year. He says the state sends out multiple notifications before it removes people, and that this is in part a way of combating voter fraud. And Kemp says he has not been more aggressive in purging voters than previous secretaries of state. But the numbers show a big jump in people removed. We found 1.6 million have been removed since he took over. GREENE: OK. WABE's Johnny Kauffman, along with Reveal and APM Reports, dug into a purge of more than 100,000 voters in Georgia, and that has become an issue in this coming election. Johnny, thanks a lot for all that reporting. KAUFFMAN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., on Dec. 31, after announcing plans to explore a campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n                \n                    \n                    Meredith Nierman/WGBH\n                    \n                \nhide caption Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Mass., on Dec. 31, after announcing plans to explore a campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Updated at 11:46 a.m. ET Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren essentially kicked off her 2020 presidential campaign on Monday, announcing an exploratory committee \u2014 a formal step toward seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 \u2014 along with outlining a pitch to voters. In a highly produced 4 1/2 minute video emailed to supporters on New Year's Eve, Warren made a populist political appeal, recounting her own middle class background and her work on consumer financial protections. Warren insisted the middle class is \"under attack\" from corporations and the right, including President Trump, who she vowed can be defeated in 2020. \"How did we get here?\" she asked rhetorically. \"Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.\" Warren's possible strength in what will be a crowded contest includes her track record of speaking to economic concerns. She has also consistently shown that she's willing to fight with President Trump. But she is a polarizing figure who may struggle to craft her own narrative, in part, because she has become a foe for conservatives, who portray her as a liberal elitist by pointing to her background as a Harvard law professor. Prior to 2012, when she became the first woman elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, Warren had never held elected office. Still, the 69-year-old senator has been a liberal icon since even before she was first elected. A professor turned consumer advocate, she was instrumental in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. But her outspoken criticism of the banking industry has also earned her the ire of some conservatives. During her years as a senator, Warren is perhaps best known for sharply grilling financial executives. In 2016, she famously told the then-CEO of Wells Fargo he \"should resign\" for leading the bank during a time when it created fake accounts. Speculation that Warren might run for president began almost as soon as she won her Senate seat in 2012. In 2016, many progressive groups urged her to run for president and her hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, even ran an editorial arguing that \"Democrats need Elizabeth Warren's voice in 2016 presidential race.\" Warren passed up the opportunity, but four years later she is now ready \u2014 although she will face a much larger field, including possibly other progressive favorites like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and several other fellow senators likely to join the fray. Some two dozen Democrats are expected to run for president this cycle, including a number of women and candidates of color. It's not clear those same progressive activists who had encouraged Warren to run a few years ago will back her this time with a wider field to choose from. \"Senator Elizabeth Warren's formal entrance into the 2020 race for President today helps launch what we believe will be a vibrant discussion of bold, inclusive populist ideas in the Democratic Primary, and we look forward to the wide array of progressive candidates that we expect to join her in it in the year ahead,\" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, in a statement. In 2014 and 2015, DFA worked with Moveon.org to encourage Warren to run for president. Warren's entrance into the contest to try and challenge President Trump in 2020 is a development he's likely to relish. Trump has frequently delighted in derisively calling Warren \"Pocahontas,\" a reference to her 2012 campaign against Republican Scott Brown when he claimed she had misrepresented her family's Cherokee heritage for professional gain. In October 2018 \u2014 one of the clearest signs yet she was readying for a national campaign \u2014 Warren released results of a DNA test showing that she did have Native American ancestry going back several generations. The Cherokee Nation, however, called the DNA testing \"useless.\" The incident was intended to quiet critics, but quickly became a cultural faux pas of its own. Trump's taunting did not end. And even some Democrats accused Warren of misunderstanding the complexity of race and identity. Warren appears to target voters of varied cultural, geographic and economic backgrounds with an anti-corporate, pro-worker message in her initial campaign pitch. One of the biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 bid was a focus on appealing to specific demographic groups, particularly marginalized groups, alienating white, working-class voters who helped elect Trump. In her launch video, Warren touched on her working-class childhood in Oklahoma. She discusses how her mother got a minimum wage job at Sears when her father got sick, in order to keep the family in their house.",

            "article_content": "Election Day has brought perhaps historic levels of voter turnout and very high stakes for both parties, as well as President Trump.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: People across the country are turning out to vote today in number that could end up being historic for a midterm election. And a lot is on the line - the vast majority of governorships, state legislatures and control of Congress. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson will be with us all night as the results come in. She joins us now to kick off our Election Day coverage. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So the president spoke yesterday about how midterms used to be boring, but this is, quote, \"the hottest thing.\" Does he have a point? LIASSON: He does, actually. I think we are on track, according to our own Domenico Montanaro, to maybe have the highest midterm turnout since 1966. And I think the president can take some credit and blame for that. In 2016, he got more white, working-class people to come out and vote than many analysts thought possible. And now his leadership style and his divisive rhetoric have caused a huge counterreaction. So Democratic turnout is out. So, yes, the midterms have become hotter, and Donald Trump can take some of the credit or blame. CORNISH: Let's talk a little bit about Democrats, then, because they would be perhaps the most nervous - right? - and most hopeful about tonight. What would success look like for them? LIASSON: I think success for Democrats is taking back the House, making significant gains in governors' races and legislative races around the country and limiting their losses in the Senate. CORNISH: And for Republicans - I mean, people have talked about this being a referendum on the president. LIASSON: I think success for the Republicans would be picking up more than net-two seats in the Senate, holding the line in governors' races and state legislative races and limiting their losses in the House, maybe holding the net pickups to under 30 or at least keeping the majority. And don't forget that Republicans have more seats right now nationwide than they've ever had since the 1920s. So they really are at their zenith. They really have nowhere to go but down. CORNISH: Can you talk more about what it does mean for each side if they fall short? LIASSON: Well, for Democrats, if they fall short, they're shut out across the board again. They're in the wilderness. They will have no say in the redistricting process that happens after the 2020 census in the states. I think they will form a big, ugly, circular firing squad. Although, one Democrat said to me even if they win, they'll form a circular firing squad. I think for Republicans, it means their legislative agenda grinds to a halt. Of course, if they keep the Senate, they can still confirm judges. And for the president, I think the biggest change if he loses is that legislation ends. Oversight begins. Subpoenas start coming to the White House. Maybe the Democrats try to impeach him. I don't know if the White House is quite ready for all of those investigations. And even more than that, he will have lost. No matter how he spins it, he embraced the election as a referendum on him. And tonight, people are either going to validate his leadership or decide they want a check and balance on it. CORNISH: That's what's at stake. Do we know what the expectations are? Has the White House talked about - I guess talked a game about what they hope to hear tonight? LIASSON: Well, the president has been - said a lot of things about what he expects. He says there's a lot of electricity, big crowds at his rallies. He thinks he's going - they're going to do great in the Senate. And he even thinks they're going to do good in the House. Although, he has publicly entertained the notion that they might lose the House. What I am told is that the president feels good about what he's done. He did 30 rallies - 11 for the House, 19 for Senate and gubernatorial candidates. He feels he didn't leave anything on the field. He's not a regrets kind of guy. Although, he did say, in an interview with Sinclair Broadcasting, that maybe he could have used a softer tone. He said, quote, \"that would be something I'll be working on.\" But what I'm told is, so far, there are no plans for a press conference tomorrow, which is often traditional after a midterm. But that could change. CORNISH: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. We'll hear more from her later. Thanks so much, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 1:40 ET Monday Preliminary results show that Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right congressman and former army captain, returned a commanding lead in the first round of Brazil's presidential election. Now, with 99 percent of the votes counted, Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party will head to a runoff on Oct. 28. Bolsonaro, the leader of Brazil's Social Liberal Party, led with 46 percent of the vote. Haddad \u2014 a stand-in for jailed former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who's currently serving 12 years for corruption \u2014 trailed Bolsonaro with 29 percent. The 55-year-old mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo and former education minister has worked to appeal to working-class Brazilians who remember Lula's government as a boon to social programs and living standards. Bolsonaro, 63, fell just short of capturing the majority he needed (more than 50 percent of votes) to claim an outright win, and avert a runoff against leftist rival Fernando Haddad. This election has surfaced deep divisions in Latin America's largest democracy, NPR's Philip Reeves reports from Rio de Janeiro, \"between those who think Bolsonaro will combat rampant crime and corruption and others alienated by his misogynist and racist comments, and his admiration for Brazil's past military dictatorship.\" With the presidency in sight, The New York Times reports, \"Bolsonaro said Sunday night he intended to unite a nation that is 'on the brink of chaos' and said, 'Together we will rebuild our Brazil.' \" Bolsonaro's popularity grew after he was stabbed last month while campaigning in Juiz de Fora, a city in southeast Brazil. As NPR's Sasha Ingber reported for NPR last month: \"The coverage of the attack has also increased his presence on national television. Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations in S\u00e3o Paulo, wrote in a tweet that the assassination attempt \"increases his chances to make it into the 2nd round. Frequent updates on his health status will give him visibility on primetime TV. Adversaries won't be able to attack him as easily as before.\"",

            "article_content": "Voters under 30 generally vote at much lower rates than older Americans. In Las Vegas, less than 5 percent voted in the 2014 midterms. That can mean their priorities are overlooked by campaigns.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Election Day is less than eight weeks away. But in a midterm year, a majority of voters don't cast a ballot. In particular, young people are far less likely to vote than older people. In the last midterm election, only about 20 percent of voters under age 30 showed up at the polls. NPR's Asma Khalid has been exploring why so many people sit out elections in America and has this report from Nevada. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: In the 2014 election, the area around the Las Vegas Strip, which is Nevada's first congressional district, had one of the worst youth-voter turnout rates in the country. Less than 5 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted. That's according to estimates from Tufts University. Brenda Lopez was one of those nonvoters. The day we met, she left her house at 5:30 in the morning for a job at an armored cash-handling company. By the time she gets back home - the home she shares with her parents, her grandma, her siblings, her husband and her daughter - she is exhausted. BRENDA LOPEZ: It's not easy, you know, being a mom and then being wife, having to cook and just still trying to keep up with work and school. And I feel like I have no time for myself. KHALID: Lopez is 26, and she's not registered to vote. LOPEZ: One of the main reasons why I haven't voted is because I feel that I'm always too busy. KHALID: Lopez doesn't like how President Trump talks about immigrants. She would love better health care. Medicaid, she says, was a godsend when she was pregnant. But even if she registers, she's not sure who she would vote for. Many young people like Lopez feel they haven't learned enough about American politics in high school. And so like 23-year-old Shelby Mabis, they don't see the point in voting. And Mabis is a stocky, blond Marine Corps vet taking a mandatory political science class at a community college in Vegas. SHELBY MABIS: I've never voted before. From what - all I know about voting is that you show up to a poll place, and you vote. But I don't know what I need to bring. I don't even know what happens during their... KHALID: A recent survey of working-class youth found that nearly 20 percent say they don't think they know enough to vote. As for how and where to vote, that can be found with an Internet search. But for Mabis, it's not just about education. It's about location. He grew up in Missouri. That's where he registered to vote. MABIS: I now - being away from home, I don't feel connected to the political system here at all. KHALID: Analysts say young people tend to move around a lot, and so they often feel less invested in local elections. They also want to choose individual candidates, not just a party label. Many say they felt uninspired by both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. So like Jonas Rand, they didn't vote for president. JONAS RAND: I don't believe that it actually is effective, to vote as a main method of accomplishing political change. KHALID: Rand is a senior studying anthropology. He's a political activist who protests, and he's no fan of our two-party political system. Rand thinks Trump is a fascist, and he's concerned about the immigration policies being enacted. But still, he says voting wouldn't have changed anything. RAND: I feel like it wouldn't be relevant because here in Nevada, we had an electoral college that voted for Clinton. KHALID: But if young people don't vote, they're not going to be targeted by political campaigns because campaigns have data telling them who votes and who doesn't. Francisco Morales is a community activist in Nevada trying to mobilize infrequent voters. FRANCISCO MORALES: It's no coincidence that politicians care a lot about Medicare and Social Security, right? Seniors vote all the time. But some of the other issues that we care about are often overlooked because politicians are not afraid of our voting bloc. KHALID: What kinds of issues, I ask him. MORALES: Issues like the student loans. KHALID: Morales is knocking on doors in a neighborhood where he grew up. He shows me the data on the next woman whose house he's approaching. In 2016, his group contacted her four times. It was time-consuming, but he considers it worth it because ultimately, on Election Day, she voted. Asma Khalid, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Democrat Andrew Gillum's surprise victory in the Florida gubernatorial primary sets up a race between a young, black progressive and Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who has staked his political career on his ties to President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Steve Cannon and Lynne Sladky/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Andrew Gillum's surprise victory in the Florida gubernatorial primary sets up a race between a young, black progressive and Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who has staked his political career on his ties to President Trump. The big story from Tuesday's primaries comes from Florida, where progressive, Bernie Sanders-endorsed Democrat Andrew Gillum won his party's nomination for governor. He will take on Rep. Ron DeSantis, who prides himself on his closeness with President Trump, who enthusiastically backed him. In Arizona, meanwhile, a nasty fight is taking shape between a Republican former fighter pilot, Rep. Martha McSally, and Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat who tried to appeal to independents while Republicans duked it out over who is most like Trump. Here are five top takeaways from Tuesday night: 1. Florida, Florida Florida \u2014 the governor's race just became the hottest race to watch this fall. Call it the Bernie Sanders-Donald Trump race that never happened. Gillum's surprise victory for the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida sets up a race between a young, black progressive with an aspirational working-class message and DeSantis, a Republican who has staked his political career on his ties to President Trump. The bases of both parties want at each other. Now, they'll get their chance. And it's all taking place in the swingiest of swing states. Wow. So, where does America stand, after almost two years of a Trump presidency? Florida, as in so many other elections, may very well tell us. 2. Money isn't everything. What makes Gillum's win even more impressive is that he was far outspent. In a primary contest that saw a whopping $112 million spent overall on TV ads ($73 million of that in the Democratic primary), the most of any race in the country, Gillum's campaign and groups supporting him were outspent by a factor of five by the Democratic favorite \u2014 and even more by other millionaires who ran. Gillum and allies spent just $2.5 million, according to NBC News. Former Rep. Gwen Graham (daughter of Bob Graham, the former Florida governor and senator) and groups supporting her spent $12.5 million. $111.5 Million has been spent in the #FLGovPrimaryRaceGet the latest spending for each race across the US by subscribing to our delta alerts.https://t.co/X3ZWFNtYMF#Delta#AdvertisingAnalytics#ElectionSeason#MidTerms#2018 pic.twitter.com/b3PHbrNpKW It's a lesson that a clear message matters, as does political energy. Gillum fired up the progressive base and, despite not leading in a single poll, he peaked at the right time. He had momentum, which was evident by an event he held with Sanders this month in Tampa that drew about 1,000 people and raised eyebrows. But in a state with as many expensive media markets as Florida, no one can win statewide without breaking the bank. And Gillum now has the backing of two billionaires in George Soros and Tom Steyer \u2014 and expect the money to flow inside and outside the state on both sides as the general election kicks into high gear. The amount of money that's going to be spent in this state by November will probably be staggering. 3. Republican turnout is a warning sign for Democrats. For all the excitement around Gillum with the progressive base \u2014 and there is plenty of reason for them to be excited; just take a look at his victory speech Tuesday night \u2014 his win carries a warning sign, too. It should be pointed out that Republicans turned out in greater numbers for their gubernatorial primary. About 1.6 million Republicans turned out in the GOP primary, while 1.5 million Democrats did. What's more, DeSantis got about 914,000 votes, while Gillum got almost 400,000 fewer. But Gillum still has room to grow: The turnout rate in Miami-Dade, a crucial Democratic area, was the highest in at least a decade \u2014 higher than the 2016 primary, and Gillum was not very well known in that part of the state before last night and faced a more crowded primary than DeSantis. But he still has some work ahead for that to happen. Robust Republican turnout wasn't isolated to Florida, either. The GOP also saw higher turnout in the Arizona governor's race and the hotly watched Senate contest. That's despite Democrat Sinema's lead \u2014 so far \u2014 in general-election polls over Republican McSally. Of course, there was much more activity in the GOP primary, so perhaps it's understandable, but it's something to watch in Arizona, a right-leaning state. 4. Get ready for an ugly fall. Arizona underscored how sharply negative the fall campaigns are about to get. With Sinema leading in the polls, having the luxury to tack to the center while McSally duked it out with two candidates who pulled her to the right, McSally, a former fighter pilot, came out firing. \"I am as impressed as anyone that my opponent owns over 100 pairs of shoes,\" McSally said in her victory speech Tuesday night. \"I, on the other hand, flew over 100 combat missions for our country.\" She also controversially said Tuesday night that the race was a contest \"between a patriot and a protester.\" It's a tactic she used against Sinema during the primary, trying to out-tough her the whole time. She even ran an ad showing Sinema protesting in a pink tutu. McSally is going so negative because negativity is what moves the numbers. With so much at stake this fall in races around the country, you can bet it's about to get a lot nastier. 5. Democratic women keep piling up the wins. Regardless of who wins the Arizona Senate race, the state will send its first woman to the Senate in history. It's a storyline we've been watching all primary season. A record number of women have run for office, and a record number of Democratic women have won nominations for governors' and House seats. Last week, the number of female nominees overall for the U.S. House hit 200 for the first time ever \u2014 155 of those, though, were Democratic women. And Tuesday night, Democratic women piled up even more \u2014 19 Democratic women won their party's nomination for the U.S. House. That is a majority \u2014 53 percent \u2014 of all the House seats with primaries Tuesday night. And Florida, in particular, will have a wide slate of Democratic women candidates on the ballot this fall, with 16 of 27 congressional races featuring a woman as the Democratic nominee. The story is not the same on the Republican side. In just four of 36 races Tuesday night, a female Republican candidate emerged as the preferred choice of GOP primary voters. In Florida, it's just two of 27. That is quite the contrast with Democrats. As the primary season starts to wrap up, take a look at the overall numbers of women who have been nominated by party. According to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics: Factoring in Tuesday night's results, overall, 174 Democratic women will be their party's nominee this fall (so far), a record. That far surpasses the prior record of 120 in 2016. On the Republican side, however, just 49 women will be their party's standard-bearer out of 435 seats.",

            "article_content": "President Trump stands beside Republican Troy Balderson, running in Ohio's 12th Congressional District, during a rally Saturday in Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump stands beside Republican Troy Balderson, running in Ohio's 12th Congressional District, during a rally Saturday in Ohio. After spending millions of dollars in a special election in Ohio, Republicans pushed the boulder up the hill just enough to eke out a very small lead, and  possibly hold on, in what unexpectedly became a competitive race. \"While we won tonight, this remains a very tough political environment, and moving forward, we cannot expect to win tough races when our candidate is being outraised,\" warned Corry Bliss, the executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC trying to help Republicans hold the House. \"Any Republican running for Congress getting vastly outraised by an opponent needs to start raising more money.\" Why the alarm bells \u2013 even after Republican Troy Balderson declared victory over Democrat Danny O'Connor in the 12th Congressional District special election? In part, it's because this district is not indicative of the kinds of places that will determine control of the House in November. It's far more conservative. To quantify that point, consider that Democrats need to gain 23 seats to take back the House, and that there are 69 seats held by Republicans that either Trump won in 2016 by less than he won Ohio 12, or that Hillary Clinton won. The Cook Political Report, based on its own partisan ranking formula, finds that there are 72 GOP-held seats with partisan makeups that are equal to or more liberal than this district. In other words, this should have been an easy win for Republicans. \"It's really kind of shocking, because this should be just a slam dunk, and it's not,\" Ohio Gov. John Kasich told ABC's This Week on Sunday. Balderson leads Democrat Danny O'Connor by 1,754 votes. That's a lead of 0.9 percentage points. There are, however, some 8,500 provisional and absentee ballots still to be counted. If the gap were to shrink to within 0.5 percentage points, that would trigger an automatic recount. O'Connor would need about 55 percent of the outstanding provisional and absentee ballots to get within that margin. He would need a little over 60 percent to take the lead. The state has 10 days before those remaining ballots can be counted, according to the Ohio secretary of state's office. Because of those remaining ballots, The Associated Press has not called the race yet. President Trump, on the other hand, declared a \"great victory.\" Trump, who campaigned for Balderson on Saturday, gave himself credit for the win. When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov. Balderson also declared victory. (O'Connor said his campaign will request a recount.) The outcome may not quite be clear from Tuesday night, but there are at least four lessons: 1. Trump puts Republicans in swing districts in a vise Trump's support raises a question that was left somewhat more difficult to answer after last night's result \u2013 whether Republican candidates in competitive districts should abandon or embrace Trump. Balderson took the latter approach. He appeared onstage with the president Saturday, where Trump heaped praise on him. Balderson has hugged Trump on immigration, saying on his website he will \"protect Ohio's working class from illegal immigration\" and \"will fight alongside President Trump to deport those here illegally.\" Jesse Hunt, national press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, tried to walk that line on NPR's Morning Edition on Wednesday. \"The president has an ability to motivate base voters,\" Hunt said, but added that he believes voters care most about local issues. The fact is: Republicans are in a vise when it comes to Trump. His approval rating is historically low, but his support with the GOP base remains strong. Without that base's support, it becomes nearly impossible for Republicans to win, especially in midterm elections when activists vote most. But to hold control of Congress, Republicans will also need independents and suburbanites turned off by the president in key districts. Take this Ohio district, for example. Trump's approval rating was underwater, and some 40 percent strongly disapprove of the job Trump is doing. But a third of voters strongly approved of the job Trump is doing. That's not an insignificant number, and Balderson needed them to put him over the top. 2. The Trump Effect could mean high turnout in November Are we now perpetually in base-election mode? In other words, how much do \"swing\" voters matter. Trump is polarizing. And Republican and Democratic strategists acknowledge that Trump is driving turnout on both sides. And consider the Ohio special election, for example. Turnout was 37 percent. That's very high for a special election in a midterm year. There has been lots of energy, higher than in past years, and the Trump Effect could portend higher-than-usual turnout this fall. 3. Republicans believe attacks on Nancy Pelosi still work Hunt rightly noted on Morning Edition that special elections are not replicas of general elections. Outsize attention can be paid to them \u2013 and that can mean lots of outside money against underfunded candidates. That won't likely be the case in general elections against better-known incumbents with bigger war chests. Still, for all the points Republicans will make about how local issues \u2014 or as Hunt put it, \"unique factors\" \u2014 matter most, a lesson they are drawing from this race is that attacks on Nancy Pelosi still work. In the final weeks of the campaign, the Congressional Leadership Fund went back to that strategy, running this ad, blasting O'Connor on immigration and trying to tie him to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Pelosi and \"The Resistance.\" That was a shift from the beginning of the race when Republicans were talking more about the tax cut plan. But an ad focusing on it was cycled off the air three weeks before Election Day, the Washington Post reported. \"Every vote for a Democrat is a vote to put Nancy Pelosi back in power,\" Hunt said of the Democratic minority leader who would like be speaker again if Democrats win the House. That's one strategy, he believes, that can win over persuadable voters \u2013 not just fire up the base. Whether that strategy works is still an open question. 4. Social Security and Medicare are still the third rails of politics There was one clear lesson Republicans in competitive to potentially competitive races likely learned from the Ohio special election, however \u2014 don't let anyone think you're going to cut Social Security and Medicare. Attacks on Balderson that he would cut the entitlement programs resonated enough that he felt compelled to put up an ad vowing not to cut them alongside his elderly mother, who had an oxygen tube connected. \"I would never do anything to cut Social Security and Medicare,\" Balderson says in the ad. \"My own mom and dad depend on both.\"",

Shamila N. Chaudhary (@ShamilaCh) is senior adviser to the dean at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, a fellow at the school's Foreign Policy Institute and senior fellow at New America. She served as director for Pakistan and Afghanistan on the National Security Council during the Obama administration. The Pakistani people have spoken. In Wednesday's parliamentary elections, they voted in Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), a political party led by former cricket star turned politician Imran Khan, to form the next government. PTI will most likely install Khan as the prime minister. But have the Pakistani people told us what they want? We can't be sure, and here's why: The campaign environment leading up to the elections was heavily manipulated by pro-PTI forces, namely members of the military, judiciary and the political elite \u2014 a collection of powerful individuals and institutions commonly referred to in Pakistan as \"the establishment.\" The civilians who join forces with the military to achieve its dominance \u2014 including a politicized judiciary that historically has been used as a tool to justify the military's extra-constitutional measures \u2014 often reap benefits typically reserved for those in uniform. Many Pakistanis believe that the establishment is behind the pressure tactics directed against the electorate during this campaign season. In this election season, assassination of candidates, intimidation of the media and the imprisonment of Khan's primary rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, no doubt silenced critical aspects of the electoral process. Did the media report freely? Were people scared off from voting because of violence and fears of retribution? Did the judiciary's pursuit of corruption charges against Sharif distract from his party's successes in running the government for the past five years? In a place like Pakistan, where a layer of political manipulation by the establishment has clouded every election since the country's birth in 1947, we will never fully know the answers to these questions. Pakistani soldiers patrol a street with a billboard featuring an image of Imran Khan in Rawalpindi.\n                \n                    \n                    Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Pakistani soldiers patrol a street with a billboard featuring an image of Imran Khan in Rawalpindi. But we're not meant to. The difficulty of ascertaining what the people want is part of the establishment's plan. It does not want a government led by Imran Khan per se. Rather, it wants a government that is weak and where civilians cannot strengthen themselves against a powerful military, which wants to maintain its influence over national security issues such as relations with India and nuclear proliferation, issues over which civilians in a democracy should have primacy. So while Imran Khan got the votes in this election, it is Pakistan's military that has won \u2014 again. The military has been cautious about overtly involving itself in politics in the past decade \u2014 a result of the unpopular legacy of former military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the military's negative exposure in Wikileaks documents and the difficult fight against anti-state militants. But that inclination has steadily receded over the past few years. The Pakistani military is no longer lurking in the shadows. It is walking down Constitution Avenue in Islamabad in broad daylight. Khan, who can reach millions of Pakistanis in a way that no other politician can, is its newest foil. His popularity as a sportsman is unparalleled and his brash, populist rhetoric appeals to young, working-class voters. What better candidate to break the dominance of the dynastic former ruling party, Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, in Parliament? But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate. With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup. The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite. Critics of Khan will say that a soft coup has already happened and with him in place, the military already runs the show. But we must consider what the Pakistani military would do if Khan's government fails to adhere to its expectations. And there will be many opportunities to fail, from determining the imprisoned Sharif's future and rapprochement with India to working with the United States to end the war in Afghanistan. All this talk of political manipulation distracts from the ambitious agenda Khan has for his vision of the \"new Pakistan,\" a place where the stark divide between the poor and privileged is addressed through a welfare state system. Amidst fraught relations with Pakistan's neighbors and the United States, Khan's government will also need to define its agenda and approach with the international community. The hardest part will be how Khan refashions himself as a unifying figure who can bring together the political parties who believe his victory is a sham. Those who came before Khan never fully realized their agendas on these and other policy matters because of lack of support from the military. \"We need a chance to succeed\" is a common refrain of Pakistani politicians on the subject of the country's antagonistic civil-military relations. Given his standing with the establishment, will Khan be different and get his chance? The challenges that lie ahead mean his lifeline as prime minister is potentially not very long. In many respects, Khan stands to butt heads with the very establishment that put him in power. The military will want to protect its interests in India and Afghanistan. The judiciary will not want to go soft on Sharif. Extremist groups close to the military may not like concessions Khan may have to make on social issues to build his coalition. To understand Khan's political fortunes and possible destiny, we should look no further than the path taken by Nawaz Sharif, who began his political career as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the military dictator Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq. When Sharif first was elected prime minister in 1990, many believed the intelligence services rigged his victory. His dramatic fall from grace \u2014 he has been ousted three times as prime minister and now sits in jail \u2014 should be a reminder for the PTI and the jubilant Pakistanis cheering Khan's victory that the military's involvement in politics leaves no one immune and nothing sacred.",

Now she's running for office with a record number of other Native Americans across the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Juan Labreche/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Deb Haaland worked on President Obama's 2008 campaign before chairing New Mexico's Democratic Party. Now she's running for office with a record number of other Native Americans across the country. On a recent afternoon in Albuquerque, N.M., Deb Haaland sits with a thick stack of paper in front of her, calling donors to thank them for their contributions and to ask them for more money. After winning her Democratic primary, Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, a Native American tribe, is running for the U.S. House in a strongly Democratic district in New Mexico. That means she may soon be the first Native American woman in Congress. \"Somebody has to be the first,\" she says as she walks through the southeast neighborhood where her office is. \"Native women, I mean we've been on the frontlines for a long, long time. Think of all the native women who have fought for treaty rights and fishing rights and all of those things.\" Haaland worked on President Obama's 2008 campaign before chairing the state's Democratic Party. But after thinking a woman would become president in 2016 and feeling let down, she says she decided to run for federal office. Because she says, she understands what it is to be working class in the United States. \"I identified with so much of what people go through in this district and in the state. Half of our population is Medicaid eligible,\" she says. \"I know what it's like to be on food stamps. My daughter and I both are paying off our student loans. So, I just felt like I know what it's like and we need more people who know what it's like to struggle.\" Haaland is a single mom, went to 13 different public schools in the district where she's on the ballot and says she understands Indian country. \"We have a president who doesn't understand what the trust responsibility is to tribes or our history at all.\" She says that's a major reason why she's running for Congress. \"You want to have influence over people who are making decisions for one of the most vulnerable communities in our country.\" She's one of a record number of Native American women running for office this year \u2014 a record number of women among a record number of Native American candidates. This year, Haaland says, is the year of women of color. \"This year, maybe we just all said separately, 'It's time for us to take the next step.' \" Then there's Peggy Flanagan, a state representative in Minnesota now running for lieutenant governor. Her top campaign issues include access to child care, education and inequities affecting \"children of color and Indigenous students.\" But also, she says, it's an opportunity to educate people about Native Americans and to stop legislation that's done to her community, rather than alongside it. \"Minneapolis is the birthplace of the American Indian movement and we have incredible history as well as infrastructure,\" she says. \"Oftentimes, it's just ignorance ... That we weren't given these rights. We always had them. Educating folks on issues of sovereignty.\" There's also Paulette Jordan, making a Democratic bid for governor in the conservative state of Idaho. She grew up on a reservation in a rural part of the state. \"We need leadership that will help defend the voices of the people and the needs of our community. There is no other option but to lead. That's why I'm running for governor,\" she says. \"Balance in the voices of representation in government is wholly unique and very critical.\" Even without big wins in the fall for these candidates, the sheer number matters says Mark Trahant. He's the editor of the news site Indian Country Today. He's been keeping track of Native American candidates for the last six years. \"There really is a record year this year. It's extraordinary,\" Trahant says. \"You see folks running for such a variety of offices.\" There are two Native American men in Congress now - both Republicans \u2014 and Trahant expects as many as ten Native Americans will be on the congressional ballot this fall. He says that's double the number in 2016. In Oklahoma, there is a race between two Native American candidates, one a Democrat and the other a Republican. As for statewide offices, there are more Native Americans running for lieutenant governor alone, six candidates, than the number who ran for statewide offices across the country in 2016. Trahant says some of this is a reaction to the current political climate, but it's also the fruit of years of work by Native American organizers, advocates and politicians. And the candidates, he says, especially the women, are dismantling stereotypes with campaigns that show the diversity of Indian country. Tatewin Means, a candidate who recently lost a primary for attorney general in South Dakota, had a groundbreaking political ad because it was in Lakota. Trahant says is the first time he's seen a political ad in a native language. Tatewin Means campaign ad in Lakota There's also Sharice Davids, an ex-MMA fighter and lesbian who's running for Congress in Kansas. She wears a t-shirt that reads, \"Strong, Indigenous, Resilient\" as she pounds a punching bag. In the ad, she says \"It's 2018, and women, Native Americans, gay people, the unemployed and the underemployed have to fight like hell just to survive.\" Sharice Davids campaign ad Trahant says this ad and others are changing things. \"What's important about these ads is they will change people's perceptions about Native Americans in general, not just the political campaigns, but how people perceive the native community,\" he says. It's also galvanizing Indigenous voters who he says are often sidelined by voting laws and distrustful of a government that has taken so much from them. That's clear when walking around with Deb Haaland in Albuquerque. Many different kinds of people, Native Americans and more, walk up to congratulate her on her primary win. At a recent minor league baseball game, Robert Piper greets her. \"As a native Hawaiian, I'm very proud of you,\" he tells Haaland, shaking her hand. Even though he can't vote in New Mexico, he says when one Native American rises \"it lifts all First Nations people.\" As Haaland leaves the field, an employee grabs her hand, holds it and says \"From one Native American sister to another, congratulations.\" Back at the office, one of Haaland's interns, Dechellie Gray, gets emotional as she explains why she's working on the campaign. \"I see my family in her family and I think that's something that's really important that I've never seen before.\" She's Navajo. Her voice trails off and she pauses to hold back tears. \"It's just very emotional for me because it means so much,\" she says. Gray says she's never seen anyone who she looks like run for federal office. New Mexico is about 10 percent Native American. \"I just think that it's really important that a government represents the people that live in their districts,\" Gray says. \"Deb always tells the story of her grandparents being sent to boarding school. And my great grandparents experienced The Long Walk. She knows what that's like. And I don't think that a lot of politicians see that and have first-hand experience of that.\" There's a lot of energy around this year's crop of candidates but getting voters out is another issue. Historically, Indigenous voters have had some of the lowest turnout rates of any group in the country.",

In a stunning primary upset, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 a young socialist activist, woman of color and political newcomer \u2014 has unseated leading House Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in New York's deep-blue 14th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and a onetime staffer for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, ran on an unalloyed leftist progressive platform, calling for a \"political revolution\" that includes Medicare and higher education for all, gun control measures, an end to private prisons and the abolition of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The district Ocasio-Cortez hopes to represent is in the Bronx and Queens; roughly 50 percent of the people there are immigrants \u2014 and she says they've been yearning for a representative who speaks to them, and speaks for their needs. \"We're having an affordability crisis in New York City,\" Ocasio-Cortez told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition on Wednesday. \"We have a security crisis with our current immigration system, and I think I was able to allow our community to really feel seen and heard, and visited and advocated for.\" She wants to abolish ICE because the agency represents the militarization of immigration enforcement, Ocasio-Cortez said. It was part of a trend, she said, of viewing and treating immigrants as criminals. \"What we're basically saying is that the structure of ICE \u2014 in a similar manner as the structure of the Patriot Act \u2014 is kind of built on a scaffolding of questionable civil liberties infringement and abuse,\" she said. \"So what we're really talking about is reimagining immigration to be humane, and in a way that is transparent and accountable.\" Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, whom many saw as a possible successor to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should Democrats win a majority in November. As for whether she feels Pelosi should continue to lead Democrats in the House, Ocasio-Cortez said she's open to the idea of new leadership in Congress. She added: \"I think it'd be inappropriate to commit to any one individual before we've even won back the House in November. Let's make sure we do that, and then we can have that conversation.\" Crowley, a 10-term incumbent, had not even faced a primary challenger since 2004. In this race, he did not attend either of the two debates that had been scheduled between the two candidates. In a profile published this week in Vogue magazine, Ocasio-Cortez was described as \"a third-generation New Yorker whose family has roots in Puerto Rico [and who] looks a lot more like the constituents in the very diverse 14th District than Crowley, a 56-year-old white man.\" By contrast, Vogue said Crowley \"pays lip service to the post-Donald Trump resistance while maintaining largely centrist politics.\" Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi\u2019s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he\u2019s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President! Ocasio-Cortez's leftist outlook found her tilting at the Democratic Party establishment. Most notably, she is a card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which has its roots in the Socialist Party of America. That group's most famous leader was Eugene V. Debs, a union leader who was a perennial presidential candidate on the Socialist ticket from 1900-1920. \"What I see is that the Democratic Party takes working class communities for granted, they take people of color for granted and they just assume that we're going to turn out no matter how bland or half-stepping these proposals are,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a recent interview, according to The New York Times. \"This is not an end, this is the beginning,\" she told cheering supporters on Tuesday. \"You have given this country hope, you have given this country proof that when you knock on your neighbor's door, when you come to them with love, when you let them know that no matter your stance, you are there for them \u2014 that we can make change,\" she said. On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez joined a protest in Tornillo, Texas, at an ICE child detention center. She has also expressed solidarity for Puerto Rico, still recovering from Hurricane Maria. In a bizarre twist, Rep. Crowley sent a woman with slight resemblance to me as his official surrogate to last night\u2019s debate.@repjoecrowley\u2019s surrogate said he is in full support of Trump\u2019s embassy change in Israel last month (where 60 people died).The community was in shock. https://t.co/LvNj0rlhFw Late Tuesday, President Trump suggested in a tweet that Crowley's defeat \u2014 the largest primary upset since 2014, when then-Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor was defeated by economics professor Dave Brat in Virginia's 7th Congressional District \u2014 may have been because he is a \"Big Trump Hater\" who \"should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!\" But more likely, Ocasio-Cortez's win is an indication that Democrats are willing to tack to the left to counter Republicans who seem to be steering a course ever-farther to the right. Even so, it would be easy to read too much into her upset victory in a firmly progressive congressional district that is carved out of parts of the Bronx and Queens \u2014 and nearly half Hispanic. \"Women like me aren't supposed to run for office,\" Ocasio-Cortez says in a campaign video that went viral. \"I wasn't born to a wealthy family or powerful family \u2014 mother from Puerto Rico, dad from the South Bronx. I was born in a place where your ZIP code determines your destiny,\" she said. Despite Crowley outraising Ocasio-Cortez by 10-to-1, her targeted campaign and aggressive ground-game were key. So, too, was her opponent's decision not to show up to debate her. \"This is the second primary debate in which Mr. Crowley was a no-show,\" according to a scathing New York Times editorial published last week. \"A spokeswoman for Mr. Crowley said he had scheduling conflicts that wouldn't allow him to attend the two debates, inevitably leaving voters to wonder \u2014 what are we, chopped liver?\" In November, Ocasio-Cortez will face Republican Anthony Pappas, a St. John's University professor who teaches economics and finance. He ran unopposed in his party's primary.",

Joseph Crowley on Tuesday night. Updated at 12:35 a.m. ET National progressives scored a major coup over the Democratic establishment Tuesday night as 28-year-old activist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset House Democratic Caucus chairman and longtime New York Rep. Joe Crowley. It was a breakthrough for the left wing of the Democratic Party, in a primary season where they haven't been able to cause too many headaches for the establishment. Crowley's defeat capped a string of progressive victories over the Democratic establishment on Tuesday, including in the Maryland governor's race, where Ben Jealous won the nomination with the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Crowley's primary loss also shakes up the Democratic leadership hierarchy in Congress. He was long considered a possible contender to lead House Democrats or even become speaker if California Rep. Nancy Pelosi either steps aside or is pushed out after the midterms. Instead, he has now fallen, on his home turf, in a monumental loss reminiscent of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's GOP primary loss in Virginia back in 2014. In GOP primaries, President Trump was able to lift two candidates to victory on Tuesday, with one of his earliest allies, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, winning his GOP primary runoff and New York Rep. Dan Donovan also beating back a challenge from former Rep. Michael Grimm. The president has been burned by making endorsements in the past that didn't pan out (twice in Alabama's special Senate election last year), but he put two more wins in the bank after stumping Monday night for McMaster and tweeting his support for Donovan last month. Here's what happened in the New York, Maryland, Utah, Colorado and Oklahoma primaries, along with runoffs in South Carolina and Mississippi. Progressives topple a House Democratic leader Tuesday was a good night for progressives across the country, in several House and gubernatorial races. Ocasio-Cortez's unexpected victory over Crowley is the biggest upset yet by a progressive upstart challenger over the Democratic establishment. She handily defeated the incumbent, leading Crowley by 15 points in unofficial results. A former organizer for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, Ocasio-Cortez ran a vigorous race over Crowley in the increasingly diverse Bronx and Queens district, and she used her Puerto Rican heritage to identify with the district's rapidly growing Latino population. A Democratic socialist who previously worked for the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, she backs abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and supports Medicare for all and free public college. Ocasio-Cortez's victory comes in a year when Democratic women have been prevailing in many primary contests. Still, Crowley had been seen as untouchable \u2014 he was also chair of the Queens County Democratic Party and a major force in New York politics for decades, aside from his rising stature in the House Democratic leadership. But Ocasio-Cortez argued that was part of the problem, making the case that Crowley had grown too distant from his district, while highlighting her own working class roots. \"It's time we acknowledge that not all Democrats are the same. That a Democrat who takes corporate money, profits off foreclosure, doesn't live here, doesn't send his kids to our schools, doesn't drink our water or breathe our air cannot possibly represent us,\" she swiped at Crowley in one ad. It's time for a New York that works for all of us.On June 26th, we can make it happen - but only if we have the #CourageToChange.It's time to get to work. Please retweet this video and sign up to knock doors + more at https://t.co/kacKFI9RtI to bring our movement to Congress. pic.twitter.com/aqKMjovEjZ Trump reacted with glee to Crowley's toppling, though his claim that the incumbent's loss would have been mitigated had he been nicer to the president is belied by the fact that it's a district where Trump got less than 20 percent of the vote \u2014 plus Crowley was defeated by a challenger who ran to his left. Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi\u2019s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he\u2019s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President! Three other New York City Democratic members \u2014 Reps. Carolyn Maloney, Yvette Clarke and Eliot Engel \u2014 also faced primary challenges of note. All three ended up winning, though Clarke only prevailed by about four points. Progressives also prevailed in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Maryland, which also highlighted the differing approaches battling for supremacy in that party. Jealous, a former NAACP president who was endorsed not only by Sanders but by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and other progressive figures, defeated Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker, who had wrapped up the support of much of the state's political establishment, such as Sen. Chris Van Hollen and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer. Both candidates are African-American, and now Jealous has a chance to become the first black governor in Maryland history if he wins \u2014 and only the third elected across all 50 states. But Jealous will have a difficult race against incumbent GOP Gov. Larry Hogan. Even though Maryland is traditionally a blue state, the centrist Hogan remains extremely popular \u2014 even among Democrats \u2014 and has been a frequent critic of Trump. Several competitive New York House seats are also a key part of Democrats' calculus to winning back the House, and in one important contest the more liberal candidate beat the establishment choice. In the 24th District, college professor Dana Balter, who was running as the more progressive pick with the backing of MoveOn.org and all four county committees, prevailed over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's favored candidate, Juanita Perez Williams. Local officials had complained about DCCC meddling in the race, and now it's Balter who will challenge GOP Rep. John Katko this fall. In New York's 1st Congressional District, former commercial real estate lending executive Perry Gershon, who spent nearly $1 million of his own money in the contest, bested three other women candidates to claim the Democratic nomination, bucking national trends that have seen female hopefuls advance in other races. He'll face GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin in a Long Island district Trump carried by about 12 points. And in the 19th District, attorney Antonio Delgado won the Democratic nomination and will challenge Republican Rep. John Faso. Democrats hope to make this seat competitive as well; Trump won it by about seven points, but former President Obama carried it twice. In Colorado, Democrats have been angling for a long time to take out Republican Rep. Mike Coffman in his suburban Denver district , which Hillary Clinton carried by 9 points. The DCCC got their preferred pick there, with attorney Jason Crow easily beating energy consultant Levi Tillemann, who had been pressured by Hoyer, the House Democratic whip, to abandon his bid. Trump endorsements boost incumbents South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster was able to fend off Iraq War veteran John Warren in a runoff, after falling short of a majority in the five-way Republican primary two weeks ago. Warren had tried to argue he was the most Trump-like candidate as an outsider businessman, but it was McMaster who had Trump's vocal blessing, as he seeks a full term as governor after assuming the job after Nikki Haley became U.N. Ambassador. Both McMaster and Trump will surely point to the president's election eve rally for McMaster as instrumental to clenching victory. McMaster has been one of Trump's most loyal allies. When he was lieutenant governor, McMaster became the first statewide-elected official in the country to endorse Trump back in January 2016. On Monday, the president acknowledged his own record was on the line if McMaster didn't won. \"They will say, 'Donald Trump suffered a major, major defeat in the great state of South Carolina. It was a humiliating defeat for Donald Trump.' So please get your asses out tomorrow and vote,\" Trump told a West Columbia crowd Monday night in a stemwinder of a speech that mentioned the incumbent governor only briefly, though he joined Trump onstage at the beginning. The president's other major endorsement that was tested Tuesday was in New York. Trump didn't campaign for Rep. Dan Donovan, but allies for the congressman said the president's tweet last month endorsing the incumbent over former Rep. Michael Grimm in the Staten Island-based 11th Congressional District helped majorly boost his chances in their bitter primary. Grimm tried to campaign as the more pro-Trump candidate, but in the end he didn't even come close to knocking off Donovan. The former congressman held the seat before he was forced to resign as he pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges and spent seven months in prison. In his tweet endorsing Donovan, Trump cited last year's Alabama Senate loss as a warning that Grimm would be unelectable in a general election. Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can\u2019t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat! That's exactly what national Republicans had feared, but they're breathing easier now. Still, Democrats are enthused by their nominee, Army veteran Max Rose. Republican divides on display Contests for open seats in safe Republican regions of South Carolina and Oklahoma will impact the direction of the House GOP conference. In South Carolina's 4th District runoff, state Sen. William Timmons, who had more establishment support, defeated bombastic former state Sen. Lee Bright, who had the backing of the Club for Growth as well as Iowa Rep. Steve King. In this conservative district, Timmons will be the heavy favorite to succeed retiring GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy. In Oklahoma's open 1st District, where Jim Bridenstine stepped down after he was confirmed as NASA administrator, former Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris will advance to an Aug. 28 runoff. Businessman Kevin Hern, who is backed by the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, is still battling for the second runoff spot with Iraq War veteran Andy Coleman, who was endorsed by the conservative House Freedom Caucus and Club For Growth. In Colorado, Rep. Doug Lamborn defeated several primary challengers after nearly failing to make the ballot. Initially he had been thrown off after district voters filed a lawsuit arguing his petition signatures were invalid because the people he hired to gather them were not Colorado residents, as required by state law. But he was put back on the ballot by a federal judge. Romney's next step toward the Senate Former 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney easily won the GOP nomination for Senate over state Rep. Mike Kennedy in the race to succeed retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch. The former Massachusetts governor had been a vocal Trump critic, even excoriating him as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" during the 2016 campaign. And while Romney is definitely not a glowing fan of the president, he has muted his criticism somewhat and Trump has even endorsed him, reaffirming his support Tuesday night. \"I look forward to working together,\" the president wrote. Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C. While not backing Trump enough has been costly in other GOP races, nearly one-fourth of voters in the conservative state of Utah voted for a third-party candidate in 2016 instead of Trump, who took only 45 percent of the vote. Romney remains very popular in this heavily Mormon state, where he helped save the 2002 Winter Olympics. A potential historic first in Colorado Democratic Rep. Jared Polis won his party's nomination to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in Colorado, which could make history. If Polis wins in November, he would be the first openly gay man ever elected governor in the country. EMILY's List backed former state Treasurer Cary Kennedy. While Democratic women have sailed in House races this year, they've had more trouble in gubernatorial contests. On the GOP side, state Treasurer Walker Stapleton won the nomination, after being attacked by his chief rival, former state Rep. Victor Mitchell, because he is a Bush family cousin, saying that means Stapleton hasn't been loyal enough to Trump. Stapleton wasn't the only political scion in the race \u2014 investment banker Doug Robinson is a nephew of Romney's.",

Here's another sign that Blankenship is suddenly being taken seriously as a candidate: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged President Trump to take steps to stop Blankenship's surge. Trump got the message, taking to Twitter to tell West Virginia Republicans not to support Blankenship. Trump tweeted early Monday morning, \"To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can't win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!\" To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can\u2019t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! The reference to Alabama is about the December special election for which Trump unsuccessfully backed Republican Judge Roy Moore for Senate, despite multiple allegations of child molestation and assault going back decades. Moore won the primary but lost the special election to Democrat Doug Jones in a race the GOP never imagined it could lose when the seat opened up. West Virginia is the definition of Trump Country. He carried this state by more than 40 points in 2016, running against \"Obama's War on Coal.\" It's a reference to environmental regulations pushed by the Obama administration. Blankenship has learned from the 2016 Trump playbook, running a campaign that is in your face, unapologetic, outside the norms and extremely politically incorrect. Not unlike the Trump campaign, it has brought accusations of racism, specifically because of the way Blankenship has referred to McConnell's wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who was born in Taiwan to Chinese parents. Chao has lived in the U.S. since she was 8 years old. In a TV spot that's ostensibly about \"draining the swamp\" in Washington, Blankenship looks at the camera and says, \"Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people.\" He adds that in the process the GOP Senate leader has gotten rich: \"In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.\" When asked by a reporter if the ad is racially insensitive, Blankenship compounded the problem by making a reference to the \"Negro\" race. Blankenship reacted to Trump's Twitter criticism by issuing a written statement of response. \"West Virginia will send the swamp a message \u2014 no one, and I mean no one, will tell us how to vote.\" He was punching back hard the same way Trump does when he has been attacked or feels maligned. Then came this from Blankenship's statement: \"As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.\" Blankenship said Trump was misinformed. \"The President is a very busy man and he doesn't know me and he doesn't know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary. The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the President's agenda.\" Of course, Blankenship's style and approach as a candidate are only a small part of his biography. On his website, the section labeled \"ABOUT ME\" portrays this 68-year-old coal industry millionaire as just like those whose vote he is seeking. \"My life, like most of yours, has had its up and downs,\" he writes in the very first line. He describes growing up poor in West Virginia. Playing baseball as a child, and his childhood job \"pumping gasoline into coal miners' cars at our family gas station.\" There's great detail describing his school years, and running for student body president, and college at Marshall University. He recalls a plane crash in 1970 in which the Marshall football team was killed. \"This was my first experience with horrific tragedy.\" He writes about going to work for Massey Coal Co. starting in 1982 and after many promotions rising to chairman a decade later. His bio lists his 2010 retirement, but there are no details about the events of that year that cost him his job and resulted in prison time. Not mentioned in this official bio is the explosion that killed 29 at Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch mine. Blankenship was indicted for cutting corners on safety regulations, resulting in excessive amounts of coal dust and methane gas in the mine. A jury found him guilty of one of three charges, saying that the CEO conspired to willfully violate safety standards. It was a misdemeanor and he was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of $250,000. He was acquitted of separate charges of securities fraud and making false statements. (Full NPR coverage of the mine disaster and aftermath can be found here.) During his Senate campaign, Blankenship talks about coal mining all the time, but his preferred focus is on the Obama administration as having waged a war on coal. He portays himself as fighting on the right side in that war. And despite the deaths of miners, and the years of safety violations at mines where he was a top executive, that puts him on the side of West Virginia coal miners. He hopes that will lead to victory in the GOP primary, even if Trump, McConnell and Republicans nationally think a Blankenship victory Tuesday would make their goal of unseating vulnerable Democrat Manchin all but impossible.",

            "article_content": "\"I put over 50,000 miles on my Jeep this race alone,\" said Richard Ojeda, a Democrat running for Congress in West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I put over 50,000 miles on my Jeep this race alone,\" said Richard Ojeda, a Democrat running for Congress in West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District. Richard Ojeda joined the Army because he says it seemed like the most reasonable choice he had growing up; his alternative options, he says, were to \"dig coal\" or \"sell dope.\" So he chose the Army, where he spent more than two decades. But when he came home to Logan County, W.Va., he was stunned. \"I come home from spending 24 years in the United States Army and I realize I got kids in my backyard that have it worse than the kids I saw in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" he shouts into the microphone during an interview. And so in his 40s, he jumped into politics. Ojeda ran for the state legislature and won. Now he's running for a congressional seat in a district Donald Trump won by 49 percentage points in 2016, trying to prove a progressive Democrat still has a shot in West Virginia \u2014 the most Trump-friendly state in 2016. Trump carried the state with 69 percent of the vote and polling suggests he remains popular. Ojeda may be a far-fetched savior for the Democratic Party, but this tattooed rabble-rouser is convinced he can turn the tide. \"We're going to have a blue wave in West Virginia that's going to make Virginia look like a ripple in the water,\" Ojeda said, referring to the big Virginia Democratic wins in 2017. Ojeda's confidence might make a political analyst chuckle, particularly because Trump captured 80 percent of the vote in his home county of Logan, W.Va. But Ojeda says people don't understand his neighbors. They're not Republicans, he insists, they're working-class folks looking for a break. Frustrated with Trump and Democrats \"Guess what?\" he asks rhetorically, \"I supported Trump. I did!\" Ojeda says Trump was talking about putting coal miners back to work and he had never heard a politician with such power pay attention to their concerns. Southern West Virginia is considered coal country. Although many of the mines employ a fraction of the people they once did, the industry still has an outsized impact on the economy and the lore of the region. Ojeda says the Trump presidency has turned out to be a disappointment and he would not vote for him again today. But even though he calls the current administration a \"train wreck,\" he insists he doesn't want the president to fail. \"He's the president of the United States, he's flying the aircraft that we are all on right now, and if you wish him to fail, you wish us all to crash,\" Ojeda said over morning coffee. This Democrat is a populist with swagger. And he's running an unconventional race \u2014 his campaign manager is a long-haul truck driver; his press secretary is a single mom in her 20s. For months, they both worked for free, because they believed in Ojeda's message. He's unscripted and unpolished, such as when he tries to explain why national Democrats have done so poorly in West Virginia. \"They've lost power because they sucked,\" Ojeda says bluntly. But he's also zealous and you can see elements of his military discipline. Ojeda campaigns for hours every day and says he's put over 50,000 miles on his red Jeep during this race. \"I always say, I put boots on the ground, and I really put boots on the ground,\" he says, pointing to his combat boots. He insists that military-style leadership ought to be more prevalent in politics, but also strikes an anti-establishment tone reminiscent of Bernie Sanders. \"What did our brothers and sisters die for?\" he asked a crowd of veterans at a campaign stop in Huntington, the largest city in this congressional district. \"They didn't die for this garbage \u2014 they did not die for people to come back here, run as leaders and do nothing but take from the people.\" Jessica Shrader, a Trump voter in the crowd, said she had never heard of Ojeda before this veterans meeting, but she appreciated his \"honesty.\" \"He's relatable,\" she said. \"JFK with tattoos\" or a modern Teddy Roosevelt? In fact, that is precisely what Ojeda strives for \u2014 he wants to be approachable. He gives his cellphone number out to the audience and tells people they can call him if they have questions. He does live videos on Facebook every couple of days. Ojeda is a populist with a penchant for the working class. But a friend of his also insisted that he's gotten more \"progressive\" with time. As a freshman state senator, he led an effort to legalize medical marijuana, and this past January he gave passionate speeches in the state capitol demanding teacher raises. \"I'm telling you, we're sitting on a powder keg,\" he told his fellow legislators at the time. \"If you don't think the teachers across our state are saying the 's' word, you're wrong.\" The 's' word he was referring to was \"strike.\" In February, teachers did strike, and they rallied around Ojeda as their champion. These days, he's pushing for mandatory limits on the number of hours a nurse works. Ojeda's political ideology is difficult to pin down. He has a tendency to throw verbal bombs, and so some describe him as a \"Tea Party liberal.\" One of his staffers likes to describe him as \"JFK with tattoos.\" But Chuck Keeney, a history professor at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in Logan County, says Ojeda reminds him more of a previous Republican president. \"I compare him to almost a Theodore Roosevelt kind of personality,\" said Keeney. \"Teddy Roosevelt was this exuberant guy, he boxed, full of testosterone, and I see a lot of Ojeda in that.\" Richard Ojeda tells a group of veterans in Huntington, W. Va., that he's trying to bring military leadership into politics.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR \n                    \n                \nhide caption Richard Ojeda tells a group of veterans in Huntington, W. Va., that he's trying to bring military leadership into politics. Plus, he points out that Roosevelt was not afraid to buck his own party \u2014 that too reminds him of Ojeda. Keeney says West Virginians may be socially conservative, but he's noticed that voters often favor a charismatic individual over party ID. So he says it's possible Ojeda could win, given the momentum from the teacher's strike. But can this Democrat really win here? \"I think he's unscripted a great deal, but in politics, that can often be a danger,\" said Bill Bissett, the president and CEO of the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce. \"He reminds me of the kind of candidate who can throw a lot of interceptions at the wrong time.\" Bissett's chamber endorsed one Democrat and one Republican in the race, but not Ojeda. He's skeptical of Ojeda's campaign. \"He may have a lot of people going to Facebook and watching his videos, [but] that may not translate into votes either in a Democratic primary or a general election,\" said Bissett. Ojeda first has to make it through a contested primary on May 8. If he wins, he'll face a Republican who's likely more established and far better financed. The Republican candidates include a longtime state delegate and the former state GOP chairman. In the last election for West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, the Republican candidate won with nearly 70 percent of the vote; but until 2014 the district was represented by a Democrat. So Ojeda supporters aren't listening to the naysayers. For Jim Wall, a Vietnam War veteran in Lincoln County, Ojeda is one of the most honest politicians he's seen in years. \"He's just a really nice guy, in my opinion,\" said Wall. \"And nice guys hardly ever win, but I'm hoping he will.\"",

He is now aligning himself with Communists ahead of Iraq's May election.\n                \n                    \n                    Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr addresses his supporters during a demonstration in Baghdad in 2017. He is now aligning himself with Communists ahead of Iraq's May election. In 2003, as U.S. forces entered Baghdad, Muqtada al-Sadr was a young Shiite Muslim cleric, little known to the American troops who toppled Saddam Hussein and ushered in a tumultuous new Iraq. As liberation turned into occupation, Sadr, the son of a revered grand ayatollah killed for opposing Saddam, compiled a militia that presented such a serious challenge to American forces, the U.S. vowed to kill or capture him. A couple of years later, his Mahdi Army was embroiled in Iraq's bitter sectarian war. That was the old Muqtada al-Sadr \u2014 responding to the needs of the times, his loyalists say. Fifteen years later, Sadr, now 44, has taken another dramatic turn \u2014 reaching out to powerful Sunni Muslim countries, distancing himself from Iran and effectively burning down his own political movement. Now, preparing for elections in May, the Shiite cleric venerated by millions of religious followers is forming a brand-new alliance with Communists and secularists. \"We have to face it,\" says Dhia al-Asadi, head of the Ahrar bloc, the Sadr movement's political wing. \"What destroyed our country ... is groups or parties allied along sectarian or ethnic lines.\" Sadr, while holding no official position in government or politics, remains one of the most powerful figures in Iraq, able to bring hundreds of thousands of followers into the streets through his family's religious legacy. His political evolution could have far-reaching consequences for the next Iraqi government, the country's fractured Shiite political class and Iraq's relationship with neighboring Iran. In Iraq, the new alliance asks Sadr's followers to take a major leap of faith in abandoning religion as a basis for voting. Since the country's first postwar parliamentary elections in 2005, Iraqis have mostly voted along sectarian and ethnic lines. And Sadr owes his huge following largely to his family's religious legacy. \"Sayid Muqtada al-Sadr believes it is not the role of any politician to spread Islam or religious teachings,\" says Asadi, an urbane, Iraq- and U.K.-educated academic. \"This is maybe seen by some as a departure from the religious ideas\" of the cleric's father and father-in-law, he says. Asadi terms it a gradual transformation. In Sadr City, on the outskirts of Baghdad, trash-strewn streets and open sewers testify to government neglect, despite the election of more than 30 Sadr movement members to parliament and several cabinet posts. Before 2003, the sprawling, working-class neighborhood of Sadr followers was known as Saddam City. Protests \u2014 quickly crushed by Saddam's government \u2014 erupted here when Sadr's father was killed in 1999. As in the rest of Iraq, disillusionment with Iraqi politics runs deep. Portraits of Muqtada al-Sadr, his father and father-in-law are painted on a wall in Sadr City, a district of Baghdad. An estimated 4 million people live in Sadr City, known as Saddam City before Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003.\n                \n                    \n                    Jane Arraf/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Portraits of Muqtada al-Sadr, his father and father-in-law are painted on a wall in Sadr City, a district of Baghdad. An estimated 4 million people live in Sadr City, known as Saddam City before Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. \"I'd rather vote for a Sunni,\" says Sabrin Hashem, a young housewife shopping on a street with posters of Sadr's father and father-in-law. \"It's been how long? Fifteen years? We haven't seen anything from a Shiite government,\" says Hashem, dressed in the enveloping black cloak that most women here wear outside the home. The Sadr name commands a following based on both religion and pragmatism. The cleric's late father, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Sadiq al-Sadr, is credited with reviving messianic sentiment among Iraqi Shiites. Followers believe the Prophet Muhammad's 12th successor disappeared in the Iraqi city of Samarra more than 1,000 years ago and will return to herald judgment day. The younger Sadr also inherited a legacy of social activism and services for the Shiite poor and dispossessed \u2014 a legacy jeopardized in recent years by corrupt members of his own political faction. In response to the corruption, Sadr ordered a sweeping purge and banned all his current members of parliament from running in May's election. He said he wanted to inject \"new blood\" into the process. \"People are saying this is not going to work,\" Asadi says of the alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, made up traditionally of atheists. But Asadi doesn't agree: \"I think this is going to succeed because they share the same principles, to a certain extent. They come from the same social classes, they fight for the same values and they share the same history of oppression and suppression by different regimes.\" The alliance puts Sadr further at odds with Iraq's powerful neighbor. Ali Akbar Velayati, the former Iranian foreign minister who is a top aide to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently visited Baghdad, warning Iraqi officials it would be unacceptable for Communists to be in government. Iraqi supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr shout slogans and wave national flags as they demonstrate in Baghdad against corruption in the Iraqi government on March 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Iraqi supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr shout slogans and wave national flags as they demonstrate in Baghdad against corruption in the Iraqi government on March 2. In contrast with the Iranian-backed militias that were assembled to fight ISIS when the Iraqi army collapsed four years ago, Sadr increasingly portrays himself as an Iraqi nationalist. He has reached out to Saudi Arabia \u2014 which is gradually warming up to Iraq after a decade of hostility to the country's Shiite-led government \u2014 to try to lessen Iraq's isolation in the Arab Gulf countries. \"That's why Sayid Muqtada al-Sadr visited Saudi Arabia [last summer] \u2014 to tell them that the Shiite of Iraq are not going to be an extension of the Iranian revolution,\" says Asadi. \"His visit was to ask them to be more present in Iraq,\" he adds, referring to a greater diplomatic and economic investment in the country. Iran is not happy with the cleric, Asadi acknowledges, but he says Sadr's role in opposing U.S. intervention in the region \u2014 the same stance as Iran \u2014 prevents Tehran from opposing him outright. Sadr has taken the same stance against Turkey and Russia, Asadi says \u2014 warning them not to intervene in Iraq. Implicitly, in demanding that all foreign forces leave, he has also called for the removal of Iranian fighters. His opposition to Iranian influence puts Sadr in rare agreement with the United States. \"He's become an Iraqi nationalist as opposed to an Iraqi Shiite Islamist,\" says Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador who served in Iraq as deputy chief of mission. \"I don't think it's American policy to try to dominate Iraq. We simply would like it to be sovereign and independent rather than a vassal state of Iran next door so if Sadr can promote that, it's in line with American policy objectives.\" In 2004, with U.S. occupation authorities in charge of Iraq, Sadr formed a militia to fight American forces, stepping into the security breach created when the U.S. disbanded the Iraqi army. Sadr named it the Mahdi Army, evoking the 12th imam, whose promised reemergence would herald salvation. He sent militia members to Fallujah to fight alongside Sunni fighters battling U.S. forces there. The U.S. military, acting on an Iraqi arrest warrant, vowed to capture or kill him. In the sectarian war that followed, Mahdi Army leaders were accused of running death squads in Sunni areas. Sadr officials point out the cleric was in Iran for much of that time, and now say those fighters were not under his control. Sadr eventually agreed to a cease-fire in his battle against U.S. forces and U.S.-backed Iraqi troops. He returned from Iran after American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 and replaced his militia with a social services organization. He reactivated the fighters in 2014 \u2014 creating the \"Peace Brigades\" to protect Samarra against ISIS. The same paramilitary force shot and killed a top security aide to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in March, when he failed to stop at one of their checkpoints. \"Even today, it's not clear that Muqtada al-Sadr has day-to-day tactical control over his militias,\" says Ford, now at Yale University and with the Middle East Institute. \"I think the Iraqi government has a real problem with different militias, both Shiite and Kurdish and Sunni. How the Iraqi government tries step by step to assert more control over these troops will be a major factor in the development of Iraq over the next couple of years.\"",

Updated at 3:50 p.m. ET Democrat Conor Lamb appears to have won the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, defeating Republican Rick Saccone in an upset for President Trump and congressional Republicans, based on a review of the vote by member station WESA and barring a recount. That a Democrat is even close in this Western Pennsylvania congressional district can mean only one thing \u2014 bad news for Republicans in this midterm year. \"We should be able to elect a box of hammers in this district,\" veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told the Washington Post's Robert Costa. \"If we're losing here, you can bet there is a Democratic wave coming.\" Why the alarm bells? Consider: Not only is this a district President Trump won by about 20 points in November 2016, as plenty have pointed out, but there are 118 Republicans sitting in seats Trump won by less than the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. Democrats need to flip a net of 24 seats to take back control of the House. It's important to not overread the results of any special election, but the result \u2014 no matter which way it goes in the end \u2014 raises questions about the Trump coalition and how much it transfers to the Republican Party broadly; the GOP's messaging on everything from continuing to use House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a cudgel to the tax bill; and whether Republicans can hold off a Democratic wave given that this result was yet another example of Democrats' holding on to the enthusiasm advantage. Where the race goes from here Member station WESA has reviewed current vote counts from all of the individual counties in the district. That count shows Lamb with a lead of 627 votes. Between provisional ballots, absentee ballots and military/residents overseas ballots still outstanding, there are only 618 votes left to count based on the latest numbers. That gives Lamb an insurmountable lead. This is barring the potential for a protest recount, which would be based on evidence of voter fraud or errors in counting. Pennsylvania law does not provide for an automatic recount in congressional races. There is no timeline for certification of the race at this point, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office. A recount is an outside possibility at this point. One would be triggered if three people in each precinct come forward with evidence of voter fraud or counting errors. Loosely, they have until the middle of next week to do that. Warning signs for GOP that the Trump coalition may not be transferable White, working-class voters were key to Trump's presidential victory \u2014 and there are plenty of them in this district. Trump won whites with some or no college education by 39 points, a wider margin than any candidate since at least 1980. There are no exit polls to know for sure how this group voted Tuesday, but Lamb made clear appeals to them \u2014 and it would be impossible to make up a 20-point gap without at least some crossover. In fact, dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 election. Lamb also benefited from Saccone's history of supporting \"right to work\" legislation in the state Legislature. The district has a sizable number of union households that might have been willing to support a different Republican candidate, but unions and the Lamb campaign were able to define Saccone as anti-union. Also, turnout was pretty high, especially for a special election in March. It was so high, in fact, more people voted than in the gubernatorial general election during the last midterm in 2014.

Saccone narrowly trails Democrat Conor Lamb and has not yet conceded. What's more, the approximately 228,000 people who went to the polls were 78 percent of the approximately 294,000 cast for Republican Rep. Tim Murphy. Murphy ran unopposed in 2016 but resigned last October amid a sex scandal, which set this special election in motion. Republicans spent some $10 million to try to hold this district (that won't even exist in nine months because of the maps' being redrawn by the state Supreme Court) and turn out their voters. But despite the relatively high turnout, Saccone got only about 113,000 votes (the same as Lamb) \u2014 less than 40 percent of Murphy's total in 2016. Trump made an eleventh-hour visit this past weekend to try to help Saccone over the line. \"I think the president helped close this race,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan contended Wednesday, per NPR's Susan Davis. But that does not appear to have been enough. The Pelosi factor and the tax bill messaging Does this win for Democrats mean they will start to abandon Pelosi? It very well might, but it depends on the district. A couple of things to look at: To which Ryan had this to say: \"This is something that you're not going to see repeated, because they [Democrats] didn't have a primary. They were able to pick a candidate who could run as a conservative, who ran against the minority leader, who ran on a conservative agenda. You will have primaries in all these other races, and the primaries bring them to the left. So I just don't think this is something they're going to be able to see a repeat of.\" But it provides a road map for Democrats in these very kinds of districts if they want to win. That has to be worrying for Republicans. It also does raise the question of what Democrats do about Pelosi. If they win the House back in large measure by running against Pelosi, can they really then turn around and re-elect her speaker this fall? And there's the question of whether enough Democratic candidates will vow not to support her for speaker that she can't get elected. The suburbs and making inroads in rural areas Fifty-two percent of Lamb's vote came from the suburban precincts in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh. If Democrats are going to win back the House, their road goes through the suburbs. Nationally, in 2016, Trump won the suburbs with 49 percent. In 2012, Mitt Romney got 50 percent in them. So that's key. Lamb won only a handful of precincts in the other three more rural counties in this district, but dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 presidential election for Trump. In other words, Lamb was able to cut into Republican margins \u2014 and when every vote counts, as in a race like this, it can make all the difference.

            "article_content": "A close race for a reliably Republican congressional seat in western Pennsylvania will be decided Tuesday. An upset by Democrats could be a warning sign for the midterms.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Votes are being counted at this moment in a closely watched special election in Pennsylvania. This is a race for a reliably safe Republican House seat near Pittsburgh. But Democrat Conor Lamb has been running a very competitive campaign against Republican Rick Saccone. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is watching the results come in in Canonsburg, Pa. Hi, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey there. SHAPIRO: Polls closed an hour and a half ago. So far, what are the results telling us? DETROW: So Conor Lamb, the Democrat, is ahead by about 8,000 votes right now. That's about 6 percentage points. He's doing really well in the Pittsburgh suburbs. There's high turnout there. He's got a pretty wide margin. In the more white, working-class, rural parts of the district, Republican Rick Saccone is ahead. But the margins are much closer than they were between Democrats and Republicans in previous presidential contests. We're all waiting for more results to come in from the eastern part of the district. That's where Saccone is from. Democrats have been feeling confident all along, but I would say the mood here at Lamb's party has shifted from ready to spike the football to just a little bit of breath holding right now. SHAPIRO: And I know you've been talking to people on both sides today. As the race comes down to the final moments, what have they been saying about how it's going? DETROW: Democrats have been feeling pretty confident. I mean, this is a district where they didn't even bother running a candidate in 2016, in 2014 where - that Trump won by 20 points. And this is neck and neck. You know, all along, Lamb's campaign was running with the national party at arm's length, saying this is about the two candidates and nothing else. They really felt like they needed to localize the race. But I just talked to John Fetterman. He's a progressive mayor of nearby Braddock. He's run statewide a couple of times. He said, yeah, Lamb's conservative background helped a lot but that you can't discount Democratic energy to try and send a message to President Trump. JOHN FETTERMAN: So I think people are just chomping at the bit to be able to say, you know what - you know, here is your message, Donald Trump - and send him home with Conor Lamb. DETROW: So like I said, Lamb is doing really well in the suburbs. In previous special elections, we've seen a big shift toward Democrats in the suburbs. And a lot of that has been attributed to anti-Trump sentiment. SHAPIRO: There's been a lot of money spent on this one House race, $10 million from outside Republican groups alone. How much has that shaped things? DETROW: Yeah, a lot of that on the Republican side was trying to save the seat. You saw $10 million in outside money. That's from groups that were not affiliated with Saccone's campaign. Democrats spent a lot, too, but most of that came from the Lamb campaign itself. There's been an interesting development today. For most of this race, national Democrats were staying quiet, not too involved. Suddenly today, this afternoon as votes are coming in, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the Democratic National Committee are saying, hey, we did actually spend money on this race; we spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on digital ads, on fundraising. But we tried to make a point to do it quietly so that Lamb could keep his distance. Ari, there's been one funny development with all this money spent. Election officials were fielding all these calls today from people saying, hey, I went to the polling place, and it was closed; what's the deal? And people said, yeah, you don't actually live in the 18th District, so you can't vote today despite all the commercials you saw. SHAPIRO: One reason that people are paying so much attention to this House race is that people are kind of looking at it as a bellwether for the 2018 midterms. How much can we actually learn from the outcome here? DETROW: I think regardless of who wins, Lamb or Saccone, tonight is probably another positive night for Democrats. It's very close in a district that, again, went Republican for years. But I think Democrats are pretty tired of these moral victories, saying, hey, we lost by just a tiny margin. And they're not going to be too excited about a close loss here. I think they'd be frustrated. But if Lamb does win, you're going to hear a lot about it as the party tries to recruit candidates and raise money and build momentum for November. SHAPIRO: And I suppose one way or another, the district is going to be gone in November because of Pennsylvania redistricting. DETROW: (Laughter) Well, there's that. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's... DETROW: And whoever wins this race needs to decide where they're going to run. SHAPIRO: That's right. NPR's Scott Detrow reporting from Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District as the results come in. Thanks, Scott. DETROW: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The 2018 election cycle has officially begun, with the first primaries being held in Texas on Tuesday. In every campaign cycle, analysts look at the fundamentals \u2014 the political laws of gravity that, in the past, have influenced elections. In 2016, Donald Trump seemed to defy a lot of these laws, and Republicans are hoping they can do the same this year to prevent the hit that the party in power usually takes in a president's first midterm elections. Here are five laws of political gravity to watch as the 2018 campaign plays out: 1. When a president's approval rating is below 50 percent, his party doesn't fare well at all Historically, parties that hold the White House lose seats in midterms \u2014 even more when they also have complete control of Congress, and even more when the president's approval rating is under 50 percent. Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating is below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats. The Republican Party has a bad news trifecta here. Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating has been below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats. Midterms are a referendum on the president and his party. Trump is still popular with his base, but because he is so historically unpopular with so many other voters, his ability to help his fellow Republicans is diminished. His \"strongly disapprove\" numbers have been consistently higher than his \"strongly approve\" numbers. The latest tracking poll from Gallup showed that 39 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, while 55 percent disapprove. And his approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average is a similar 40 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove. 2. The party with the intensity and enthusiasm on its side wins Democrats have it \u2014 and it's fueled by animus toward Trump, just like Republicans in 2010 and 2014 were motivated by antipathy to President Barack Obama. (Democrats lost a total of 76 House seats and 15 Senate seats in those two Obama-era midterms.) In the handful of special elections since 2016, and in the Virginia and New Jersey 2017 elections, Democratic turnout has been up. There are hundreds of new Democratic candidates running in races where Democrats have failed to field a candidate in the past, and polls consistently show that Democrats are more interested and enthusiastic about the 2018 campaign than Republicans. As The Washington Post noted Saturday, about 1,200 candidates had registered to run as Democrats for the House by the end of 2017 \u2014 a clear record for a single party and the first time since before the wave election of 2010 that Democrats outnumbered Republicans at the same point in an election cycle. 3. When people are in a bad mood, the party in power suffers Voters' attitudes about the state of the country \u2014 Are we in a recession? Are we at war? \u2014 is always one of the most important factors. Americans remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. On average, just 35 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent think it is on the wrong track. Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.\" Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report, on how Americans feel about President Trump And this year, the measurement isn't working the way it usually does in at least one big respect. The direction of the country and a president's approval rating is typically tied to voters' views about the economy. But right now, the economy is doing pretty well \u2014 with Americans' attitudes about the economy reaching a 17-year high in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll \u2014 and increasing numbers of people are saying they like the GOP tax cuts. So why isn't Trump more popular? In fact, he is suffering poor approval ratings with the very upper-middle-class, suburban voters who are probably benefiting the most from his tax cuts. Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report said that it's as if voters are saying to the president, \"Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.\" There is a wild card on the economy \u2014 Trump's threatened tariffs and a possible trade war. On Monday, the president said that he didn't think there would be a trade war if he goes ahead with steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but a few days earlier, he tweeted that \"trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" Republicans worry Trump's tariffs could undermine the stock market and economic growth \u2014 two factors they have been counting on to help them in November. 4. The party that has the structural advantages can sometimes mitigate damage This is the bright spot for Republicans. Even though many Democratic candidates have raised impressive amounts of money to stock their war chests, Republicans have a lot more outside money than Democrats do. The Koch brothers' network of conservative donors alone have pledged to spend a whopping $400 million electing Republicans this year, 60 percent more than they spent in the 2016 presidential election. Many GOP congressional districts are also drawn to protect incumbents, and because Republicans control more state legislatures, they have overwhelmingly drawn those districts to advantage their party. Republicans are hoping the mighty fortress of redistricting will help them defend against a big blue wave \u2014 if one materializes. They are trying to fight back against a state court ruling in Pennsylvania that redrew the state's congressional district and is likely to eat into the GOP's 13-5 statewide advantage in House seats. But challenges to maps drawn by Republicans in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina are unlikely to impact the 2018 election. 5. The party that turns out their base usually wins Who actually comes out to vote is an important factor in any election \u2014 and it's hard to predict. But it's especially true in midterms, when activists traditionally dominate. Consider: There is about a 30 percent drop-off in turnout from presidential to midterm years. In 2016, Donald Trump surprised a lot of political handicappers when he got more rural, white, working-class voters to the polls than most turnout models predicted. And things are often favorable for the GOP in a midterm. \"The people who turn out the most tend to be older people, tend to be whiter people, tend to be people who are married, and tend to be people who are well educated,\" says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. \"Most of them tend to favor the Republicans.\" But there's one flaw in that profile for Republicans \u2014 highly educated voters generally do not like Trump. In fact, more than half of white college graduates have strongly disapproved of him. And, since 2016, they have been turning out for Democrats. This will make it harder for Trump to help Republican candidates in the kind of suburban districts won by Democrat Hilary Clinton in 2016. The suburbs are precisely where Democrats are hoping to build their comeback. Clinton won 23 districts where a Republican was elected to the House in 2016. Democrats need to pick up a net of 24 seats to take back the House. What's more, Trump won independents in 2016, but they've flipped. To make up for it, Trump needs to turn out big numbers of his white, non-college-educated supporters to the polls this year \u2014 just like he did when he defied the odds two years ago. \"Coalitions that are built in presidential elections don't always translate into midterm elections,\" Walter points out. \"Just ask Democrats who were counting on the Obama coalition of 2008 to come out in 2010. They didn't.\"",

            "article_content": "Positive attitudes about the economy have been making the GOP more optimistic that they can limit losses in the midterm elections. But market volatility this week showed that to be a risky proposition.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Democrats are hopeful about this year's midterm elections. The party that's out of power usually has big gains in a midterm. For Republicans, a strong economy has calmed some of their worries about this year's campaign, but the volatility in the markets this week also shows that's a risky bet. Here's NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: On Monday in Ohio, President Trump tried to explain that in congressional elections, the party in power - in this case, his party - usually loses seats because, he said, their supporters get complacent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So what happens is they sort of take it for granted. They sit back, and then they get clobbered because the other people are desperate. And they get out, and they have more energy. LIASSON: Trump said he was sure Republicans would do just fine. But... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: History's not on our side, but it's not because of that word - complacency. You win the presidency, and you take it easy. And then they come and surprise you in the midterms. They call them the midterms. LIASSON: Trump seemed to be preparing Republicans for losses. And the big question of the 2018 elections is, how big will those losses be? Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to get the majority in the House. Republican pollster Bill McInturff says the GOP still has a lot of advantages. BILL MCINTURFF: Number one is these are not particularly fair congressional seats. There's an inherent Republican advantage, and that means that Democrats don't have to win. They have to win by a lot. LIASSON: Meaning that to a certain extent, Republicans can count on the mighty fortress of redistricting. They also have a huge national financial advantage. And then there's the Republicans' secret weapon, the economy. MCINTURFF: We have some tough political numbers, but it's very different sitting on the best economy in terms of consumer confidence since 2000. Despite the last few days of the market, in general, economic confidence is at a generation high. LIASSON: The latest polls show Americans are feeling better about the economy. In this week's Quinnipiac poll, a whopping 75 percent of voters said their financial situation was excellent or good. The Republican tax plan is getting more popular. And finally, says McInturff, so is President Trump. MCINTURFF: Most midterms are a referendum on the incumbent president. Donald Trump defied history by winning the presidency, and that's to his credit. But sooner or later, political gravity tends to affect every president. This is a midterm that's still going to involve attitudes about the president. But when we talk about signs of progress, look; the president's numbers have floated up. LIASSON: President Trump's numbers are still historically low, but it seems they are starting to benefit from people's feelings about the economy. And the president is counting on that trend continuing. Since the stock market gyrations this week, he's stopped bragging about the Dow, but he's never stopped bragging about the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: And wait till you see GDP over the next year or two. Wait till you see what happens to our country 'cause people can feel it. LIASSON: Democrats have a theory of the case for 2018, too, and it's based on learning some hard lessons of the past. Despite historic trends, Democrats say they have an uphill battle this year. They have to harness the organic enthusiasm that's been fueling high Democratic turnout and keep it going till November. And they have to be a big-tent party. Yesterday at a House Democratic retreat, former Vice President Joe Biden told Democrats they didn't have to choose between appealing to their liberal multi-ethnic base and reaching out to the white, working-class voters they lost in 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: All these so-called racists who voted against us last time out - remember; a black man and an Irish Catholic kid won all those places before. And so folks, let's not rip ourselves apart in a debate that is irrelevant. LIASSON: Democrats say they also need to avoid another trap. Yes, midterms are referendums on the president. But... STEVEN SCHALE: I think it's a dangerous assumption to assume that people are just going to vote for anybody because they're angry at Donald Trump. LIASSON: That's Steven Schale, a Democratic political consultant in Florida. SCHALE: You know, as we've seen in special elections around the country, Trump has been, you know, one of our best allies in electing Democrats. But that being said, like, you still have to recruit good candidates. You've still got to deliver a good message. And so I do think candidates that base their entire argument on the fact that I'm not Trump do so at their own peril. LIASSON: Like the stock market, the polls have been volatile, and they may continue to seesaw for the rest of the year. If there's been one constant of the Trump presidency it's that every day is unpredictable. Plus, it's only February. Mara Liasson. NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., announced Wednesday he will not seek what would be his 10th term in Congress, making him the second California Republican this week, along with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, to call it quits rather than face a possible Democratic wave in this year's midterms. Issa's influence on Capitol Hill has waned recently, but for four years, he chaired the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where he earned a reputation as a staunch critic of former President Barack Obama and became a fixture on cable-news programs. As chairman of the committee, Issa was a key player in GOP-led investigations looking at what Obama administration officials knew about controversial incidents including the 2012 terrorist attack on a diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans including a U.S. Ambassador were killed, the IRS targeting of conservative groups and the \"Fast and Furious\" gun-trafficking scandal. The ladder eventually led to the extraordinary 2012 contempt vote of then-Attorney General Eric Holder by the U.S. House. Holder refused to hand over internal Justice Department documents about a botched gun-sting operation in Arizona. In a statement Wednesday, Issa said was \"forever grateful to the people of San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties\" and said it was an \"honor\" to serve them. He added: \"Together, we put an end to abusive congressional earmarks, strengthened the Violence Against Women Act, empowered better oversight of the executive branch, and cleared the course for better intellectual property protections to stop the piracy of American ingenuity. \"Throughout my service, I worked hard and never lost sight of the people our government is supposed to serve. Yet with the support of my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in California's 49th District.\" Issa, 64, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was first elected in 2000. As the Los Angeles Times points out, California's 49th district has changed since then, with growing Latino and Asian populations, and in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump in Issa's district. In his own 2016 race, Issa narrowly defeated a Democratic challenger \u2014 winning by only about 1,600 votes. As NPR's Jessica Taylor reported, there are now 31 Republicans not seeking re-election in 2018. That number will likely grow, as Republicans in competitive districts have to make decisions about whether to run in an election year where their president has a historically low approval rating. Democratic activist billionaire Tom Steyer this week pledged to put up $30 million to help defeat Republicans in the midterms. Later Wednesday, Steyer's organization NextGen America tweeted out a statement praising Issa's decision: \"This week, we got our first wins with Darrell Issa and Ed Royce stepping down rather than face crushing defeat in November. Progressives are energized like never before \u2014 and today makes it more than obvious: Trump and the GOP are scared.\" .@TomSteyer weighs in on @DarrellIssa retirement. Thinking about quitting now, @SteveKnight25, @DanaRohrabacher, @MimiWaltersCA, @RepDavidValadao, @RepJeffDenham? Because we\u2019re coming for you. https://t.co/hUOtcSzSB7 pic.twitter.com/LKlM7GhxD8 Issa was born in Cleveland, where he grew up in a working-class family. He dropped out of high school in 1970 to join the U.S. Army and earned the rank of captain. In the 1970s, he had a couple of run-ins with the law, including an incident where he and his brother were arrested on suspicion of stealing a red Maserati sports car from a Cleveland showroom. According to an NPR report from 2012, Issa said police mistook his identity and charges were dropped. But by 1982, Issa created a car-alarm company called Directed Electronics, which he eventually moved from Cleveland to San Diego. Issa made a fortune from this business and he even provided the voice of the Viper car alarms that would warn people they were standing too close the vehicle: \"Protected by Viper. Stand back.\" According to the Center for Responsive Politics, which estimates politicians' wealth based on personal finance-disclosure information, Issa's estimated net worth was more than $323 million in 2016. He used his substantial wealth not only to help finance his own campaigns through the years, but in 2003, he dropped $1.7 million to launch a signature-gathering effort to recall then-California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, according to the San Diego Union Tribune. Issa had plans to run in the recall election against Davis, but eventually dropped out when actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger entered the race. Schwarzenegger went on to defeat Davis and serve as governor from 2003 until 2011.",

Senators recommend more funding and IT support, but there is no consensus about how much or how to pay for it.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: A big question is hanging over the midterm elections this fall. It's this. What is the best way to protect the vote from foreign interference? The Senate Intelligence Committee took up that question at a hearing today. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to tell us more. Ryan, thanks for coming. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: My pleasure. MARTIN: First, context - there's been a lot of attention on the Russians' hacking of emails and their disinformation campaigning during the 2016 election. But did they also target state election systems? LUCAS: They did. That's right. And that's in large part why there's so much concern right now about making sure that state voting systems are secure ahead of the midterms. And this is important because public confidence in the integrity of an election and the results is really a key part of how U.S. democracy works. Now, why the concern? As you said, the Russians targeted election systems in 2016. The Department of Homeland Security says that happened in 21 states. DHS says the Russians managed to access a system in only one state. That was a voter registration database in Illinois. Officials say no data was changed; no vote tallies were changed. But the security of election systems - and when I say that, I'm talking about everything from voter databases to voting machines used on Election Day - is still a really big concern here. This isn't just fears that vote tallies could be changed. There are concerns that a foreign adversary - take Russia - could delete voters from voter rolls, for example, on a large enough scale that it could lead to chaos on Election Day and doubts about the integrity of the election itself. MARTIN: Well, how concerned are U.S. officials that Russia or another country will try to hack the midterm elections? LUCAS: They're very concerned. For months, senior U.S. intelligence officials and lawmakers have been warning that 2016 wasn't a one-off for Russia. They say the Kremlin will try to interfere again. They say other countries could follow Russia's lead. Today DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reiterated this point in her testimony. Here's a bit of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: We think the threat remains high. We think vigilance is important, and we think there's a lot that we all need to do at all levels of government before we have the midterm elections. LUCAS: Now, another DHS official said today that the department hasn't seen anything at this point that would suggest that a foreign adversary might be testing systems ahead of the midterms. But there's still a lot of concern that this is a potential target. MARTIN: OK, so what is the government doing to safeguard future elections? LUCAS: Well, one of the big problems in 2016 was communication between federal government on one hand and state and local election officials on another. It took a year for DHS to inform states that their systems were targeted by Russia. One thing that hampered the feds from sharing information with state officials was that a lot of the information was classified. So DHS says it's working to fix that. Already about 20 out of 150 state election officials have received security clearances. And the DHS secretary said today that if the department has information of a threat, it can share it immediately with state officials, even state officials who don't have clearance yet. She said that more than half the states have signed up for a DHS cyber-scanning service which would help identify potential probing. But there are also some very simple steps that can be taken to help secure the vote and ensure confidence in it. One of the most important is making sure that a voting system leaves a paper trail that can be audited. Old-school paper ballots are one example of this. As one person said today, you can't hack a piece of paper. And this is important because right now, five states are entirely paperless in their voting, and several others have areas, jurisdictions that have paperless voting. MARTIN: OK, final question - it's reasonable to assume that some of these changes will cost money. Who's going to pay for it? LUCAS: Money is always an issue, isn't it? A lot of the voting machines used in states are old - in many cases, more than a decade old. Committee Chairman Richard Burr said today that upwards of $400 million for election security could be in the spending bill that Congress is looking to pass this week. But again, the clock is ticking on this. It takes time to get this stuff done. Some primaries have already happened. They're really going to get going in the late spring. So time is short, and lawmakers say this is urgent - got to get it done. MARTIN: That's NPR's Ryan Lucas. Ryan, thank you. LUCAS: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Texans have turned out in record numbers to vote this year. In fact, more people in the state voted early than in the entire 2014 midterms. The biggest race is for a Senate seat.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: In Texas, voter turnout is at record levels. We know this because nearly 5 million Texans voted early. And that is more than the total turnout for midterms four years ago. The race capturing most of the headlines is of course for the U.S. Senate between Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O'Rourke. As NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports from Dallas, that is not the only race energizing voters. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: The 32nd Congressional District in Dallas is an upper-middle-class suburb that was carefully drawn to be reliably Republican, if not forevermore, then for a very long time. And so it's been. Republican Pete Sessions has represented the district in D.C. for the last 16 years. But times and - more to the point - demographics have changed, and the congressman is fighting for his political life against Democratic contender Colin Allred. And thousands are streaming into Dan D. Rogers Elementary School here to vote. DON WOODWORTH: It's an epic struggle for the United States. It goes way beyond these local races. It's all about the president. GOODWYN: Don Woodworth and his wife, Pamela, are the kind of deeply conservative voter that has long dominated this district. D WOODWORTH: I'm very far to the right. I'm very conservative in everything. PAMELA WOODWORTH: My biggest concern is that my children will no longer have the right to do what they want to do. If they want to have a gun, they won't be able to have it. D WOODWORTH: Pamela Woodworth says she's a Christian conservative. P WOODWORTH: I believe the sanctity of marriage is between a man and a woman. I have a lot of gay friends that are - I love them, but I don't have to like their lifestyle. GOODWYN: The Woodworths believe Democrats are mostly un-American. D WOODWORTH: Against the foundation of the country and want to turn things around, that the Constitution is this living document. I think it's nonsense. And when you have 65 million people doing that, you're in jeopardy. EDWINA LYON: I - it - it's just - feels like an apocalypse or Armageddon, the end of the world, in a way. GOODWYN: Edwina Lyon is a retired teacher and devoted Democrat. She's appalled at Trump's proposals to abolish birthright citizenship, not to mention the way he demeans his political opponents. LYON: I spent 26 years saying to children, you may not talk to your friends that way, and, we don't hit each other. GOODWYN: She's worried about the planet. LYON: I have three grown children. I'm deeply worried about climate change and what kind of environment they're going to have. And I don't understand it because Trump has grandchildren. GOODWYN: Like the Woodworths, Lyon says her anxiety level and the stakes couldn't be higher. The Woodworths voted to re-elect Republican Ted Cruz to the U.S. Senate. Lyon backs Beto O'Rourke. Turnout may decide it. And the unprecedented numbers are giving O'Rourke's supporters hope. If the total number of voters in Texas approaches or exceeds 8 million, that could put Cruz's Senate seat in play - or maybe not. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas.

            "article_content": "One of the nation's closest races is the bid for the House seat in the state's 7th Congressional District. And, Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez tries to hold onto his seat after a corruption trial.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: On this Election Day, we are spending time at polling places around the country as they begin to open. And right now, we're going to turn to New Jersey, where there are a couple key races to watch. This includes a House race in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District. Republican Congressman Leonard Lance is facing a challenge from Democrat Tom Malinowski. And WNYC's Nancy Solomon is at a polling station in that district, and she joins me now. Nancy, good morning. And I heard the weather was not going to be great in New Jersey today. How bad is it? NANCY SOLOMON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. It's pretty misty. It's not raining yet. It's cold. Excuse the train going by. But it is forecast to rain all day, which, of course, we know is not great for turnout. GREENE: No. Well, how is turnout so far? I guess it's - what? - polls have been open for maybe 20 minutes or so. SOLOMON: That's right. I'm at the Millburn Public Library (ph) in Millburn, N.J., and it's surprising. It is busy here. There are a lot of people coming to vote. They were here, parked in their cars, waiting to get in at 6 o'clock. And there's a steady flow. And I thought - oh, man, it's 6:20. I'm not going to have much to say to you. GREENE: (Laughter). SOLOMON: But I've actually been able to talk to five or six voters. They were all Democrats. They were all - their reason for voting is because they're upset with President Trump. And you know, this is the place I come when I'm looking for Republican voters and moderate voters. And it's surprising. GREENE: Well, that's so interesting because, I mean, Leonard Lance has been the Republican congressman there. And it sounds like President Trump's election really, really changed things for him and the dynamic in his role in that district. SOLOMON: Absolutely. This is the 7th Congressional District in New Jersey. It's suburban pretty much throughout except for - the far reaches are a little more rural. And it's a moderate district, and there's a long tradition of moderate Republicanism in New Jersey. And Leonard Lance was elected 10 years ago as a moderate. People in his district liked him. But over the years, there's been a drift, you know? We know that the Republican Party, of course, has become more conservative. The leadership is more conservative. And Lance has been marginalized in the party. And so now you see this reaction to Trump. And what they wanted was for him to stand up to Trump. And there are a lot of voters. And they've been organized in ways we've really never seen here before, the level of grassroots activism that started as a Trump resistance movement and then became a flip-the-House-blue movement. And you know, you're talking about suburbs here. You know, we're not talking about radical folks. We're talking about middle-aged, middle-class, mostly white women who have been in this movement. GREENE: So interesting - I mean, it sounds like that really is one of the races that, as we follow it, it won't mean something just for the district but could tell us a lot about the national narrative that we're going to see as this Election Day plays out. I love the sound of the commuter train going by. WNYC's Nancy Solomon - as polls are just opening in the state of New Jersey, she's in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District. And we'll be checking in on polling places throughout the morning. Thanks so much, Nancy. Stay dry. SOLOMON: You're welcome, David. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Tony Evers, Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin, faced a primary opponent who was further left and does not take up all the far-reaching policy positions of Bernie Sanders. But he has embraced the progressive banner, and Sanders has his back in a campaign to unseat GOP Gov. Scott Walker.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Tony Evers, Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin, faced a primary opponent who was further left and does not take up all the far-reaching policy positions of Bernie Sanders. But he has embraced the progressive banner, and Sanders has his back in a campaign to unseat GOP Gov. Scott Walker. Democrats Andrew Gillum and Tony Evers are both carrying the progressive banner in tight races for governor, but their differing ideologies and strategies show how the label has broadened appeal and less definition in 2018. Gillum is the charismatic 39-year-old mayor of Tallahassee barnstorming the state of Florida in his bid to become the state's first black governor. His progressive agenda, embraced by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, combined with identity politics is intended to bring together a coalition. In Wisconsin, Evers is the oft-described \"bland\" 66-year-old superintendent of Wisconsin schools sticking to kitchen table economic issues as he tries to unseat incumbent Gov. Scott Walker. He has not taken up all the far-reaching policy proposals of Sanders, but the two have teamed up nonetheless. An increasing number of Democrats are identifying as \"progressive\" this election year, as the party overall moves to the left \u2014 and the label is embraced by a larger swath of Democrats. Strategists say it's a word that has gained popularity since Sanders' bid for the presidency in 2016, and it carries different connotations in different states, adapting to the local climate. In some states, it refers to a $15-dollar minimum wage or Medicare-for-all. In other states, it includes legalizing marijuana, taking on the NRA, or calling to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). For some candidates, it's a description of economic populism; for others, it's an adjective that refers to cultural or social issues. That ambiguity allows candidates to appeal to different parts of the Democratic Party coalition, something they can afford running in separate races across the country, as opposed to battling for the soul of the party in a single presidential primary. In the Michigan governor's race, for example, the Democratic nominee Gretchen Whitmer held off a more progressive candidate on the left, but since capturing the nomination she has campaigned with Sanders and received the endorsement of the progressive political action committee Democracy for America, founded by former presidential candidate Howard Dean. Research by Elaine Kamarck at the Brookings Institution examined congressional races and found there was a \"huge increase\" in the number of Democrats who identified as a \"progressive\" this election year \u2014 44 percent in 2018, compared to 29 percent in 2016 and 26 percent in 2014. However, many of these self-described progressives lost their primaries to more \"establishment\" candidates. But the sheer number of progressive Democratic candidates who ran in the 2018 midterms suggests the popularity of this label isn't going to disappear after November, when the 2020 Democratic presidential primary fight will quickly heat up. In Wisconsin, it's all about the economy Tony Evers is not a fiery liberal demanding free college for all. He's a soft-spoken bureaucrat, a former teacher and school administrator, who campaigns on promises to improve basic public services: infrastructure, education and healthcare. \"The average moms and dad and kids in Wisconsin, they care whether their roads are safe, they care whether they have a good education system, they care about having access to affordable healthcare,\" he told NPR in an interview. \"That is progressivism for me.\" It's a progressive message that's tailored to Wisconsin, which has had a long history of a particular vein of populist economic politics. It's a progressivism that targets big business, not culture wars, guns, or immigration. \"Progressivism means to me solving problems that people have,\" Evers said. \"It's not a Republican issue, it's not a Democratic issue, it's issues that are facing everyday people in the country, such as healthcare.\" In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Wisconsin developed a reputation as a particularly progressive region, in major part because of one man - Robert La Follette. LaFollette took on the railroad industry and fought against the robber barons of the day. The state's progressive history continued into the 20th century with the development of Social Security. Wisconsinites, including Evers, like to point out that parts of Social Security came out of the University of Wisconsin. That progressive legacy, some say, transcends party politics and lingers to this day. \"There's a long-standing strand of thinking in Wisconsin that big business can be harmful,\" said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"This goes back to the fights between Bob La Follette and the railroads and the timber industry in the early 1900s, but I think it extends even to concerns about the FoxConn plant that's being developed in southeast Wisconsin,\" said Burden. The state offered FoxConn a $3 billion tax incentive to lure the tech company to Wisconsin. Evers has been an outspoken critic of the FoxConn deal and incumbent Gov. Walker. He has said that if elected governor, he would try to revise the contract. Anti-Walker sentiment is a key part of Evers coalition, but he's also trying to appeal to populist economic ideas. \"We're going to give every middle class family in the state of Wisconsin a 10 percent break on their income taxes cause those are the people that have been struggling all along under Scott Walker,\" Evers told the crowd at a recent rally with Bernie Sanders on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Where Evers struggles is that even some Democrats aren't sure how to place him ideologically. He was not the most liberal candidate in his primary. \"I don't know if I would call him a progressive,\" said Dylan Fairweather, a 25-year-old with a nose ring at the Sanders rally. \"I guess if he's gonna call himself a progressive, go ahead - do your thing. But I don't know, that's kind of tough.\" Ever is not as bold as Sanders ideologically, not is he as free-wheeling with promises to revolutionize the system. But Burden says even though many people might not put Evers and Sanders in the same ideological camp, he still thinks there's a connection between the two self-identified progressives. \"There is a common idea that big business and big institutions can be problematic, that average people need to have a say in their government, (and) providing public services is important,\" said Burden. In Florida, a coalition built on ideology and identity Hundreds of miles south, in Florida, Democratic nominee for governor Andrew Gillum is mixing economic populism with race. These days, more Americans think of themselves as \"liberal.\" White Democratic voters, in particular, are increasingly likely to describe their political views as \"liberal\" compared to a decade ago, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Black voters are far less likely to describe themselves as \"liberal\" (30 percent, compared to 54 percent of white voters). A progressive candidate of color can potentially build a coalition of white liberals and black voters more successfully than a white candidate. Any successful candidate in a close statewide race has to unite diverse coalitions within the party, and what Gillum \u2014 and to an extent Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams \u2014 are trying to do is build a coalition that is based on ideology and identity. It's something Bernie Sanders, seen as the most progressive option in the 2016 presidential election, struggled to do. And it might show Democrats how they could successfully win elections in places they never previously thought they could. Gillum leans into his identity. His supporters like to say that he is unapologetically black. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, takes a selfie with Dorothy Himmelstein after a campaign event in Flagler County.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid /Asma Khalid\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, takes a selfie with Dorothy Himmelstein after a campaign event in Flagler County. After a recent Gillum rally, Dorothy Himmelstein stopped the mayor to take a selfie on her phone. Himmelstein, a 72-year-old retired teacher who still faithfully puts on an Obama button every morning, looked amused when asked what attracted her to Gillum. \"Oh, besides him being black?\" she asked bluntly. Gillum isn't shy about tackling big cultural fissures. He has has repeatedly called for the state's \"stand your ground\" law to be repealed. Gillum has said the controversial Florida law that enshrines the right of self-defense, even to the point of lethal force, is \"vigilantism\" that has \"no place in civilized society.\" \"We didn't make apologies for it,\" Gillum told an audience at the annual Congressional Black Caucus legislative conference in September, referring to his willingness to demand the law be repealed, despite warnings that such a move could be political suicide. \"We didn't run from our stories and our experiences, it informed our public policy.\" In a recent debate, Gillum called out his GOP opponent Ron DeSantis for accepting money from a donor who made an Islamophobic and racist comment about former President Obama. As my grandmother used to say \u2014 a hit dog will holler. pic.twitter.com/kC34Ldd0is \"I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\" he said. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\" He then linked to that debate video clip on his twitter profile so it could be shared more widely. Despite Gillum's tendency to lean into his identity, when asked about demographics, he dismisses the question. He insists his strategy is to campaign everywhere, even in counties Democrats rarely visit. After a campaign event in Flagler County, a county Donald Trump won by more than 20 percentage points, Gillum said he thought the Democrats' soul-searching after 2016 over the question of whether to reach out more to white working class voters or people of color was a \"false dichotomy.\" \"The reason why I'm campaigning in a very, very red part of the state is we got to treat people as individuals,\" said Gillum. \"I think we have really written off too many parts and too many people, to include folks who would be our natural allies, refusing to go to them, refusing to talk to them, refusing to ask them for their vote.\" And that's the duality of Gillum's campaign. It's a mix of ideology and identity. He believes that progressive ideas will resonate everywhere in his state. And on the campaign trail, he frequently talks about classic economically progressive ideas: the need to solve income inequality, expand Medicaid to over 1 million Floridians, and raise teacher salaries to $50,000. And while these ideas might be described as \"progressive,\" Florida Democratic strategist Steve Schale points out the entire Democratic Party has shifted, moving further to the left in recent years. Even the 2016 ideological lines of purity have been muddied with both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigning for Gillum in Florida this cycle. \"Issues like access to affordable healthcare and raising the minimum wage really aren't seen as progressive anymore, they're seen as very mainstream,\" said Schale. \"Candidates 10 years ago who talked about these issues were seen as pushing the envelope. These days, Democratic candidates who aren't talking about these issues are frankly just not part of the conversation.\"",

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday in Houston.\n                \n                    \n                    Loren Elliott/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump addresses the crowd during a rally in support of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Monday in Houston. Updated at 5:22 p.m. ET President Trump is campaigning hard with just two weeks to go until the midterm elections, and he is keeping the fact-checkers busy. Never a stickler for the truth, Trump has introduced a number of fresh falsehoods during the wide-ranging monologues he has been offering to adoring crowds in packed arenas around the country. Here's a look at some of the the president's latest false claims. Migrant caravan With conservative news outlets glued to a caravan of Central American migrants making their way north through Mexico toward the U.S. border, Trump suggested there is something more sinister than desperately poor families looking for a better life. \"Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in,\" Trump tweeted on Monday. Sadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws! Later, he repeated that unsubstantiated claim, telling White House reporters \"you're going to find MS-13, you're going to find Middle Eastern. You're going to find everything. And guess what? We're not allowing them in our country. We want safety.\" Reporters traveling with the caravan and the migrants themselves say they haven't seen any Middle Easterners in the group. While it's not unheard of for people from the Middle East to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico, it is extremely rare. Of more than 300,000 people apprehended last year trying to cross the Southern border illegally, fewer than 100 came from countries in the Middle East, according to data gathered by Customs and Border Protection. Tuesday afternoon the president acknowledged, after some back-and-forth with a reporter, that he had no proof there are Middle Easterners in the Central American caravan. \"There's no proof of anything,\" Trump said. But he insisted the migrants and illegal immigration in general pose a serious threat to the country. \"Certainly you have people coming up through the Southern border from the Middle East and other places that are not appropriate for our country,\" Trump said. \"And I'm not letting them in.\" Trump has promised to focus on hot-button issues like illegal immigration and the Supreme Court in the homestretch of this year's campaign season. \"This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, tax cuts, law and order, and common sense. That's what it is,\" Trump told supporters in Houston Monday night. Tax cuts Many mainstream Republicans thought they would be running this year on the strength of the big tax cut that Congress passed in 2017. But as time has passed, that tax cut has not worn very well. Maybe people aren't seeing a bump in their own take-home pay. Or perhaps they're worried about the federal deficit, which has ballooned as corporate tax revenues fell. Approval for the tax cut is hovering around 40 percent. The president has been offering supporters a fix for this: another tax cut, this time directed at the middle class rather than those at the top of the income ladder. \"We're going to be putting in a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income families,\" Trump told supporters in Houston Monday. \"It's going to be put in next week.\" Whatever you might think of the merits of another tax cut, it's not going to happen next week as the president suggested. Congress is not even in session until after the election. Moreover, no one outside the White House seems to have much of an idea of what the president is talking about. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who heads the tax-writing committee in the House, just smiled at reporters and offered a thumbs-up in Houston. Brady later issued a statement saying, \"We will continue to work with the White House and Treasury over the coming weeks to develop an additional 10 percent tax cut.\" Larry Kudlow, who directs the president's National Economic Council, conceded on Tuesday morning that Trump's timetable of acting next week may be overly ambitious. \"It may not surface for a while, but that's his goal,\" Kudlow said. \"That's his policy intent. And I don't see anything wrong with that.\" Trump \u2014 a political novice \u2014 has a history of promising quick results, then missing deadlines. The 10 percent tax cut appears to be a bit of political vaporware timed for the election and a tacit admission the actual tax cut Republicans passed last year isn't selling very well. Mobs and jobs The battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh energized Republicans, many of whom were offended by the outspoken protesters who repeatedly interrupted his confirmation hearings. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, complained the hearings had degenerated into \"mob rule,\" and Trump has gleefully picked up that language. \"Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs,\" Trump told supporters on Monday. This is a distillation of the president's exaggerated complaint that Democrats favor open borders, lawlessness and Venezuelan-style socialism. While Senate Democrats almost unanimously opposed Kavanaugh's nomination, some \u2014 including the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinsten \u2014 seemed as frustrated by the protesters as were their Republican counterparts. Many Democrats object to the president's get-tough border security and criminal justice policies as counterproductive. But they would reject the labels Trump tries to attach to them. Finally, while job creation during Trump's first 20 months in office has been strong, it still trails the level of job creation during former President Barack Obama's last 20 months in office.",

            "article_content": "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen waves to supporters in Phnom Penh on Friday. Ahead of Sunday's elections, Hun Sen's ruling party has banned the main opposition party, jailed its leaders and other critics and shut independent media outlets. Opposition politicians in exile are urging a boycott.\n                \n                    \n                    Heng Sinith/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen waves to supporters in Phnom Penh on Friday. Ahead of Sunday's elections, Hun Sen's ruling party has banned the main opposition party, jailed its leaders and other critics and shut independent media outlets. Opposition politicians in exile are urging a boycott. Other than the campaign posters plastered across Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, there's little sign that general elections are coming up this Sunday, July 29. Traffic hums along as usual. And save for the occasional car spouting ruling party propaganda through a bullhorn, there's no canvassing or active campaigning in the streets and scant open talk about the vote. \"Recently, people are keeping quiet,\" says May Titthara, executive editor of the Khmer Times newspaper. This is in stark contrast with what happened during last year's election campaign season, when opposition rallies drew crowds across the country. These days, the only political party drawing big crowds is the Cambodian People's Party, the longtime ruling party. That's because this time, there's no real opposition to the CPP. Its leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen, has been in office for more than 30 years. After significant gains by the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in last year's local elections, Hun Sen launched a brutal crackdown on dissidents, the media and rights organizations that he accused of trying to overthrow the government. By the end of 2017, the main opposition party had been dissolved by the Supreme Court. With only fledging parties standing in Hun Sen's way, Sunday's elections have already been declared a sham by Cambodia's main opposition politicians, rights groups and some members of the international community, who have withdrawn election funding. Human Rights Watch calls the elections \"fundamentally flawed\" and warns that banning the main opposition makes the \"vote meaningless.\" It also notes that many election observers are staying away because \"the electoral process is too problematic.\" The U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure this week calling for sanctions on the ruling party for undermining democracy and human rights. \"Democracy for Cambodia is at stake,\" says Mu Sochua, vice president of the CNRP, reached by NPR in Portugal. She has been living in exile since she and several other opposition leaders fled the country in October, after their party's co-founder, Kem Sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. Kem now sits in jail with no timeline for a trial. From Hun Sen's perspective, voter turnout will be key since the CNRP has called for an election boycott. High turnout would be \"cited as proof that the nation has come together to express support\" for the ruling party, writes Astrid Nor\u00e9n-Nilsson with the Center for East and South-East Asian Studies at Lund University in Sweden. Low turnout, she tells NPR in an email, \"would be an Achilles heel\" that the opposition could use to undermine the ruling party in the future. Mu and other opposition leaders are banking on the international community not recognizing the election results. But for Hun Sen, this election is primarily about locking in his legacy, Nor\u00e9n-Nilsson says. \"Hun Sen has led Cambodia for more than three decades, making Cambodia rise again from the ashes of the Khmer Rouge-regime ... overseeing two decades of stellar economic growth and making the country reach lower middle-income status,\" she says. \"He wants these achievements to be his political legacy.\" Hun Sen's political rise A former Khmer Rouge commander, Hun Sen was installed as Cambodia's de facto leader of the Vietnamese-backed government in 1979. He was first elected prime minister in 1985. As he jostled for power with two other strongmen into the 1990s, he became \"co-prime minister\" in 1993. Hun Sen launched a coup in 1997, deposing the first prime minister. The following year, Cambodians elected him again as sole prime minister on a message they craved: stability, development and economic growth. \"In 1998, he managed to negotiate an end of the Khmer Rouge and bring about peace for the whole country for the first time in decades,\" Ou Virak, president of the Future Forum, a public policy think tank in Phnom Penh, told NPR in an email. Hun Sen also followed through on his promise to develop the country. Cambodia's economy \u2014 based largely on garment manufacturing and tourism \u2014 grew by an average 7.6 percent between 1994 and 2015 and is the world's sixth-fastest growing economy, according to the World Bank. While income inequality has risen, particularly between the ruling elites and the poorest 30 percent, Cambodia's middle class is growing, says Ou. Still, Cambodia remains poor, with a per capita GDP of $1,384 in 2017, one of the lowest in the region. Over the decades, human rights groups have accused Hun Sen's government of stamping out dissent by way of political violence, unbridled corruption, repression of free speech and almost complete control of the media. His iron-fisted rule, Ou says, has succeeded through a \"wide and somewhat successful network of patronage.\" He also built loyalty in the armed forces and the courts. Yet he has allowed Cambodians to have some personal freedoms, says Ou, such as permission to study abroad and speak English. While always facing some restrictions, civil society has blossomed throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he says. \"The ideals of human rights and democracy have been allowed to be disseminated,\" Ou says. Many experts see Hun Sen as moving toward China, which is bringing aid and investment, and away from the West, which criticizes the way he runs his country and accuses him of human rights abuses. Over the years, the Cambodian leader has hammered away with an anti-Western message: that Cambodia has been used as a geopolitical pawn by outside powers. He has plenty of fodder for this argument, including Cambodia's French colonization, the U.S. bombing campaign in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and what he sees as United Nations interference in nation-building. Cambodia makes for an interesting test case of China's influence, says Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. The U.S. has mostly focused on human rights issues in Cambodia, he says. \"But the U.S. has to figure out a strategy for a world in which China is much more influential and the U.S.'s power is receding somewhat,\" says Kurlantzick. The road ahead Although repression over the last year has been the most severe Cambodia has seen since the late 1990s, Kurlantzick suggests Hun Sen might let up after the election. \"Historically, Hun Sen's strategy has been to alternate between severe repression and co-opting opposition members, leaders of civil society and anyone who generally opposes him in between periods of repression,\" he says. Other experts, like Nor\u00e9n-Nilsson, believe Cambodia is going through a political transformation and that the main point of Sunday's election is for Hun Sen to usher in a \"new normal\" with fewer democratic freedoms \u2014 something unpalatable to many Cambodians. \"I think ordinary Cambodians, almost without exception, want Cambodia to be a democracy ... even though there may not be even a minimal agreement in society about what democracy means,\" she says. Mu Sochua says after Sunday, she'll continue the fight on behalf of her opposition party. \"We cannot live in fear, we need to give Cambodia a chance,\" she says. Mu points to Malaysia's shock election earlier this year, where the ruling party of 60 years was finally ousted by the opposition. \"The struggle in South Africa, the struggle in the U.S., the struggle anywhere for democracy,\" she says, \"is step by step.\"",

            "article_content": "Tariffs levied by the Trump administration are becoming a major part of this fall's Senate campaigns. Depending on the race, Democrats are choosing whether to run against the tariffs or support them.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: All right, we've just heard how President Trumps tariffs are affecting one farmer in the Midwest. Now we're going to hear how tariffs and trade are affecting key Senate races there. Ten Democrats are running in states that President Trump won in 2016, and we're going to take the next few minutes to check in on the races in Missouri and Wisconsin where the Democratic candidates are running in very different directions on trade. Reporter Jason Rosenbaum of St. Louis Public Radio starts things off. JASON ROSENBAUM, BYLINE: To win a third term, senator Claire McCaskill will have to string together a coalition of urban, suburban and rural voters. But rural counties have taken a sharp Republican turn in the last decade. McCaskill believes she has a potent issue - President Trump's tariffs. She predicts the tariffs will be brutal for Missouri agriculture. CLAIRE MCCASKILL: For every trade war that starts, it's not just the first salvo. It's the reaction. ROSENBAUM: Countries like China and Canada have already retaliated. Canada has slapped tariffs on frozen meat from Missouri. MCCASKILL: So the president's declared a trade war against Canada, which is our most reliable and important trading partner for agriculture. ROSENBAUM: It's not just McCaskill who is up in arms. Her GOP colleague Missouri Senator Roy Blunt also criticized Trump's tariffs. And it's not a mystery why. Agriculture is one of Missouri's top industries. Missouri Farm Bureau President Blake Hurst says soybean farmers in particular are bearing the brunt of the trade war. BLAKE HURST: I mean, we're not profitable. At these levels, we're losing money. And so at some point, it becomes difficult to pay your loan back and difficult to make payments on your farm. It's hard to support your family. ROSENBAUM: Still, many of the state's rural politicians and agricultural groups aren't backing McCaskill. For example, the Missouri Cattlemen's Association and the Missouri Pork Association have endorsed state Attorney General Josh Hawley's U.S. Senate bid. Hawley has the endorsement of Trump and vice president Mike Pence. When asked about his opinion of the tariffs, Hawley says he supports what Trump is trying to do. JOSH HAWLEY: The Chinese in particular have systematically attempted to rig the international trade system to build their middle class on the backs of ours. That is just a fact. And this president said he's not going to let it happen. And I'm glad he's out there trying to do something about it. Let's see what deal he's able to get. ROSENBAUM: Opinion polls show that Trump's standing in Missouri is higher than the national average. But McCaskill clearly thinks that opposing the tariffs will help her withstand a tough re-election bid. For NPR News, I'm Jason Rosenbaum in St. Louis. LAUREL WHITE, BYLINE: And I'm Laurel White in Madison, Wis., where Senator Tammy Baldwin is running for re-election. It could be a tough race. Baldwin is one of only two Democrats holding statewide office in a purple state that's getting redder every year. Getting support from Republicans and independents who voted for President Trump will be crucial. So even though she's a liberal Democrat, Baldwin is highlighting her common ground with the president on trade. Here she is in Eau Claire, Wis., earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TAMMY BALDWIN: When President Trump visited Wisconsin last year, he told us that he backed my buy American water infrastructure plan 100 percent. Now, that's bipartisanship. WHITE: Baldwin says more Republicans need to think like President Trump when it comes to buy America policies. She even recorded a campaign video last month asking the president to lobby fellow Republicans on her bill. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BALDWIN: Please make sure that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan know that you support this important legislation that puts America first. Maybe just send them a tweet. WHITE: Baldwin recorded that video in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., a part of the state President Trump won in 2016. While Baldwin has criticized the tariffs against American allies, she said that tariffs do send a strong message to what she calls bad actors like China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BALDWIN: Tariffs can be useful when they're used in a smart way, a targeted way. And we know that China cheats. WHITE: The two Republicans running to face Baldwin in November are running close to the president on trade. But other Wisconsin Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Governor Scott Walker, oppose the tariffs. They point to the effects for companies like Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson which says it's moving some jobs overseas in response to the tariffs. Dairy and soybean farmers also say they're feeling the pinch. Baldwin has called on the president to do something to support those businesses but sticks by her statement that the U.S. has to be tough on China. She's walking a fine line trying to show voters she can find common ground with the president and hoping it's enough to keep her in office for another six years.

            "article_content": "Tens of millions of Pakistanis are casting votes in the country's national elections. The balloting has been scarred by violence \u2014 including a suicide bombing that killed more than two dozen people.  NOEL KING, HOST: Polls are now closed in Pakistan. Tens of millions of people turned out today to vote in national elections. There was also violence this election day, including a suicide bombing that killed at least 28 people. And there were allegations of election interference. NPR's Diaa Hadid was covering the elections for us from Islamabad. We spoke to her earlier today. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: All right, let's start with this violence today, this suicide bombing. What happened there? HADID: So there was a suicide bombing in Quetta. ISIS claimed responsibility. It seemed to have targeted a police van, and it killed more than 28 people. It wasn't directly related to the elections, but it does reflect how much violence has occurred in the lead-up to these elections that have targeted candidates and their rallies. There was one attack in a provincial town where a suicide bomber killed more than 150 people at an election rally. KING: Wow. So this is an election with certainly a lot going on in the background. Let me ask you about the contest itself. Who are the main candidates in this race? HADID: So there's two main parties, and polls show that they are neck and neck. One is led by a Pakistani sporting legend called Imran Khan, and he's challenging the old ruling party. That's led by a fellow called Nawaz Sharif. Now, Sharif alleges that the military has intervened in the run-up to these elections to curb his party's chances. He's currently in prison right now on a corruption case. And he says that was cooked up to prevent him from campaigning. There's certainly been a crackdown on media seen as sympathetic to the Sharifs. Now, amid these allegations, we've seen more than 300,000 security forces from the army fan out to protect the polling booths. But because of these allegations, Sharif and other parties say the soldiers aren't there to guard the elections, they're there to intimidate voters. KING: Well, you were at a polling station earlier. And I wondered - did you see soldiers? And did people appear to find them threatening? HADID: Right. So we were at a boys' school this morning that's been converted into a polling station. It was down a middle-class street, you know, tree-lined, birds chirping. There were posters neatly pasted explaining to people how to vote. Yes, and inside the polling station, there was an armed guard patrolling the area. And yet, nobody seemed fazed by this. There was also representatives from all the parties who were monitoring the elections. And there were also volunteer election officials. And I spoke to one of them. His name is Mohamed Javed Iqbal. And he was pretty emotional about the whole thing. It's only the second time Pakistan has had a peaceful transition of power between one civilian government to another. And he was just so pleased to be a part of it. MOHAMED JAVED IQBAL: This is my country. I'm working hard for this country. KING: That is a nice thing to hear. Pakistan is also a very conservative country. Did you see women voters out today? HADID: Yeah, I did. They were actually in a separate room. They have gender-segregated polling booths. And the women were neatly lined up. One woman was pushing another woman in a wheelchair. And there was a real sense of excitement in the room. And I spoke to one woman who'd just voted. Her name is Mariyam Farroukh. She's 22 years old. It's the first time she's voted. And she said she voted for Imran Khan's party. It's called the PTI. MARIYAM FARROUKH: Yeah. It's my first time voting. I was very passionate to vote for PTI, so that's why (laughter). I just feel that if Imran Khan is in power, then obviously, education standards of Pakistan will be raised to another level, inshallah. HADID: And just about everyone I spoke to said they were voting for Imran Khan. He's very popular in Islamabad. He's seen as a man that will transform Pakistan. And honestly, people really didn't pay much heed to all the allegations that have marred these elections. KING: NPR's Diaa Hadid in Islamabad covering the elections there. Thank you, Diaa. HADID: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF AUGUST WILHELMSSON'S \"NOW IS THE TIME TO LEAVE\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

London Breed made history Wednesday as the first African-American woman to be elected mayor in San Francisco, the city where she grew up. Ballots were still being counted for more than a week after election day, but her opponent, former state Sen. Mark Leno, conceded the contest. Breed served as Board of Supervisors president for the city. She emphasized her humble beginnings during the campaign. Her grandmother raised her on a shoestring budget in public housing. In a victory speech on the steps of city hall, Breed challenged her supporters to strive for success. \"No matter where you come from, no matter what you decide to do in life, you can do anything you want to do,\" she said. \"Never let your circumstances determine your outcome in life.\" WATCH: Apparent San Francisco Mayor-elect @LondonBreed on being the first African American woman to be elected in the city. https://t.co/663YUoVqxi pic.twitter.com/HNYo8GsQXL Breed will take the reins of a city enjoying a tech boom but suffering its consequences: spiraling real estate prices and a growing homeless population. KQED's Scott Shafer reported that Breed was one of three Democrat candidates for mayor and all three promised to address homelessness. Breed's approach was to clean up the streets, while Leno and city Supervisor Jane Kim emphasized adding more housing and shelters. Leno, 66, would have been the city's first openly gay mayor. The Associated Press reported that Leno said Breed \"is going to do a very fine job. Her success is San Francisco's success.\" In her remarks Wednesday, Breed pledged to serve all of San Francisco. \"I am prepared to do everything I can to work together to bring everyone together for the purposes of solving our most challenging problem,\" Breed said. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Heather Knight noted that Breed's election as a black female mayor is particularly significant because of the city's \"insane cost of living, which has driven out much of the black middle class.\" Breed succeeds the late Mayor Ed Lee, who died of a heart attack in December 2017. She will finish the remainder of his term, which ends in January 2020, and then face re-election. She is the second woman to become mayor of San Francisco. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein first became mayor in 1978.",

            "article_content": "After the nationwide \"March For Our Lives\" demonstrations, and the public discourse that followed, NPR's Michel Martin reflects on the proposal to give teens a say at the ballot box.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Finally, it was a week ago today that hundreds of thousands of kids and teens, along with parents and supporters, converged to express their hurt and rage at the murders of friends and classmates. They were people from middle and upper-middle-class neighborhoods like Parkland, Fla., and Newtown, Conn., who survived shocking spasms of violence that drew the world's attention. And there were kids from very different neighborhoods who spoke of learning to hit the floor before they learned how to read, only to realize, or at least to believe, that few care that they lived that way. What brought them all together, of course, was gun violence and the desire for change. It was called the March for Our Lives. There were actually hundreds of marches, but the Washington, D.C., gathering drew speakers you might recognize - David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez among others. As you probably also know by now, reactions to what they had to say tended to fall into two camps. People who agreed with the teens, applauded them as eloquent, profound, mature beyond their years, and there were people who didn't like what they had to say, some of whom then felt the need to attack them as grandiose, whiny and misinformed. The fact that people didn't agree with their specific ideas - raising the age to buy a long gun to 21, universal background checks, barring civilians from having military-grade weapons or magazines of more than 10 rounds - that was not a surprise. Policies that affect millions of people are meant to be debated, but the furious personal attacks on the teens - well, that was a bit of a shock, to me, anyway. Some commentators went so far as to attack the teens for their hairstyles, their perceived sexual orientations, their college acceptances. Let's not even repeat the total lies made up about them on social media. Now, it seems a bit much to talk about the hairstyle of somebody who had to run out of their school on bloodied floors after 17 people were cut to shreds there, but there you go. I guess conversations about anything difficult in this country have gotten like that. So in the spirit of trying to find something both sides might be able to agree on, how about this - let them vote? Lower the voting age to 16 and let these kids - whiny, mature, brilliant, totally clueless, gun owners, gun haters, whatever they are - be part of the conversation for real? If we're going to treat them like adults, hold them to adult standards, expect them to let total strangers trash them when they think they're wrong, debate them without any regard for their feelings, then how about letting them have some of the responsibilities and rights of adults and participate in shaping the world we live in instead of begging others to do it for them? Now, I can imagine some of the reactions. Some might say, they aren't going to vote. Eighteen to 24-year-olds barely vote now. So what? In a country where only about half the eligible population votes routinely, it's not as though the current voters have covered themselves with glory. Now, some might say teens are too impulsive, too self-centred. They spend too much time on social media, not enough time reading and digging into complex issues. Really? If teens are mature enough to buy weapons - especially military-grade weapons - then why aren't they mature enough to decide who sits on the county council or in Congress? If 16 and 17-year-old people can be brought up on criminal charges as adults, as they can be in most states, then why can't 16 and 17-year-old people be eligible to serve on juries and sit in judgment of those crimes? And if you think this is a ploy to pad the liberal vote, let's not forget that most young, white voters went for Trump. It seems highly likely that plenty of 16-year-old conservatives and gun owners would find their way to the polls too. Let's get real. Decisions about who gets to vote in this country have always been less about fundamental human worth and more about prejudice and power. I was reminded of this when I read Elaine Weiss's fascinating book, \"The Woman's Hour,\" about why it took until 1920 for half the population - i.e., women - to get the right to vote. And that came after a bitter battle with, remarkably, many of the same elements we see today - vicious personal attacks, huge sums of money changing hands, dire consequences predicted. Eighteen-year-olds got the vote in 1971 in large part because of the Vietnam War. The feeling was that if these citizens were old enough to fight and die in Vietnam that they should be part of the conversation about what put them there. Well, teenagers today are dying, and they are fighting. How about letting them fight where it matters - at the ballot box? Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When Koya Graham turned 18, the first thing she did was register to vote. And, year after year, the Cleveland native faithfully voted for Democrats \u2014 that is, until the 2016 presidential election. \"I'm not interested anymore,\" Graham told NPR in the Spring of 2016. \"I don't see any immediate, significant changes happening.\" And Graham was not alone. It's been estimated that millions of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016. A recent analysis in The New York Times puts the exact figure at 4.4 million \u2014 and approximates that an outsized number of those non-voters (36 percent) were black. Black voter turnout fell seven percentage points in the last election, plummeting from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent in 2016, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Many analysts say a natural drop-off was expected in the post-Barack Obama era. But the 2016 voter turnout for African-Americans was not just lower than the Obama years, it was even slightly lower than the 2004 election between George W. Bush and John Kerry. Loading... One key question this political season is whether African-Americans still feel they have a home in the Democratic Party \u2014 a party that has relied on their votes for decades. Graham, now 38, insists she has no regrets for bypassing the election. She said the Trump presidency has kind of turned out to be a blessing in disguise. \"I think for our people, for my people, this is probably the best thing that could have happened,\" she said at a coffee shop in Cleveland. \"The veil has been lifted.\" Graham said the country's underbelly of racism is being exposed. \"We've always had our blinders on ... and even though it's unfortunate where we are now, I'm glad that it has happened because America is being seen for the country that it is.\" Kelton Latson, another non-voter NPR first met in 2016, agrees. \"Now people can wake up,\" he said. \"Black people have been voting for over 50 years, and nothing has ever changed. Our communities still look the same. We're still at the bottom of the economic poll.\" Latson didn't vote in 2016 and said a number of his friends didn't vote either, for similar reasons. The 26-year-old \u2014 who likes to quote Malcolm X and sports the activist's signature style of horn rimmed glasses \u2014 said he has no intention of voting in 2018. He no longer sees voting as an effective way to change the system, he said \u2014 but adds that his apathy toward voting is a personal opinion and perhaps voting works for other people. \"I'm not saying you shouldn't vote,\" Latson said. \"You just need to be more cautious with your vote and stop being willing to just throw a ballot out there off of emotion.\" Kelton Latson, 26, didn't vote for president in 2016 and has no intention of voting in the 2018 election.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Kelton Latson, 26, didn't vote for president in 2016 and has no intention of voting in the 2018 election. Voting \u2014 but still frustrated The frustration isn't limited to non-voters. Even some young African-Americans who cast a ballot in 2016 and are working within traditional party politics say Democrats seem to take black votes for granted. And they're tired of that relationship. \"They just kind of expect us to jump on board,\" said Ifeolu Claytor, a 23-year-old working with the Ohio Young Black Democrats. \"And that's something that needs to change, clearly, cause black millennials will just stay at home. It's not 1980 where people are still kind of fresh, like, 'oh, our parents just got the right to vote.'\" Ifeolu Claytor, 23, (right) and Gabrielle Jackson, 28, (far left) check out a social media voting video on Esosa Osa's phone. All three are members of the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ifeolu Claytor, 23, (right) and Gabrielle Jackson, 28, (far left) check out a social media voting video on Esosa Osa's phone. All three are members of the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats. Claytor also said the party seems too focused on courting middle class white voters. \"Focusing on WASPy [white anglo-saxon protestant], middle class issues is not going to win in 2018 or 2020,\" he said. Claytor added that a lot of black people feel left behind by the Democratic Party: They want to hear more about criminal justice reform and wealth disparity from politicians.  Gabrielle Jackson, the president of the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats, said she understands Claytor's frustration, but that the situation is improving.  \"We've had almost every gubernatorial candidate ... come talk to us about our issues,\" she said. \"[In 2016] Democrats didn't do that. They refused to talk to us in a lot of cases... These people are recognizing that in order to win, you cannot ignore us, and if you do, you will lose.\" Convincing the base Part of voter turnout is about speaking to the issues that matter most to voters. But another key component is mobilization. In both the Virginia gubernatorial race and the Alabama senate race in 2017, black voters were specifically courted and mobilized; and post-election analysis suggests black voters, particularly black women, were key to the Democrats' victories in both states. \"In Alabama, we knocked on about 500,000 doors,\" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a superPAC that worked with partners on the ground to mobilize voters. \"We talked to people on their doors. Both in Alabama and Virginia \u2014 ran canvass programs where people from the community were out talking to their neighbors.\" The lesson from the Alabama mobilization strategy was that you can never have too much voter contact \u2014 organizers contacted voters early and often, they weren't merely dropping off pamphlets three weeks before election day. And a bulk of the outreach was done on a grassroots level. According to Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, Democrats need to critically reconsider whether their traditional mobilization efforts are sufficient. Part of the problem, she said, is that because black voters are considered a base voter for the Democratic party \u2014 meaning there's an assumption that an overwhelming majority of African-Americans will vote Democratic \u2014 they are often overlooked. \"There is a tendency for the Democratic Party to focus on other groups where the margin is actually going to be more narrow,\" Gillespie said. And as a result, Gillespie sees, even loyal Democrats feel there's a tendency to \"paper over\" concerns that matter most to black voters. \"It's not just a 2016 problem. It's not just a 2018 problem,\" she said. \"It is the type of thing that sparked the candidacy of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988... it was the kind of thing that precipitated Maxine Waters threatening to walk out of the DNC in 2000... it was the kind of thing that spurred Al Sharpton's candidacy in 2004.\" There's an assumption that black voters don't need to be persuaded to vote for Democrats. But Shropshire said they do. \"Black voters, in particular, want to understand how Democrats are going to address a whole range of racial justice issues, and so running away from those issues is a non-starter,\" she said. Beyond traditional Democratic policies around the economy and healthcare, some of the voters NPR talked to say they want to hear candidates talking about criminal justice reform or racial tension. \"The anti-Trump sentiment is not enough, we have to tell people what to vote for, who to vote for,\" said Quentin James, founder of Collective PAC, an organization working to get black candidates into elected office. In 2016, despite the dip in turnout, African-Americans still overwhelmingly voted Democrat, so there's no realistic assumption they will shift to the Republican party en masse this November. Shropshire said the fear is that they'll just stay home.",

            "article_content": "Black voter turnout in the last presidential election fell to the lowest rate since 2000. Will 2018 be any different? Young voters and non-voters in Cleveland, Ohio weigh in.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's estimated that millions of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 stayed home during the 2016 presidential election, and many of those nonvoters were black. For this political season, one big question is whether African-Americans still feel like they have a home in the Democratic Party, a party that year after year depends on their votes. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid reports from Cleveland. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: I first met Koya Graham in the spring of 2016 when she told me she had no intention of voting for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) KOYA GRAHAM: I'm not interested anymore. I don't see any immediate significant changes happening. KHALID: When we reconnected at a coffee shop in Cleveland, Graham confirmed she did not vote in 2016. And she says she has no regrets. The Trump presidency has kind of turned out to be a blessing in disguise. GRAHAM: For our people, for my people, this was probably the best thing that could've happened to America. The veil has been lifted. KHALID: Graham says the country's underbelly of racism is being exposed. GRAHAM: I think that we've always had our blinders on. And even though it's unfortunate, you know, where we are right now, I'm glad that it has happened because America is now being seen for the country that it is. KHALID: Many black voters I talked to say they have been loyal Democrats for years, and yet hardly anything has changed in their communities. Ifeolu Claytor is a 23-year-old working with the Ohio Young Black Democrats. And he says his party has taken black votes for granted. IFEOLU CLAYTOR: And that's something that needs to change clearly because black millennials will just stay at home. It's not 1980 where people are still, like, kind of fresh like our parents just got the right to vote. KHALID: Claytor feels like Democrats are too focused on courting middle-class, white voters. CLAYTOR: Focusing on WASPy middle-class issues is not going to win in 2018 or 2020. KHALID: But his friend and fellow Democrat Gabrielle Jackson insists the situation is improving. In 2016, she says some candidates simply refuse to engage with black voters. This year is different. GABRIELLE JACKSON: We've had almost every gubernatorial candidate. We'll have them all by May, by the primary come talk to us about our issues and things that affect them. KHALID: And Jackson says if politicians don't, they shouldn't expect votes. JACKSON: These people are recognizing that in order to win, you cannot ignore us. And if you do, you will lose. KHALID: So turnout is about issues like criminal justice reform, racial tension and wealth disparity. But it's also about mobilization. And recent history shows how dramatically turnout can change when voters are engaged. Look at the elections in Virginia and Alabama last year where black voters, particularly black women, were key. ADRIANNE SHROPSHIRE: In Alabama, we knocked on about 500,000 doors. KHALID: That's Adrianne Shropshire. She leads the group BlackPAC, which was instrumental in the Alabama Senate race. SHROPSHIRE: We talked to people on their doors both in Alabama and in Virginia, ran canvas programs where people from the community were out talking to their neighbors. KHALID: Shropshire's group is trying to make sure the voter drop-off in 2016 doesn't become a permanent trend. But to do that, Democrats need to make a persuasive argument. SHROPSHIRE: Black voters in particular want to understand how Democrats are going to address a whole range of racial justice issues. And so sort of running away from those issues is a nonstarter. KHALID: In the 2016 election, black voter turnout plummeted from 2012 and 2008. It even dipped slightly lower than the Bush-Kerry election of 2004. Black voters are base voters in the Democratic Party, and so Shropshire says there's really no fear they're going to shift to Republicans this November. The fear is that they'll just stay home.

            "article_content": "In a special election, voters in Pennsylvania's 18th district will go to the polls next week to vote for their next representative in Congress.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: In a special election, voters in Pennsylvania's 18th District will go to the polls in nine days to choose their new member of Congress. Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone are facing off under huge national scrutiny as each party is looking to this election to gauge how voters are feeling ahead of the November midterms. Our host Lulu traveled to the district earlier this week and sat down with the few voters there. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: We're gathered around a long table in the kitchen of David Podurgiel's suburban home. He works for a big coal company overseeing tugboats that ply the rivers. Dave, who goes by the nickname Pod, voted for President Trump and is supporting Rick Saccone. For him, this election is about the economy. DAVID PODURGIEL: I mean, I see myself as a fiscal conservative. And I think he follows along those lines. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Across the table is Rosie (ph) Bigley. She's been a nurse for 38 years. ROSEMARY BIGLEY: Medical care needs to be available to everybody, whether you can really afford it or not. And I believe that Conor Lamb really supports that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Susanna DeJeet retired after a long career in social services and education. She's a staunch Republican, and she's focused on three main issues. SUSANNA DEJEET: Our national security. It's our economy. And then I have to say health care, too. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Steelworker Jojo Burgess is a union steward. He's African-American, and he is supporting Conor Lamb. JOJO BURGESS: I look at the issues as it comes to working people and poor people. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I'm going to ask you a little bit about some of the motivating factors of what you think Pennsylvania and this part of Pennsylvania needs right now. PODURGIEL: The industry I'm in, the coal industry - there was a war on coal from the previous administration, OK? It hurt the coal companies. It hurt the steelworkers - no denying that. The coal miner and the related industries have been forgotten about. I think we need somebody in there that doesn't forget about the rural areas. DEJEET: I'm not sure if we're any different here than we are across the states, where people are concerned about the economy and jobs. And President Trump - he's bringing back the jobs. He's reducing the regulations. Jobs have increased in the United States. That's not just here. That was across the nation, which is why Trump won and which is why we want to keep that agenda moving forward. It's all about agenda and policies. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How do you see it? BURGESS: I'd like to respond to that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Please. BURGESS: And I'm going to respond like this. We keep hearing about this war on coal. And I think - and this is from someone that has had uncles that had been in the mines and have relatives that have been in the mines - the war on coal is not from the government. It's because there's cleaner forms of energy that can produce and do the same things. With environmental standards being the way they are - because let's face it. While some people may not believe about the global warming and different effects on the environment that different things have, it's real. It's real. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to move on just for a minute because I'd like to get your point of view specifically on the issue that motivates you, which is health care. Is this the issue that you feel that is the most important here in Pennsylvania? BIGLEY: It is health care. And it's also getting some new blood into government - someone who is willing to, you know, work across the aisle. Falsely, Conor Lamb was tightly linked with Nancy Pelosi, which is not true. He has said it's time for a lot of these longtime career politicians - give it a rest. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's talk a little bit about Donald Trump because he does loom very large over the political landscape at this time. I'd like to know what your views are of the president? BIGLEY: My views are every time I see Donald Trump, or he opens his mouth, I cringe. It floors me - his lack of empathy. I don't think he can identify with middle-class, lower-middle-class people who have suffered major personal losses. DEJEET: No matter what the man does - if he cures cancer, he's going to be tagged for something he said on Twitter. Meanwhile, if you can't see him as a compassionate person, I want you to understand that the whole reason he gave up his fortune and his lifestyle to run for the office was to make sure that the average working person got to keep more of what they earned instead of seeing it go to big business. That's why he won. BURGESS: Let's just be serious here. DEJEET: OK. BURGESS: There's one reason why Donald Trump won this election - because he made middle-aged, white America feel like they were victims of something. This president is racist. He's made many racial statements. And that's not mainstream media. That's his Twitter account. That's his call. The NFL players - that's predominately black - son of a B's. If you look at the voting on how he carried this country - not just the state, this country - middle-aged males in particular showed up and voted. And that's where he won this race at. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you see? PODURGIEL: First, I don't believe he's a racist. That's a media thing. I mean, he has one of the largest corporations in the world. And he employs whites, blacks, Hispanics, gays. If he was a racist, he wouldn't be hiring all these people, OK? So I don't believe that. I just - it drives me crazy how people try to pin that on him. But I could tell you from my employees - I have both represented employees, meaning union, and I have nonrepresented. Every one of them voted Donald Trump. And I can tell you right now two weeks ago, every one of them came in and says, hey, Pod. That's my nickname. I'm sorry. He said, Pod, my God, my paycheck was up. Thank you. I said, don't thank me. I mean, the president did his tax cut. So what I like so far - I don't want him to be presidential. He's a businessman, OK? When we were coming out of the recession, just think if the previous administration did some tax cuts, you know, instead of taxing us more. And Trump came in and did it. And it just - I see there's this confidence being admitted by everybody. BURGESS: Can I ask Pod a question? What is the demographics of your workers that you have there that all voted for Donald Trump? PODURGIEL: It's very mixed. I have female deckhands. BURGESS: OK. PODURGIEL: I have... BURGESS: Are any of them black or Latinos or anything that voted for Donald Trump? PODURGIEL: Yes. One of my best captains is an African-American. So I have very mixed... BURGESS: OK. And he voted for Trump? PODURGIEL: Yes. BURGESS: OK. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to ask you this because it is such a - and as you can see through the conversation, it is a tense time when we talk about politics. People's views are so very different at this moment. Have you sat around a table before and had these kinds of conversations with people with different views? Do you have these conversations here in Pennsylvania because there is such a diversity? BIGLEY: I'm a nurse. My group is a very small, close-knit, specialized group of nurses. So we interact like this around a table frequently. And I guess I was surprised prior to the last election how many were voting for Donald Trump. And when we sit around and talk now - and I work with men and women - 3 out of the 4 that voted for Donald Trump wish they could take their vote back. When you said, I'm sorry that he gave up his job. He didn't give it up. It's just sitting over here, being managed by somebody else. As soon as he's out of the presidency, he's going right back to making money. And I'm sorry - the economy is a big issue. But it's not the only issue. There are many other issues besides, how much money am I going to get in my pocket? And a lot of people view it that way. What is this president going to do for me? - not our country, not our region. For me. They couldn't see past themselves. DEJEET: Well, if someone votes simply on personal issues, how he treats his wife, how he doesn't treat his wife, they will be disappointed at some point here or there. But if you vote on the policies, then I think that you tend to regret your vote less as long as your candidate goes in and does what they're saying they're going to do. So it was the policies that won. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What should people outside of this area know about what is important to the people of Pennsylvania and the people in your district? PODURGIEL: I think the big thing that's important to people is integrity. I want to give a quick example. I had a chance to meet him last week - Conor Lamb. And in an open forum, just like we have - are having here. And I said, will, you support coal you go against your party and support coal? And he says, I'm going to support energy. That's the political answer for saying, no, I'm going to go with my party. And that, to me - that's about integrity. That's about - you know, I would've been happy with an answer of no. And I think that's what people in this area - you know, it's blue collar around here. I'm blue collar. You know, and people are looking at that part of life. Just, like, can we trust them somebody - somebody that we're going to trust that's going to take care of us, that's at our level. And it's something you see with Rick Saccone. BURGESS: You talk about Conor Lamb's integrity because of the answer that he gave you. Have you ever reversed that question to ask Rick Saccone, would you go against your party and vote for what's right versus party lines? He has a voting record. You could check to see what the answer to that is. Conor Lamb's a fresh face in this in this race. Conor Lamb, while he's running as a Democrat, I believe has the common person in mind. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So no one changed their minds at the table. And at times, it did get heated. But when I used the word contentious to describe their interaction, they all jumped in to correct me. Jojo then summed it up. BURGESS: We all have different views. But guess what? We're all human beings. And if you want a right as a human being, you can be different, but you can still respect people as being a human being and understand their point of view. And I think that's why dialogue like this is good. But at the end of the day, I appreciate Pod having us in his house. I think that it's a very lovely home. And, hey, I don't have no ill feelings towards their support, which - I hope they don't have it towards mine. But guess what? People are different. And that's why this country's great. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Jojo Burgess, Susanna DeJeet, Rosie Bigley and David Podurgiel. And I'm Lulu Garcia-Navarro in Western Pennsylvania. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(CHEERING, APPLAUSE) PENCE: ...Rick Saccone? KELLY: It's the latest race that is making the GOP nervous. Republicans won the district handily in 2016. But this time around, Democrats think they have a shot. NPR's Scott Detrow reports. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District shouldn't be a close race. The southwest corner of the state has elected Republicans by wider and wider margins in recent years. President Trump won nearly 60 percent of the vote here in 2016, helping him become the first Republican to carry Pennsylvania since 1988. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Thanks to all of you, on a November night in 2016, this president turned the blue wall red. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) DETROW: And yet, Vice President Mike Pence is campaigning here, and Trump was here two weeks ago. Ray Zaborney is a Republican strategist who's run a lot of races in western Pennsylvania. He blames the broader political dynamics for the fact the race looks relatively tight. RAY ZABORNEY: Democrats are enthusiastic to get out and vote against Republicans, at least some Democrats. And I think you see just natural increases in turnout. DETROW: That's even more the case in special elections where turnout is lower. It's why Democrats cut deep into the usual Republican victory margins in all of last year's special House races, though they didn't flip any of them. So Republicans like Saccone are sticking to a pretty basic message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SACCONE: Don't forget about that date now, March 13. DETROW: And outside conservative groups are pouring millions of dollars into TV ads. Still, Democrat Conor Lamb's campaign is outraising Saccone's. The young first-time candidate comes from a prominent local political family and has an appealing resume. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: He grew up here, went to Central Catholic, then college and law school, served four years in the Marines, still loves to shoot, became a federal prosecutor. DETROW: Democrat Bill DeWeese represented the southern part of the district in the statehouse for decades before resigning after a corruption conviction. He thinks Lamb's moderate profile gives him a real chance of winning. BILL DEWEESE: They will not be able to talk about him being anti-gun. They will not be able to wrap Mrs. Pelosi around him in some concocted TV commercial. DETROW: Lamb has said he would not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader. That hasn't stopped the TV ads. SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: How do we know Conor Lamb will join Pelosi's liberal flock? He already has. Lamb joined Pelosi to oppose a middle-class tax cut, calling your tax cut crumbs. DETROW: Amid all that, Lamb's campaign is playing it cautiously. You'll notice he's not in this story. Lamb has been shy with the press. The campaign said Lamb did not have any public events yesterday. But hours later, he posted pictures on Twitter with Massachusetts Congressman Joe Kennedy speaking to a full room of supporters. Republicans are nervous enough that Pence was here today and the president is expected to come back before the election. So much White House involvement could make it look like Republicans are seriously concerned. Zaborney doesn't see it that way. ZABORNEY: We have a race. It's probably closer than we'd want it to be, and that's probably how it'll end. But we take it seriously. And obviously you leave everything on the field. So having the president, vice president go as a precaution - that is a luxury to be able to take on a special election that's the only thing happening right now. DETROW: The GOP can focus on this race and probably do the damage control needed to keep it red. Republican's broader concern - what will happen later this year when voters in dozens of districts more competitive than this one are all heading to the polls on the same day.

            "article_content": "Russia protesters demonstrated Sunday against the upcoming presidential election that they say is rigged in President Putin's favor. Police detained the opposition leader who sparked the protests.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And we\u2019re turning now to Russia where there were large anti-government protests on Sunday. Thousands of people were marching across the country, calling for boycotts of the presidential election in March. Now, leading these protests was Alexei Navalny. He\u2019s one of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s biggest critics. During the protests yesterday, he was arrested, along with some 200 other people. And let\u2019s talk about this with NPR\u2019s Lucian Kim, who is joining us from Moscow. Hi, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So start, if you can, with reminding us how these protests came together in the first place. KIM: Well, Alexei Navalny, who has now become Russia's most prominent opposition leader, was denied registration as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election, and that's after spending more than a year campaigning. So he called for a boycott. He said, by participating, people are supporting what are, in fact, unfair elections. GREENE: So he's arrested almost from the moment he shows up at the - at a rally in Moscow. What happens to him now if he's in custody? KIM: Well, that's right. He was kind of bundled into a police bus almost the moment he showed up at the Moscow rally. He was later released. No charges have been brought against him yet, but it's likely he will face charges of organizing an illegal rally. I think just as dramatic is that police yesterday were breaking into the offices of his anti-corruption foundation. That's where they were broadcasting live on YouTube from around Russia's regions. But this had actually already happened before, so by the time the police got there, they were just broadcasting from an alternative, secret location. GREENE: OK, so Navalny has a presence on YouTube and social media. He's got, like, a sizable following. He's sending a message that people should boycott this election in March, but does any of this pose a threat to Vladimir Putin? KIM: Well, you know, state media pretends that none of this is happening. Vladimir Putin even refuses to mention Navalny's name in public. But it's important to note that Navalny does still represent a pretty narrow demographic - it's urban, young, educated, middle class. But I think the Kremlin thinks that there's a danger that this - that Navalny's movement could really snowball if there is some kind of catalyst. The economy is still limping along, poverty is quite widespread, and there's a lot of discontent with corruption. GREENE: OK, so the Kremlin is taking the opposition movement seriously. I mean, it's not just something that can be ignored. KIM: Well, they're acting like they're ignoring it, but it's clear from the way that they're reacting that, you know, it has spread some reason for concern. GREENE: OK. Speaking to NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim a day after protests in Moscow, during which Alexei Navalny, the young opposition leader, was arrested. And we'll be following this story as we head towards the presidential elections in March. Lucian, thanks. KIM: Thanks, David. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The protests that began last week in Iran are different from most unrest that has previously roiled the country since its 1979 revolution. They have covered more geography, engulfing small and midsize cities across the country. But they also have reportedly drawn smaller turnouts than the massive 2009 election protests in Tehran. Although more information is needed about the makeup of the demonstrators, significant differences have emerged. Iranian reformists and middle-class residents in large urban areas are reported to have largely steered clear this time around. Economic protests are not rare in Iran. When they occur it's usually in response to a specific government action. For example, Mashhad, the northeastern city where the latest demonstrations began, was rocked by protests and riots in 1992 after authorities tried to demolish homes built without permits in a squatter area on the city's periphery. Several police officers were killed, government buildings destroyed, hundreds were arrested and at least four protesters were executed. Then there was the 1994 protests in Qazvin, northwest Iran. That was triggered when the Iranian parliament's narrowly rejected legislation to create a new province with the city of Qazvin as its capital. But, like in Islamshahr, the structural adjustment policies of then-President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and high inflation were broader underlying factors. Qazvin did become a province a couple of years later. In 1995, protests in the squatter settlements of Islamshahr, on the southwestern outskirts of Tehran, were set off by an increase in public transportation costs. The domestic security forces of the Revolutionary Guard cracked down after protesters took over government and law enforcement buildings. It is not known how many people were killed. The latest protests are different in that they are spread out and simultaneous, probably thanks to the existence of social media and not necessarily in reaction to particular triggers specific to the cities involved. (Although, in Kermanshah, an inept government response to a recent earthquake may have been a delayed trigger.) The wider spread and simultaneity of the latest protests have led some outside observers, perhaps dreaming of regime change, to overlook key elements. The most significant missing element is the reported lack of a middle-class presence in protests within large urban areas. Many of these folks were key participants in the 2009 protests and, a few years later, instrumental in President Hassan Rouhani's election. The economic and political centrality of cities like Tehran, Tabriz and Isfahan makes their presence critical for a broad-based challenge of central authority. It's not that the many segments of the Iranian middle class are content with current conditions in Iran, the government or regime. Rather, they are ambivalent about the drivers behind the protests and implications for their personal security. Also missing is organizational leadership. This is partly due to the suppression of independent labor and nongovernmental organizations, which could provide conduits for citizens to air their grievances and demands to the government. To be sure, citizens have been encouraged to protest against the regime by certain leaders in exile \u2014 at least, until social media platforms such as Telegram were blocked. One of the most vocal advocates is Reza Pahlavi, the Washington-based son of the former shah of Iran. Another is Maryam Rajavi, the Saudi-funded, Paris-based head of a controversial Iranian resistance group called Mujahedeen-e-Khalq. But the latter is loathed inside Iran way more than the regime, and the former has failed to create and lead a viable and unified opposition outside of Iran. In any case, as a recent Iranian joke put it, \"Iran already has one shah!\" Because the call for wholesale regime change largely comes from the outside, and without any linkages to the struggle for reform inside Iran, the country's reformist movement has distanced itself from the protests rather than try to give them direction and organization. None of the above is to suggest the demonstrations are without impact. The protests came suddenly and are a reminder of how quickly Iranian protests can get out of control, turn into international events and challenge the legitimacy of the whole national system. Unless the country's divided and discordant leadership can reach a consensus on changing the ways of the Islamic Republic, allowing independent organizations to form and effectively articulate the demands of the variegated society, Iran's leaders will be playing with fire, endangering the country's stability and security. It really doesn't matter if these protests are encouraged by \"enemies of Iran,\" as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested this week. The responsibility that encouragements to take to the streets succeeded inside Iran falls squarely on the shoulders of the Islamic Republic.

Once again, Medicare is moving front and center in this fall's campaigns. Throughout the election season, Democrats have been criticizing Republicans over votes and lawsuits that would eliminate insurance protections for pre-existing conditions for consumers. But now Republicans are working to change the health care conversation with a tried-and-true technique used by both parties over the years: telling seniors their Medicare coverage may be in danger. It's not yet clear, however, whether these dependable voters are responding to the warning. Republicans charge that Democrats' support for expanding Medicare would threaten the viability of the program for the seniors who depend on it. \"The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised,\" President Trump wrote in a guest column for USA Today on Oct. 10. \"Under the Democrats' plan, today's Medicare would be forced to die.\" The column was filled with false and unsubstantiated claims, as NPR's Scott Horsley reported. In a speech to the National Press Club on Oct. 8, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said almost exactly the same thing. \"Democrats call it 'Medicare-for-all' because it sounds good, but in reality, it actually ends Medicare in its current form,\" Ryan said. It's a sentiment being expressed by Republicans up and down the ballot. In New Jersey, where Republican Assemblyman Jay Webber is running for an open U.S. House seat, he enlisted his elderly father in one of his ads. After the candidate notes that his opponent is \"interested\" in Medicare-for-all, Webber's father, Jim Webber, says, \"That would end Medicare as we know it.\" Fact-checkers have repeatedly challenged these claims. Health insurance analyst Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute told PolitiFact that suggesting Medicare-for-all would disrupt current enrollees' coverage is a \"horrible mischaracterization of the proposal.\" Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" column noted that a leading proposal \"in theory would expand benefits for seniors.\" And Democrats are far from united on the topic of expanding Medicare, but that is not preventing Republicans from suggesting that they are. In New Jersey, Webber's Democratic opponent, Mikie Sherrill, is actually not one of the many Democrats who have specifically endorsed the idea of \"Medicare-for-all.\" The reason Republicans are pushing the Medicare issue this fall, says Harvard public health professor and polling expert Robert Blendon, is because \"people over 60 are very high-turnout voters,\" particularly in nonpresidential election years like 2018. (Blendon works with NPR on polls conducted in collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.) Issues involving Medicare and Social Security can motivate those older voters even more, says Blendon, \"because they are so dependent on [those programs] for the rest of their lives. Retirees are very scared about outliving their benefits.\" Medicare is often a rallying cry for politicians from both parties during elections. In 1996, Democrats in general and President Bill Clinton in particular campaigned on the early GOP attempts to rein in Medicare spending. Republicans coined the term \"Mediscare\" to describe Democrats' attacks. But in the 2010 midterm contests, Republicans went on the attack. Just after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans zoomed in on the billions of dollars in Medicare payment reductions imposed on health providers to help pay for the rest of the law, sparking protests against Democrats around the country. Later, after Republicans regained control of the House in that election, Ryan, then head of the House Budget Committee, opted to call for a repeal of everything in the ACA except the Medicare reductions the GOP had so strongly campaigned against in 2010. This year, the Democrats are hammering back, noting that both Trump and the GOP Congress have proposed more cuts to Medicare and that under Republican leadership, the insolvency date of the Medicare trust fund has gotten closer. \"First they passed a tax bill that gave a huge windfall to corporations and the wealthy, despite warnings from nonpartisan scorekeepers that it would explode the deficit,\" said a statement from Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \"Then, before the ink was even dry the knives came out for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\" Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow has suggested that the administration will push for larger entitlement cuts in 2019. For his part, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in an interview with Bloomberg News, blamed higher deficit numbers on Medicare and other entitlement programs rather than the GOP's tax cuts from 2017. \"We can't sustain the Medicare we have at the rate we're going, and that's the height of irresponsibility,\" he said. Despite the coordinated talking points, it is unclear whether this year's GOP attacks on Democrats over Medicare will work. That is not just because Democrats have ammunition to throw back, but also because seniors don't seem particularly threatened by the idea that expanding insurance to others could jeopardize their own coverage. In a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in September 2017, seniors were no more likely than younger respondents to say they thought health care costs, quality and availability would get worse if the U.S. instituted a national health plan. Fewer than a third of respondents overall, as well as those 65 and older, said they thought national health insurance would worsen their own coverage. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) In addition, pollster Geoff Garin, president of Hart Research, said in a conference call with reporters Oct. 15 that the attacks on \"Medicare-for-all\" are not showing up in polls yet. But he said he's skeptical of how much impact they could have. \"The basic idea of expanded health care in America is generally pretty popular,\" he said. Still, Harvard's Blendon says he understands why Republicans are trying: \"Seniors are critical for Republicans to maintain their majority.\" Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders insists Democrats' takeover of the House of Representatives and other key wins are a vindication of the progressive posture he's long advocated for. \"Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum ran brilliant campaigns. Created enormous excitement at the grassroots level, and were running in states that are tough states for Democrats,\" Sanders told NPR. (Abrams has not conceded in the Georgia gubernatorial race, Gillum initially conceded his race for governor late Tuesday night but his campaign is now suggesting they may await a possible Florida recount.) In an earlier interview with the Daily Beast, Sanders appeared to have placed part of the blame for Gillum and Abrams' apparent losses on the fact that neither state had ever elected an African-American governor. \"You know there are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American.\" Sanders' spokesman insists those remarks were taken out of context. Speaking to NPR, Sanders said any votes Gillum or Abrams lost over their race were entirely due to what he called \"racist\" campaigns run by their Republican opponents. \"There's no question that in Georgia and in Florida racism has reared its ugly head. And you have candidates who ran against Gillum and ran against Stacey Abrams who were racist and were doing everything they could to try to play whites against blacks,\" he said. \"And that is an outrage, and we have got to continue doing everything that we can to fight all forms of racism.\" Gillum's campaign repeatedly pointed to what they deemed racist statements by Rep. Ron DeSantis and his supporters, a charge DeSantis vehemently denied. In a memorable moment, Gillum turned to DeSantis during a debate and said, \"I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist.\" As Sanders surveys Tuesday's results, the once-and-possibly future presidential candidate says the most telling Democratic victories came in the Midwest. \"Trump became president because he lost the popular vote, but he won the Electoral College in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Well, three out of four of those states elected Democratic governors, and all four of those states elected Democratic United States Senators,\" Sanders said. \"So I think Trump's victories in those very important states may not be longstanding.\" Several Democratic leaders are reading the party's major gains in the House and reclaiming of governorships and other key posts as an endorsement of moderation. Many of the Democrats who flipped suburban Republican-held House seats shied away from the no-holds-barred assault on President Trump that so much of the Democratic base has gravitated to over the past two years. Sanders, who won another Senate term Tuesday running as an independent, clearly disagrees with that assessment. \"Democrats are fighting back because many of those Democrats are now running on progressive agendas.\" \"When the freshman class in Congress takes office in January it is going to be the most progressive freshman class in the modern history of this country,\" he said. \"You're going to have many people there who won elections based on the fight for Medicare-for-all, based on raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, based on making sure we lower the cost of prescription drugs.\" Sanders certainly isn't a disinterested observer on the question of whether or not the Democratic Party's future lies in bold progressive or strategically moderate positioning. Despite never joining the party, he finished second in its 2016 presidential primaries, and is considering whether or not to try again in 2020. Like many other possible 2020 candidates, Sanders made sure to include key primary and caucus states like Iowa and South Carolina on his travel itinerary in the final weeks of the midterms. Sanders bristled at the widely-accepted idea that the 2020 primary is already underway. \"Never-ending elections,\" he said, \"are very unfair to the American people who get a little bit sick and tired of that.\" But with the Democratic field expected to be well into the double digits, Sanders acknowledged he won't be able to wait as long as he'd like to announce a run. \"I'm going to have to make a decision in the not-too-distant future,\" he said, \"But I think we have a few months to make that decision.\"",

The Affordable Care Act faces a new legal challenge after a federal judge in Texas ruled the law unconstitutional on Friday. The decision risks throwing the nation's health care system into turmoil should it be upheld on appeal. But little will be different in the meantime. \"Nothing changes for now,\" says Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent of Kaiser Health News. \"If you need to sign up for health insurance you should,\" Rovner tells NPR's Michel Martin. \"If you're in one of the several states where it's extended where you can sign up through January, you have time to do that too.\" Below are some questions and answers about the ACA. 1. What was the Texas ruling? U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act was not constitutional. O'Connor made his decision after 18 Republican state attorneys general and two GOP governors brought their case, Rovner reports. They claimed that the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 because it included an individual mandate \u2014 or a tax penalty for Americans who did not buy health insurance. After Congress repealed the individual mandate in 2017, O'Connor said the rest of the law fell apart. 2. Who might this ruling affect? The Affordable Care Act runs for more than 1,000 pages and includes many provisions \u2014 the exchanges for individuals that are frequently political footballs \u2014 and a long list of other measures and protections designed to expand insurance coverage. NPR's Alison Kodjak reports that the ACA expanded Medicaid, which has allowed more than 10 million people to get coverage in states that chose to expand the program. The law also protects people with pre-existing conditions and allows people up to age 26 to be covered under their parents' insurance; requires calorie counts at restaurants and gives protections to lactating mothers. The ACA also secured more money for Native American health care and made significant changes to allow for generic drugs and to provide funding for Medicare. Rovner says people should act as if the ACA is still in place, but the ruling opens a possibility for \"an enormous disruption.\" \"It would really plunge the nation's health care system into chaos,\" Rovner says. \"The federal government wouldn't be able to pay for Medicare because all the Medicare payments have been structured because of the Affordable Care Act.\" 3. What next? Judge O'Connor did not rule the law has to be enjoined immediately. Saturday was the last day of open enrollment for the ACA in most states. NPR's Kodjak reports people can still enroll in health plans in states with extended deadlines. She says even the newest ACA insurance policies will go into effect until more legal action plays out in courts. The federal site for insurance, Healthcare.gov, is running a banner that reads, \"Court's decision does not affect 2019 enrollment coverage.\" NPR's Kodjak says the state of California has already said it will appeal the ruling. Other states will likely join California in the fight to preserve the law, Kodjak reports. Rovner says the case will probably reach the Supreme Court, though lower courts may reject O'Conner's ruling first. 4. What are the political stakes in this decision? The political stakes are great. Voters saw health care as an important issue in November's midterm elections. Kodjak notes Congress voted multiple times in 2017 to repeal the ACA but did not succeed. \"Lots of Republicans were running ads during the midterms saying they were the ones who were going to protect people's health care, and specifically protect people with pre-existing conditions,\" Kodjak says. The challenge to the ACA brought by Republican attorneys general is aimed at eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions, Kodjak says. \"So now you have Republicans trying to play both sides, which is going to be difficult,\" she says.",

            "article_content": "Two Years in the Resistance by Bernie Sanders Hardcover, 270 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Bernie Sanders will not say he is running for president. Instead, he employs a familiar dodge: \"The year 2020 remains a long way off.\" But Where We Go From Here is unmistakably a campaign book, which means that, like almost all campaign books, it is boring. Many campaign books are ghostwritten and scraped free of controversy and doubts; these are not books in any meaningful sense of the word, but tools to generate publicity and \"Is he or isn't he running?\" speculation in the press. Why anyone would read one of these when they could be reading a book about good-looking British detectives, or ghosts, or rockets, is beyond me. But here we are: 2020 is looming, contenders are ramping up their campaigns, and the season for glossy hardbacks full of declarative sentences, false modesty, and Abraham Lincoln quotes is upon us. Where We Go From Here is slightly more interesting than most campaign books because Bernie Sanders is slightly more interesting than most candidates for president: He won 13 million votes in the 2016 presidential election as a self-identified democratic socialist, pushing Medicare for all, a higher minimum wage, prison reform, free public universities, campaign finance reform, and ending unnecessary foreign interventions. \"At a time of massive and growing income and wealth inequality,\" he writes, \"as our nation moves closer and closer to an oligarchic form of society, we need an unprecedented grassroots political movement to stand up to the greed of the billionaire class and the politicians they own.\" And, the longest serving Independent in Senate history, he is happy to criticize Democrats, whom he sees as ineffective and easily cowed, alongside Republicans, who he sees as morally compromised by their donors. Chapters are structured like diary entries spaced over the last two years, which he has spent visiting 32 states to advance progressive candidates and position. A standard entry will describe his platform and quote a previous speech at length, with some notes about audience size \u2014 he has an almost Trumpian interest in crowd sizes \u2014 and then finish with a vague injunction to unity or progress. One of the book's most striking features is his disdain for what he calls \"the corporate media.\" He is careful to distinguish his criticism from Donald Trump's: \"Unlike Trump, I do not believe that the mainstream media is 'fake news' or an 'enemy of the people,'\" he writes. \"I don't believe that most reporters carry a grudge and intentionally try to destroy politicians. I do believe, however, as I have said many times, that for obvious reasons, multinational conglomerates that own our media are not interested in analyzing the power of big-money interests, or the needs of working families.\" For any legitimate outlet, allowing funders to dictate coverage in any way is a huge ethical breach. It's irresponsible of Sanders, who surely knows how media works, to suggest that reporters tweak their stories to please \"big-money interests.\" He also often accuses the media of not covering issues that they cover extensively, from climate change to healthcare to the Koch brothers \u2014 Sanders writes that the media has \"zero interest in what they stand for,\" despite the amount of great reporting on their agenda from journalists such as Jane Mayer at The New Yorker. His disdain, if more nuanced than Trump's, is hardly less self defeating, and at a certain point it begins to feel like what he is actually bothered by is the media's failure to cover his campaign as he would like it to be, rather than as it actually is. He is annoyed, for instance, by a New York Times article that suggested some of his political proteges wouldn't win their primary races. He points to the victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 whom he did not even endorse in the primary \u2014 and sneers, \"No doubt the New York Times was disappointed.\" Otherwise, Where We Go From Here is just what you might expect. His platforms are presented but not interrogated. There are stances, but few real questions and little self-reflection. But light deception, overblown rhetoric, and the urge to find blame everywhere but in your own campaign are not unique to Sanders: they are hallmarks of this genre. Sanders often works to counter perceptions that he is an extremist. But whether or not he is a political radical, on the page, Sanders is textbook.",

            "article_content": "Over the past week, politically tinged violence, such as the killings in Pittsburgh, have dominated headlines. How will those stories impact turnout and voters' decisions in the midterm elections?  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: To help put recent events in a political context, NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is with us now. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Ari. SHAPIRO: We heard a few people there saying the events of the last week made them more inspired to get out and exercise their right to vote. What are the chances that the opposite could also happen? MONTANARO: I mean, sure, you know, the ugliness of politics and how that's affected whether people see politics as something that solves problems, you know, that's something that can really make people feel disaffected and stay home sometimes. You know, here's an example of how that's actually put into practice in a campaign. It's exactly why negative ads are run by superPACs and outside groups. You know, when these candidates are down in races, they blanket the airwaves with these things, and that can actually suppress the vote. SHAPIRO: Candidates across the country are making their closing arguments right now. Have these events been shaping those arguments? MONTANARO: You know, the fundamentals of this election have been clear for two years and have not really changed very much. You know, we talk a lot about some of these events and rightfully so, you know, and these - you know, people are fighting for the last headline. But when I talk to Democratic and Republican strategists today who are working with these campaigns, they said this - for Democrats, it's about finishing how you started. They spent the entire election talking about affordable health care pre-existing conditions, and they want to drive a truck through as what one strategist called the Republican tax cut scam that wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On the other hand, Republicans are saying the message on pre-existing conditions, sure, it's effective, but they think it's going to be more about immigration and dysfunction. You know, they said if they make it about sanctuary cities and abolishing ICE, they think that's good for them, and it's a message that they've been pushing all along. It's not something that just popped up. Now, on dysfunction, they concede that people say they want a check and balance, but they are trying to argue is the check and balance you want that when it comes to Democrats. SHAPIRO: Of course, President Trump is not on the ballot, but he is on the campaign trail and on a lot of people's minds. Does he seem to be a plus or a minus for the midterm elections for Republicans right now? MONTANARO: Well, it depends on which election you're talking about, right? In the Senate, probably he is because the landscape in the Senate just favors Republicans so strongly, you know, in places like Indiana, West Virginia, Tennessee and Texas where Republicans really should do well, and they need that base to come out. But in places like Arizona and Nevada, it's not really clear that he is, and, you know - and Democrats really need their base out there, and they're happy to let President Trump talk and what they think is suppress vote among some of his base but also hurt with independents, you know. But the fact is Republicans are in a vice overall. Even in the House, they need Trump's base, but he turns off independents and women in the suburbs. And that really hurts them down ballot in those key, key House races. SHAPIRO: I also want to ask you about young voters because traditionally the midterm voter has been a little bit older than the voter in a presidential year. But this year, we saw huge youth marches against gun violence. Do you think that we're going to see a different kind of turnout next week? MONTANARO: Well, look; we're expecting to see record turnout, you know, something that could be the highest turnout in the last 50 years or so. So that could really fundamentally reshape what we're talking about here. At the same time, younger voters are still lagging behind some of those other groups, older, white voters in particular who still say that they're fired up, that they want to go vote. You know, they don't traditionally turn out in big numbers in midterms. You know, what kind - you know, what kind of effect does this discussion of civility have on them? I mean, on the one hand, many young voters in particular are disaffected with politics, but you see millennials kind of take matters into their own hands with, like, online fundraising for causes that are important to them. On the other, we saw, you know, young voters really get involved and animated speaking out on gun violence after Parkland. So, you know, do they turn out for that? SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

On a blustery fall afternoon in Jay, Maine, Jared Golden stands at the gate of the Verso Paper Mill shaking hands with workers at the end of their shift.  The workers \u2014 mostly men, wearing steel-toe boots, some still in their safety goggles \u2014 greet him politely before rushing off to their waiting pickups. Golden, 36, is a slender and soft-spoken state lawmaker. But his appearance is deceiving. Under his flannel shirtsleeves are some serious tattoos, acquired during his stint as a Marine infantryman with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Golden is the Democratic candidate for Maine's 2nd Congressional District seat, a district President Trump won in 2016, but which is now seen as a toss-up \u2014 one of many that Democrats hope to flip on Election Day in their effort to win control of the House of Representatives. It's not an impossible dream.  The 2nd District was held by Democrats for 20 years before Republican Bruce Poliquin won it in 2014.  And before Trump, it had been won by Democratic presidential candidates since Bill Clinton in 1992. The 2nd District, geographically the largest congressional district east of the Mississippi River, stretches across a vast swath of the state, with deeply wooded forests and small fishing villages. Mostly rural, it's not just the Maine of lobsters and lighthouses, but more hardscrabble with shuttered mills and one of the worst opioid problems in the nation. Democrat Jared Golden shakes hands with a worker outside the Verson Paper Mill in Jay, Maine.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Naylor/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Jared Golden shakes hands with a worker outside the Verson Paper Mill in Jay, Maine. In an interview at a nearby hospital where he met with administrators, Golden, like Democrats across the nation, calls health care his \"No. 1 issue.\"  He cites Poliquin's 2017 vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He says the GOP's proposed replacement contained \"very deep cuts to Medicaid,\" a program that Maine voted to expand (although those expansion efforts have been blocked by the state's outgoing GOP Gov. Paul LePage.) Golden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age 55 and believes there should eventually be universal coverage.  \"I think that there's a lot of people in a state like Maine or an older state or older workforce, who are 60, 62. Ready to retire, physically worn down, but they're waiting for Medicare to do it. And I also think there are people who might continue to work but take their premiums that they pay to a for-profit insurer and instead buy into Medicare.\" That position has been attacked by Poliquin, the GOP incumbent, in TV ads like this one from the National Republican Campaign Committee: NPR repeatedly reached out to Poliquin's campaign for an interview but got no response. The 64-year-old is running for his third term, as the only remaining Republican in the House from New England. In a debate earlier this month, he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations, while accusing Golden of being in the pocket of Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others. \"There's millions and millions of dollars pouring into this race from Nancy Pelosi, the extreme radical from San Francisco, or Maxine Waters. All this dark money,\" Poliquin said. \"And here's the reason: Jared Golden votes in line with Nancy Pelosi. She must have looked at his voting record and said this is exactly the sort of person we want down in Washington.\" Golden has repeatedly asserted he will not vote for Pelosi for speaker, saying it's time for \"a new generation of leaders.\" In that same debate, Poliquin, whom Trump endorsed for re-election in a tweet, refused to state whether he voted for Trump in 2016.  \"That's my business,\" Poliquin said. \"I work with everybody, Republicans and Democrats, as a business professional, but I do not tell anybody who I vote for.\" .@BrucePoliquin from Maine is a great Congressman. He is in a tough fight against a very liberal Nancy Pelosi Democrat. Bruce has helped bring JOBS back to his State and totally protects your Great Second Amendment. We need to keep Bruce in Washington. He has my Full Endorsement! Should Golden win, and Democrats take control of the House, Golden says he does not view his role \"as resistance,\" but opens the door to working with the president. \"I like to say I'm a Marine, no better friend, no worse enemy. If the president does something that helps Maine, I'm with him. If he does something that hurts Maine, I'm going to stick up for our state,\" he said. Rep. Bruce Poliquin shows off his 30-year-old L.L.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the two major candidates and the parties and political action committees supporting them have dropped more than $8 million into the district. Two independents in the race are not expected to be a factor, but could be because of a wild card. Maine now has ranked-choice voting in federal elections. University of Maine political science professor Mark Brewer explains \"if you were to go and get your ballot today and vote, you'd be given the option to rank those four candidates, one through four. One being your top choice and four being your last choice.\" If no candidate receives a majority,  the last-place finisher is eliminated. Brewer says that if those who voted for that last-place candidate made a second choice, then \"those votes are then allocated to their second-choice candidate.\" No one knows for certain how this will play out, which Brewer says is \"fascinating to watch.\"  And Poliquin has refused to say whether he will honor the results if he should lose.",

This election really is about Donald Trump. Roughly two-thirds of voters say President Trump is a factor (either major or minor) in their vote in this year's midterms, far more than said so in 2014 about then-President Barack Obama, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Among women, though, it's even more acute \u2014 51 percent of women overall said Trump will be a \"major\" factor in their vote in two weeks; 54 percent of suburban women said the same. Among those who said Trump is a \"major factor,\" 64 percent said they were more likely to vote Democratic in November and 32 percent said they were more likely to vote Republican. \"This is definitively a national election \u2014 with a referendum on Trump,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. What's more, 47 percent of voters said their opinion of Trump makes them more likely to vote for a Democrat for Congress, while 34 percent said their opinion of Trump makes them more likely to vote for a Republican. Compare that to 2014 when Republicans took control of the Senate. Obama had a somewhat lower effect on making voters cast a ballot for Republicans \u2014 with 41 percent saying then that their impression of Obama made them more likely to support a Republican and 38 percent saying their impression of the 44th president made them more likely to support a Democrat. Democrats also have increased their advantage from 6 to 10 points compared to earlier this month on the question of whether people are more likely to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in their district. Democrats now lead Republicans on the so-called generic congressional ballot 50 percent to 40 percent. Driving that edge are independents, nonwhite people and women, particularly suburban women and white women with college degrees. Republicans lead with the familiar groups who drove Trump to victory in the 2016 election: white people without a college degree (particularly men), white evangelical Christians, rural voters and married men. Trump's approval rating stands at 39 percent, down from 41 percent earlier this month. Trump's approval rating is hotly divided by party but has remained fairly consistent through the nearly two years he's been in office. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Miringoff added that if 2010 and 2014 were elections driven by men upset with Obama, this is an election driven by women, particularly suburban women, and independents motivated to vote against Trump. Trump has just a 33 percent approval rating with women overall and a 27 percent approval rating with women who live in the suburbs. And 35 percent of independents say they approve of the job Trump is doing. On the issues, the economy and jobs (at 20 percent) rated as the top issue of concern for voters, followed by health care and immigration (both at 17 percent). There were big differences in the priorities by party, however. Democrats rated health care as the top issue (at 26 percent) followed by climate change (at 13 percent). Nothing else cracked double digits. For Republicans, jobs and the economy took the top spot (at 30 percent), with immigration next (at 25 percent). Nothing else came close. Republicans' tax cuts have turned out to be a liability for Republicans. Just 11 percent said it was the most important factor in their vote. A plurality of voters (45 percent) said the issue of tax cuts makes them more likely to vote for a Democrat for Congress in November, while 39 percent said the issue makes them more likely to vote Republican. What's more, when asked about how to reduce the federal deficit, 60 percent said it was better to roll back the tax cuts passed by Congress than to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 and that includes a plurality of Republicans. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Even self-proclaimed Trump supporters were split on which was the better option. That's a blow to congressional Republicans, especially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who lamented the rising federal deficit but blamed it on entitlements rather than tax cuts. \"It's disappointing, but it's not a Republican problem,\" McConnell told Bloomberg News on Oct. 16. \"It's a bipartisan problem: unwillingness to address the real drivers of the debt by doing anything to adjust those programs to the demographics of America in the future.\" As NPR's Scott Horsley reported the same day, based on a fiscal-year-end report from the Treasury Department: \"The federal deficit ballooned to $779 billion in the just-ended fiscal year \u2014 a remarkable tide of red ink for a country not mired in recession or war. \"The government is expected to borrow more than a trillion dollars in the coming year, in part to make up for tax receipts that have been slashed by GOP tax cuts.\" The poll was conducted from Oct. 21 through Oct. 23. Pollsters interviewed 935 Americans overall and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 percentage points. Of those, 738 were registered voters and answers that refer to voters have a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.4 percentage points.",

Since the start of October, New York Democrat Antonio Delgado has posted 14 ads on YouTube. Some show him out greeting voters. Others are attack ads on his opponent, Republican Rep. John Faso. But the overwhelming majority \u2014 all but one of the ads \u2014 mention health care. Delgado is in a tight race in New York's 19th Congressional District. And his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced. The party has been hammering on health care relentlessly. In fact, more than half of pro-Democratic TV ads in the home stretch to Election Day have mentioned health care, compared to around one-third of Republican ads, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. The prevalence of health care in this year's ads sets 2018 apart, according to Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. \"It's very unusual,\" she said. \"I think if we look at this cycle in comparison to the last over the last decade, we're seeing many, many, many more times the discussion of health care than we have.\" Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. That's a big change from the 2010 and 2014 midterms in particular, when Republicans regularly slammed Obamacare, former President Obama's 2010 signature legislative achievement which is also called the Affordable Care Act. Democratic ads, meanwhile, barely touched the topic, according to Wesleyan's data. But since 2016, Republicans have tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the law has gained popularity. According to data compiled by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans have either been evenly divided or had a net-favorable view of Obamacare since January 2017. That's after years in which Americans often had a net-unfavorable view of it. \"Democrats have a very clear advantage on health care, and not only that, it's one of the top issues that voters say matter to them,\" said Democratic pollster Margie Omero. \"It's something that we hear in focus groups all the time.\" Indeed, a recent poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal finds that voters give Democrats an 18-point advantage on the question of which party handles health care better. Republicans play defense on Obamacare repeal All of this has emboldened Democrats to attack the GOP. But in recent weeks, Republicans have ramped up their own messaging. Among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks: one from Republican John Faso, whom Delgado is trying to unseat. The ad features Faso's wife, a cancer survivor, saying he voted to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This is one of a recent crop of ads where GOP candidates promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Similar ads have come from California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. President Trump has been saying the same thing. Wednesday, Trump tweeted that \"Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions.\" Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican. But to be clear: the Republican Obamacare repeal bill \u2014 cited in Faso's ad as an example of how he voted to protect sick people \u2014 would have made it harder for many with pre-existing conditions to get coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt. \"Insurers would have still had to guarantee insurance to people with pre-existing conditions,\" he said. \"But people who were uninsured and had a pre-existing condition they might have faced prohibitively high premiums, which would have put coverage effectively out of reach.\" That's not the only way the GOP repeal bill could have hurt people with pre-existing conditions. \"States would have also been able to waive the ACA benefit requirements,\" he added. \"So if you have cancer and you need an expensive drug the fact that you can get insurance but not get coverage for that drug, isn't going to help you very much.\" On top of all that, the Trump administration will not defend against a lawsuit from 20 state attorneys general that seeks to declare Obamacare unconstitutional \u2014 meaning it could potentially overturn the law's pre-existing condition protections. In the face of Democratic attacks and with a tough election approaching \u2014 Republicans have made some moves on the topic of pre-existing conditions to counter Democrats. One early September law, the \"Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act,\" would have still allowed insurance companies to charge ultra-high premiums for people with pre-existing conditions, according to experts interviewed by McClatchy at the time. Another measure \"expressing the sense...that protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions should be retained in law\" also got some Republican support....but it wouldn't have had any real effect. Republicans make their own attacks Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions are highly popular: According to a September poll from Kaiser, even a majority of Republicans supported keeping those protections. However, Levitt points out a flip side to the policy. \"When the ACA guaranteed insurance to people with pre-existing conditions premiums did go up especially for people who are healthy,\" he said. This has long been part of the Republican argument: that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people, and furthermore forced people to get insurance they didn't want. And while some Republicans are playing defense \u2014 Iowa Rep. David Young, for example, touts one of his votes for a fund that would have gone toward people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 getting too defensive isn't a great strategy, says one operative. \"There's a truism in politics that if you're explaining you're losing,\" said Republican strategist Michael Steel. It's not that Republicans have been dodging health care this year. Rather, they have other lines of attack. Perhaps the biggest: single-payer health care, often known as \"Medicare for all.\" Around half of Democratic House candidates back the policy this year, according to USA Today. And while it might be popular among the Democratic base, distaste for it motivates many in the Republican base. \"I think Republicans feel that the increasing radicalization of the Democratic Party, that the growing support for Medicare for all \u2014 without a realistic plan to pay for it \u2014 also provides an opportunity when talking to a lot of voters who are trying to make up their minds right now,\" Steel said. Estimates of the cost of Medicare for all vary widely, as in one recent study that found it could cost up to $32 trillion or save up to $2 trillion over a decade. While these arguments about Medicare for all and preexisting conditions are being used to motivate voters to turn out on Election Day, the reality is that the election probably won't do much to settle the debate.",

            "article_content": "Health care is a top issue for voters heading into the midterm elections. The arguments on each side have gotten heated, particularly over pre-existing conditions and government-run care.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Now to the fast-approaching midterm elections, where health care has been the dominant issue. Democrats have been aggressively attacking Republicans for trying to repeal Obamacare. But as Election Day approaches, Republicans are fighting back. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has more. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Democrat Antonio Delgado has put up more than a dozen ads on his YouTube page since the start of October. And the overwhelming majority - all but one - mention health care. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"FIGHTING FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE\") ANTONIO DELGADO: Everywhere in this district, folks tell me, we've got to fix health care. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I'm a three-year cancer survivor. I'm so happy you're going to fight the fight for us. KURTZLEBEN: He's in a tight race in New York's 19th Congressional District, and his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced. In fact, more than half of pro-Democratic TV ads in the homestretch to Election Day have mentioned health care, compared to around one-third of Republican ads. That's according to the Wesleyan Media Project. Margie Omero is a Democratic pollster. MARGIE OMERO: Democrats have a very clear advantage on health care. And not only that, it's one of the top issues that voters say matter to them, that they think is a, you know, big issue facing them personally and facing the country. KURTZLEBEN: That's a big change from the 2010 and 2014 midterms. When Republicans slammed Obamacare, Democrats barely touched the topic. But since 2016, Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare, and the law has gained popularity. Now, Republicans have ramped up their own messaging. Among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks, one from Republican John Faso, whom Delgado is trying to unseat. The ad features Faso's wife, a cancer survivor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARY FRANCES FASO: John knows firsthand how important health care is for families. The truth is he voted to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. KURTZLEBEN: This is one of a recent crop of ads where GOP candidates promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions. President Trump has been saying the same thing. But then, the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage. That's according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt. LARRY LEVITT: Insurers would have still had to guarantee insurance to people with pre-existing conditions. But for people who were uninsured and had a pre-existing condition, they might have faced prohibitively high premiums, which would've put coverage effectively out of reach. KURTZLEBEN: According to a September poll from Kaiser, even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections. However, Levitt points out a flip side to the policy. LEVITT: When the ACA guaranteed insurance to people with pre-existing conditions, premiums did go up, especially for people who are healthy. KURTZLEBEN: And this has long been part of the Republican argument - that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and, furthermore, forced people to get insurance they didn't want. However, there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining, for example, the finer points of pre-existing conditions. And there's a good reason for that. MICHAEL STEELE: There's a truism in politics that if you're explaining, you're losing. KURTZLEBEN: Michael Steele is a Republican strategist. It's not that Republicans have been dodging health care this year. Rather, they have other lines of attack. Perhaps the biggest - single-payer healthcare, often known as \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d STEELE: I think Republicans feel that the growing support for \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d without a realistic plan to pay for it also, you know, provides an opportunity, you know, when talking to a lot of voters who are trying to make up their minds right now.

The 2018 elections could see the highest turnout for a midterm since the mid-1960s, another time of cultural and social upheaval. \"It's probably going to be a turnout rate that most people have never experienced in their lives for a midterm election,\" Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who studies turnout and maintains a turnout database, told NPR. McDonald is predicting that 45 to 50 percent of eligible voters will cast a ballot. That would be a level not seen since 1970 when 47 percent of voters turned out or 1966 when a record 49 percent turned out in a midterm. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: Midterm Turnout Spike Expected In 2018 In 1966, Democrats were the ones facing a backlash. President Lyndon Johnson was in the White House and Congress had just passed his Great Society measures on Medicare, voting rights and civil rights. Democrats wound up losing 47 House seats and three Senate seats, \"heralding the end of the New Deal coalition and the realignment of voters that will put Richard M. Nixon (R) in the White House in 1968,\" as T.A. Frail at the Smithsonian put it. On average since World War II, only about 40 percent of Americans eligible to vote cast a ballot in midterms. That's 30 percent lower than presidential elections. In 2014, a record low 36 percent cast a ballot, the lowest in 70 years \u2014 since 1942, when many adults were fighting in the war overseas. But the Trump presidency has spurred a high level of interest in the 2018 midterms. Angry and frustrated Democrats, especially women, are looking to exact a measure of political revenge, as Republicans promise to stick with Trump. The 2018 midterms offer Democrats their first chance to take a stand. McDonald said he bases his forecast on four indicators: 1. Record special election turnout. 2. High primary turnout. 3. A high degree of self-reported interest in the election. 4. High levels of early voting. In some states, McDonald said he is seeing early voting that is exceedingly high. In Georgia, for example, comparing to this time in 2014, early vote turnout is three times higher, so far. \"It just seems like all four indicators, they're all pointing in the same direction,\" McDonald said. Digging into some of those and other factors, there are other signs: A record number of candidates. More candidates than ever before filed to run in 2018. In particular, more Democrats ran for Congress in 2018 than for any single party ever before. A record number of women, particularly Democratic women, ran and were nominated as well. But Republicans overall were not that far behind. High primary turnout. This has been particularly true among Democrats. According to a study by a Republican pollster of voting in 35 states, Democrats saw a 78 percent increase in turnout, compared to 2014, while Republicans saw a 23 percent uptick. Democrats were at a similar turnout level as when they took back the House in 2006 \u2014 accounting for 53 percent of all primary ballots cast; in 2006, they cast 54 percent of primary ballots. High overall interest and engagement. A higher percentage of Democrats than at any other time in the past quarter century told Pew they are more enthusiastic about voting than usual. Among Republicans, Pew found a sign of resilience. The level of interest in the GOP in 2018 is higher than in parties that were successfully overtaken by wave elections in the past. Core Democratic groups may be showing more interest. Low propensity voters in past midterms \u2014 young voters and nonwhites \u2014 are showing some mixed signs they might have a higher interest than past elections. An October ABC News/Washington Post poll found that far more voters who are under 40 and nonwhite are saying they are \"absolutely certain to vote\" compared to the 2014 midterms. At the same time, however, an early October NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll and a late September NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found core Democratic groups, like voters 18 to 29 and Latinos, are far less interested than core Republicans, like whites, men and older voters. But even if those core Democratic groups lag behind core Republican groups, that could still be good news for Democrats if those low-propensity groups vote in higher numbers than in past midterms.",

But the fate of the eight-year old health care law could be decided by which party wins control of Congress in November. \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 the progressive alternative to Obamacare \u2014 also stands to gain or lose ground. And the Trump administration will be looking for a green light to keep making health care changes of its own. Republican strategist Karl Rove wrote about what's at stake in a recent Wall Street Journal column. The headline described health care as the \"sleeper issue\" of the 2018 midterm elections. Republican Lou Hendricks agrees. The Kansas City retiree told pollsters health care is at the top of his list as he ponders his midterm vote. \"One of the big concerns that we have as as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions,\" Hendricks said. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who's in a tough battle for re-election, is trying to tap into that concern. McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign ad. \"I don't talk about it much,\" she says, over video that shows the senator meeting with other women. \"Those who faced cancer and many other illnesses have a pre-existing condition when it comes to health coverage.\" McCaskill blasts her Republican opponent, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and its requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history. Republicans insist they will also protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions, though they've been vague in saying how. Democrats around the country have seized on this issue. Health care dominates congressional campaign ads, outpacing jobs, taxes, and immigration. \"Democrats have been laser-focused on health care this year,\" said Erika Franklin Fowler, who tracks campaign ads for the Wesleyan Media Project. It's the mirror image of past election cycles, when Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet. \"Regardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable Care Act, there are provisions of it that are very popular,\" Franklin said. \"Once it became clear that those provisions are in trouble, I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it this cycle.\" Democrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November. On the other hand, if Republicans keep control, they could take another run at repealing Obamacare.

The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who helped torpedo the last repeal effort, has now been replaced by Jon Kyl, a more reliable GOP vote. No matter which party controls Congress next year, the Trump administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare. For example, the administration has already relaxed regulations to allow stripped-down insurance policies with reduced coverage. \"The president will still be in office, and his administration will still be active,\" Anderson said. But if Democrats win control of either chamber, they might be able to put the brakes on those efforts. \"What you're likely to see is much greater and even fierce oversight of the administration's efforts to change \u2014 and many would say undermine\" the Affordable Care Act, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research organization. In Kansas City, Hendricks described himself as a fan of the Affordable Care Act. But more and more he's leaning towards a single-payer insurance system, which progressive advocates like to describe as \"Medicare for All.\" \"It makes it easier and simpler for everybody,\" Hendricks said, \"with he exception of Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, enter the medical insurance company here.\" President Trump has gone on the offensive, claiming without evidence that any expansion of Medicare will come at the expense of today's seniors. Even if they win a sweeping victory in the midterms, Democrats won't have the power to pass \"Medicare for All\" over a presidential veto. But they might jump start the conversation ahead of the next election in two years.",

Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, campaigns for re-election, he has warned that 800,000 West Virginians with pre-existing conditions could lose health coverage. Ensuring that people with pre-existing health conditions can get and keep health insurance is the most popular part of the Affordable Care Act. It has also become a flashpoint in this fall's midterm campaigns across the country. And not only is the ACA protection, which mostly applies to people who buy their own coverage, at risk. It's also possible that pre-existing condition protections that predate the federal health law could be in play. Democrats charge that Republicans' opposition to the ACA puts pre-existing protections in peril, both by their (unsuccessful) votes in Congress in 2017 to \"repeal and replace\" the law and via a federal lawsuit underway in Texas. \"Eight hundred thousand West Virginians with pre-existing conditions [are] in jeopardy of losing their health care,\" said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Republicans disagree. \"Pre-existing conditions are safe,\" President Trump declared at a rally in West Virginia for Patrick Morrisey, Manchin's GOP opponent. Morrisey, West Virginia's attorney general, is part of a group of state officials suing to overturn the ACA. Who's right? Like everything else in health care, it's complicated. What's clear, however, is that voters want protections. Even majorities of Republicans told pollsters this summer that it's \"very important\" that guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions remain law. Here are some key details that can help put the current political arguments in perspective. Pre-existing conditions are common Pre-existing conditions are previous or ongoing medical issues that predate health insurance enrollment. The problem is that the term is a grab bag whose limits have never been defined. It certainly applies to serious ongoing conditions such as cancer, heart disease and asthma. But insurers also have used it to apply to conditions like pregnancy or far more trivial medical issues such as acne or a distant history of depression. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in 2016 that more than a quarter of adults younger than 65 \u2014 about 52 million people \u2014 have a pre-existing health condition that very likely would have prevented them from purchasing individual health insurance under the pre-ACA rules. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Protections vary by the kind of insurance you have But what protections people with pre-existing conditions have depends on how they get their coverage. For that reason, it's not right to say everyone with health problems is potentially at risk, as Democrats frequently suggest. For example, Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, and Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for low-income people, don't discriminate in either coverage or price on the basis of pre-existing conditions. The two programs together cover roughly 130 million Americans \u2014 nearly a third of the population. The majority of Americans get their coverage through work. In 1996, Congress protected people with pre-existing conditions who have employer-based coverage by passing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. HIPAA was intended to eliminate \"job lock,\" or the inability of a person with a pre-existing condition (or a family member with a pre-existing condition) to change jobs because coverage at the new job would most likely come with a waiting period during which the condition would not be covered. HIPAA banned those waiting periods for people who had maintained continuous coverage, meaning a break of no more than 63 days, and the law limited waiting periods to one year for those who were previously uninsured. In addition, it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to or raising premiums for workers based on their own or a family member's health status or medical history. HIPAA was less successful in protecting people without job-based insurance. It sought to guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions leaving the group market could buy individual coverage if they had remained continuously covered. But the law did not put limits on what individual insurers could charge for those policies. In many cases, insurers charged so much for these \"HIPAA conversion\" policies that almost no one could afford them. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, built on those 1996 protections and specifically sought to help people buying their own coverage. It barred all health insurers from excluding people because of pre-existing conditions, charging them higher premiums and imposing waiting periods for coverage of those conditions. While the protections were mostly aimed at the individual insurance market, where only a small portion of Americans get coverage, the ACA also made some changes to the employer market for people with pre-existing conditions, by banning annual and lifetime coverage limits. Will protections on pre-existing conditions become collateral damage? In 2017, the GOP-controlled House and Senate voted on several versions of a bill that would have dramatically overhauled the ACA, including its protections of pre-existing conditions. Under the last bill that narrowly failed in the Senate, states would have been given authority to allow insurers to waive some of those protections, including the one requiring the same premiums be charged regardless of health status. In February, 18 GOP attorneys general and two GOP governors filed suit in federal court in Texas. They charge that because Congress in its 2017 tax bill eliminated the ACA's penalty for not having insurance, the entire federal health law is unconstitutional. Their argument is that the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 based only on Congress' taxing power, and that without the tax, the rest of the law should fall. The Trump administration, technically the defendant in that case, said in June that it disagreed that the entire law should fall. But it is arguing that the parts of the law addressing pre-existing conditions are so tightly connected to the tax penalty that they should be struck down. Clearly, if the lawsuit prevails in either its original form or the form preferred by the Trump administration, pre-existing protections are not \"safe,\" as the president claimed. Even more complicated, the protections written into HIPAA were rewritten and incorporated into the ACA, so if the ACA in whole or part were to be struck down, HIPAA's pre-existing condition protections might go away, too. Republicans in Congress have introduced a series of proposals they say would replicate the existing protections. But critics contend none of them cover as many situations as the ACA does. For example, a bill unveiled by several Republican senators in August would require insurers to offer coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions, but not require coverage of the conditions themselves. That hasn't stopped Republicans from claiming that they support protections for pre-existing conditions. \"Make no mistake about it: Patients with pre-existing conditions should be covered,\" says Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Leah Vukmir, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Health care has been a major issue in that race, as well as many others. Yet Vukmir was recently hailed by Vice President Pence as someone who will vote to \"fully repeal and replace Obamacare.\" Meanwhile, Democrats who are chastising their Republican opponents over the issue are sometimes going a bit over the top, too. An example is Manchin's claim about the threat to coverage for 800,000 people in West Virginia. West Virginia's population is only 1.8 million and more than 1 million of those people are on Medicare or Medicaid. That would mean every other person in the state has a pre-existing condition. A recent study found West Virginia has a relatively high level of pre-existing conditions among adults, but it is still less than 40 percent.

USA Today published an opinion column by President Trump Wednesday in which the president falsely accused Democrats of trying to \"eviscerate\" Medicare, while defending his own record of protecting health care coverage for seniors and others. The column \u2014 published just weeks ahead of the midterm elections \u2014 underscores the political power of health care to energize voters. But it makes a number of unsubstantiated claims. 1. The political context: Health care has emerged as a dominant issue on the campaign trail in the runup to the November elections. According to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks congressional advertising, health care was the focus of 41 percent of all campaign ads in September, outpacing taxes (20 percent), jobs (13 percent) and immigration (9 percent). Democrats are particularly focused on health care, devoting 50 percent of their ads to the issue, but health care is also a leading issue in Republican commercials (28 percent), second only to taxes (32 percent). Perhaps sensing that Democrats are gaining traction, Trump has decided to go on the attack, targeting the Democratic proposal known as \"Medicare-for-All.\" 2. Cost of the plan: Trump claims that expanding the federal government's Medicare program would cost $32.6 trillion over a decade. But as Business Insider reports, that would actually be a discount compared with the nation's current health care bill. Trump's figure was calculated by the libertarian Mercatus Center, but he fails to note that total health care spending under Medicare-for-All would be about $2 trillion less over the decade than currently projected. The federal government would pay more, but Americans on the whole would pay less. Remember that the U.S. already spends far more per person on health care than does any other country. And when you count the tax break for employer-provided insurance, the federal government already pays about two-thirds of this bill. But because of the fragmented private insurance system, the government gets none of the efficiency or buying power that a single-payer system would provide. 3. Health care rationing: Trump claims \u2014 with no supporting evidence \u2014 that \"the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care. Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business. Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors. There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures. Previously covered care would effectively be denied.\" Detailed implementation of any single-payer plan would of course be subject to substantial negotiation. But the Medicare for All bill drafted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., states explicitly that \"Nothing in this Act shall prohibit an institutional or individual provider from entering into a private contract with an enrolled individual for any item or service\" outside the plan. 4. Pre-existing conditions: Trump notes that as a candidate, he \"promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions.\" In fact, Trump and his fellow Republicans tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. GOP plans would leave it up to the states to craft alternative protections. In addition, Republican attorneys general have sued to overturn Obamacare's protections, and the Trump administration has declined to defend them. America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the insurance industry, warns that ending the Obamacare guarantee could result in hardship for the estimated 130 million Americans under 65 with pre-existing conditions. \"Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019,\" AHIP said in a statement in June. 5. Strength of Medicare: Trump writes that \"Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare. Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.\" He is repeating a claim that was widely debunked during the 2012 election. The Affordable Care Act actually strengthened the solvency of Medicare, but it has since been weakened again by the GOP tax cut. The president is trying to play on the fears of seniors \u2014 who vote in large numbers \u2014 with the claim that any effort to improve health security for younger Americans must come at their expense. But that is a false choice.",

            "article_content": "Progressive candidates have scored big upsets recently against candidates steeped in the Democratic establishment. The New York gubernatorial primary is another test this week.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: It's the last week of primaries before November's midterm elections. Progressive candidates have scored big upsets recently over candidates from the Democratic Party establishment, and they'll try to do that again this week with primaries in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New York. There's a primary there for governor that has gotten a lot of attention. It's between the current governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Cynthia Nixon, an education activist and actress best-known for her role in the show \"Sex And The City.\" We'll hear from Nixon in a few minutes. First, NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro's here to catch us up on how these primary battles have been fought. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Ari. SHAPIRO: How significant is it that progressives have scored these big victories, sometimes catching incumbents by surprise? MONTANARO: Well, so far in this campaign, there've been some high-profile progressive wins, like with Andrew Gillum for governor of Florida, for example, and for the House, where you had two relatively unknown candidates go and knock off Democratic incumbents in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, who is pretty well-known in Boston, but outside of that, not as much. Overall though, the Brookings Institution's been keeping track of how progressive versus establishment candidates have been doing. By the numbers, progressive candidates have emerged in only about a quarter of all the races, and in many of those, have actually been in Republican-leaning districts. So the likelihood that they'll change the makeup of Congress on the Democratic side isn't very high at this point. Mostly, we're going to see this continue when and if Democrats at some point take back Congress, and especially in that 2020 primary race. SHAPIRO: The race in New York, of course, is for governor. We're not talking about Congress. But how does that race compare with some of the other contests we've seen? MONTANARO: I mean, there's lots of similarities. I mean, Nixon is pushing things, for example, on the issues that are certainly more liberal than Andrew Cuomo, the governor - current governor has been willing to go, like, for example, on raising taxes on the wealthy to fund schools, wanting statewide universal health care, whether public sector unions should have the right to strike, for example. You know, she also represents a wave of women, minorities and LGBTQ candidates who are running. Nixon identifies as queer. But it's also different in a lot of other ways, too. You know, Cuomo - the name Cuomo is political - Democratic political gold in New York state. His father was governor. He's got ties and connections to lots of high-profile Democrats because of that, including Joe Biden, who has been all over the airwaves for Cuomo, and Hillary Clinton, who campaigned with him this past weekend. Cuomo's also seen this challenge coming. He spent $8 million just in the last three weeks, despite the fact that he's up by big poll numbers. You know, for context, Nixon has only spent about 450,000 in the last three weeks. SHAPIRO: Wow. MONTANARO: That's roughly equivalent to what Cuomo spent per day. SHAPIRO: Wow. When you take a step back, do you see these progressive candidates shaping the Democratic Party heading into the November midterms, and potentially even into the 2020 presidential race? MONTANARO: Well, in many ways, progressives have already won. I mean, they've been able to shift Democratic talking points and politics toward things like \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d $15 minimum wage, and for some, Abolish ICE, which, you know, a lot of moderate Democrats and establishment Democrats don't particularly like. But a lot of this is going to be on the stage in the 2020 primaries for absolute certain. We're seeing almost a mirror image of what played out with the Tea Party. And I think it's going to really be a big factor in those primaries in 2019. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. And you can also hear him on the NPR Politics podcast. Thanks, Domenico.

Updated at 4:35 p.m. ET Andrew Gillum was expected by many to be an also-ran in Florida's Democratic gubernatorial primary. Now, despite being heavily outspent by his better-known centrist rivals, the 39-year-old Tallahassee mayor is his party's nominee, and has already drawn attention from the Oval Office. In addition, only hours into the general election, Gillum's Republican opponent is being criticized for making what some are calling racist remarks, telling Florida not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. Gillum, who defeated former Rep. Gwen Graham and several other candidates, would be Florida's first black governor if elected in November. \"I actually believe that Florida and its rich diversity are going to be looking for a governor who's going to bring us together, not divide us. Not misogynist, not racist, not bigots,\" Gillum said on CNN on Wednesday morning. \"They're going to be looking for a governor who is going to appeal to our higher aspirations as a state,\" he said, \"who's going to talk about what it means to build a Florida that makes room for all of us and not just some of us.\" Democrats have not won the Florida governor's mansion since 1994. Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the GOP primary with President Trump's endorsement, was accused of racism over a comment he made Wednesday morning on Fox News after Gillum's morning appearance. DeSantis said, \"The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.\" The chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, Terrie Rizzo, tweeted that it's \"disgusting that Ron DeSantis is launching his general election campaign with racist dog whistles.\" It's disgusting that Ron DeSantis is launching his general election campaign with racist dog whistles. #FlaPol https://t.co/T9qRVYtbv3 The DeSantis campaign issued a statement later Wednesday, saying: \"Ron DeSantis was obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies that Andrew Gillum espouses. To characterize it as anything else is absurd.\" A Fox anchor later said of DeSantis remarks, \"we do not condone this language.\" Gillum ran to the left of his Democratic opponents in the primary, calling for Medicare for all, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Gillum was backed by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and had financial support from billionaire philanthropists George Soros and Tom Steyer. Steyer has called for Trump's impeachment, and Gillum agrees. Asked whether he thinks Democrats should try to impeach the president if they retake the House, Gillum responded, \"I absolutely do.\" Trump quickly attacked Gillum Wednesday morning on Twitter, calling him \"a failed Socialist mayor\" and the \"biggest dream\" opponent for DeSantis. The president also charged that Gillum has allowed \"crime & many other problems to flourish in his city,\" adding, \"This is not what Florida wants or needs!\" Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dream....a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime & many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs! Tallahassee has seen a spike in homicides, but its overall crime rate has declined, although it remains the highest in the state. And city hall itself has been under investigation by the FBI for corruption, although Gillum has said he is not a target of the investigation. Gillum is the son of a bus driver and has three young children. He is the second African-American candidate for governor in the region this year, joining fellow Democrat Stacey Abrams in neighboring Georgia.",

Updated 12:03 a.m. ET Favorites of both the conservative and progressive movements scored surprising wins in Florida's gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday, setting up a competitive clash come November. On the Democratic side in Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum's victory was the most unexpected of the night, as he defeated centrist former Rep. Gwen Graham. His victory is one of the most significant progressive victories of the 2018 primary season \u2014 a surprise upset in a statewide race, to lead one of the biggest states in the country, which is one of the year's top battlegrounds. Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis won the Republican nomination, cruising to a nearly 20 point win over establishment-backed Adam Putnam, the state's agriculture commissioner \u2014 a margin no one expected, boosted by his coveted endorsement from President Trump. In Arizona, national Republicans got their pick in a top Senate race with Rep. Martha McSally emerging from a bitter GOP primary. She'll face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in one of Democrats' best takeover chances during a midterm cycle where they're largely playing defense. Either way, Arizona is poised to have its first female senator next year. Donald Trump vs. Bernie Sanders proxy battle Both of the Florida primary wins show that the momentum in each party lies in the far right and the far left. DeSantis had been seen as a slight favorite, but no one had predicted such a blowout win over Putnam, who started the race as the clear frontrunner. Gillum hadn't led in a single poll and was heavily outspent by several of his rivals, but was able to harness the progressive energy to beat Graham, a famed political scion in the state whose father had served as governor and senator. Sen. Bernie Sanders campaigned for Gillum and drew more than 1,000 people to a rally in Tampa earlier this month. Gillum campaigned on repealing the state's controversial Stand Your Ground law, Medicare for all and raising the minimum wage. In a statement, Sanders said Gillum had \"laid out a vision for a new course for the state of Florida and our country.\" Billionaire donor Tom Steyer also endorsed Gillum and spent on his behalf, and on Tuesday called his win \"further proof that when Democrats put forward candidates that tell the truth and embrace a bold vision for the future, they win.\" Gillum would be the first African-American governor of Florida if elected, and he becomes the second black Democratic gubernatorial nominee this year in the South, joining Georgia's Stacey Abrams. In the GOP primary, DeSantis tied himself closely to Trump, and it paid off. In one memorable ad, DeSantis showed himself with his children, teaching them to \"build the wall\" with blocks and reading them the president's famous book, The Art of the Deal. Trump held a rally in the state to help the Republican congressman and sent out plenty of tweets praising DeSantis, who's been one of his most vocal allies in Congress. Congressman Ron DeSantis is a special person who has done an incredible job. He is running in Tuesdays Primary for Governor of Florida\u2026.Strong on Crime, Borders and wants Low Taxes. He will be a great Governor and has my full and total Endorsement! Putnam, a former congressman who was once seen as a rising star in the GOP, criticized DeSantis as nothing more than a puppet of the president and said he was out of touch with Florida-specific issues. But, as it has time and again in Republican primaries this year, that tactic fell short. DeSantis's victory is yet another example of Trump's ability to lift candidates to victory in GOP primaries. One notable exception where Trump couldn't do that was last week in Wyoming's gubernatorial primary, where Republican megadonor Foster Friess fell short. But in other races in South Carolina, New York and more, he's shown an ability to move voters to candidates who side with him and against candidates who don't, even incumbents. Democrats had believed that the conservative DeSantis could give them a chance to take back the governor's mansion for the first time in two decades, liking the pairing of him against the more moderate Graham. But a Gillum vs. DeSantis race would take on a new dynamic. It represents a generational shift, too \u2014 both men are only 39 years old. Florida will also be home to one of the top Senate contests this cycle. Current Republican Gov. Rick Scott easily defeated a nominal challenger to win the GOP nomination. Now, he'll face Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson this fall in one of Republicans' best pick up opportunities. There could be as many as a half-dozen competitive House races in Florida this fall too. One of top pick-up opportunity for Democrats is in the open 27th District, where former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala won the Democratic nomination in a district Hillary Clinton carried by 20 points in 2016. Republicans got their preferred nominee, TV anchor Maria Elvira Salazar, in the Hispanic-majority Miami district, but it's still a tough seat for the GOP to defend. EMILY's List-backed Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell won the primary in the neighboring 26th District to take on Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, in a district Clinton carried by 16 points. The wins by Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell continue a trend of Democratic women showing strength in primaries this cycle across the country. Battleground Arizona In Arizona, McSally \u2014 the first female fighter pilot in U.S. history to fly in combat \u2014 emerged from a nasty primary to win the Republican nomination as she tries to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake in one of the year's top Senate races. McSally easily defeated two far-right candidates whom national Republicans feared would cost them the seat if nominated \u2014 former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. John McCain in 2016, and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was pardoned by Trump last year after he was convicted of criminal contempt for his hardline efforts in detaining immigrants. McSally, who had more of a moderate record in the House, had to move to the right in order to win the primary though, most notably on immigration, which Democrats argue will hurt her in a state with a growing Hispanic population. She had also denounced Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election, but now cozied up to him. McSally has already begun to draw a stark contrast between herself and Sinema, a former Green Party anti-war activist who's now a Blue Dog Democrat. The race is a must-win for Democrats if they want to have any hope \u2014 albeit slim \u2014 of taking back the Senate. \"This is how I see this campaign. It's a choice between a doer and a talker ... between a patriot and a protester ... between a career fighter pilot and a career politician ... between proven grit and Hollywood glitz,\" McSally said in her remarks. \"There is nothing wrong with Hollywood glitz. I am as impressed as anyone that my opponent owns over 100 pairs of shoes. I, on the other hand, flew over 100 combat missions for our country.\" Meanwhile, Democratic Senate Majority PAC said in a statement that \"McSally spent the primary pandering to her conservative base and abandoning her prior political beliefs ... she will not be able to suddenly walk it all back and pretend to be moderate Martha again. Martha McSally's serial flip-flopping shows that she puts her career in politics first and the needs of Arizona second, and that Arizona voters cannot trust a single thing she says.\" In the Oklahoma gubernatorial runoff, mortgage company executive Kevin Stitt defeated former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett to win the GOP nomination. Stitt, a political newcomer, campaigned as the more conservative outsider candidate, putting millions of his own money into the race. That strategy won out over Cornett's emphasis on his political experience. Stitt will now face Democratic nominee Drew Edmondson, the state's former attorney general, for the right to succeed outgoing Republican Gov. Mary Fallin.",

SHAPIRO: Let's start with the special election in Ohio, the 12th Congressional District officially too close to call. Is there something more important to say about this race, though, than who might end up a few votes ahead or behind in something that they're going to have to run in a few months again anyway? LIASSON: Right. The results mean nothing for the balance of power in the House. But there are signs of what might happen in November. And we've seen the same thing over and over again - again last night, overperformance among Democrats, higher turnout among Democrats than in 2016. Again, Republicans had a lot more money and resources to devote to this race, including a presidential visit. But it's unclear whether they can replicate that in the fall in other districts because there are close to 70 Republican House districts where Trump won by less than he did in the Ohio 12th or that Hillary Clinton won. And that is the House battleground. So if Democrats came this close in this district which is heavily Republican and they overperform the same way everywhere else, they should win the House. SHAPIRO: Let's talk about another race that is too close to call - Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a controversial figure, ally of President Trump running for governor against the sitting governor. And Kobach leads Governor Jeff Colyer by a slight margin. If Kobach does end up winning, what does this mean for the general election in the fall? LIASSON: Well, what's interesting about this race is Donald Trump endorsed Kobach over the incumbent Republican governor, which presidents don't usually do and local Republican parties usually do not like. But Kris Kobach is a Trump ally. He ran his short-lived voter fraud commission. And Kansas is a rare case where Democrats were thrilled with Trump's endorsement because they think Kobach is the candidate that's easier to beat because of his hard-line rhetoric on immigration and voting rights. And they think that's going to help them win. They have a female candidate named Laura Kelly. And what we saw is that the president has had a very big effect in primaries. He can make or break a Republican candidate. But his endorsement has been much less powerful in general elections. His candidates lost in Alabama, in the 18th District in Pennsylvania and in the Virginia governor's race. So this race in the fall if Kobach wins is going to be a test of the power of Trump's endorsement. SHAPIRO: Let's talk about what we learned about the Democratic Party from last night's results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a big splash in June when she took down a Democratic leader in a New York primary. She is young, a democratic socialist. She and Bernie Sanders endorsed a number of candidates on the ballot yesterday. How did they do? LIASSON: Not great. There is no doubt a lot of energy in the Democratic Party moving left, and Bernie Sanders has led the way on a lot of things now accepted broadly by Democrats like Medicare for all and the minimum wage raise. But in primaries, Sanders can't seem to get his candidates over the finish line or even close. In two cases last night, his candidates lost by really big margins. And as for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is a meteoric figure on the left. She gets people to stand in line to see her. She can generate tremendous press coverage for her, the candidates that she endorses. But they didn't win last night with one exception, a Detroit House race to replace John Conyers. It's a heavily Democratic district just like Cortez's is in New York City where there is no Republican opponent in the fall. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Mara, let's talk about Missouri, where there was an interesting vote last night about unions. LIASSON: Yes. The labor movement which has been on the losing end of almost everything for a generation beat a right-to-work law in a referendum, the first time a right-to-work law was overturned by popular vote. It was defeated about 2 to 1 - tells you something about grass-roots energy on the left, could be another good sign for Democrats in the fall. SHAPIRO: NPR's Mara Liasson, thank you.

On Tuesday, Democrats picked her to run unopposed for the congressional seat held by former Rep. John Conyers for more than 50 years. Tlaib would be the first Muslim woman in Congress. Updated at 2:48 p.m. ET Rashida Tlaib has some experience being first, and not just because she is the eldest of 14 children. As the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, she was the first person in her family to earn a high school diploma \u2014 then a college degree, and a law degree. She was the first Muslim woman ever elected to Michigan's Legislature, where she served in the House for the maximum term of six years. And in January, she is set to become America's first-ever Muslim congresswoman. The 42-year-old Detroit native, whose father worked at a Ford plant, clinched a Democratic primary in Michigan and won the right to run unopposed in a U.S. House race this fall. \"I am at a loss for words,\" she tweeted overnight. \"I cannot wait to serve you in Congress.\" Tlaib won the Democratic nomination to replace former Rep. John Conyers, the long-serving congressman and civil rights icon who resigned last year after sexual harassment allegations. The district covers portions of Detroit and the surrounding suburbs. It is heavily gerrymandered to concentrate Democratic votes, making it reliably Democratic. \"No Republicans ran in Tuesday's District 13 primary race, meaning Tlaib is set to win the seat in November's election and begin serving a full two-year term in January,\" Michigan Radio reports. Several other Muslim women are also running for Congress, in districts where primaries have not yet occurred \u2014 including Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is running for the House; Deedra Abboud, who is running for Senate in Arizona; and Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, who is making a bid for a House seat in Massachusetts. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota was the first Muslim ever elected to Congress; Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana was the second. Both men are black, which means Tlaib also would be the country's first Arab-American Muslim in Congress, as Haaretz notes. Metro Detroit is home to a large Muslim and Arab-American population, including thriving communities in cities such as Dearborn and Hamtramck. But Tlaib grew up in a Detroit neighborhood where Muslim and Arab residents were relatively rare, The Associated Press wrote in 2008: \"The southwest Detroit district has large black and Hispanic communities, with a white minority. \"Tlaib said she brings a long experience of working with others while staying true to her Muslim heritage. She described sitting in the cafeteria at Detroit Southwestern High School during Ramadan, watching friends eat while she fasted.\" And she will be representing a district where fewer than 5 percent of voters identify as Arab-American, TheNewArab reports. So while her Muslim and Palestinian identity made headlines nationally, local outlets have focused largely on her politics, her rhetoric and her reputation as a state lawmaker. While she served in the state House, Tlaib made a name as an environmental advocate \u2014 among other things, she led a charge against piles of petroleum coke heaped on the shores of the Detroit River by Koch Carbon, in a fight that made national headlines. She also focused on constituent services. After she left office, Tlaib became a public interest lawyer with the Sugar Law Center. She was an early, outspoken anti-Trump activist, joining a protest that interrupted the then-candidate when he was stumping in Detroit in 2016. On her own campaign trail, she promised to push for the president's impeachment. Tlaib also said she would add new protections and provisions to the Civil Rights Act and fight for Medicare-for-All and a nationwide $15 minimum wage, among other progressive goals. Tlaib ran to the left of several establishment Democrats in the crowded field to succeed Conyers, receiving endorsements from national progressive groups, CNN notes. She was endorsed by the Detroit Free Press, which cited her \"fiery rhetoric,\" \"easy charm\" and experience as a Democratic representative in a Republican-controlled state Legislature. That could be helpful, the local paper noted, if a \"blue wave\" fails to materialize, and Democrats like Tlaib remain in the minority in Congress.",

            "article_content": "President Trump shakes hands with Ohio 12th District Republican nominee Troy Balderson during a rally last weekend in Lewis Center, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump shakes hands with Ohio 12th District Republican nominee Troy Balderson during a rally last weekend in Lewis Center, Ohio. A critical House special election on Tuesday could provide some of the biggest clues yet about how much trouble Republicans could be in this November. In Ohio, the last Republican vs. Democrat matchup before November has become the latest proxy fight for whether Democrats can harness the energy, activism and overperformance in past special elections to pull off an upset in a GOP-held district. Republicans, meanwhile, have brought in President Trump himself and millions of dollars to stop that from happening, which would further trigger alarm bells about a possible blue wave in the fall midterms. Four other states are holding their regular primaries \u2014 Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington \u2014 where there are important House, Senate and gubernatorial contests on the ballot. Several races feature some of the progressive vs. establishment battles that have divided the Democratic Party so far this year, and there are also more women running who could add to historic numbers. On the GOP side, in addition to the House special election, President Trump has waded into competitive primaries as well \u2014 a further test of his considerable ability to sway his base for or against candidates, even though some national Republicans fear he could be boosting weaker candidates. Here's what to watch on Tuesday night: Ohio 12th special election: Canary in the coal mine for Republicans? The Columbus suburbs, where Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O'Connor are facing off, have a lot of the hallmarks that have proved problematic for Republicans in other recent elections \u2014 relatively affluent and highly educated, Democratic turnout has been heavy in early voting, and it's not exactly hardcore Trump Country. The GOP has struggled in special elections since 2016, and losses in Pennsylvania and Alabama have already added to its midterm worries. A win by O'Connor in the seat vacated by former GOP Rep. Pat Tiberi could be the canary in the coal mine for Republicans. Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich \u2014 who once held this seat in Congress \u2014 said Sunday on ABC's This Week the fact that the race has become a nail-biter should worry the GOP. \"The chaos that seems to surround Donald Trump has unnerved a lot of people. So suburban women in particular here are the ones that are really turned off. ... It really doesn't bode well for the Republican Party because this shouldn't even be close,\" Kasich said. According to the Columbus Dispatch, through last week Democrats had returned absentee ballots in the district's most populous counties at a pace that nearly doubled that of Republicans. Comparatively, in the 2016 general election, GOP ballots outnumbered Democratic ballots by 9 percentage points. Republicans, meanwhile, have poured millions into the race in the eleventh hour to save Balderson, falling back on one of their tried-and-true messages \u2014 stoking fears of a would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and rising progressivism within the Democratic Party. O'Connor has said he wouldn't support Pelosi as Democratic leader, though he did stumble on that question in an MSNBC interview. O'Connor, the Franklin County recorder, hasn't made his message so much about Trump but has zeroed in on health care, economic issues and comments Balderson made suggesting he might support raising the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare. Trump held a rally for Balderson this past weekend, which Republicans hope will fire up base voters and drive up primary day turnout to counter any Democratic surge. But it could also have unintended consequences by turning off independents and moderate Republicans who don't like the president. The night before the rally, Trump also went off on Ohio favorite son LeBron James, the NBA player who just opened up a school for at-risk kids in his hometown of Akron. Democratic primaries: Can progressives pull off more upsets? New York Democratic congressional nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigns for Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption New York Democratic congressional nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigns for Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed last month. The last big primary day at the end of June brought the upset victory by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over longtime New York Rep. Joe Crowley, the No. 4 ranking Democrat in the House. Now, in a handful of primaries on the ballot Tuesday, progressives are hoping they can re-create that magic, often with the help of their new 28-year-old heroine. Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders rallied last month for two Kansas House candidates \u2014 Brent Welder in the 3rd District and James Thompson in the 4th District \u2014 who support progressive priorities like Medicare for all and a higher minimum wage. Welder is vying to take on GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in a top-targeted Kansas City suburban district, which Hillary Clinton won by 1 percentage point in 2016, and some national Democrats worry a far-left candidate could jeopardize their chances. EMILY's List has endorsed Sharice Davids, a former White House fellow under President Barack Obama who would be the first openly lesbian Native American in Congress if elected. A third top-tier candidate, teacher Tom Niermann, has argued for a more centrist approach in trying to flip the district. There's a similar dynamic happening in Michigan's 11th District, another top Democratic pickup opportunity in suburban Detroit. Ocasio-Cortez is backing Fayrouz Saad, a former homeland security official who would be the first Muslim woman elected to Congress. Hillary Clinton has endorsed Haley Stevens, who worked on the auto industry bailout under Obama. Stevens has gotten union support, as has former state House Minority Leader Tim Greimel. Suneel Gupta, a health care technology executive and brother of CNN's Sanjay Gupta, is also running. Ocasio-Cortez has also weighed in for Cori Bush, a young female challenger to Rep. William Lacy Clay in Missouri, hoping to provoke the kind of upset she was able to carry out against another Democratic stalwart. Bush is a pastor and civil rights activist, while Clay has represented the district for almost two decades, succeeding his father, who helped found the Congressional Black Caucus. There's a divide in the Michigan gubernatorial primary too, where Democrats hope to pick up the seat of retiring Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. Long seen as the front-runner, state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer has gotten key labor endorsements and is backed by EMILY's List. She faces Abdul El-Sayed, who has the blessing of both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, and self-funding businessman Shri Thanedar. Republican primaries: Trump endorsement could hurt general election chances in Kansas Trump has also waded into several of Tuesday's GOP contests \u2014 much to the chagrin of some national Republicans. The most noteworthy is in the Kansas governor's race, where Tuesday morning the president tweeted his support for Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Trump ally who has been a conservative lightning rod on issues like immigration. Kobach spearheaded Trump's efforts to prove widespread voter fraud in the 2016 elections \u2014 allegations still without proof. Kris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas.  He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement! Strong on Crime, Border & Military. VOTE TUESDAY! The AP reported Trump weighed in against the urging of his aides, fearing a Kobach victory could endanger the GOP's hold on the state. Kobach is challenging incumbent GOP Gov. Jeff Colyer, who became governor after Trump chose Sam Brownback to be the U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Trump also endorsed Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette in the governor's race over Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who withdrew his support for Trump in October 2016 following the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Snyder has backed Calley, though polls have shown Trump is more popular with Michigan Republicans than is the outgoing governor. In the Senate GOP primary for the nod to face Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Trump backed Iraq War veteran John James, who also has support from many in the GOP establishment. But James first has to fend off wealthy venture capitalist Sandy Pensler, who has poured millions into his own campaign.",

He's headed to Ohio to rally for Republican candidate Troy Balderson in what's becoming an increasingly close special election.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump at a rally in Florida earlier this week. He's headed to Ohio to rally for Republican candidate Troy Balderson in what's becoming an increasingly close special election. The last special congressional election before Election Day is turning into a nail-biter for Republicans. President Trump will make a campaign stop on Saturday for Troy Balderson, a Republican state senator running to represent Ohio's 12th congressional district, which includes affluent suburbs of Columbus as well as rural parts of central Ohio. The Aug. 7 election takes place in a district that voted 53-42 for President Trump in 2016 while returning Rep. Pat Tiberi, a Republican, to Congress by a large margin. But halfway through his term, Tiberi resigned out of frustration with the political climate and took a job leading an Ohio business group, putting a historically Republican seat into play. Balderson's opponent, Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, is riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm in a race that has become a dead heat, according to recent polling. O'Connor has raised more money than Balderson, who has outside Republican groups running ads on his behalf. Last Saturday, Republican voters packed into a carpeted hotel conference room outside Columbus to to hear Balderson speak. \"I gotta get you to the polls. You have to get your friends to the polls. August 7. Keep saying that every minute of every day,\" Balderson urged them. \"August 7, August 7, August 7. Has to happen. We have got to win this race.\" Congressional Republicans began 2018 hoping they could run on their newly enacted tax cuts and the strong economy. Instead, Balderson's campaign is focused on a Trump-style message around immigration and social issues. \"In Congress, Balderson will defend our Christian values and support American jobs by building Trump's wall, deporting illegals, and will be the same fiscal conservative he's been in the state senate,\" one of Balderson's ads said. Republicans like Sue Lorenz, a hospital worker at Ohio Health, approve of that message. \"It's very important to find a replacement for Tiberi who will support Trump's agenda and further conservatives' values,\" Lorenz said. Balderson and his allies charge that a vote for O'Connor is a vote to make Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House. But O'Connor says he doesn't plan to back Pelosi and that Republicans are trying to distract voters. \"I've never once had a voter ask me who I'm going to vote for for speaker. People just don't care. People care about kitchen table issues,\" O'Connor said. \"They care about who's going to fight for their access to earned benefits like social security and Medicare.\" Democrats have outperformed in terms of turnout in almost every special congressional election since 2016, including wins in Alabama and Pennsylvania that took Republican seats, and they see this race as a chance to flip one last seat before the general election. In a district that hasn't been represented by a Democrat since the Reagan years, the race has energized local activists like Phyllis Elmo, one of O'Connor's volunteers. \"I think they're excited because he's young and he brings an energy that we haven't seen,\" Elmo said. \"And he'll talk to people.\" Republicans insist that they're not taking the race for granted. In addition to Trump's visit, Vice President Pence campaigned with Balderson earlier in the week. \"We all are aware of the fact that there's increased Democratic enthusiasm and energy on their side in this political year,\" said Matt Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party. Whoever wins on Tuesday will serve only the remainder of Tiberi's unexpired term. Balderson and O'Connor will face each other again on the ballot on Nov. 6 for a full term.",

            "article_content": "Democrats hope to win control of the house in November. If they win they'll have a challenging task of uniting the ideological poles of their party. Three members were charged with crafting a message that can win an election.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: And now to the upcoming election in this country. House Democrats are preparing their closing argument for why voters should hand them control of the House of Representatives in November. They're hoping a wave of unhappiness with President Trump will help elect everyone from conservative Democrat Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania to Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York. NPR's Kelsey Snell spoke with the trio of House Democrats in charge of making sure all those candidates have a shared message now so they can all come together after the election. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: House Democrats say they have a message for everyone. Their prospects for a victory in November are booming, and they credit it all to a group of candidates tailor-made to challenge Republicans. CHERI BUSTOS: I think the common denominator that I see among these candidates who are running is they are smart, they are independent-minded, they have strong ideas, and they're coming from all different sorts of backgrounds. SNELL: That's Illinois Democrat Cheri Bustos. She is working with David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Hakeem Jeffries of New York on a message that can tie all of the wings of the party together for the campaign and set them up to govern if they win in November. But that means trying to find common ground for all of those independent minds. They want progressives to win in progressive districts and moderates to prevail when they're trying to defeat Republicans, all while still sharing a common bond with party leaders. And Jeffries says they're going to do that by talking about more than just resisting President Trump. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: To the extent that the president has lost support, that just allows for room to have a dialogue, but that doesn't mean the dialogue should be anchored in bashing the president. SNELL: But that's difficult. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's former chief of staff, Nadeam Elshami, says it will only get harder if Democrats win control of the House in November. NADEAM ELSHAMI: In the majority, every member believes she or he has the ability to advance a priority. And while each priority is critical to that particular member or that particular district, it may not fit into the bigger picture. SNELL: Democrats have faced this kind of thing before. They've weathered severe divisions over NAFTA, military intervention and familiar fights over single-payer health care. The trio says their plan this time around is to stick to pocketbook issues, like jobs, protecting the Affordable Care Act and investing in communities. Cicilline says they don't want to be like Republicans in 2010 who ran primarily on opposing President Obama at every turn. They want to focus on promising voters that they will aggressively fight for their values while somehow working with Trump to actually get bills passed. DAVID CICILLINE: If we go into - go into the majority and behave the way that they have behaved, I think we'll be in the majority for two years. I mean, the American people are watching. They expect us to behave differently and work together to produce results that improve their lives. SNELL: That might work for moderates trying to defeat Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Chicago, but it risks alienating passionate candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are running on Medicare for all and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Divisions like those already exist among Democrats in Congress, and they could be magnified by a wave of newcomers. For example, this year, 123 Democrats including Jeffries and Cicilline, signed onto a bill to create Medicare for all without the co-sponsorship of leaders. But Bustos says they'll figure that all out because the bigger mandate is to get bills passed. BUSTOS: There are enough reasonable members of Congress who want to make that happen, but we've got to - we've got to lay that case out to the American public. SNELL: And they have less than 100 days left to do that. Kelsey Snell, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF JOY DIVISION SONG, \"HEART AND SOUL\") Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thirteen socialists walk into a West Virginia bar. It's a Saturday evening in early July, and the North Central West Virginia chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is getting together at a brewery outside of Rivesville. Everyone here has their own stories for how they came to socialism. For chapter co-founder Kelley Rose, a 36-year-old who works for a nonprofit helping young adults stay in school and find jobs, religion played a big part. \"I might be the only one in our little chapter that is a Christian, and it all just fits so perfectly together for me, things that I've always thought anyway along with my values morally and religiously,\" she said. \"Possibly my mother would want to debate me on this, but if anyone was ever a socialist it was Jesus.\" And so, less than a year and a half ago, Rose helped start this chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, making it a part of the DSA's explosive growth nationwide. Membership has grown sevenfold since 2015, from around 6,000 then to 43,000 as of early July. But for all of its recent growth, socialism is still an idea with a lot of Cold War-era baggage for a lot of Americans. Still, the group has gained new prominence with New York Democrat \u2014 and DSA member \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's recent congressional primary win. Here's how one socialist sums up his beliefs: \"I think we just need to realize that the end goal is, ultimately, like social control of the means of production,\" said Joe Cernelli, a founding member of that West Virginia DSA chapter. \"You know we don't just want to improve capitalism, we will ultimately want to get rid of it.\" That's not just his idea; the DSA views capitalism as an oppressive system \u2014 \"We see it as fundamentally undemocratic,\" as DSA National Director Maria Svart put it. Here's how she sums up what the group wants: \"When it comes right down to it, we believe people need to be able to live a dignified life. I mean, there are certain things that should not be left up to the market,\" she said. Removing some parts of the economy from the forces of the free market, for example. In other words, socialism. In the DSA's ideal economy, some sectors \u2014 like health care and utilities \u2014 would be government-controlled. Other businesses would be worker-owned, as Svart explains it. \"Let's say you were negotiating at a bargaining table with workers in a bakery, and the workers said, 'Look, we want more than a quarter of the bread; we want half of the bread, or we want two-thirds of the bread,' \" she said. \"The socialist would say, 'Actually, we want the bakery. We want to control it all, for all of our benefit.' \" It's easy to focus on the \"socialist\" part here, but the word \"democratic\" is also a part of the group's name, and members often stress that part of their ideology. They say putting workers in charge of businesses, for example, necessarily makes those businesses more democratic. But beyond that, the group advocates for some pretty revolutionary changes to democracy, like abolishing the Senate. The DSA calls it \"extremely unrepresentative\" for the way it gives both tiny and huge states alike two senators each \u2014 the group would like to replace it with a more representative body. The country \u2014 and the attitudes of most American voters \u2014 are pretty far from this vision, though, so the DSA is willing to pursue policies that fall short of its ultimate goals. Health care is one example \u2014 the group backs \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 where the government provides health insurance, but the private sector supplies the doctors and hospitals. But many DSA members would prefer a system where the government employs the doctors themselves. The most prominent champion of \"Medicare for All\" is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. While Sanders considers himself a democratic socialist, he is not a DSA member, and his views don't fully align with the DSA. That's true of members like Cernelli, as well. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a 2016 event in New York City. Sanders describes himself as a socialist, but is not a member of the rapidly growing Democratic Socialists of America.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a 2016 event in New York City. Sanders describes himself as a socialist, but is not a member of the rapidly growing Democratic Socialists of America. \"I think we could do better than Bernie, but I think it was definitely a good start,\" he said. \"There are some policies that I think he's been a little too soft on, a little too Democrat for me.\" And this gets at something important about the DSA: while the DSA has its stated goals, there's no orthodoxy members have to follow. \"I'd say one of its strengths is that it's a big tent \u2014 at least on the left,\" said Maurice Isserman, a professor of history at Hamilton College and a charter member of the DSA. \"People come in describing themselves as libertarian socialists or social democrats or anarchists or whatever you know as long as they subscribe to the basic tenets of the organization they can maintain their own political identity within it.\" And because the country is so far from the DSA's ultimate vision, the group has a pragmatic streak in how it approaches its radical ideas. For example, in explaining its electoral strategy, the group acknowledges that it's part of a bigger \"mobilization to defeat Republican rule at the state and national level,\" and that \"chapters may also choose to support progressive, anti-corporate candidates who do not openly identify themselves as socialists.\" And likewise, Svart says, the group sees Sanders as an \"ally\" while also wanting to go further than he does on many areas. It can be really hard to nail down what, exactly, the DSA wants, just by talking to members. There are regional chapters nationwide, each with different priorities, and those chapters have members with different socialist ideas. Beyond that unifying ideology, the group doesn't have a platform that lays out a comprehensive list of positions on a range of topics. However, the group does have three major current campaigns it has agreed upon: \"Medicare for All,\" strengthening unions, and electing Democratic Socialists. \"Medicare for All\": This a term getting thrown around among progressives these days. The basic idea is to take Medicare, which is in part free and in part subsidized for seniors, and give it to everyone else, too. \"We don't want something that's a half measure,\" Svart explained. \"We want to get private industry totally out of the system. We just want to make sure everybody's in. Everybody gets health care.\" This isn't an entirely new idea. In fact, Bernie Sanders talked about it a lot in his presidential campaign. And he got attacked for how much it could cost \u2014 by one estimate, $32 trillion over 10 years. Electing more democratic socialist candidates: It has been 20 years since a member of the DSA was in a national seat. Ocasio-Cortez is set to change that, in a congressional race she is heavily favored to win. She's the most prominent DSA candidate out there, but there's a whole slate of other DSA politicians in smaller races \u2014 Julia Salazar, running for a state seat in New York, Sara Innamorato, running for Pennsylvania's House, and Gabriel Acevero, running for Maryland's House of Delegates, to name a few. Strengthening unions: Svart explained that this involves helping out workers who are organizing or negotiating. \"What that looks like is we show up on picket lines when workers are trying to form a union or negotiate a contract,\" she said. \"If their unions are kind of sitting with their head in the sand and they're not really being effective at organizing their co-workers, we support members organizing their co-workers.\" But once again, these are examples of the group's willingness to accept incremental steps on the way to its bigger, much more radical goals. For example, take the DSA's focus on strengthening unions. The group is helping workers organize now, but it's ultimately in favor of worker-run cooperatives in many industries, as well as putting workers on corporate boards. Even with only a handful of primary victories for the group's candidates, as well as 45,000 members \u2014 a tiny number in the grand scheme of American politics \u2014 the group's new visibility is a big deal, Isserman says. \"This is the most important moment in DSA's history,\" he said. In addition to skyrocketing growth, the group is benefiting from young American adults growing more open to socialist ideas. One 2016 Harvard poll of 18 to 29 year olds found that 33 percent supported socialism. Capitalism was only slightly more popular with that cohort, drawing 42 percent support. \"Thanks to the economic downturn of 2008, which turned the millennial generation in a significant way to the left, it made them much more open to the idea of socialism,\" Isserman explained. On top of that, he added, movements like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street acquainted young Americans with organizing, making them more open to a group like DSA, with its ambitious agenda. And Bernie Sanders, despite not being a DSA member, claimed the label of \"democratic socialist,\" helping the group gain visibility as well. While the electoral gains this year won't be all that big, the size of the group's ideological influence remains to be seen. \"There are a couple of issues that I think will be interesting tells as indicators as to what sort of impact they may have,\" said Mo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic National Committee. \"The most recent one is eliminating ICE.\" Ocasio-Cortez championed the idea of eliminating the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and some Democratic lawmakers have picked it up. That could be one growing sign of DSA clout. Then again, though, it could be easy to mistake the group's newfound visibility for political power. He recognizes that the post-2016 Democratic Party has been moving left, on policies like \"Medicare for All\" and job guarantees. But Elleithee says that's not evidence that socialists caused the shift among Democrats \"Maybe thats the distinction,\" he said. \"There's a progressive wing of the party that I think is having an impact and is helping to frame the debate.\" In other words, it's not that a more popular DSA \u2014 or even socialists more broadly \u2014 is pulling the party left, it's that leftward-moving Democrats are making the group more popular. Still, a lot of the group's policies \u2014 even if they are gaining more adherents \u2014 face an uphill battle. Because of potential cost and also just the radical changes involved, DSA ideas are often criticized as economically and politically unrealistic. Jonathan Williams understands that. He's a first grade teacher who showed up to the brewery to check out his local DSA chapter for the first time. After seeing Hillary Clinton lose in 2016, he explains, he rethought his more moderate politics. \"That Clintonian view of politics I did find appealing for quite some time,\" he said. \"It took seeing it crushed rather decisively and then all of those gains wiped away in the course of 18 months to realize that maybe that wasn't working. And rather than telling myself that good things are impossible that it's not doing any harm to swing for the fences.\" For a voter who thinks the Democratic Party is balking too much, swinging for the fences just seems like the best option.",

Michael Capuano, in Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District. The night Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a Democratic congressional primary in New York, Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city council member who is also challenging a 10-term Democratic House incumbent, tweeted a congratulatory photo. A huge congrats to @Ocasio2018 for your victory tonight! You proved that when we stand up for what we believe in, we win. This is about more than one campaign or election. This is a movement. Together, we will change the world. Congratulations! #ChangeCantWait #Ocasio2018 pic.twitter.com/imORpc1jST And Ocasio-Cortez responded with an equally effusive tweet of her own. It's hard not to see similarities between Pressley's race in Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District and the recent Democratic upset in New York where Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House who might have run to succeed Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pressley, 44, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council in its 100-plus-year history, is taking on a 10-term white male incumbent, Rep. Michael Capuano, 66, who represents an urban district that encompasses Boston, Cambridge and surrounding suburbs, much of the area once represented by a young John F. Kennedy, and now often called the \"Kennedy seat.\" \u201cThe people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.\u201d - @AyannaPressley.Vote her in next, Massachusetts. There are more of us, too: @CoriBush, @Chardo2018, @AyannaPressley & more.We need to elect a corporate PAC-free caucus if we\u2019re going to get things done. https://t.co/M2tF5cedTs But beyond the initial optics, the 7th District primary, which will be held on Sept. 4, is fundamentally different from that in the Bronx and Queens district where Ocasio-Cortez won. Pressley is not an outsider nor does she identify as a Democratic Socialist as Ocasio-Cortez does. She has worked within Democratic Party institutions for most of her career, as a congressional aide for 16 years, first to Rep. Joe P. Kennedy II and then to Sen. John Kerry. Capuano doesn't have the same vulnerabilities as Crowley did in New York. He has taken Pressley as a serious challenger from the outset. He specifically courted endorsements from civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the Congressional Black Caucus PAC and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Capuano is also a known progressive. He supports Medicare-for-all, voted against the Iraq War, refused to attend President Trump's inauguration and has even supported an impeachment vote on the president. The reality is both Pressley and Capuano have similar progressive policies. She calls for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He voted against the Homeland Security Act that originally established ICE. \"There's no daylight between the public policy positions of both candidates,\" said Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist, who helped Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., successfully challenge a Democratic incumbent congressman in 2014. Pressley concedes there is no difference in how they would vote on Capitol Hill, but she also insists that is not why she is running. \"This was the seat held by John F. Kennedy, so having a progressive voting record is baseline,\" she said before referring to Kennedy's famous book. \"That is not necessarily a profile in courage.\" Pressley says even if they vote identically on existing bills, they'll likely write and champion distinctive legislation. She points to the Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act, a bill to improve federal efforts to fight maternal mortality, an issue that disproportionately affects African-American mothers.

Pressley is challenging a 10-term incumbent in the Massachusetts' 7th Congressional District Democratic primary. \"As of yet, no one from our delegation has signed on the MOMMA Act as a co-sponsor,\" Pressley said. \"Now there are 12,000 bills, it's impossible to keep up, I don't think this means they don't care about it. But if I'm there, this is an issue I'm focused on.\" She also points to her record as a Boston council member on gun violence, structural racism and the wage gap.  Capuano points to his experience, seniority on committees and record of delivering both results and money for infrastructure projects around Boston. With no major policy arguments, the fight boils down to representation, worldview and how much race, gender and age ought to matter in Democratic Party politics. And although a majority of residents in the Boston-area district are not white, an analysis by NPR member station WBUR found that a majority of voters are white. Pressley's campaign slogan is \"change can't wait.\" She is tired of some people suggesting it's \"traitorous\" to challenge a fellow Democrat. She points out that the 7th District is the most diverse district in the state, but also has very high income inequality. And that's the message she delivers on campaign stops. \"Listen, I'm not saying vote for me because I'm a black woman, but I won't pretend representation doesn't matter. It matters,\" she told a couple dozen women and girls of color at a Dominican restaurant in Boston. \"This district is 57 percent people of color and almost 40 percent single-female-headed households. The district has changed,\" she said. \"The needs of this district have changed, and the job description has changed.\" But Capuano, who has held this job for 20 years and never faced a serious challenge until now, takes issue with that line of criticism. \"All districts change,\" he said. \"This district, greater Boston, is a very transient neighborhood. It's always changing.\" Plus, he insists, the district does not have a simple majority demographic. \"There's no majority of any race, any creed, any ethnicity, anybody,\" he said. \"And anybody who wants to govern this district, really has to reach out to people that don't look like them ... and don't think like them.\" Rep.

Capuano struggles to understand why some voters think race and gender are relevant in this race. \"I've always been put off by identity politics on every level,\" he told The Boston Globe in May. When asked about representation, he tends to pivot the conversation back to his record on housing or transportation. \"Look, I cannot be a woman of color,\" he told WBUR in February. \"I just don't think there's that many people who will vote for me because I'm a white male, or against me because I'm a white male.\" When Capuano campaigns, he doesn't talk much about his opponent; he tries to focus on his own record. But he has said that \"it's unfortunate\" Democrats are spending time and money on a \"family fight\" when their real foe is President Trump. \"I hear people who want me to fight against Donald Trump. I hear people who talk to me about issues, and the issues I hear mostly, first of all, are Donald Trump on pretty much everything,\" Capuano said at a recent campaign stop in a Boston suburb. At another stop in a senior center in his hometown of Somerville, Capuano never once mentioned his rival. Instead, he spoke about Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and Republicans. \"There's a lot of way to kill something, one way is to bankrupt it, so even if they don't repeal it, say 'we're gonna get rid of Obamacare, we're gonna get rid of Medicare,' they can still bankrupt it,\" he told a group of a seniors. There is no doubt that Capuano has the money and the loyalty of a popular incumbent. \"You have to have a reason to turn Mike Capuano out of office, and I don't see that,\" said Ferson. But all signs in the midterm elections suggest this is the year of the woman, specifically the Democratic woman. Doug Rubin, a Democratic consultant in Boston, says it's plausible voters might think Capuano has done a good job as a congressman and yet still want a change. \"There is a real kind of organization around women voters who want to send a message to Trump,\" he said. \"And Ayanna is in a perfect position to take advantage of that.\" Regardless of who wins, Rubin says a family fight every so often is healthy. It motivates people to get to the polls and that may be just what Democrats need, he says, not just here in Massachusetts, but all over the country.",

Many top Democrats said they were surprised and shaken by Ocasio-Cortez's defeat of Rep. Joe Crowley, one of their top leaders. House Democrats were still reeling Wednesday after one of their top leaders, Rep. Joe Crowley, lost his primary in New York City to a 28-year-old first-time candidate named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The shocking upset is a significant blow to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her other top deputies, who have been battling calls from within their membership to step aside and allow a new generation of leaders to take the helm. Crowley's loss adds new intensity to a simmering fight over the direction of the Democratic Party and who should lead it. Pelosi defended her slot at the top of the party Wednesday at a news conference in the Capitol. \"I'm female; I'm progressive,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"So what's your problem? Two out of three ain't bad.\" Pelosi has become the focus of intense debate in congressional districts across the country. Republicans target her as the national image of a Democratic Party of coastal elites, while some in her own party use her as a symbol of the ways party leaders are out of sync with an increasingly diverse, progressive electorate. Ocasio-Cortez embodies nearly every attribute of that surging left wing. She is an activist who identifies as a Democratic socialist. She has the support of liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., whose platform includes Medicare for all, free college tuition for every student and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many top House Democrats said Wednesday that they were surprised and shaken by Crowley's loss \u2014 but they remained confident that his failure was a fluke. Pelosi told reporters that she does not believe that Democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez are ascendant in the party in general. \"The fact that in a very progressive district in New York it went more progressive than \u2014 well, Joe Crowley is a progressive \u2014 but more to the left than Joe Crowley, is about that district,\" Pelosi said. \"It is not to be viewed as something that stands for everything else.\" Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, D-S.C., also blamed a leftward shift in Crowley's district, which covers Queens and parts of the Bronx, for the loss. But he also suggested that Crowley could have done more to make sure he understood and reflected his constituents. \"It's obvious that something went wrong with his relationship with his constituents,\" Clyburn said. \"Sometimes you misread the tea leaves.\" Clyburn, 77, and Pelosi, 78, are often criticized themselves for growing out of step with the new, fresh faces of their party \u2014 a characterization they both vehemently reject. Pelosi often calls the criticism a sexist, ageist attack, and Clyburn is quick to remind reporters of the challenges he faced running for office in the South. \"I hope you'd recognize how late in life I got here and other people who look like me,\" Clyburn told reporters on Wednesday. \"I didn't come here at 28 because laws wouldn't allow me to be here. So don't tell me how late it was. I started late because of the laws of this country.\" Others in the party, like rising star Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., simply blamed the unpredictable nature of elections. \"It is the message that comes out of every election,\" Kennedy said. \"There's two ways to run a race, unopposed or scared.\" But Kennedy said Democrats could learn from the shock of Tuesday night in New York. Referring to what he sees as frustration of both Democrats and Republicans with Washington, Kennedy suggested: \"It's worth spending some extra time making sure that every member of Congress is doing what they need to do to represent the aspirations and concerns of their district.\"",

Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., speaks to supporters at the opening of her campaign field office on May 18 in Ferguson, Mo. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that \"Democrats are going to spend the next few months, including the August work period, focusing on the nation's health care system.\" Every campaign manager running a Democratic campaign would have winced at that idea, had it come at any point between 2009 and 2017. \"I would be pretty surprised,\" said Guy Cecil, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee's executive director in 2012 and 2014, at the idea a Democrat would willingly draw attention to health care so close to an election. Republicans hammered the Affordable Care Act or ACA, over and over, in the years after its passage in 2010. \"Everything that was bad about health care was all the fault of Obamacare,\" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill told a Missouri crowd last fall. \"Which of course wasn't true, but it was powerful, politically.\" So powerful that Republicans won control of the House in 2010, and then the Senate in 2014, attacking Obamacare. But in 2018, Democrats see health care as their issue, and a key way to defend the seats of McCaskill and the nine other Democrats running for reelection in states President Trump carried in 2016. McCaskill has made health care \u2013 particularly prescription drug costs \u2013 a central focus over the past year. \"You're going to hear me talk about it non-stop,\" she said during a visit to a Missouri senior center in March. \"It is outrageous, the stress right now that people feel right now about climbing health care costs.\" Videos of McCaskill discussing health care costs make up much of her official YouTube page. Democrats see the health care focus as a viable defense against the politically unfriendly territory this year's Senate campaign is playing out on, as well as increasingly positive views voters hold about the economy and the general direction of the country. \"Health-care costs remain one of the top issues in every state in the country,\" Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who heads the Senate Democrats' campaign committee, recently told reporters. \"And when you look at that issue, the most recent poling I've seen on that...shows a 20-point advantage for Democrats.\" As Democrats raise alarms about future Obamacare repeals, Republicans have responded by raising alarms about how a Democrat-controlled Congress would lead to a government-takeover of health care. Indeed, the Democratic Party has shifted to the left on health care in recent years, with multiple likely 2020 presidential candidates signing onto Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' bill creating a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health care system. Republicans also try to shift the blame for rising premiums and other ACA problems on the Democrats who created the system. President Trump attempted to tag Democrats on the issue in a tweet last summer. The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare! But polls show that just as Trump is getting credit for the economy he inherited from Obama, he also gets the blame for the health care status quo. \"Voters began thinking about the ACA differently when the debate began in earnest about repealing the law and replacing the law,\" said Drew Altman, the president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks and polls health care views. \"And they began to understand that benefits that they cared about, or their families cared about, or their friends cared about, may be lost.\" Cecil, who now runs Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, agreed. \"Really, from that point forward we've seen in almost every special election so far this year and last year, and the Virginia governor's race, that health care continuously is a top-three issue for voters, even when the campaign is not about health care.\" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making protecting Obamacare a central argument in the advertising it's running in key House districts Democrats are trying to flip from red to blue. Beyond Obamacare, with Republicans holding all the power in Washington, Democrats feel emboldened to blame the GOP for all other health care woes, including rising drug costs and insurance premiums. Voters by and large buy that argument. Just as Trump is getting increasing credit for the improving economy he inherited from Obama, he's taking the blame for shortcomings voters see elsewhere. \"They're the government and they own it, and they're responsible for the problems with the law, whatever they are,\" said Altman. On the Senate floor Wednesday, Schumer promised to spend the coming months in Washington \"focusing on all our Republican friends have done to drive up the costs of health care to average Americans, and what we should be doing to reverse that awful trend.\" Expect that in Fall advertisements and campaign messaging, too \u2014 even if Democratic operatives who rode out the 2014 and 2010 campaign cycles when the issue was a negative for the party may flinch at the thought of the idea.",

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., speaks to reporters in front of the courthouse in Newark, N.J., on Nov. 16, 2017. The federal bribery trial of Menendez ended in a mistrial when the jury said it was deadlocked on all charges against him. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez escaped federal criminal prosecution. But he couldn't escape the judgment of his Senate colleagues. The bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee unanimously issued a rare rebuke on Thursday, formally admonishing the senator for his conduct over a six-year period with his longtime friend and political ally Dr. Salomon Melgen. The long-dormant panel \u2014 which had not issued a public release since 2012 \u2014 said Menendez brought discredit to the Senate and ordered him to repay all impermissible gifts and refile his financial disclosure reports to reflect repayment. Menendez faced federal bribery and corruption charges stemming from his relationship with Melgen. Federal prosecutors alleged pay-to-play corruption, in which Melgen lavished gifts, trips and political donations on Menendez in exchange for political favors. The trial ended in mistrial last November, when jurors were unable to reach a verdict. The government case collapsed earlier this year and Menendez has resumed his place in the Senate, including his role as the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In its verdict, the Senate Ethics Committee noted that his trial did not result in a conviction but found that Menendez's conduct ran afoul of what is proper for a U.S. senator. \"The criminal system, however, neither enforces nor supplants the Senate's rules or standards of conduct, and the Committee's action stands independent from that result,\" the panel wrote. Separately, Melgen was convicted of stealing $73 million from Medicare and sentenced to 17 years in prison in February. Thursday's admonishment was the first formal action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee in six years, a fact that has often led to criticism that the panel lacks rigorous oversight of senators' conduct. The last senator to receive a formal admonishment from the panel was Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in 2012. Menendez is running for re-election this November in a state that is reliably Democratic, but Senate Republicans see an opportunity to use this ethics admonishment against him in the 2018 campaign. \"Bob Menendez's scandalous conduct laid out in this letter should outrage every New Jersey voter,\" said Bob Salera, a spokesman for the Senate GOP's 2018 campaign operation, in a statement. Republicans are rallying around former pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin as their likely candidate. \"Elect a Senator New Jersey can be proud of,\" reads his campaign website.",

Tipirneni faces Republican Debbie Lesko in a special election next week. In a congressional district that is considered as red as the sun is bright, Democrats see a tiny opening in an upcoming special election in Arizona after a surprising victory in a similar race last month in Pennsylvania. Voters in Arizona's 8th Congressional District, northwest of Phoenix, are choosing a replacement for Trent Franks, who resigned abruptly last year amid sexual harassment allegations. Last weekend, Democrat Hiral Tipirneni had a reminder for the dozens of volunteers gathered at Wigwam Creek Middle School in Litchfield Park, Ariz. \"After what we learned in Pennsylvania, every vote counts. We know this. Every vote,\" she told the crowd. \"Nobody can afford to sit it out.\" While Republicans are taking nothing for granted, Tipirneni sees a path to victory. \"Talk about the issues,\" she said. \"We're not talking about the ideology. It's not a D versus R thing. It's a, 'Hey I have a health care plan that's gonna get us to a place where every American [has] a quality, affordable health care. My opponent does not.' \" Tipirneni, a physician, had planned on challenging Franks in this Fall's midterms. After Franks resigned in December, a slew of Republicans ran to replace him in a special primary election. A well-known state lawmaker won: Debbie Lesko. \"This is a special election,\" Lesko said of the national attention the race is getting. \"We Republicans need to prove to the Democrats that they do not have a chance of winning in this solid Republican district.\" Debbie Lesko (left) is a former state lawmaker who resigned her seat to run in the special primary election to replace Trent Franks in Congress.

The district is Arizona's 8th, northwest of Phoenix. How solid is it? The last time this suburban area sent a Democrat to Congress was 1980. That representative, Bob Stump, then switched parties and became a Republican. As of Thursday, early voting numbers show the number of registered Republicans who have sent in their ballots outnumber registered Democrats by over 31,000. Sitting on her golf cart in a strip mall parking lot, Republican Peggy Harmon said she already voted for Lesko. \"Because she's Republican. We don't need no more Democrats. So I'll vote for all Republicans now,\" she said. Still, national GOP groups are spending significantly on the race. The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have together put in over $900,000 for things like TV ads and door-to-door canvassers. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., headlined a fundraiser for Lesko on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Alex Conant, a Republican strategist with Firehouse Strategies, argued the money is an insurance policy. \"I think the costs for Republicans, if they were to somehow neglect the race and somehow lose, it would be a big problem,\" he said. \"So I think that's part of why you're seeing the party make this modest investment.\" In contrast, Democratic groups have spent very little, even as Tipirneni's campaign has raised more than Lesko's. To win, they'll need to convince voters like John Eckardt. He usually votes Republican but is nervous that the GOP might make changes to Medicare and Social Security. \"This fooling with Medicare and Social Security is a bad thing,\" he said. \"Because people have worked for it and paid into it for all the years that they worked. They should get it.\" Lesko said she'd never vote to cut those programs for current retirees, but has supported the idea of changes for future beneficiaries. There's one wild card that makes GOP activist Lezlee Alexander nervous: \"You never know what's coming out of D.C. and how it's gonna affect everybody.\" Asked if she was referring to something President Trump might do or say, she said, \"Yeah, exactly.\" Tuesday's result could end Republicans' jitters \u2014 for now.

Ryan, 48, cited wanting to be around his adolescent children more often. Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Wednesday that he will not seek re-election and will retire in January. \"You all know I did not seek this job,\" Ryan said, addressing reporters. \"I took it reluctantly. ... I have no regrets.\" Ryan, 48, cited wanting to be around his adolescent children more often. \"My kids aren't getting any younger,\" Ryan said, \"and if I stay, they'll only know me as a weekend dad. That's it right there.\" Ryan has three teenage children. He noted that his oldest just turned 16, which was how old Ryan was when his father died. \"I think we have achieved a heck of a lot,\" Ryan said, noting that Republicans \"did big things.\" But the GOP-controlled Congress was only able to pass a signature tax cut legislation. That was something Ryan has been focused on since he entered Congress in 1999. On the other hand, Republicans during his tenure were unable to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, advance the ball on entitlement reform or cut the deficit. In fact, the deficit has only gone up. After a high-profile failure last year, Ryan described the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as \"the law of the land.\" And Congress is not expected to get much, if anything, else done this year before the midterms. Republican challenges Ryan's departure is the highest-profile retirement yet in what has been a record number of Republicans already heading for the exits. Ryan wasn't the only person to announce his retirement on Wednesday: Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., also said he won't run for re-election. That means a total of 39 GOP members are not running for re-election \u2014 24 are retiring from public office altogether, while 15 are seeking other positions. Democrats, meanwhile, are facing about half of that number with only 18 of their members not running for re-election to the House. There have been rumors for some time that Ryan could retire. And his tenure has been something of an uneasy one \u2014 even before taking the job. Ryan ran for the post after House Speaker John Boehner was ousted, under pressure from conservatives in his conference. He was thought to have little interest in the job, given his position as chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. But he was roundly seen as the only person who could get the votes necessary to be elected speaker. Those tensions didn't entirely go away within his conference, and then along came Donald Trump. Ryan was critical of Trump's demeanor during the 2016 campaign, but he soon swallowed those criticisms when Trump won. Hoping to push forward on conservative legislation, Ryan worked with the president more than against, but he was still \u2014 on a near-daily basis \u2014 quizzed by reporters on the latest Trump tweet or sound-off. Ryan did not mention Trump in his press conference but a source familiar with the speaker's decision insisted that it had nothing to do with Trump. Trump tweeted out praise for Ryan on Wednesday, calling him a \"truly good man.\" He also touts his \"legacy of achievement that nobody can question.\" Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul! From House staffer to Speaker Ryan grew up in a Catholic family in Janesville, Wis., After his father died, he worked a series of blue collar jobs to help support his family and himself \u2014 from McDonald's to camp counselor to an Oscar Mayer salesman who once drove the company's famed Wienermobile. Ryan was also a former congressional staffer before he rose to the highest position in the House. He interned for Wisconsin GOP Sen. Bob Kasten while he was attending college at Miami University of Ohio and later joined his staff. He had some odd jobs to help make ends meet during that time too, working as a waiter at a Capitol Hill watering hole and as a fitness trainer. The politician who had the greatest influence on Ryan by far was New York Rep. Jack Kemp, the famed tax reform crusader and supply-side economics evangelist. He was a speechwriter for Kemp, would go on to work for the think tank he co-founded, Empower America, and would also follow in his footsteps as an ultimately unsuccessful candidate for vice president. Ryan also served as legislative director for then-Kansas Rep. Sam Brownback. When Ryan returned to Wisconsin to launch his own political career (running for and winning an open seat in 1998 when he was only 28 years old), he adopted many of those same conservative fiscal philosophies once he got to Congress. In addition to pushing for tax cuts, Ryan would go on to put an emphasis also on cutting the deficit and balancing the budget via major changes to social programs such as Medicare and Social Security. His first major policy push came during the George W. Bush administration when he championed the president's plan to create private Social Security accounts. That crusade failed, but Ryan had put begun to make his mark on the House GOP conference. In 2007, he was named the top Republican on the House Budget Committee and regularly rolled out his own alternative budget frameworks to contrast with President Obama's fiscal plans. Once Republicans won back the House in 2010, Ryan became one of the \"Young Gun\" GOP leaders on the rise and assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate. After the duo lost, Ryan tried to refocus on working on anti-poverty policies and becoming part of a bipartisan group who wanted immigration reform. In 2015, he would become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, giving him his biggest platform yet to push through some of his conservative economic ideas. Later that year, he would reluctantly succumb to calls for him to run for speaker after Boehner stepped aside. Looking ahead Ryan has said he fully expects that this will be his last job in elected politics and the source familiar with the speaker's decision would not discuss Ryan's plans or next steps. \"He has always believed this [being speaker] is not a long-term thing,\" said the source. But getting out of the spotlight now, especially in the Trump era, could help Ryan should he change his mind about running for office again down the road. Ryan, the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney in 2012, is, after all, only 48. Being a congressional leader is usually not helpful to a politician's public image. They often become lightning rods for political partisanship. By getting out now, one theory goes, Ryan could lay low and potentially run for president at a later date. Ryan's exit also adds another potential target for Democrats looking to take over the House this year. The filing deadline to get on the primary ballot in Wisconsin is June 1. The primary is Aug. 14. Although Ryan won his last re-election with 65 percent of the vote, he was facing a strong challenge from Democrat Randy Bryce this year, who had already raised more than $4.7 million. \"Paul Ryan decided to quit today rather than face Randy Bryce and the voters,\" said Bryce's communications director, Lauren Hitt. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the current minority leader, called Ryan \"an avid advocate for his point of view.\" She added, \"Despite our differences, I commend his steadfast commitment to our country. During his final months, Democrats are hopeful that he joins us to work constructively to advance better futures for all Americans.\" Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.",

President Trump's proposed budget flirts with combating high prescription drug prices, but industry watchers say the tweaks to Medicare and Medicaid do little more than dance around the edges of the problem. The White House's proposal, which comes after Congress passed a two-year spending deal Friday, though, sets the tone for the administration's focus on prescription drugs. \"Drug costs are a populist issue for the president,\" and he's made it clear to his staff that progress needs to be made this year, said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a health care consulting firm. The proposal would cut billions of dollars in drug spending in the federal Medicare program, which provides health care for about 60 million people age 65 and older or younger patients with disabilities. The budget would also alter drug spending in Medicaid's safety-net program for nearly 70 million Americans. The sheer size of the federal government's Medicare and Medicaid programs means any drug pricing tweaks that do get made are meaningful \u2014 just not necessarily groundbreaking. \"The main question is, how far are they actually going to go in dealing with the underlying problem?\" said Paul Van de Water, who spent nearly two decades in the Congressional Budget Office and is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Most of the proposals for Medicare, for example, move money around rather than force a drop in prices, Van de Water said. Alex Azar, the newly appointed secretary of Health and Human Services, said the proposed budget supports the work his agency is already doing to reduce the high cost of prescriptions, \"especially for America's seniors.\" Just last month, the former Eli Lilly executive told Congress during his confirmation hearings that \"all drug prices are too high in this country.\" Highlights from the proposals include: Creating a five-state pilot project to allow state Medicaid programs to negotiate prices with manufacturers and create their own drug formularies, or preferred lists of medicines. Trump entered office with blustering promises to bring drug prices \"way down.\" But critics have charged that the White Househas failed to engage Congress on cost-cutting ideas, and that a leaked draft of an executive order last summer read like a wish list for the industry. With the proposed budget, the administration is trying to recast that narrative at a time when Republicans in Congress may be willing to compromise. \"Americans want Washington to lower prescription drug prices, and our paper provides policy options that would make drugs more accessible to Americans, today and in the future,\" wrote D.J. Nordquist, chief of staff for the president's Council of Economic Advisers, in an email late Friday after the council released a 28-page report on tackling drug prices. The CEA paper and the president's budget come on the heels of Congress passing a spending pact Friday that includes a big benefit to Medicare enrollees at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry. The budget proposes closing the doughnut hole in 2019, a year earlier than expected. Republicans \"just showed a propensity to sort of take on the industry,\" said Jayson Slotnik, a policy consultant and partner at Health Policy Strategies. And there is political upside for doing more since Republicans are concerned about this year's November midterm elections approaching, Slotnik said: \"They can run and [say] it's something they have accomplished.\" Yet James Love, director of the nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International, said Trump's proposals are not \"insightful or original\" and, referring to the council's report, said it \"could have been written by PhRMA,\" the powerful trade group for pharmaceutical manufacturers. PhRMA released a statement late Monday applauding the provision to pass on rebates to Medicare beneficiaries but also raising concerns about other elements of the budget proposal, saying they would \"limit access to innovative medicines.\" Experts from the academic and think-tank world said the district has seen several of these policies before. For example, the rebate and discount pass-through proposal has been a topic of discussion within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for more than a year and is already in the rulemaking process. Another proposal that lowers reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs that are new to the program is reminiscent of an Obama-era pilot that never got off the ground. Tara O'Neill Hayes, who focuses on health policy at the conservative American Action Forum, said several Medicare proposals were also similar to those found in a June 2016 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. If all the Medicare proposals took effect \u2014 including one that calls for more flexibility in drug formularies \u2014 O'Neill Hayes said overall premiums could go up slightly for all Part D beneficiaries, but that would be offset by lowering out-of-pocket payments for the beneficiaries with the highest drug costs. \"You're going to have winners and losers,\" she said. \"The real winners here are going to be the incredibly high-cost patients.\" Trump's budget requires hospitals to provide a minimum level of charity care to get an additional payment adjustment under the 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide drugs at steep discounts to hospitals and clinics with a high proportion of low-income patients. The administration lowered reimbursement amounts for hospitals earlier this year, and Mendelson at Avalere said he expects more changes. In reviewing Trump's budget and the council report, Allan Coukell, senior director of health programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said several of the proposals \"have the potential to reduce out-of-pocket costs, several have the potential to increase competition within the programs and/or move people toward lower cost drugs. None of it changes the overall trajectory\" of rising sticker prices. Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
