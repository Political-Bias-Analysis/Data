            "article_content": "Checking blood pressure of female patient, unrecognizable people (iStock) The distance people live from the equator may influence their blood pressure, a new study suggests. Researchers found that people in Chile who lived at greater distances from the equator had higher average blood-pressure levels compared with people who lived closer to 0 degrees latitude. The study also found that the 37 percent of people in the country's southern latitudes (farther from the equator) had blood pressure high enough to diagnose the individuals with hypertension, whereas only 29 percent of those in the northern latitudes had hypertension. The findings were published online May 5 in the American Journal of Epidemiology. The researchers said they studied Chile because it is the longest country in the world, running for about 2,640 miles (4,250 kilometers) from north to south, and because it has a homogeneous, or ethnically similar, population throughout its extent. This allowed the researchers to examine similar individuals over a wide range of latitudes. [5 Surprising Ways to be Heart Healthy] The study demonstrated that subjects' blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension is highest in the south of Chile, which is farthest from the equator, compared to the north of the country, which is nearer to the equator, said Dr. Charles Ferro, a kidney specialist at University Hospitals Birmingham in England, and the lead author of the study. The link between higher blood pressure and higher latitudes held true even after researchers took into account many socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that could influence people's blood pressure. These factors included the individuals' age, sex, income, smoking habits, fruit and vegetable intake, salt intake, weight, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and history of diabetes or heart problems, Ferro said. Location matters In the study, the researchers analyzed data collected from about 4,600 adults in Chile who had their blood pressure measured at their homes in the morning after an overnight fast, as part of a national health survey within the country. The researchers said they wanted to to evaluate whether blood pressure is affected by geographic latitude, solar radiation (a measure of the light and energy from the sun) and ambient temperature (outdoor temperature without factoring in variables, such as humidity or wind speed). Just as location matters in real estate, it also seems to make a difference to blood pressure: The study found that the systolic blood pressure (the top or first number in a reading) of people living in southern latitudes in Chile was on average more than 5 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) higher than in people in northern locations, Ferro said. And the rate of high blood pressure among people who resided in the south of the country was more than 8 percent higher than in the north, he said. [9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less)] There wasn't a clear relationship in the study between blood pressure and solar radiation or ambient temperature, the researchers said. Among the people in the study, change in latitude translated into change in blood pressure in the following way: For every 1 degree increase in latitude away from the equator, systolic blood pressure increased by 0.1 mmHg, and the prevalence of hypertension increased by just under 1 percent, Ferro said. These are relatively small changes, which is why it takes a large distance, such as the extent of the whole country of Chile, to detect these subtle differences in a population, he said. The reasons why latitude influences blood pressure, even to a small extent, are unclear, Ferro said. Other studies have suggested that people's salt intake, the number of daylight hours in their area, their sleep patterns and their levels of vitamin D all might play a role, the researchers said. There is also increasing evidence that ultraviolet radiation directly lowers blood pressure, potentially by increasing the release of nitric oxide, a substance that may help widen blood vessels, Ferro said. Other possible explanations are that living near the equator could result in more active lifestyles or healthier diets, but the researchers tried to control for these factors in this study, he said. But a better understanding of how the link may work could lead to insights into the condition of hypertension, and its causes. Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company. All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Calls her the most qualified candidate to run for the presidency President Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton to succeed him in the White House Thursday, saying she has the \"courage\" for the job and vowing to hit the campaign trail for her soon -- in a video message posted just moments after meeting with her primary rival Bernie Sanders. \"I know how hard this job can be. That\u2019s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,\" the president said, in the video posted on Clinton's campaign site.\u00a0\"In fact, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\" The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday. The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted that she's \"fired up.\" Honored to have you with me, @POTUS. I'm fired up and ready to go! -H Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump immediately fired back. To which the Clinton campaign tweeted: \"Delete your account.\" Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention. \"Anybody who thinks that whoever the next president is -- \u00a0and God willing, in my view, it will be Secretary Clinton.\" The White House, meanwhile, said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination. The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders. Sanders afterward struck a conciliatory tone Thursday, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can \u201cwork together to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The Vermont senator said he still plans to compete in next Tuesday\u2019s Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar. And he said he plans to take his message \u201cto the Democratic National Convention\u201d in July. He did not, however, say specifically whether he would still be an active candidate by then, taking no questions from the press before heading over to a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. The meeting with Obama was private. They met for over an hour, and Fox News is told no staff or aides were present. But his tone, compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, appeared to soften. While offering no endorsement himself, Sanders said he spoke with Clinton and congratulated her \u201con her very strong campaign.\u201d And Sanders thanked Obama for his \u201cimpartiality\u201d throughout the process. He said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their \u201cthumb on the scales.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying \"it is time now to unite our party.\" Clinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders \u2013 and his supporters \u2013 into the fold. The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Trump intensifies. Sanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he\u2019ll do everything in his power to prevent Trump\u2019s election. As for what he wants, Sanders said he\u2019ll continue to fight what he called the \u201cdrift\u201d toward an oligarchic society. He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues he\u2019ll bring to the Philadelphia convention. Whether that means a fight to overhaul the party platform \u2013 or a last-ditch bid to somehow deny Clinton the nomination \u2013 remains to be seen. One demand Sanders was thought to be considering \u2013 as part of a party-unity deal -- is the removal of Democratic boss\u00a0Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders and the DNC chairwoman have been at odds for months, with Sanders\u2019 team long accusing her of helping now-presumptive nominee Clinton. Whether Sanders sought \u2013 and the president would even consider \u2013 a Schultz sacrifice is unclear. \u201cI don\u2019t see how she makes it through the convention,\u201d one Democratic lawmaker told Fox News. \u201cThe key to Hillary winning is getting Sanders supporters on board.\u201d Speculation over Wasserman Schultz\u2019 position has swirled for months, however, and so far she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle. Asked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she\u2019s not worried about her job. \u201cI'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president\u2019s support,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "FILE: 2004: People line up to vote at Crieve Hall Elementary School in Nashville, Tenn. (AP) Every election cycle we must endure challenges and allegations about fraud (conservatives) and discrimination (liberals) when it comes to voter ID laws. This year is no different. A federal court ruled that the Texas Voter ID law passed in 2011, requiring voters to present official photo identification, discriminated again poor, minority and disabled voters and ordered a judge to approve new interim rules for the Nov. 8 election. The new rules will broaden the list of acceptable forms of ID. Voters will now be able to present, among other things, an expired ID, a government check or a current utility bill. \"Supporting documents don't have to have a photo, reports The Austin Chronicle, \"but if they happen to, then voters will need to present the original. Otherwise, they can present a copy.\" Similar battles over voter identification laws are being waged in other states, notably Wisconsin and North Carolina. It's worth reviewing the list of the seven forms of identification currently accepted by Texas law -- a Texas driver license issued by the Department of Public Safety (DPS); a Texas election identification card issued by DPS; a personal identification card issued by DPS; a license to carry a handgun issued by DPS; U.S. military identification card containing the person's photo; U.S. citizenship certificate containing the person's photograph; a U.S. passport. Why are liberal groups determined to repeal laws requiring proof of citizenship and residence? The answer is found in a definition of the word fraud... Granted, most poor people are unlikely to have a passport, but the state will issue any legal resident an identification card. Are civil rights groups who sued the state contending that poor and minority people are so inept that they can't apply for an identification card? If that is their position, how are they able to apply for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program) benefits, which require a photo ID? Why is voting the one category in which you don't have to prove your citizenship and legal residence? I will answer that question in a moment. Three years ago during a similar controversy, Ashe Schow of The Washington Examiner compiled a list of 24 things that require a photo ID. You must have a photo ID if you are 25 or under and wish to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. Store signs say so. Want to open a bank account? Photo ID required. Here are the rest of the categories: applying for welfare, Medicaid and Social Security (presumably poor people take advantage of one or more of these programs); unemployment benefits (ditto); rent/buy a house, or apply for a mortgage; drive/buy/rent a car; get on an airplane; get married; buy a gun; adopt a pet; rent a hotel room; apply for a hunting or fishing license; buy a cellphone; visit a casino; pick up a prescription (or buy restricted over-the-counter medications); donate blood; apply for a license to hold a demonstration; buy an \"M\"-rated video game; purchase nail polish at CVS. Again, why is voting placed in a separate category? Why are liberal groups determined to repeal laws requiring proof of citizenship and residence? The answer is found in a definition of the word fraud: \"deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.\" Since many poor people are receiving government benefits, they are responsive to Democrats' claims that Republicans want to cut them off, so they had better vote early and vote often, as the saying goes, or else. Notice the left never focuses on emancipating people from poverty. That might make the poor independent of government, which would be intolerable to the left. They need a reliable voting bloc and keeping the poor dependent on government is a modern form of slavery that is cynical in the extreme. Unless discrimination against an individual can be proved, these voter ID laws should be upheld. Otherwise, expect more votes from dead people, illegal aliens, people with false addresses and even Mickey Mouse. All of these scenarios have occurred in previous elections and are likely to be repeated in this and future ones without proper identification.",

City officials plan to present an overview of security preparation Tuesday, May 31, 2016, for this summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, seeking to counter continuing concerns about readiness to host the event expected to bring 50,000 visitors to northeast Ohio. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File) In less than 5 days, more than 50,000 people will arrive in Cleveland for the 2016 Republican National Convention. When friends and family ask about my job, they want to know: When they tune in this July, what part of the program or piece of staging should they look for? What\u2019s kept me so busy for more than a year? The answer is that my most meaningful contributions won\u2019t be on their television screens. In order to see my proudest moments, my friends would have to visit the homes, schools, shelters, small businesses, and hospitals in our host city. They would have to meet the people I\u2019ve come to know in those places and listen to convention staffers tell stories about volunteering there. As the convention\u2019s deputy director of public and community affairs, my job is to make sure we\u2019re not only promoting our host city, but also thoughtfully engaging with and contributing to the Cleveland community. For me, success isn\u2019t measured by a four-day period in July, but by the impact we have on and in Cleveland\u2014long before the first delegate arrives and long after we\u2019ve swept up the last piece of confetti. When I arrived in Cleveland over a year ago, the plan was to build an engagement effort that was more than a loose patchwork of good deeds and good works. We wanted to be a great partner to serve a common goal: to help make this city\u2019s motto, \u201cProgress and Prosperity,\u201d a reality for every member of the Cleveland community. We started with the local economy. Cleveland is a city on the rise, but you can still see evidence of its on-going struggle to recover from the recession that began in 2008. \u00a0Economically, the brightest rays of hope radiate from the city\u2019s small and mid-sized businesses. They are the engines of economic opportunity, and we are doing everything we can to help them succeed. Through our Host Committee\u2019s vendor guide, we\u2019ve encouraged groups planning convention-related events to \u201cgo local\u201d for the goods and services they need. Recently, our partner, Google, held a workshop where over 100 local business owners learned how to build a company website and establish a strong presence online. And we\u2019ve highlighted the convention\u2019s 12 caterers and six florists, all local businesses poised for growth. Armed with the tools to attract new customers, Cleveland\u2019s businesses should see higher receipts this summer\u2014and a lasting impact on their bottom line. We\u2019ve also supported community initiatives that encourage learning and leadership. Cleveland\u2019s poverty rate means many students are at risk of dropping out of high school or falling behind in grade school. \u00a0Community initiatives like the Sara J. Harper Library are improving those odds. Judge Harper has lived a life of \u201cfirsts\u201d: the first black woman to graduate from Case Western University, the first woman on the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve judiciary, one of the first two black women elected to the Ohio 8th District Court of Appeals, and the first black woman to sit on the Ohio Supreme Court. \u00a0She established a library in her childhood neighborhood, the public housing at Outhwaite, because she wanted the kids who live there to have books, learning programs, and the inspiration they need to succeed. We\u2019re proud to highlight the library\u2019s education-related initiatives. In fact, for many of us, the highlight of each month is our visit to the Holy Trinity Church and Cultural Arts Center, which runs a Little Scholars program and a basketball camp for children, young adults, and teens. Of course, the true measure of any community is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens. We\u2019ve taken special care to help the sick, the hungry, and those experiencing homelessness or unemployment in our host city. We\u2019ve stocked and served at the Westside Mission, cleaned at the Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry\u2019s Central Kitchen, and we\u2019ve filled shopping carts at the Bishop Cosgrove market for families in need. Many of our volunteer days are spent with community partners improving Clevelanders\u2019 health and well-being. We helped conduct a survey at the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Minority Men\u2019s Health Fair, where over 2,000 men received screenings and care for diseases and conditions that occur more frequently in the black community. The information we collected will help improve outcomes for patients with kidney disease. And through a partnership with the Credit Union National Association and RealClearPolitics, we are building a horticultural therapy suite at Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital. When completed, Cleveland\u2019s youngest patients will be able to garden there and participate in nature activities. All of this important work is tied together by infrastructure improvements. We\u2019ve partnered with AT&T to upgrade hardware and significantly improve 4G phone service. This project is one of many that will continue to benefit the entire community. As a black Republican woman, this work has added personal meaning for me. I traveled a different path to Cleveland than many of my convention colleagues. I was the Chairman of the National Black Republican Leadership Council, co-founder of the Committee of 40, and the first high-ranking, African-American consultant to the Republican National Committee (RNC). After the 2012 election, Chairman Reince Priebus got serious. He set out to create a sustained, party-wide effort to show up, help out, listen, and better address the needs of every community, not just the ones that reliably vote Republican. I was honored to help implement his plan, and I was excited when Convention CEO Jeff Larson asked me to align our engagement effort in Cleveland with the chairman\u2019s and Speaker Ryan\u2019s vision. Cleveland is a predominantly black city, and when I walk into a hospital, a school, or a shelter here, it moves me. I feel like I\u2019m doing more than giving back; in my own small way, I\u2019m breaking down the wall between two groups I belong to and care deeply about: The Republican party and the black community. So, no, my proudest achievements won\u2019t be on your TV screen. But you can see them; they are spread out across our host city, where a family is eating a meal we helped prepare, a child is trying on a pair of shoes that we delivered, and a florist is growing her business into the city\u2019s next great success story. Those are the signs that our engagement effort has had a positive impact on the Cleveland community. Even better is the thing we didn\u2019t plan for: the profound impact that this community has had on my convention colleagues and me. C. J. Jordan is deputy director of public and community affairs for the Republican National Convention.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is joined by Hillary Clinton on stage at the Democratic National Convention PHILADELPHIA \u2013 President Obama and Tim Kaine tag-teamed to deliver a scorching warm-up Wednesday for Hillary Clinton to accept the party\u2019s nomination for president at the Democratic convention, with the president accusing Republican Donald Trump of only offering \u201cslogans\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s newly tapped running mate almost upstaging the commander-in-chief with his gusty impression of the billionaire\u2019s New Yawk bravado. Framing the election as a choice between pessimism and optimism, Obama endorsed Clinton as a tough and tenacious leader, saying \u201cshe is fit\u201d and \u201cready\u201d to be the next commander-in-chief \u2013 while rejecting Trump\u2019s claim that only he can cure the nation\u2019s ills. \u201cAmerica is already great. America is already strong,\u201d Obama said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.\u201d Of Clinton, he said: \u201cThere has never been a man or a woman \u2013 not me, not Bill, nobody \u2013 more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.\u201d As the kicker, Clinton surprised the crowd by showing up onstage with Obama at the end of his speech, the two of them hugging and waving to delegates who were holding up \"thank you\" signs. The president\u2019s convention embrace of his one-time political rival is sure to fuel a central charge of Republicans in the general election \u2013 that Clinton represents a third Obama term, and the status quo. Without question, the sitting president depends on his former secretary of state to help preserve his legacy, and fend off recurring Republican attempts to repeal ObamaCare, upend environmental regulations and more. To that end, Obama and a host of speakers on the convention\u2019s third night intensified their attacks on Trump, as they talked up Clinton\u2019s qualifications. \u201cThe Donald is not really a plans guy.\u00a0He\u2019s not really a facts guy, either,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe calls himself a business guy, which is true, but I have to say, I know plenty of businessmen and women who\u2019ve achieved remarkable success without leaving a trail of lawsuits, and unpaid workers, and people feeling like they got cheated.\u201d Obama also used the platform to defend his record in office, declaring he\u2019s \u201cmore optimistic about the future of America than ever before.\u201d Trump countered on Twitter: \u201cOur country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.\u201d The night in Philadelphia was replete with barbed insults even as the musical acts kept returning to themes of \u201clove\u201d and understanding. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid lit into Trump earlier in the night, calling him a \u201chateful con man\u201d and \u201cegomaniac.\u201d Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, an ex-Clinton primary rival, gave a fiery speech calling Trump a \u201cbully racist.\u201d Obama\u2019s address, marking a passing of the torch to the woman he defeated for the nomination eight years ago, was delivered shortly after delegates finalized the party\u2019s 2016 ticket. In an overwhelming voice vote, they nominated Virginia Sen. Kaine for vice president. Kaine himself, after starting off talking family and faith, shifted gears in the second half and shelved his nice-guy persona to deliver a broadside against Trump, as he accepted the VP nomination from his party. \u201cHillary has a passion for kids and families. \u2026 Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself,\u201d Kaine said. The senator was merciless after that. He went on to mock Trump, imitating his Queens accent when he says, \u201cBelieve me.\u201d \u201cWe're gonna destroy ISIS so fast -- believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns -- believe me!\u201d Kaine bellowed, as the crowd roared with laughter. \u201cHere's the thing. Most people, when they run for president, they don't just say \u2018believe me.\u2019 They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. \u2026 You cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.\u201d The senator also delivered several lines in Spanish as he recalled his long-ago work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. While he was speaking, the Trump campaign was firing out press releases ripping Kaine as a \u201cjob killer\u201d and part of the Washington establishment. The sitting vice president, Joe Biden, also went after Trump on all fronts, saying the billionaire businessman would endanger national security \u2013 and lacks compassion. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That\u2019s a bunch of malarkey,\u201d Biden said. Remnants of the noisy factions that have disrupted proceedings since the week\u2019s start flared up again during the Kaine voice vote \u2013 with a large section of the California delegation chanting, \u201cRoll call! Roll call!\u201d \u2013 and during ex-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta\u2019s remarks. But some of the unrest has subsided, as party elders have methodically worked since Sunday \u2013 when they ousted party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz over a leaked email scandal \u2013 to convince Bernie Sanders\u2019 soldiers to lay down their arms. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential run before ruling it out, made a late appearance Wednesday \u2013 with an endorsement that could help Clinton reach out to vital independents whom Trump also is courting, and a bagful of zingers aimed squarely at his fellow billionaire. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us!\u201d Bloomberg said, calling him a \u201cdangerous demagogue\u201d and claiming it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d to elect Clinton. The focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming and even national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights. Obama delivered his address just weeks after his Justice Department closed the books on its investigation into Clinton\u2019s improper use of a private server and email while secretary of state, opting to pursue no charges. Despite allegations from Republicans of political favoritism, the decision helped clear away one of the last major hurdles to her nomination going into the Philadelphia convention. Together, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party. The president\u2019s speech Wednesday effectively kicks off Obama\u2019s general election role as a chief Clinton surrogate. The New York Times reported that aides mostly have cleared his calendar for October and expect him to be on the trail regularly for Clinton until the election.",

            "article_content": "A subduction zone lying beneath Bangladesh, Myanmar and eastern India could release a massive magnitude 8.2 to 9.0 earthquake, new research suggests. The red line shows the areas where the fault is likely locked (the soli (Steckler et al, LDEO) A massive fault could trigger a cataclysmic earthquake beneath Bangladesh, parts of east India and Myanmar, new research suggests. The hidden fault, which has been buried under miles of river sediment, could release an earthquake of magnitude 8.2 to 9.0 in one of the most densely populated regions of the world, the study found. And because researchers discovered the system relatively recently, they have no estimates for when such a megaquake could occur. \"We don't know if it's tomorrow or if it's not going to be for another 500 years,\" said study co-author Michael Steckler, a geophysicist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York City. In the low-lying, waterlogged country of Bangladesh, the mighty Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers meet and form the world's largest delta, eventually draining into the Bay of Bengal. The flow of these two massive rivers deposits a gigaton of sediment every year, the researchers said. This constant overlay of sediment obscured the geology below the Ganges Delta. But in recent years, scientists have learned that tectonic plates are colliding beneath the eons worth of sediment. To get a better picture of how the plates buried deep below the surface were moving, Steckler and his colleagues worked with researchers at Dhaka University in Bangladesh to install ultrasensitive GPS devices throughout Bangladesh between 2003 and 2014. They combined this data with plate-motion data collected from India and Myanmar, creating a map of the entire fault region. The GPS network revealed that one plate is diving under the other deep beneath the surface in an area encompassing Bangladesh and parts of Myanmar and eastern India. (The two plates are likely the Indian Plate and a part of the Eurasian Plate that some call the Burma Platelet, Steckler said.) At the upper layers of the fault, the two plates are stuck together, building up strain that could produce a megathrust earthquake if it ruptures, the researchers said. Based on the strain data, the team estimates that the fault could unleash a maximum of a magnitude 8.2 to 9.0 earthquake, they reported Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. While an earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or greater has the potential to cause damage anywhere in the world, this particular region may be especially vulnerable. The researchers estimate that about 140 million people live within 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the fault, including the 17 million people who live in the crammed megalopolis of the Greater Dhaka Area in Bangladesh. The country also already faces problems with poor construction, Steckler said. \"I've seen them pumping sand to build up the ground level to build a 20-story building,\" Steckler told Live Science. \"If there's an earthquake [that ground is] going to liquefy and the building is just going to fall over.\" Not only would the region be incredibly vulnerable to widespread building collapse, but overcrowding could make it difficult to rescue people who survive the initial quake, Steckler said. \"Right now, the streets are clogged with traffic such that it's impossible to drive around Dhaka on a normal day,\" Steckler said. \"If you fill the streets with debris, it's really going to be impossible to get supplies and rescue equipment and things like that around.\" However, right now, the team has no idea if the region is likely to experience a major earthquake anytime soon. The researchers have some evidence of a temblor in 1762 further south from the study area, as well as a quake that may have caused a major river between Bangladesh and Myanmar to switch the direction in which it flowed, but beyond that, the river sediments have buried the geological evidence, and there isn't historical evidence to provide clues about how frequently these quakes occur. Countries in the region face many immediate problems \u2014 including terrorist attacks, poverty, climate change and corruption \u2014 so it's difficult for politicians to justify expensive seismic retrofitting for a quake that may never come, Steckler said. To better characterize the region's risk, the team is building a more detailed map of the shape of the fault, as well as looking at historical tsunami data to understand how often megathrust earthquakes occur, Steckler said.",

            "article_content": "A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration. The federal government's portal logged over 2.8 million visitors by afternoon October 2, largely in an attempt to sign up for Obamacare.  REUTERS/Mike Segar  (UNITED STATES - Tags: HEALTH SOCIETY POLITICS) - RTR3FIUH (Reuters) Last week, Aetna became the latest major health insurer to announce that it will exit most of the states where it offers health insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges. The move could make Pinal County, in my home state of Arizona, the first in the nation to have no options when it comes to ObamaCare\u2019s marketplace. For a law that President Obama said would bring more \u201cchoice, more competition, [and] real health care security,\u201d ObamaCare has delivered nothing more than empty promises. Aetna\u2019s exit could leave nearly 10,000 citizens of Pinal County without any health care options in the ObamaCare marketplace. As a rural area of our state in which 18 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, the impact will be felt particularly hard. Aetna\u2019s exit could leave nearly 10,000 citizens of Pinal County without any health care options in the ObamaCare marketplace. Today, 88 percent of ObamaCare enrollees in Pinal County receive a federal subsidy averaging $230 per month. Of that 88 percent, over 50 percent of the population receives additional financial assistance to help pay for copays, prescription medications and other health care needs. Unless another insurer agrees to enter the marketplace, the only options these individuals will have would be to pay potentially thousands of dollars for health insurance in the private marketplace or go without health coverage altogether. Unfortunately, it\u2019s likely that Pinal County will not be the last community left out to dry by the president\u2019s failed health care law. The crumbling of ObamaCare has become commonplace all across the country. Major insurers like UnitedHealth, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Humana have reported stunning financial losses from Obamacare \u2013 to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. To cope with these losses, insurers have been forced to sharply increase premiums or exit the marketplace altogether. In fact, before it announced it would leave Arizona, Aetna had proposed an 18 percent premium rate hike over last year to cover its losses. The average proposed premium rate increase among all insurers for 2017 plans in Arizona tops 65 percent. I\u2019ve heard from my constituents across the state who are concerned about what the collapse of ObamaCare will mean for them and their families. Take Karen from Tucson, Arizona, for example, who recently wrote to my office about her concern that Aetna\u2019s exit will mean even higher costs for health care, for which she is already paying $485 month with a $6,300 deductible. Or take Sandra from Chandler, Arizona, who was forced to make the difficult decision of taking $15,000 out of a retirement account to pay for her family\u2019s skyrocketing deductible. That decision in turn made her family\u2019s income too high to get additional tax breaks for health care. My office has received countless other letters and phone calls from concerned Arizonans who have been left with fewer options, less access and decreased quality of care under Obamacare. But this frustration is not unique to Arizona. -- A recent Gallup poll found that Americans cite health care costs as the most important financial burden facing their family. The best thing government could do to expand access to health insurance is to institute reforms that rein in costs and make health care more affordable. I\u2019ve introduced legislation to replace ObamaCare with real reform that would expand quality access to health care without compromising individual liberty, competition or innovation. Unfortunately, every Republican effort to meaningfully bring down the cost of health care has been met with rigid opposition by Democrats who are more concerned with protecting President Obama\u2019s legacy than making health care accessible and affordable. Just take my Democratic opponent in the Arizona Senate election, for example. Despite the overwhelming outcry by her constituents to address the rising costs of health insurance under Obamacare, Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick continues to tout the president\u2019s failed law as her proudest vote. The fact is, ObamaCare has always been the wrong solution to reforming America\u2019s health care system. It shouldn\u2019t have to take the complete collapse of the system for Democrats to finally wake up to this reality. In the meantime, Republicans will continue fighting to repeal and replace this failed law with health care that empowers Americans to choose the health care that works for them and their families \u2013 not the federal government.",

            "article_content": "Robert Wolf and Steve Moore debate Hillary's claims on 'Fox & Friends' What an amazing speech in Columbus on Tuesday by Hillary Clinton. She started off by telling the American people what is patently obvious: \"People are working harder and longer just to keep their heads above water. \u00a0And to deal with the costs, the everyday costs, the costs of basics like childcare and prescription drugs that are too high. \u00a0College is getting more expensive every day. \u00a0And wages are still too low and inequality is too great. \u00a0Good jobs in this country are still too hard to come by.\" All true. \u00a0Her prescription for this financial crunch on families: keep doing what we are doing. There was something almost comical about Hillary's lecturing us about fiscal responsibility, economic fairness, and lifting the middle class. \u200eWait. Wasn't she part of the Obama administration which also promised all these things? And haven't those policies given us the weakest recovery ever since the great depression, a massive increase in income inequality, a shrinkage of the middle class, and a near doubling of the national debt to $19 trillion. There was something almost comical about Hillary's lecturing us about fiscal responsibility, economic fairness, and lifting the middle class. \u200eWait. Wasn't she part of the Obama administration which also promised all these things? What's on the next episode of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d? The Menendez brothers explaining how to be respectful to one's parents. One of her more spectacular claims was that here \"in America we pay our bills,\" in reference to Trump's sensible idea of refinancing out debt to lock in historically low interest rates. Not this president. Wringing up some $8 trillion of debt is hardly \"paying the bills.\" \u00a0It's passing them on to the next generation. Hillary slammed Trump for not understanding the new economy and job creation, which is also a bold claim since Donald Trump is a highly successful businessman who actually has created thousands of jobs, while Hillary has gotten rich off of... politics. \u00a0\u200e Hillary's attacks on Trump were a subterfuge to deflect attention from the most remarkable part of her rant. What was billed as a \"major economic speech\" was entirely bereft of new ideas. In fact, it was vacant of ANY ideas at all about how to help the economy. \u00a0The left's idea cupboard is entirely empty. Her policy solutions to helping the middle class were raise the minimum wage, tax the rich, and spend more on infrastructure. Gee, where have we seen this before? Oh yes, this is Obamanomics Part Deux. The class warfare theme ran throughout the speech, and yet this presents Hillary with another uncomfortable problem. Obama has raised the minimum wage, he already did spent $830 billion on infrastructure stimulus spending, and he \u200ehas taxed the bejesus out of the rich. And the result wasn't more equality and a resurgent middle class, but an angry and worried worker class that hasn't seen a pay raise in 15 years and with household incomes in the last seven years that have fallen behind inflation. \u00a0 Some 95 million Americans aren't working and the poverty rate is still hellishly high. On trade she trashed Trump for closing our markets and threatening a trade war and then she recommended trade policies that seem almost the same as Trump's. Get tougher in trade deals. Punish China for cheating. Renegotiate the Asia trade pact. Trump should sue for plagiarism. Hillary made the claim that Trump hates working women, but the Obama/Clinton policies have been anything but beneficial to women. Single women have seen some of the biggest income declines under Obama. So who hates women! Poor Hillary is selling the American voters sand in the desert: four more years of stay the course economic bromides at a time \u00a0when two out of three voters say that the U.S. is on the wrong, not the right track. \u200eShe should listen to her husband who in a rare moment of complete honesty\u00a0called the last seven years \"awful.\" Voters share that sentiment. \u00a0If Hillary wants to run on this economy, Donald Trump would be smart to tell her: Hillary it's all yours.",

            "article_content": "Voting machines on election day, 11/2/10 (AP) President Obama and the Democratic Party have failed African-Americans, and it no longer serves their interest to reliably support either Hillary Clinton or the party. From Reconstruction to the Great Depression, African-Americans were strongly aligned with the GOP, recognizing Abraham Lincoln\u2019s role in ending slavery and the virulent segregationist policies championed by southern Democrats. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and Harry Truman\u2019s executive orders to desegregate the military and end discrimination in federal employment broke those ties but as recently as 1956 and 1960, Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon managed to win 39 and 32 percent of the African-American vote. Lyndon Johnson\u2019s support for The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the GOP\u2019s subsequent \u201csouthern strategy\u201d to win white voters hostile to such progressive policies put about 85 percent of African-Americans reliably in the Democratic column. Democrats rewarded their loyalty with a host of economic and social measures intended to alleviate poverty and compensate for past discrimination\u2014including income support programs, \u00a0federally enforced preferences in private sector hiring and college admissions, and minority set-aside programs that benefit only a few, but often influential, entrepreneurs and civic leaders. Conservatives have long argued that programs to aid those adversely affected by the prejudices of history or simply poor business conditions\u2014for example, the decline of the textile and furniture industries which employed many blacks in the South\u2014can become self-defeating. Assistance can cross the line from providing help to overcome disadvantages to discouraging individual initiative, accountability and self-improvement. In the process, those cultivate a client relationship between protected classes of voters and politicians who promise ever greater handouts and state-coerced preferential treatment, and a decadent cycle that keeps African-Americans pinned down in poverty. Mr. Obama has been the most aggressive president since Lyndon Johnson in championing welfare programs\u2014for example, expanding Medicaid, the earned income tax credits and food stamps and aggressively pressing universities to grant greater preferences to minorities in admissions. And Hillary Clinton promises even more of the same. Government benefits are now so generous that low-income wage earners face increased taxes of 50 to 80 percent on additional income\u2014from extra taxes and lost government benefits\u2014if they work more hours or send a second adult into the workforce. \u00a0Often, it can pay an African-American working mother to have absent fathers paying child support rather than a strong role model, earning a second salary, under her roof. Democrats have effectively isolated conservative leaning Republicans and broadened their minority base by adding Latinos through lax immigration enforcement and initiatives like the Dream Act in several states, and assigning to Asian-Americans protected status under affirmative action laws that are simply unwarranted by social and economic indicators. Asian-Americans outperform whites in education, and their average annual family incomes are about $74,000, as compared to $35,000 for African-Americans and $60,000 for whites. In these times of slow economic growth, African-Americans, not whites, have been the biggest losers. They are pushed out of jobs and educational opportunities by illegal immigrants and other groups Democrats are cultivating to win a permanent lock on the White House. On Mr. Obama\u2019s watch, African-American family incomes are down by about $2,200, while those for Hispanics and Asian-Americans are up $800 and $2,100, respectively.\u00a0 The wealth gap with whites has widened tremendously, and African-Americans have regained far fewer of the jobs lost in the Great Recession than other Americans. African-Americans are disproportionately saddled with student loans after dropping out of college after a few years or earning a degree that hardly imparts the skills necessary to earn a living. President Obama was elected on the promise to create greater economic justice but for African-Americans conditions have become decidedly worse. African-American elites have grown prosperous through minority set-aside programs and protected jobs in business and academia but their advice to support Hillary Clinton is ill-informed at best, and simply cynically self-interested at worst. Republicans abandoned an anti-civil rights posture long ago and their pro-growth platform simply offers more hope for a better future for all Americans\u2014including African-Americans. Neither Donald Trump nor Paul Ryan advocate shredding the social safety net, for example. The GOP advocates for benefits that offer a hand up not huge indiscriminate largess that imposes a lifetime of poverty and injustice in exchange for votes.",

(AP Photo/B.K. Bangash) RAWALPINDI, Pakistan \u2013 For an elite but passionate group of vintage car collectors in Pakistan, restoring antique rides is like travelling back in time \u2014 and money seems to be no obstacle when the prize is a Lincoln convertible that belonged to an Afghan king or a Rolls-Royce once used by India's last viceroy. Mohsin Ikraam, president of the Vintage and Classic Car Club of Pakistan, says the collectors help preserve a portion of the region's history of the past century. Among rich Pakistanis, he says, the desire to own classic automobiles has been growing and the club's membership has now topped 10,000. The club sponsors many promotions and events where owners roll out their antiques for annual car shows or take them on rallies spanning hundreds of kilometers (miles) across Pakistan \u2014 something that might raise eyebrows among those aware of just how volatile this country can be. To outsiders, Pakistan is more known for militant havens in its northwestern tribal areas and Taliban insurgents who have fought for over a decade to overthrow the government and impose a harsh version of Islamic law, killing tens of thousands of people in the war. But Pakistan's gearheads are a testament to the universal appeal of fixing up and maintaining vintage cars, more commonly associated with America, Britain and Western countries from where popular shows like \"Top Gear\" or \"Fast N' Loud\" have reached Pakistani cable channels. Take businessman Raja Mujahid Zafar, for one. He has nearly 40 classic cars \u2014 the oldest among them a 1914 Ford Model T \u2014 at his palatial Islamabad home. A special section of the house and grounds is dedicated to his hobby, including a big concrete garage and two outdoor shelters. \"You can't stop time,\" he said, gently touching the Ford's copper-plated insignia, \"but you can drive back into the past.\" He imagines the car whizzing about on roads back when the region was still a British colony, scenes reminiscent of old movies. \"That's the historical ride you enjoy,\" he says. The Ford, known as Tin Lizzie or just T, was the result of Henry Ford's desire to produce a car affordable to the middle class in the early 20th century. It was credited for putting America on wheels at a time when automobiles were considered an extreme luxury by people mostly used to riding horse carriages. Zafar's said his \"first love\" was a maroon, six-cylinder Wolseley 1936 model \u2014 a \"wreck\" when he found it in 1988. It took him several years and trips abroad to hunt down parts to restore it to original condition, he said. Getting spare parts is the most challenging aspect of the hobby, the collectors say, and parts are often shipped from the U.S. or Europe. Advertisements are put in foreign newspapers \u2014 even friends traveling abroad are recruited for help. In response to an ad in 2004, a London broker got a Karachi-based businessman Karim Chhapra an original clock he desperately wanted for his 1924 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost model. It cost 400 pounds \u2014 or about $725 at the time. The Rolls-Royce won first place at an international Concours D'Elegance car show in Kuwait in 2012, Chhapra said, and his American 1929 Hupmobile came in second. The Rolls was originally owned by a prince, Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi, in the then-India's Bahawlpur state, which later became part of Pakistan. Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of India, and Pakistan's father of the nation, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, rode in it together during the 1947 ceremony marking the birth of Pakistan. It had remained garaged for decades, said Chhapra, who made his son promise never to sell the car but keep it in the family. When he occasionally takes the 300,000 pounds (about $462,000) Rolls-Royce for a spin, people on the streets stop him for a selfie. The prince had about 100 cars, most of which were auctioned off, said his grandson, Sulaiman Abbasi, also a member of the classic cars club. Abbasi said he has worked for years on another car he inherited from his grandfather, a 1948 1 \u00bd liter-engine Jaguar, photographing each sequence as he restored the sleek black saloon with so-called \"suicide doors\" \u2014 the kind that are hinged at the rear rather than the front. Vintage cars are not just about passion but also patience, says car mechanic Ali Hussain, who has been restoring antique cars since 1972 at his workshop in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, just outside Islamabad. Hussain is currently working on a 1934 Wolseley and a 1944 Chevrolet, and says he sometimes feels like a doctor, \"injecting life\" into the old and broken-down. The hobby is expensive, admits Ikraam, the club president, who has a 1947 Lincoln Continental Convertible V12, which he said Afghanistan's last king, Zahir Shah, used to drive in the early 1970s. For example, a 12-cylinder 1963 Ferrari that was taken from Pakistan to America was auctioned for $2 million. Pakistan's emerging classic cars industry is worth nearly $11 million, Ikraam said \u2014 a staggering sum in a country of 180 million people where the majority live below the poverty line of $2 a day. As he drove another one of his oldies, a 1967 Ford Mustang that could cost $50,000 these days in the United States, Zafar, the businessman, said there is no limit to the cars he would love to have. In his bedroom, decorated with hundreds of small models of old car, the wall clock, the side lamp, the ash tray and the music player are all in the shape of models still missing from his collection. \"These are mostly the cars I dream to own,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Candidate talks potential vice presidential nominees, clarifies his stances on the minimum wage, tax cuts and a Muslim ban on 'Hannity' Poor Donald Trump. Nothing to do but sit at home and perhaps spin old records in hopes that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will come around and endorse him soon. The duo scheduled a phone chat Wednesday evening. A source familiar with the call characterized it as a \u201cgood conversation.\u201d That was the extent of it. Swipe left or right, Mr. Speaker, in this game of political Bumble. But until Ryan\u2019s ready, it\u2019s just Trump, biding his time \u2013 waiting for the speaker to do what everyone expects he will, and get on board. If Trump is by the turntable, perhaps the first record up should be The Kinks and \u201cTired of Waiting for You.\u201d \"I'm so tired. Tired of waiting. Tired of waiting for you.\" Earlier, viral rumors suggested that Ryan was on the verge of endorsing Trump. Nope. Not true. As dawn broke Wednesday, a senior Ryan aide told Fox News \u201cthere is\u00a0no update\u201d and there was no signal to the Trump camp to expect an endorsement. \u201c[The speaker has] also not told anyone he regrets anything,\u201d said the aide. It\u2019s no surprise that those close to Trump leaked that Ryan was nearing an endorsement. Only Ryan was still afraid of -- you guessed it -- commitment. During a Wednesday press conference, Ryan feigned ignorance of the leak\u2019s catalyst. \u201cI don\u2019t know where all this got from,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI have not made a decision and I really have nothing more to add.\u201d And how does Ryan feel about that false endorsement rumor? \u201cI don\u2019t worry about that stuff,\u201d replied Ryan. \u201cI\u2019ve been around this a long time. None of that stuff really gets to me.\u201d Naturally, that begs the question whether \u201cthat stuff\u201d would \u201cget\u201d to Ryan if President Trump stoked innuendos about the speaker \u2026 if he\u2019s trying to cajole Congress to advance a particular legislative initiative next year. \u201cI can control what I can control,\u201d declared Ryan. Hmm. Pick your version. The Supremes or Phil Collins. Either one will do. \u201cYou can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait. She said love don't come easy. It's a game of give and take.\u201d Might ponder that last lyric for a moment ... What\u2019s funny is that this protracted, partially choreographed Trump/Ryan courtship is hurtling toward the only logical conclusion possible: Paul Ryan will eventually endorse Trump. It\u2019s not so much a matter of if, but when. Fox News is told the Ryan endorsement is coming. June is a good piece of political real estate to survey. After all, the Republican convention comes in mid-July. And if there\u2019s much question that a Ryan endorsement isn\u2019t a fait accompli, consider the political downside for Ryan: First, the speaker would stand nearly alone among Republican congressional leaders who haven\u2019t endorsed Trump. As House speaker, Paul Ryan\u2019s political bearing is certainly more complex than those of his colleagues. The party looks to Ryan for leadership. The speaker risks hanging out to dry rank-and-file Republicans if he doesn\u2019t get behind Trump. That\u2019s to say nothing of the personal political risk Ryan could face with such an unconventional stance of failing to endorse Trump. The House could turn on Ryan (See Boehner, John). Never mind that those who support Trump certainly aren\u2019t in line with all of Ryan\u2019s policy positions. They\u2019re more aligned with Donald Trump. Yet Ryan can\u2019t plunge in immediately. Rip off the Band-Aid? Well, there are many Republicans in the House who can\u2019t or simply won\u2019t support Trump for president. So Ryan must be measured. \u201cI want this to be a sincere deliberative process,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI think it\u2019s important we actually discuss the principles we all share in common and the policies that come from them.\u201d Only the exercise may not be deliberative if it\u2019s pointed toward an inevitable conclusion. That\u2019s ironic considering what Ryan said earlier this month when asked about political chasms between many Republicans and Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t fake unifying. That we don\u2019t pretend unification. That we truly unify so we are at full strength in the fall. I don\u2019t want us to have a fake unification process here.\u201d But if the Trump/Ryan alliance is a forgone conclusion, aren\u2019t these political gymnastics fabricated anyway? That said, Ryan took time Wednesday to paint broad brush strokes about six policy areas the GOP hopes to focus on in the coming years. The issues range from health care to executive action to poverty. Ryan wouldn\u2019t completely rule out a vote or two on any of these initiatives this year. But he maintains that the policy blueprints are for the future. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a legislative agenda for 2016 because Barack Obama is president. That\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cWe want a conservative president. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to be for a lot of these things.\u201d We all know with whom Ryan is left. Donald Trump. Shotgun wedding? Marriage of convenience? Call it what you want. Trump will wait. Perhaps taking The Beatles\u2019 \u201cCome Together\u201d for a spin.

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman) SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2013 Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is suggesting boycotting Starbucks over the minimalist design of its annual holiday cups. \"Did you read about Starbucks? No more Merry Christmas on Starbucks,\" Trump told a capacity crowd of thousands gathered to hear him speak at a pre-debate rally in Springfield, Illinois on Monday evening. \"Maybe we should boycott Starbucks. I don't know,\" he said. \"Seriously, I don't care.\" Some religious conservatives have expressed anger over the coffee company's annual holiday-time cups \u2014 a minimalist all-red design with no images aside from the company's green and white logo. Previous years' cups have featured snowflakes, winter scenes and sometimes Christmas ornaments. But a small number of critics see the design choice as part of a larger movement away from exclusively Christian-themed holiday decorations. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump, who is working to win the support of evangelical and other conservative Christians in a crowded field, has often expressed frustrations over companies using the term \"Happy Holidays\" in place of \"Merry Christmas.\" He said on Monday that: \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying, 'Merry Christmas' again. That I can tell you.\" He added that Starbucks operates a store in one of his buildings and that \"that's the end of that lease, but who cares?\" The rally comes on the eve of the next Republican presidential debate, which will be taking place Tuesday evening in Milwaukee. Brian Oaks, general manager of the Prairie Capital Convention Center, said the billionaire businessman and reality television star had attracted a record-setting crowd for the convention center of 10,200 in downtown Springfield, a solidly Republican city in a Democratic-leaning state. Trump did not mention the debate during his rally speech, but previewed some of the attack lines he may choose to use against rivals, including retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is now running neck-and-neck with him in several polls. Trump expressed near-exasperation at Carson's continued popularity in the face of growing questions about discrepancies in his autobiography, \"Gifted Hands,\" which included claims that he tried to hit his mother with a hammer and unsuccessfully tried to stab someone when he was an angry youth. \"With what's going on with this election? I've never seen anything like it,\" said Trump. He went on to mimic the back-and-forth between Carson and reporters trying to verify the story of his rise from poverty to acclaimed surgeon, including a claim by Carson that the person he'd tried to stab had been saved by his belt buckle. \"You stab somebody and the newspapers say, 'You didn't do it.' And you said, 'Yes I did, I did it!'\" said Trump. \"This is the only election in history where you're better off if you stabbed somebody,\" he said. \"What are we coming to?\"",

Did an outgoing local show you the way? Was the city easy to navigate? Or were the locals just downright rude? Some 128,000 people took the survey in 2015\u2014see what you had to say about the friendliest U.S. cities, and the ones that gave guests a cold shoulder. Counting down... 1. Newark, New Jersey Alas, Newark takes the top spot\u00a0again, for least-friendly city in the country. \"This was one of the saddest looking cities I've ever seen,\" said one reader. Another said it was a \"business necessity. Extreme traffic, poor signage.\" \"I often stay in Newark...and dine in Hoboken.\" Geez! Doesn't anyone ever go to the Ironbound District? Or anywhere other than the airport? Those looking on the bright side will tell you to head there, along with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and Prudential Center. Newark has its bright spots, too. 2. Oakland, California This East Bay city retains its no. 2 position, with one reader simply stating: \"Some parts of the city are scary.\" But more readers thought that \"Oakland is starting to renew itself. New eateries are popping up everywhere...most are local finds at this stage.\" Temescal Alley is still one of the hippest parts of the city, and the weekend markets are where you'll find the best of the city.

It could be a boon to NJ if the surrounding areas could be cleaned up.\" \"It's a strange, split-personality town: an odd mix of grinding poverty and over-the-top conspicuous consumption. The promise of casino-funded urban renewal never really materialized.\" 4. Detroit, Michigan We have a feeling Motor City won't be long on this list. While some people said the city was still facing hard times, others reinforced the notion that \"Detroit's coming out of the bad times and really has a lot to offer, both in the city and in the surrounding suburbs.\" \"The energy is all you need to feel to want to return to the city again and again,\" said another reader. \"Things are changing and you can be a part.\" 5. Hartford, Connecticut Connecticut's \"forgettable\" state capital \"shuts down at night\" and is considered \"dreary, especially when it rains or snows.\" \"It definitely needs a facelift!\" Traffic and \"seedy sections\" of the city aside, \"it appears to be trying to rejuvenate itself.\" The food scene is on the rise (a few readers loved Firebox restaurant); \"Elizabeth Park's rose garden is wonderful\" and the \"river walk with its cultural and food festivals\" are worth a visit 6. New Haven, Connecticut The city of New Haven, beyond the ivy-covered walls, seemed \"tired and spiritless,\" said one reader, calling Yale within \"a little oasis.\" It's a refrain we hear often: that there isn't much to see in New Haven beyond the university, and \"the contrast between the academic wealth and local poverty is poignant.\" But this year, we were happy to hear our readers trumpet the great restaurants in the city, particularly on Wooster Street, home to some of the best pizza in the U.S. \"Frank Pepe's Pizza for life!\" Did your city make the Friendly list?

The massive service workers\u2019 union, UNITE HERE, which boasts more than 265,000 members, has issued a scathing study that accuses ObamaCare of worsening \u201cincome inequality.\u201d Those are fighting words among Democrats, who have settled on accusing Republicans of fostering income disparity in a bid to hold the Senate this fall. With culinary workers in Las Vegas threatening to shut down the Strip with an ObamaCare-fueled strike, the issue is reaching a boiling point for already-divided Democrats. Big labor\u2019s complaint about the law relates to targeted taxes that penalize benefits plans that provide \u201cCadillac\u201d health coverage. Such benefits are the key selling point for many unions. ObamaCare poses a major threat to already flagging private-sector union membership. The report reads like a ransom not to the president and vulnerable Democrats, deliver another carve out or face the wrath of the groups that fund and provide foot-soldiers for Democrats: \u201cHaving already made efforts to accommodate businesses, churches and congressional staff, it is ironic that the administration is now highlighting issues of economic inequality without acting to preserve health plans that have been achieving the goals of the ACA for decades.\u201d Pay cut - Washington Examiner: \u201c[The union] warned that due to Obamacare\u2019s much higher costs for health insurance than what union workers currently pay, the result will be a pay cut of up to $5 an hour. \u2018If employers follow the incentives in the law, they will push families onto the exchanges to buy coverage. This will force low-wage service industry employees to spend $2.00, $3.00 or even $5.00 an hour of their pay to buy similar coverage.\u2019\u2019\u2019 THREE HOTS, A COT AND OBAMACARE FOR PRISONERSNYT: \u201c\u2026jails and prisons around the country are beginning to sign up inmates for health insurance under the law, taking advantage of the expansion of Medicaid that allows states to extend coverage to single and childless adults \u2014 a major part of the prison population\u2026 Although Medicaid does not cover standard health care for inmates, it can pay for their hospital stays beyond 24 hours \u2013 meaning states can transfer millions of dollars of obligations to the federal government. But the most important benefit of the program, corrections officials say, is that inmates who are enrolled in Medicaid while in jail or prison can have coverage after they get out. People coming out of jail or prison have disproportionately high rates of chronic diseases, especially mental illness and addictive disorders. Few, however, have insurance, and many would qualify for Medicaid under the income test for the program \u2014 138 percent of the poverty line \u2014 in the 25 states that have elected to expand their programs. Health care experts estimate that up to 35 percent of those newly eligible for Medicaid under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law are people with histories of criminal justice system involvement, including jail and prison inmates and those on parole or probation.\u201d [Flashback - Jailhouse navigators find captive audience for ObamaCare -\u00a0Daily Caller: \u201c\u2026billionaire\u00a0George Soros\u00a0and the Obama administration help fund the Chicago nonprofit that set up Obamacare enrollment programs for prison inmates.

This massive shift of authority threatens the stability and functionality of our tripartite system of checks and balances. \u2026 In this sense, Obama is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he has become the very danger that separation of powers was designed to avoid\u2026To be clear, President Obama is not a dictator, but there is a danger in his aggregation of executive power.\u201d HOT AIR: SENATE DEMS HOLD GLOBAL WARMING TALK-A-THONIt may seem helpful to his goal of retaining the Senate, but Majority Leader Harry Reid is allowing the most liberal members of his party to make noise about climate change all night long.

Bill Young, R-Fla. Democrats were banking on a win in the increasingly blue Pinellas County district after recruiting 2010 gubernatorial nominee Alex Sink to run. The district was Sink\u2019s only bright spot in her failed bid four years ago. But, as Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel points out, the district is \u201cObamacare\u2019s Ground Zero.\u201d From Weigel: \u201cRepublicans watched the county go for George W. Bush, then for Barack Obama, then for Barack Obama again. They watched it vote for Alex Sink, in 2010, when she ran for governor\u2026A drive through the district, which covers all but the most urban parts of Pinellas, doubles as a tour of an Obamacare panic zone\u2026\u201d The takeaway: If Sink can find a way to hold on, Democrats may feel emboldened to defend the president\u2019s troubled law. If she stumbled, Democrats will again sound the retreat. Early votes suggest squeaker - Tampa Bay Times: \u201cAs of Saturday, about 117,000 ballots had been cast in Pinellas County\u2019s special election for Congressional District 13 \u2026Republicans had a 4,515-vote advantage over Democrats in District 13 and likely will cast significantly more votes on election day than Democrats. It still may not be enough for [Republican David Jolly], given the way swing voters ultimately pick the winner in this centrist district. Consider that in 2012, Republicans had cast nearly 11,000 more votes than Democrats by election day and then outperformed Democrats on election day by more than 9,000 votes. Barack Obama still narrowly won the district. In 2010, Republicans had a nearly 12,400-vote lead prior to election day and then on election day cast more than 8,600 more votes than Democrats. Sink still narrowly beat Republican Rick Scott in the district. It\u2019s shaping up to be a squeaker, but giving the recent track record of District 13 voters, Jolly needs an even stronger GOP surge in the final stretch and on Tuesday.

In an interview, Mr. Rubio said the speech is meant to advance discussions about the best way to expedite economic growth. The U.S. isn\u2019t as competitive as it used to be, he said, blaming that loss of vitality on \u2018our tax laws, our regulatory structure and our national debt.\u2019\u2019\u2019 GOP FRONTRUNNERS STAKE OUT PUTIN POSITIONSFox News: \u201c[On \u2018Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace,\u2019 Sen.

Paul said he would warn Putin that he\u2019s creating \u201cchaos\u201d and potentially the next Syria-type crisis. He also said he embraces the Reagan maxim of \u2018Don\u2019t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.\u2019 Said Paul: \u2018People still need to know this.

It was carried twice by Barack Obama, and if you array the states in order of Obama 2012 percentage it was the state that cast the 270th electoral vote for him. So although Obama did just slightly better in Colorado (51 percent-46 percent) than nationally (51percent-47 percent), Colorado was arguably the median state in the political spectrum. Entering the 2014 electoral cycle, Colorado had two apparently popular candidates for reelection, Governor John Hickenlooper and Senator Mark Udall. But they have not been faring well in public polls, as I have noted several times.\u201d NOT EXACTLY RED MEAT FOR KANSAS DEMOCRATSKansas Gov.

((AP)) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

GATES RAISES NEW TRUST QUESTIONS FOR EMBATTLED OBAMA - Public confidence in the commander in chief and his team is taking another hit today in the wake of new allegations about President Obama\u2019s political calculations on military strategy. Robert Gates, Obama\u2019s first-term secretary of Defense, has rattled Washington and disrupted the president\u2019s intended narrative for the midterm election year. As the president tries to shift the conversation to an attack on Republican resistance to expanded welfare spending, Gates\u2019 bombshell memoir is raising new questions about the trustworthiness of a president still reeling from the revelation that he misled voters with a claim that Americans would be able to keep their health insurance and physicians under ObamaCare. On top of that, there is lingering public concern about Obama\u2019s expansion of domestic surveillance programs. The timing for Gates\u2019 claims could hardly be worse. The money line from the former secretary: \u201cI felt that agreements with the Obama White House were good for only as long as they were politically convenient.\u201dFox News has more. [WSJ shares the top 10 revelations from Gates\u2019 memoir, read a longer excerpt here.] Micromanaged by politicos - In his book, \u201cDuty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War,\u201d set for release on Tuesday, Gates claims that Obama was skeptical of\u00a0 his own policy toward the war in Afghanistan and was \u201coutright convinced it would fail.\u201d According to excerpts reviewed by Fox News, Gates never questioned Obama\u2019s commitment to U.S. troops but rather \u201conly his support of their mission.\u201d A carry-over from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, Gates says he was often \u201cseething\u201d because he felt President Obama and his administration lacked trust or confidence in him. Gates wrotes: \u201cWith Obama, however, I joined a new, inexperienced president determined to change course\u2014and equally determined from day one to win re-election. Domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor, though I believe never a decisive one, in virtually every major national security problem we tackled.\u201d [The Hill looks at what looming departures by seniors staffers will mean for the infamously insular Obama White House.] And Hillary, too - Gates offers a stinging critique of how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made her decision to oppose the \u201cIraq surge,\u201d a strategy from the Bush White House that turned the tide in a war Clinton initially supported: \u201cHillary told [Obama] that her opposition to the [2007] surge in Iraq had been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary. .\u2009.\u2009. The president conceded vaguely that opposition to the Iraq surge had been political. To hear the two of them making these admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.\u201d [Hill-itary industrial complex - The Clintonista political action committee, Ready for Hillary, is boasting a $4 million 2013 cash haul. The committee behind the 2016 Democratic frontrunner announced Tuesday it raised $2.75 million in the last half of the 2013 alone. WaPo has more.] Oh no, Sheriff Joe! - Some of the more caustic criticisms in Gates\u2019 memoir were directed at Vice President Joe Biden. While the former Pentagon chief called Biden \u201ca man of integrity,\u201d he also observed, \u201cI think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201d The White House fired back that the president disagrees with Gates\u2019 assessment in a statement saying, \u201cJoe Biden has been one of the leading statesmen of his time, and has helped advance America\u2019s leadership in the world. President Obama relies on his good counsel every day.\u201d [Photo illustration - In a rare move the White House is allowing photographers access to Biden\u2019s regular lunch with the president today.] Playing defense - On NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, former White House Adviser David Axelrod called Gates\u2019 language \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cconfusing.\u201d \u201c[N]ot only did [Gates] praise [Obama] for the Bin Laden raid, but he thought [Obama] made the right decisions on Afghanistan, that he was a clear, thoughtful, decisive decision-maker. So his big complaint is that he thinks that [Obama] wasn\u2019t sufficiently personally in his heart committed enough to his own strategy. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d Axelrod claimed there had been \u201cno Afghanistan strategy\u201d prior to Obama taking office and that Obama focused on a limited mission against al Qaeda and bringing the troops home. AL QAEDA RESURGENT - U.S. officials suspect Abu Sufian bin Qumu, a former inmate at Guantanamo Bay was involved in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on an American outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

Kelly File: Obama\u2019s Abandonment - Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., a Marine veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, told Megyn Kelly that the surge by Islamist militants in Iraq are a consequence of President Obama\u2019s withdrawal policy.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I see here is a political squandering of military victories and an abandonment by this administration of everything we did in Iraq.\u201d\u00a0Hunter said he believes the president abandoned the war in Iraq for \u201cpurely political reasons and that he\u2019s \u201cnot surprised\u201d that Obama, according to former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, appeared to doubt his own strategy in Afghanistan.

John Thune, R-S.D., wants to offer businesses that hire new workers from the ranks of the long-term unemployed a break on ObamaCare costs. Thune\u2019s proposed amendment to the administration-backed plan for another three-month extension of emergency benefits for those who have exhausted their state unemployment insurance would also give employers a six-month reprieve from their share of the payroll tax. It would also provide long-term unemployed individuals a low-interest loan, up to $10,000, to help them relocate in search of a new job. The $6.4 billion jobless benefits bill cleared its first procedural hurdle in the Senate Tuesday. Read more from Fox News here. WHAT DOES THAT COST?: OBAMACARE\u2019S OLYMPIC SIZED PITCH - Team Obama is hoping to seize on Olympic sized audiences to promote ObamaCare during next month\u2019s winter games in Sochi, Russia.

HHS declined to specify the size of the ad buy. Politico has the details. [The House is set to vote Friday on a bill that would require weekly reporting on the status of ObamaCare.

Breitbart has more.] MARYLAND DEMS MIGHT BAIL ON STATE\u2019S OBAMACARE SITE - The abysmal launch of Maryland\u2019s ObamaCare Web site is causing some of the state\u2019s top Democrats to consider abandoning it altogether and sending residents to the crash-prone federal site. Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, D-Md., had been initially opposed to the idea but with only 18,000 residents enrolled as of Dec. 27, he appears to be open to the option until his state\u2019s Web site improves. Fox News has more. ROLLBACK: WALMART PLANS BETTER DEALS THAN OBAMACARE - A Washington Examiner comparison has found health plans offered to Walmart employees are not only cheaper than those offered by ObamaCare, but they provide better access to high-quality medical care as well. Examiner reports \u201c...a 30-year-old smoker would pay up to $428 per month, in contrast to roughly $70 each month for a Walmart employee. A family of four could pay a $962 premium, but the same Walmart family member would pay about $160.\u201d NOT-SO FINEST - Eighty former members of the NYPD and FDNY were busted Tuesday for allegedly faking mental illness in a $400 million disability scam.

WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...John Stossel hits back at claims that the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor for Fox News Opinion. From Equality Versus Liberty: \u201cIt's true that today, the richest 1 percent of Americans own a third of America's wealth. One percent owns 35 percent! But I say, so what?

Scott Brown. Brown, who seems to be leaning toward a run in his newly adopted home state, hasn\u2019t declared yet. The script of the snarky ad: \u201cWhen Scott Brown was the senator from Massachusetts\u2026 he delivered for Wall Street \u2014 saving big banks $19 billion in taxes. And Brown wrote legislation helping big banks make risky investments. Now he\u2019s shopping for a Senate seat in New Hampshire. Really? That\u2019s good for Wall Street and great for Scott Brown, but it doesn\u2019t make sense for New Hampshire.\u201d CASSIDY CLOSING IN ON LANDRIEU IN CASH RACE - Louisiana Republican Senate hopeful Rep. Bill Cassidy raised more than $1 million during the last three months of 2013. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., raised slightly more, collecting $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. Still, in a sign Landrieu is fighting for her political life, the Democrat spent more to fend off attacks against her support of ObamaCare during the same period. The spending has increased Cassidy\u2019s cash-on-hand by a larger margin. Landrieu\u2019s war chest is $6.37 million compared to Cassidy\u2019s $4.2 million. The Advocate of Baton Rouge has the details. PICK SIX: SPOILER ALERT - The 2014 midterm elections could tip the balance of power in the Senate to the Republicans if the GOP can pick up six seats. Fox News First wants to know which six blue seats you think are most likely to turn to red this year. The consensus among readers so far (in order of times picked by readers): Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, West Virginia, South Dakota and North Carolina.\u00a0But a reader notes the GOP path to victory in South Dakota is more complicated than it would appear. Reader Don Peckham of Aberdeen, S.D., says former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler\u2019s run as an independent could complicate matters. Pressler, who subsequently left the GOP and twice backed President Obama, represented South Dakota in the Senate as a Republican from 1979 to 1997 and could still draw some GOP votes. Peckham wrote: \u201cPressler made the comment that he didn\u2019t care if he would be the spoiler for South Dakota.\u201d Share your top six picks.

Gilmore started a campaign on GoFundMe to raise $10,000 for the party and to help cover extra costs, including for her family\u2019s upcoming Make-a-Wish trip to London. Tavi suffers from osteocarcoma, an aggressive cancer of the bone that has recurred three times for the 16-year-old. But little did Gilmore know when she started the fundraiser that, while donations received through the website are generally considered gifts, for individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\u2014 a federal program that helps eligible low-income individuals deemed disabled cover costs for basic needs\u2014 any amount of money raised through the site is considered a type of resource. Gilmore\u2019s social security caseworker declined to comment for this article, but Gilmore said she was informed that if she accepted the donations, that money would be interpreted as income\u2014 and Gilmore would lose her SSI eligibility, which helped cover all medical costs for Tavi. By then, Gilmore said her overall monthly income, which included SSI and child support from Tavi\u2019s father, was about $814 a month. Gilmore also supports Demetrius, who has an intellectual disability and receives SSI assistance. Demetrius had struggled to find a job due to his disability, Gilmore said, and, until August 2015, she had not been receiving child support from his father. \u201cTo make it clear I was not trying to cheat the system or anything like that ... it is not my character even in times of struggle,\u201d Gilmore wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. \u201cAll I wanted by setting up the site was to get my kids and I out of homelessness, and not be in struggle mode any longer, while also hoping to put some joy in my daughter's life\u2014 something she hasn\u2019t had in a while.\u201d While stories abound of comparatively wealthier individuals receiving surprise tax statements for donations obtained through GoFundMe, Gilmore\u2019s dilemma sheds light on how causes that are meant to be altruistic can sometimes backfire on those who are most in need. After Gilmore was forced to have GoFundMe refund the thousands of dollars to the more than 300 friends and strangers who donated, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based nonprofit began trying to re-raise those funds to give Tavi the birthday party and London trip her mother wants her to have. Meanwhile, Gilmore and her children have secured section 8 housing, and Tavi\u2019s cancer has become terminal. \u201cShe suffered like many others suffer\u201d When Tavi was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at age 12, she began a slew of treatments, including 18 courses of chemotherapy over 30 weeks, and eventually an amputation of her left leg above the knee that has left her reliant on a wheelchair. Throughout her daughter\u2019s cancer battle, Gilmore has leaned on her faith, and she has maintained temporary jobs that have left her without a steady stream of health insurance. But getting Tavi to doctor\u2019s appointments was not only a time commitment, Gilmore said, but it was also a challenge. Throughout her daughter\u2019s chemotherapy treatment, Demicka would take Tavi to Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, about 25 minutes away, using a contracted transportation company, and they lived in a multi-floor building apartment building that required climbing three flights of stairs to get to their apartment. \u201cThat was really painful to watch her limp around,\u201d Gilmore told FoxNews.com in a phone interview. \u201cWith the stairs she had to hold on to me and hop up, and that put that stress on my back.\u201d As Gilmore went from one temporary job to the next, and Tavi\u2014 who also suffers from clinical depression\u2014 kept up with her classes online in the hospital or from home. Tavi\u2019s cancer has since recurred three times. Her doctor, Doug Hawkins, a professor of pediatrics and associate division chief of hematology and oncology at Seattle Children\u2019s, said about one-third of children with osteocarcoma will see their cancer recur even with the best of treatment. \u201c[Tavi] suffered like many others suffer\u2014 with nausea and vomiting, and she had to have feedings by an NG tube and have blood transfusions,\u201d Sue Ehling, a nurse practitioner who treats Tavi at Seattle Children\u2019s, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThat\u2019s all pretty typical. I think what makes them unique was their financial situation, and the mom being a single mom raising two kids. It just got progressively harder and harder for them.\u201d \u201cYou have to be available for all your appointments,\u201d said Ehling, who added that Tavi was admitted to the hospital three times in a row and had to attend follow-up clinical appointments over a two-week period. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d Ehling said. Hawkins, who described Gilmore as \u201cincredibly loving,\u201d said caring for a child with recurrent cancer \u201cbecomes an all-consuming task to take care of them.\u201d \u201cWe need to do what we can as a society to help patients and their children who are under these incredibly difficult circumstances,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. Tavi\u2019s recurrences have required three surgeries on her lungs, where the cancer had spread. Prior to Tavi\u2019s first lung surgery, on both the left and right, in September 2014, Gilmore quit her data entry job so she could stay home with Tavi. \u201cIt was heartbreaking that she was going to have to go through another surgery,\u201d Gilmore said, \u201cand facing cancer again, and then thinking about her health, and then me not being able to work again, and being at the hospital ... It was real frustrating to me.\u201d That month, as Gilmore stayed by her daughter\u2019s side in the hospital for the surgery, she called the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) to request food stamps. The following March, a CT scan of Tavi\u2019s chest during a checkup at Seattle Children\u2019s revealed the cancer was back in her right lung, so she underwent her second surgery in April. At that point, rent was $825, and in August 2015\u2014 when Gilmore had only begun to receive back-pay in child support from Demetrius\u2019 dad\u2014 her landlord raised it to $850. Gilmore said she had been receiving some nonprofit support, but the money wasn\u2019t enough. Some of her immediate family lives in Washington\u2014 but none of them were able to offer her financial support. \u201cMy mom is on Social Security, and my sister was taking care of her three kids and one is on Social Security,\u201d Gilmore explained. In September, Tavi had a third surgery on her lungs to eradicate the cancer. And in October, Gilmore moved her family from their apartment into a motel that she said an anonymous donor and Tavi\u2019s school had helped paid for them to sleep at from Nov. 2 to Nov. 17. \u201cGod, at that point, was my source of strength,\u201d Gilmore said. Next, Gilmore said the city of Tukwila contacted Pastor Jan Bolerjack at Riverton Park United Methodist Church, who took in Gilmore, Demetrius and Tavi, and let them sleep in the basement of the Tukwila church, where they stayed until Dec. 19, 2015. Bolerjack could not be reached for comment. Feeling like she had nowhere else to turn, Gilmore decided to start the online fundraiser while staying at the church. \u201cEvery month, we had been facing the possibility of being homeless, but I kept reaching out to different organizations, and then the hospital was sending us to different organizations to get help,\u201d Gilmore said, \u201cbut at that time, it finally ran out because I was running out of people to get help from.\u201d \u201c[The money] was nothing I worked for\u201d Six days after setting up the GoFundMe page on Nov. 22, Gilmore saw the amount raised through the campaign surpass $10,000 and eventually soar to nearly $16,000\u2014 all thanks to more than 300 friends and strangers who were touched by Tavi\u2019s plight and Gilmore\u2019s hopes for her daughter. \u201cI was in shock and overwhelmed with joy,\u201d said Gilmore, who at that point posted a video update on GoFundMe, telling her donors that when she had seen the outpouring of support she had started crying. But as the page racked up more donations, Gilmore said she learned through separate calls to her SSI caseworker as well as the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) that if she took the donated money, she would lose SSI eligibility, and thus Tavi\u2019s food and medical benefits. Whether an individual stands to benefit or suffer a penalty from using crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe depends on the nature of the donations as well as the amount. But in Gilmore\u2019s case, due to SSI, the amount was more relevant for that outcome. Christopher Floss, a tax and income attorney at Chicago-based Hoogendoorn & Talbot LLP, said that, under IRS laws, the rule that determines whether money raised through a crowdfunding site must be claimed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is straightforward. \u201cThe concept itself is pretty simple,\u201d Floss told FoxNews.com. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get anything in return for your contribution\u2014 specifically, if what you get in return for your contribution is greater than or equal to the gift, the IRS is going to look at that as a taxable exchange. So in that event, the receiver of the income would have to declare that as gross income.\u201d Floss said he wasn\u2019t personally familiar with Gilmore\u2019s case, but that, taking SSI out of the equation, her income tax liability seems null. \u201cIt sounds to me like this is a bunch of pure gifts by disinterested people who are not receiving anything in return, so that, to me, says these are just gifts,\u201d Floss said. According to GoFundMe\u2019s terms and conditions, and GoFundMe media director Kelsea Little, most donations received through the site are considered \u201cpersonal gifts,\u201d not taxable income. That influx of donations has amounted to what Little said are \u201cmillions\u201d of campaigns being hosted on the site for people raising money to cover medical costs, vacations, and even basic living needs after a personal tragedy. But whether Gilmore\u2019s donations were gifts is irrelevant because SSI laws are separate from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) laws, SSA spokesman William Jarrett told FoxNews.com in an email. People who receive SSI must report any changes in income, resources and living situation, or they may risk losing SSI eligibility. \u201cYou must have limited income and resources in order to receive benefits,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cGenerally, you can receive SSI if your resources are worth $2,000 or less,\u201d he said. \u201cResources that we count in deciding if you qualify for SSI include real estate (except for the home you live in), bank accounts, cash, stocks, and bonds.\u201d Barbara Silverstone, executive director of the National Organization of Social Security Claimants\u2019 Representatives (NOSSCR), an association of attorneys and advocates for the disabled, said that monthly $2,000 cap referenced by Jarrett hasn\u2019t changed in nearly 20 years. \u201cThat\u2019s very low,\u201d Silverstone told FoxNews.com. \u201cTheir income also can\u2019t be higher than their SSI amount, which is also low. Even with the amount you count as resources, these people are living so far below the poverty level\u2014 even when they\u2019re receiving SSI.\u201d Silverstone said Gilmore may have been able to reap the benefits of the GoFundMe donations if a friend who is not receiving SSI had created the GoFundMe page and thrown Tavi a party. \u201cBut Social Security doesn\u2019t always give the clearest information to the claimants,\u201d she added, \u201cso it was possible that that wasn\u2019t even explained as an option.\u201d Another option would have been for Gilmore to forgo SSI eligibility for a month and spend all the GoFundMe donations in that month-long period, and then reapply for the program with updated records, which most applicants are afraid to do based on the potential delay of income, Silverstone said. To avoid losing her SSI benefits, Gilmore said the SSA told her she would need to supply a list of all GoFundMe donors and the amounts they had submitted, and that the DSHS advised her to shut down the fundraising page by the end of December 2015. \u201cI was confused,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why it was considered income when it was nothing I worked for.\u201d Ann Mohageri, the Seattle region communications director for the SSA, said she advises all SSI participants to ask their caseworkers about any eligibility stipulation they\u2019re unsure about. \u201cI don\u2019t know in [Gilmore's] particular case, but in their case the medical care is probably worth far more than the actual dollar benefit,\u201d Mohageri told FoxNews.com. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important to you? We\u2019re not going to make you choose. You can choose what you want, but you can\u2019t have both.\u201d Gilmore left the page alone, not touching the money until she could explore all her options, and then asked GoFundMe to refund all $15,673 that donors had raised, which they did on Jan. 16, 2016. In a statement to FoxNews.com, Little, the GoFundMe spokeswoman, said the company worked \u201cvery closely with the Campaign Organizer (Gilmore) to help resolve the situation in the way that worked best for her and her family.\u201d \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished\u201d A handful of U.S. news outlets covered Gilmore\u2019s story, and Jacksonville-Fla.-based DirectlyTo, a 501(c)(3) caught wind of it, and reached out to Bolerjack at the Riverton Park United Methodist Church to connect with Gilmore. Through their organization, DirectlyTo founder Alvin Kennedy and executive director Kwesi Johnson help individuals jump-start philanthropic campaigns. What stood out about Gilmore\u2019s story to Kennedy was that she was at risk of losing her medical funding for Tavi, but also because they have personal experience being misled by crowdfunding websites like GoFundMe. Johnson and Kennedy, both 35, explained they started a campaign through GiveForward.com, another crowdfunding site, to raise money for a friend suffering from multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the bone marrow. They wanted to help him pay for goods and services like a stationary bike, a special chair, and food for healthy and organic meals. But the friend had been in between jobs and had been receiving government assistance, so his resources cap, like Gilmore\u2019s, was limited. Meanwhile, Johnson was concerned about the site\u2019s model, which is similar to that of GoFundMe\u2019s, as neither is a licensed nonprofit. \u201cIf I\u2019m donating, why isn\u2019t this a tax write-off for me?\u201d Kennedy recalled thinking. In part, that\u2019s where the idea for DirectlyTo came about, and now the site functions as a place where people who want to donate to a particular cause or person can work one on one with DirectlyTo founders to do so. Donors can receive a tax write-off for their contributions. With DirectlyTo, Kennedy and Johnson are trying to re-raise the money Gilmore lost when she had to refund the GoFundMe donations, and then they will use it to help her cover essential costs and fund Tavi\u2019s party and London trip, both of which are tentatively planned for spring, Gilmore said. Since launching the campaign Wednesday, Jan. 13, about 75 backers had raised almost $5,000 of its $15,000 goal as of Thursday morning. Johnson said he and Kennedy consulted a tax attorney before setting off to re-raise the returned donations. \u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018No good deed goes unpunished,\u2019 and we didn\u2019t want to be punished for doing something we could do for this young lady,\u201d Johnson told FoxNews.com. Gilmore said Tavi\u2019s most recent lab test results were relatively better but that her emotional state has gotten worse. \u201cShe\u2019s more depressed than they\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d Gilmore said. Tavi\u2019s mental health counselor could not be reached for this story. Gilmore said Tavi\u2019s doctors at Seattle Children\u2019s have requested that she move up her Make-A-Wish trip to London from July to March. \u201c[Tavi\u2019s doctors] are worried about something else coming up on the scans by July,\u201d she said. Tavi\u2019s surprise birthday party\u2014 which will include a truck with video games and which Gilmore wants to take place at their local community center\u2014 may also take place in March. Gilmore said she hadn\u2019t yet started planning the Make-A-Wish trip, but that for Tavi\u2019s birthday she hopes her daughter receives one simple yet essential gift. \u201cLove,\u201d Gilmore said, \u201cbecause I know that she\u2019s depressed that she doesn\u2019t have close friends and she feels lonely. I hope that it shows that she does have people that care for her.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Dylann Roof appears via video before a judge in Charleston, S.C., on Friday, June 19, 2015. The 21-year-old accused of killing nine people inside a black church in Charleston made his first court appearance. The killings of nine people at a black church in South Carolina appear to fit a grim pattern of violence fueled by hateful ideology, joining attacks by extremists in the last five years that have targeted Jewish and Sikh centers, federal government buildings and police officers. (Centralized Bond Hearing Court, of Charleston, S.C. via AP) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 Confronting extremists, law enforcement in the U.S. has been focusing on aspiring jihadists who align with the Islamic State, overshadowing longstanding concerns about avowed racists, neo-Nazis and anti-government militias. The South Carolina shootings, experts say, are a reminder of the persistent dangers posed by disaffected people who are bent on violence but whose statements before they act may skate below the radar of police and federal authorities. The killings at a black church in Charleston appear to fit a grim pattern of violence fueled by hate-filled ideology, joining other attacks by extremists in the past five years that have targeted Jewish and Sikh centers, federal government buildings and police officers. While the number of Americans professing extremist ideologies fluctuates, the election of President Barack Obama, coupled with a national economic downturn, has in recent years intensified anger among white supremacists and anti-government groups to levels not seen since the time of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, said Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League. \"We're actually about six years into a major resurgence of right-wing extremism, the largest we've had since the mid to late 1990s,\" Pitcavage said. The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, says it has counted more than 30 acts or plots of domestic terrorism or hate-driven rampages since 2010, an increase from the five years before that. Those include the killings in Kansas last year of three people outside a Jewish community center and Jewish retirement home; a 2011 bomb plot that targeted the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane, Washington; an assault-rifle attack on a Mexican consulate and federal courthouse in Austin, Texas; the murders of six at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and the slaying of two Las Vegas police officers by a couple with anti-government views who left behind a swastika and a yellow flag bearing the words \"Don't Tread on Me.\" The culprits are often individuals with little or no association with organized hate groups, acting on their own. In the Charleston case, 21-year-old Dylann Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder. He is accused of opening fire inside a Bible study last Wednesday night in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The Justice Department is investigating the killings as a hate crime. Roof, currently held on $1 million bond on a gun charge, had displayed on his Facebook page the flags of past white-led regimes in Africa and complained that \"blacks were taking over the world\" and that \"someone needed to do something about it for the white race,\" according to a friend who spoke with the FBI after seeing him on surveillance images. His erratic behavior in the months before the shootings included showing up dressed in all black at a shopping mall and posing questions in stores that aroused suspicions \u2014 such as asking employees how many people were working and when they closed. An online, hate-filled manifesto purportedly written by Roof surfaced days after the shooting and is being reviewed by the FBI. But tracking violent extremists before they act is difficult, in part because spouting hateful viewpoints isn't by itself a crime, and many of those who do commit violence aren't leaders of a movement but are disaffected individuals on the periphery of it, said Pitcavage. To some extent, law enforcement faces the same challenges in keeping tabs on Islamic State sympathizers seeking to travel to Syria or commit acts of terror at home \u2014 investigations in which the FBI dissects social media communications for evidence of intent to commit a crime. \"They tend not to be actively engaged with the movement,\" Pitcavage said of lone extremists. \"They're not joining organized groups. They're not extensively interacting online. They're not going to events and meetings.\" Ron Hosko, a former FBI assistant director and current president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said that when it comes to investigating would-be domestic terrorists, the FBI has long faced the challenge of not treading on free speech rights while trying to make the right call about when hate speech is about to cross the line into illegal action. \"It's a big, free country where people say crazy things, and part of that is just the uncertainty of what somebody will say versus what they intend to do,\" he said. John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism coordinator and now a professor at Rutgers University where he co-leads an initiative examining targeted violence directed at faith communities, said he believes there is more law enforcement can do \u2014 similar to its terrorism investigations \u2014 to track warning signs on social media and investigate Internet postings that hint at violence. \"We use them effectively in international terrorism cases,\" he said. \"We're not using these same tools with the same rigor when we're seeking to identify or detect potential school shooters or someone who would attack a church,\" he said. ____ Associated Press writer Ken Dilanian contributed to this report.",

OBAMA REKINDLES \u2018POOR\u2019 WAR - President Obama today will officially launch his latest assault on income inequality. Fresh from weeks of Hawaiian recreation, Obama is expected to harangue Republicans for their resistance to a $6.4 billion welfare package to give aid to those who have exhausted state unemployment insurance. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has scheduled a vote for this morning on the measure, but doesn\u2019t seem to have the five GOP votes necessary to advance the spending bill. His home-state colleague Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., is on board and Obama seems to have delivered the support of moderate Maine Republican Susan Collins, who sounded favorable after a Monday chat with Obama \u2013 an unusual move for a president famous for frosty relations with members on both sides of the aisle. To get three more votes, though, Reid might need to offer GOPers the chance to amend the bill, at which point they would surely force uncomfortable considerations like paying for it. [\u201cIt's not paid for. So it's about borrowing money from children in the future to pay for a benefit today. The real job is why aren't we creating jobs and why aren't we moving the economy and why aren't we picking the fiscal mess that's here? Why aren't we creating the confidence that needs to be developed for that to happen?\u201d \u2013 Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d] Pass or smash - The White House push for the spending bill is predicated on long-term unemployment being a crisis. Top Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling told reporters, \u201cWe have never, over the last half-century, cut off emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment was even barely over half the rate that we have right now.\u201d Of course, neither have federal benefits to the unemployed continued for as long as they have, stretching back to the panic of 2008. Republicans, including moderates like Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., aren\u2019t keen on the idea of an unconditional extension. If they say \u201cno\u201d to Reid\u2019s demand today, however, they can expect a thorough sliming by the president in a speech scheduled for just after the vote. Obama doesn\u2019t seem to think it will pass, given that the White House has invited those whose benefits have expired to stand behind the president for the event. Obama makes new \u2018promise\u2019 - The Hill previews an event President Obama has scheduled for Thursday in which he will further lay out his economic vision: \u201cThe president\u2019s remarks are designed to highlight his call to designate so-called \u2018Promise Zones\u2019 where the federal government would provide tax incentives, housing assistance, and education grants to fight persistent poverty, and come amid a broader populist push by the White House ahead of the Jan. 28 State of the Union address.\u201d Midterm messaging - The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is hitting hard at Republicans in the battle over unemployment benefits. In a release the DSCC slams the GOP saying, \u201cBecause of Republican Senate candidates and the reckless economic agenda they have embraced, long-term jobless insurance has expired for more than 1 million Americans who have been looking for work for at least 26 weeks, denying families the crucial relief they need while costing the economy an estimated 240,000 jobs.\u201d [National Journal\u2019s Michael Hirsh looks at how newly confirmed Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen\u2019s old-school liberalism could transform Washington.] Income politics: where are the jobs? - The U.S. has an unemployment rate over 7 percent, yet there are nearly 4 million U.S. job openings. Republicans argue that by extending unemployment benefits many job seekers will hold out for their \u201cperfect job.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013Watch Fox: Correspondent Molly Henneberg explores the disparity and what is causing stopping some from getting back to work YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: BENEFITS FUEL UNEMPLOYMENT - Extending unemployment benefits will only fuel further unemployment. That was the prevailing opinion viewer voters shared with Weekly Standard Senior Writer Stephen Hayes\u2019 during Monday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel. As measured by Bing Pulse, Hayes\u2019 statement, \u201cWhat's surprising to me is Republicans aren\u2019t making a moral case about how often unemployment insurance that goes on forever leads to more unemployment,\u201d attracted high agreement from Republicans, Democrats and independents. Charles Krauthammer saw viewer engagement spike when he charged, \u201cThe result of Democratic policies is long-term unemployment, a terrible recovery, and all of this would indicate that what you have to do is to change the policies and not put on all the band-aids.\u201d On that point, viewer votes surged to 22,000 per minute. Bing Pulse measured 142,000 votes from viewer-panelists, see the full results here. Your voice matters. Make it heard and take a seat on the panel. THE OBAMACARE TAXMAN COMETH - The New Year is bringing a host of new taxes on insurance companies due to ObamaCare. Politico details: \u201cThe new levies include a multibillion-dollar assessment on insurance companies based on their market share, a fee that will be used to compensate insurers who take on the most costly policyholders and a penalty for individuals who decide to remain uninsured. A tax on so-called Cadillac health plans, set to begin in 2018, is the last major provision to kick in. SLOWDOWN IN HEALTH SPENDING NOT DUE TO OBAMACARE - From Washington Examiner: \u201cHealth care spending in the United States grew 3.7 percent in 2012, according to a new government study, representing the fourth straight year of relatively low medical inflation. But the report from actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stipulated that the weak economy over the 2009-2012 time period is the most likely reason for the slowdown in the growth of health spending, not President Obama\u2019s health care law.\u201d SISTER ACT: NUNS MAKE POTENT ADVERSARIES FOR OBAMA - The Supreme Court will soon rule on an ObamaCare lawsuit from the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order that operates charity nursing homes across the United States. The nuns want the high court to shield them from an ObamaCare provision that would require them to subsidize contraception for employees despite Catholic doctrine clearing forbidding birth control. Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted temporary relief to the nuns while the court mulls a final decision. The Obama administration wants the case dismissed on the grounds that lay workers at the homes are entitled to subsidized contraception. The clash is proving a publicity nightmare for the administration, particularly after a video from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty describing the orders\u2019 good works made the rounds. Watch Fox: Correspondent Doug McKelway profiles the Little Sisters of the Poor, and why the Obama administration has taken aim at them. SUPREMES WON\u2019T SHIELD DOCS FROM OBAMACARE - The Supreme Court refused a request from the Association of American Physicians & Surgeons and the Alliance for Natural Health USA to block ObamaCare\u2019s implementation.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney pointed to a plan to increase U.S. military sales to Iraq, including surveillance drones. Vice President Joe Biden phoned Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki Monday to express support for Iraq\u2019s government in the effort to drive out the al Qaeda-affiliated groups.

Schweitzer can fire up the base on some policy sore spots for Hillary, including domestic surveillance (he\u2019s against it) and marijuana legalization (he\u2019s receptive to it). Schweitzer also offered this critique of President Obama, \u201cAs governor I had four years to work with the Bush administration and four years to work with the Obama administration, and they\u2019re just not good at getting things done.\u201d When it comes to the Clintons, though, Schweitzer cuts closer to the bone: \u201cBut do you recall what the music was, blaring, after they were elected? \u2026 Fleetwood Mac, \u2018Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.\u2019 So what do we play next time?

NUNN RUN A THROWBACK - Senate hopeful Michelle Nunn, D-Ga., is getting some help from her father\u2019s old friends. The younger Nunn took in a $5,000 donation to her re-election effort from former Sen. Richard Lugar\u2019s, R-Ind., political action committee. Lugar and Nunn\u2019s father, former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., developed a close friendship when they worked together on nuclear non-proliferation during their time in the Senate. Nunn raised an impressive $3.3 million in the first five months of her campaign, including $500 from former Sen. John Warner, R-Va. The dough won\u2019t likely do much, though, unless Republicans have a train wreck of a primary, as Democrats hope.

Presidents have long taken advantage of the Constitution\u2019s provision that the chief executive may make temporary, emergency appointments to key positions without confirmation from the Senate. The allowance for so-called recess appointments was conceived as a way to let the executive branch function during times when the Senate was out of session and Philadelphia was a long carriage ride over rutted roads from most of the nation. But modern presidents have used it to install controversial appointees unlikely to win confirmation into important posts for one year. President Obama\u2019s decision to push the envelope and fill out the National Labor Relations Board with pro-Union picks when the Senate was not technically in recess may permanently deprive the executive branch of that helpful loophole. The Supreme Court is holding an extended session today to hear arguments on this case. [The Seattle Times has the back story of a pop bottler in Yakima, Wash. that spurred the case that could alter the federal balance of power.] High stakes - Senate Republicans have joined the bottling company in seeking to have the appointments struck down and the board\u2019s rulings after the non-recess recess appointments invalidated. If Democrats manage to stave off Republicans in midterm elections, the case won\u2019t be so important in the immediate future, since under powers newly assumed by Senate Democrats, presidential appointments can be confirmed with 51 instead of 60 votes. But if the GOP manages to win half of the dozen Senate seats that seem to be in play this year, it would nix Obama\u2019s chances to fill key positions unless he was willing to make compromises with his longtime red team adversaries in the Senate.

It's another to work at making them believe that you believe as president that their sacrifice is worth it, that the cause is just, that what they are doing is important for the country, and that they must succeed.\u201d He went on to compare Obama\u2019s approach to that of President George W. Bush\u2019s, \u201cPresident Bush did that with the troops when I was secretary. I did not see President Obama do that.

But a bipartisan supermajority\u00a0 in the Senate is threatening to buck a presidential veto threat and vote to reinstate the tougher sanctions if the current talks don\u2019t bear fruit.

But when it came to sustaining Israel\u2019s strength, security and prosperity for future generations, the Bulldozer \u2013 as he was affectionately known to his comrades-in-arms \u2013 had a canny knack of knowing when to engage constructively when he deemed it to be in Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d OBAMACARE YOUTH DEFICIT MAY TRIGGER BAILOUTWhile the administration boasted enrolling over a million people in ObamaCare during December, new data from state exchanges show young people are not buying into the embattled health law. \u201cData from seven states and the District of Columbia, which are running their own marketplaces, show that of more than 200,000 enrollees, nearly 22 percent are 18 to 34 years old, according to a Reuters analysis. The administration had hoped that over 38 percent, or 2.7 million, of all enrollees in 2014 would be 18 to 35 years old, based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate that 7 million people would sign up by the end of March.\u201d And remember, those numbers are likely better than for most states because the District of Columbia includes Hill staffers forced to sign up for ObamaCare. The consequences could be huge. While industry insiders say that bailouts for insurers will keep the law afloat, if the enrollments skew this old, not even the much ballyhooed \u201crisk corridors\u201d could prevent rates for most Americans from skyrocketing.

From HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton: \u201c\u2026they [Hillary aides Kris Balderston and Adrienne Elrod] recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet the names and deeds of members of Congress. They carefully noted who had endorsed Hillary, who had backed Obama, and who had stayed on the sidelines\u2014standard operating procedure for any high-end political organization. But the data went into much more nuanced detail. \u2018We wanted to have a record of who endorsed us and who didn\u2019t,\u2019 a member of Hillary\u2019s campaign team said, \u201cand of those who endorsed us, who went the extra mile and who was just kind of there. And of those who didn\u2019t endorse us, those who understandably didn\u2019t endorse us because they are [Congressional Black Caucus] members or Illinois members. And then, of course, those who endorsed him but really should have been with her \u2026 that burned her\u2026 Their spreadsheet formalized the deep knowledge of those involved in building it. Like so many of the Clinton help, Balderston and Elrod were walking favor files. They remembered nearly every bit of assistance the Clintons had given and every slight made against them. Almost six years later, most Clinton aides can still rattle off the names of traitors and the favors that had been done for them, then provide details of just how each of the guilty had gone on to betray the Clintons\u2014as if it all had happened just a few hours before. The data project ensured that the acts of the sinners and saints would never be forgotten. There was a special circle of Clinton hell reserved for people who had endorsed Obama or stayed on the fence after Bill and Hillary had raised money for them, appointed them to a political post or written a recommendation to ice their kid\u2019s application to an elite school. On one early draft of the hit list, each Democratic member of Congress was assigned a numerical grade from 1 to 7, with the most helpful to Hillary earning 1s and the most treacherous drawing 7s. The set of 7s included Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), as well as Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Baron Hill (D-Ind.) and Rob Andrews (D-N.J.).\u201d [Daily Caller ponders why Bill and Hillary Clinton backed a George Soros-supported for-profit college scheme.] IRS LOOKS TO MAKE IT OFFICIALWith the scandal from heavy-handed tactics by IRS agents against President Obama\u2019s political enemies still lingering, the Obama administration wants to make it easier for agents to crack down on similar groups.

BEVIN GETS A BOOST FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUPA conservative group that played a key role in the 2012 primary upset by Ted Cruz in Texas is jumping in for Kentucky hopeful Matt Bevin. The Madison Project is opening five field offices in the Bluegrass state to organize grass roots efforts for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s challenger. McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore blasted the group\u2019s political director, Drew Ryun for recently tweeting Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was a \u201ctool.\u201d Moore told the Lexington-Herald leader, \u201cTheir genius strategy is to smear Mitch McConnell, call Rand Paul a 'tool,' and then ask Kentucky Republicans to abandon their own and support Matt Bevin.\u201d PICK SIX: THE ED FACTORThe next 294 days will prove crucial for Democrats seeking to survive the midterm elections and still hold control of the Senate. Republicans only need to knock off six vulnerable Democrats and Fox News First wants to know who you think they are. Reader Frank Catenaccio said the entrance of former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie in Virginia\u2019s Senate race could shake things up for Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.

Male and female viewers who used Bing Pulse to have their say during the All Star Panel on Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d agreed with Jonah Goldberg\u2019s indictment of the press: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the mainstream media is willing to do the due diligence on a road closure in New Jersey but wasn't willing to read the ObamaCare bill.\u201d Discussion of President Obama\u2019s Iraq policy drew heightened viewer interaction. Charles Krauthammer\u2019s charge that the president\u2019s inability to forge a strategic partnership with Iraq has contributed to a resurgence of al Qaeda saw a spike in viewer votes. Krauthammer\u2019s statement, \u201cal Qaeda now controls more territory than ever in its history, and it isn't in Afghanistan at the edge of the world,\u201d\u00a0 drew 22,000 viewer votes per minute.

REID PATRON: I DIDN\u2019T KNOW LAUNDERING DONATIONS WAS WRONGA top political patron of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told the Nevada State Bar he did not know it was illegal to borrow $130,000, disburse it to family and friends and instruct them to make donations at the legal limit to Reid\u2019s 2007 re-election campaign. Harvey Whittemore, facing two years in federal prison after a jury found him guilty of political corruption charges, is asking to have his law license restored even as he awaits a ruling on his appeal of the conviction. One of those speaking on his behalf, a retired federal judge appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, told the disciplinary board: \u201cI knew Mr. Whittemore was always supporting political candidates and, I don\u2019t mean to be pejorative, but I\u2019m sure Harry Reid was always out there with his hand out.\u201d The Reno Gazette-Journal has the story. WALKER WINS FREE SPEECH VICTORYA Wisconsin judge last week threw out subpoenas in secret \u201cJohn Doe\u201d probes by Democratic prosecutors decried as partisan intimidation tactics by supporters of Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis. WSJ opines: \u201cThis means that prosecutors essentially invented without evidence the possibility of criminal behavior to justify the subpoenas and their thuggish tactics. At least three targets had their homes raided at dawn, with police turning over belongings, seizing computers and files, and even barring phone calls\u2026 The judge\u2019s order vindicates our suspicion that the John Doe probe is a political operation intended to shut up Mr. Walker\u2019s allies as he seeks re-election this year\u2026 The John Doe process has become a political weapon intended to serve partisan ends regardless of the law. Kudos to a judge who was brave enough to read the law and stop it, but there\u2019s more free-speech defending to do.\u201d [Is that you, Donald Rumsfeld? - For sale in Friday\u2019s WaPo classified section: \u201c55th Inauguration Cufflinks\u2026 George Bush January 20th, 2005\u2026\u201d The asking price from an unnamed seller in Anne Arundel County, Md.:\u00a0 $75] DIDN\u2019T GET AMAZON PRIME\u2026Astronauts aboard the International Space Station just received their delivery of Christmas presents.

WHITE HOUSE SHAKEUP: PANIC PLAY? - As President Obama looks to reverse a second-term tailspin, he\u2019s bringing back the man who helped launch his first term. John Podesta, founder of the influential left-wing\u00a0group the Center for American Progress, served as White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton. Podesta helped Clinton regain his footing following his impeachment for lying about an affair with a White House intern. Podesta, though, was faulted for allowing lax practices at the end of the Clinton presidency, when scandals, including the alleged sale of presidential pardons, erupted. Podesta, who led Obama\u2019s transition team in 2008 and 2009, is coming aboard as an adviser but not with a specific title. NYT first reported Podesta\u2019s new role, pointing out that the Democratic fixer and brother to Washington mega-lobbyist Tony, has been unofficially advising Obama for years. [Ed Henry wants to know - \u201cIs bringing John Podesta in just some window dressing or is it the start of a genuine effort to go outside the circle of the team that botched the rollout of his signature initiative?\u201d \u2013 Ed Henry] For real? - Obama last week brought back his former legislative liaison to Congress, Phil Schiliro, as part of what now seems to be a slow-moving shakeup. Certainly there are plenty of problems with the way Team Obama has been executing details, particularly in the press shop and in dealing with Congress. But will Clintonite Podesta have the power and access to make changes? The last Clinton insider who tried to turn around the Obama White House, Bill Daley, left in 2012 after a one-year stint as chief of staff. Reports said that he found little traction in the insular world of Obama\u2019s inner circle. OBAMA MAKES NICE WITH CASTRO - In a Kodak moment that\u2019s making a splash, President Obama shook hands with Cuban ruler Raul Castro during a memorial service in Johannesburg for Nelson Mandela.\u00a0The grip and grin is only the second time since the Castro family took power 50 years ago that a U.S. president has shaken hands with a leader of the communist nation\u2019s regime. Bill Clinton was the first, clasping hands with the previous ruler, regime-founder Fidel Castro in 2000. The move drew immediate outrage on the right as conservatives bashed Obama\u2019s willingness to elevate the leader of an oppressive regime famed for its human-rights abuses. Obama brought domestic politics into his eulogy for Mandela as well with a dig at conservatives who celebrate Mandela\u2019s cause of freedom but oppose redistributive economic policies. \u201cThere are too many of us who happily embrace Madiba\u2019s legacy of racial reconciliation, the president said, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality.\u201d\u00a0Fox News has more.

Gonzalez became an international figure at age six when the U.S. government took him away at gunpoint from his mother\u2019s relatives in Miami (she had died fleeing to America) to be sent to Cuba where his father and the government demanded his return. The Castro regime is highlighting Gonzalez\u2019s visit to a conclave for young socialists in Ecuador and a birthday interview with state media. The young man certainly sounds like a believer, speaking lovingly of former ruler Fidel Castro, via AP: \u201cHe always came for my birthday. I always looked forward to that moment,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI'm a person of few words (and) I clammed up when he was there, but it was enough to see him and give him that hug. I always remember what he told me: That I was already somebody, that the whole world knew who I was, and now what I had to do was be good at something, that's what he asked of me,\u201d Gonzalez added. \u201cHe never cared which path I took ... the intention was that I be good at whatever I did.\u201d OBAMACARE PAIN PILL - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former senior policy adviser to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Megyn Kelly that many prescriptions may not be covered under ObamaCare. \u201cThe list of drugs that the plans cover, in many cases, aren\u2019t very long.\u00a0 And if the drugs aren\u2019t covered you\u2019re on your own, you basically have to pay for it entirely out of pocket, and the money that you spend on those drugs doesn\u2019t count against your out of pocket limit or against your deductible,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cThis could cost patients who need special drugs a lot of money, literally tens of thousands of dollars a year.\u201d Watch the full interview from \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d [WaPo: AIDS advocates say drug coverage in some marketplace plans is inadequate] OBAMACARE POLL: THEY\u2019VE TRIED IT AND THEY DON\u2019T LIKE IT - Fifty percent of voters disapprove of ObamaCare, 43 percent strongly so, according to a poll out from the budget hawk group Public Notice. The survey, conducted by Tarrance Group, found that while 40 percent of respondents approved of the health law, a majority of key groups disapprove including women ages 18 to 44 (51 percent), employees of small businesses (57 percent), adults in households with children (56 percent) and voters who\u2019ve tried to shop on ObamaCare Web sites (52 percent). The poll also showed that Members of Congress who voted for the president\u2019s law are getting a negative reaction from voters, with 43 percent saying they less likely to re-elect those who voted for the health law versus 38 percent who are more likely to vote for their member if he or she voted for ObamaCare. MEDICAID DUMP - More reports are emerging on how ObamaCare is incorrectly pushing Americans into Medicaid, a welfare program, when they are not eligible.

BAIER TRACKS: RED LINES FOR THE BLUE TEAM - \u201cAs much as ObamaCare is giving the president a headache on the domestic front, a new bipartisan push for Iran sanctions this week could reach migraine level for the administration on the foreign policy. President Obama is trying to make strides on a nuclear deal with Iran, and has signed onto a plan for reduced sanctions while Iran is supposed to be making disclosures about its secret nuclear program over the next six months. The deal is still hanging in the balance, though, as U.S., allied and Iranian negotiators haggle over the technical details. Meanwhile, Democrats, including Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and others, have signaled a willingness to sign onto a bill that would impose harsh new sanctions on Iran at the end of the six months if Iran doesn't comply. Well, Iran's foreign minister says if that happened it would kill the whole deal. Would the president veto a bill passed by majority Democrats in the Senate and risk Democrats\u2019 positions on Iran come 2014?\u00a0\u00a0 Good question and one that is no doubt on the minds of the vote counters in the White House.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier [Watch Fox: Secretary of State John Kerry testifies before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today.\u00a0 Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen will have the latest details.] IRS SCANDAL REWRITE? - President Obama\u2019s pick to lead the embattled IRS, John Koskinen, will have his confirmation hearing today, as the White House tries to rehabilitate the troubled tax collection agency ahead of its new role in enforcing ObamaCare. In a recent MSNBC interview, Obama, who had previously apologized for the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups, waved away notions of intentional wrongdoing. DEAL ON DEFENSE BILL - House and Senate negotiators hammered out a final agreement on a Pentagon policy bill Monday. Under the agreement, commanding officers will be prevented from overturning sexual assault verdicts, a special victims counsel program for the survivors of sexual assault throughout the military would be expanded and retaliation for reporting assault would become a crime. Commanders would still be in control of the court martial process. Despite the administrations calls for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the measure would keep it open. NYT has the details. Where does the money go? - Former Navy Secretary John Lehman looks at how Americans are spending more but getting less when it comes to national defense. From WSJ: \u201cWhile the fighting forces have steadily shrunk by more than half since the early 1990s, the civilian and uniformed bureaucracy has more than doubled. According to the latest figures, there are currently more than 1,500,000 full-time civilian employees in the Defense Department -- 800,000 civil servants and 700,000 contract employees. Today, more than half of our active-duty servicemen and women serve in offices on staffs.\u201d FEE FOR THEE? - Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., are finalizing a budget deal that would lift the spending caps from the 2011 debt-limit deal, known as \u201csequestration,\u201d with $65 billion in new income for the federal government. Washington Examiner points out that the new money would largely come from government fees. The airline industry has voiced its opposition to the proposed deal as it would double the security tax charged to passengers. Fees would also increase on banks to pay for federal mortgage subsidies, resulting in hundreds of dollars in new costs for consumers.

YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: PROMISES BROKEN - ObamaCare is socialized medicine and few members of Congress actually read the bill before voting on it.

As measured by Bing Pulse, viewers across the political spectrum also agreed when Weekly Standard Senior Writer Stephen Hayes said the promises the administration made before ObamaCare passed, are simply not true. Discussion of ObamaCare\u2019s sticker shock drew an increase from our audience-panelists as viewers across the political landscape agreed with the Hill\u2019s A.B. Stoddard when she said the promise of affordable care under the president\u2019s health law was broken. Stoddard also saw a surge in viewer voting intensity, to 24,000 viewer votes per minute, when she said she expected health care costs to rise even if the administration increased enrollment.

NEWSEUM BOWS TO DOJ PRESSURE ON DISABILITY REGS - D.C.\u2019s Newseum, a steel and glass bastion of political correctness, has nonetheless come under the thumb of the federal government.

            "article_content": "AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) One of the most profound statements about this election was made last week by Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Acknowledging that the campaign had \u2018turned her stomach\u2019 (I don\u2019t think she\u2019s alone in that), the popular Republican argued that when it comes to deciding who to actually vote for, \u201cThis is no longer a choice for me on personalities, because I\u2019m not a fan of either one. What it is about is policy.\u201d She reluctantly concluded that \u201cthe best person based on the policies and dealing with things like Obamacare still is Donald Trump...That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an easy vote, but it does mean that I\u2019m watching out for the people of South Carolina and I\u2019m watching out for the people of this country and that\u2019s who I will be voting for on Nov. 8.\u201d Gov. Haley is right that neither candidate has made this an easy vote -- even for their supporters. Clinton has confirmed all the worst fears people had about her: the lying, the corruption, the constant political calculation and lack of deep conviction; the jaw-dropping arrogance and sense of entitlement displayed by her and her acolytes in America\u2019s insular ruling elite; their snooty and divisive contempt for working people and anyone who doesn\u2019t share their ideological worldview. On the other side of the fence, Donald Trump has tested the loyalty of even his most fervent supporters with a string of offensive remarks, displays of almost crazed indiscipline, self-generated distractions from his fundamental argument for change, and revelations about his attitude to women that nobody could possibly defend. What is the best way to think about the 2016 election? Is it not acceptable to vote, in good conscience, for a candidate on the basis of the likely consequences of their election on people\u2019s real lives, rather than some nebulous impact on our \u2018culture\u2019? The question for the responsible voter is: how to weight these questions of character alongside questions of policy and the likely real-world impact of voting for one or other of the candidates? For the left, the choice is clear, and was perhaps best expressed in a New York Times headline: \u2018How Could Anyone Vote for Trump?\u2019 Most Clinton supporters cannot give you a positive reason to vote for their candidate other than the fact that she is not Donald Trump. The Clinton campaign has really made only one argument in this election: that Trump\u2019s personal character traits should disqualify him from the presidency. They do not attack his tax plans, or his support for school choice, or any other policy position. They just say that voting for Trump means endorsing sexism, racism and...well, you heard the \u2018deplorables\u2019 speech - you get the picture. The election, according to the Democrats, should be about the \u2018message\u2019 that a Trump vote would \u2018send\u2019 rather than what a President Trump would actually do. But is that really the best way to think about the election? Is it not acceptable to vote, in good conscience, for a candidate on the basis of the likely consequences of their election on people\u2019s real lives, rather than some nebulous impact on our \u2018culture\u2019? All this reminds me of a concept first proposed by psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943: the Hierarchy of Needs. The idea is that human beings prioritize their needs in a fairly logical way. The first priority is physical -- the need for things like food and shelter. Once these basic requirements for survival are met, people look for other things that make life worthwhile, like love and a sense of belonging. Right at the top of Maslow\u2019s \u2018Hierarchy\u2019 is what he describes as \u2018Self-actualization\u2019 -- the need to define yourself in a way of your choosing. It seems to me that this is why the rich coastal elites are backing Hillary and have turned on Trump. They can afford a Clinton presidency, whatever outcomes it delivers. They don\u2019t really care whether a President Clinton would grow the economy a little, a lot, or not at all -- they will do just fine. But for the half of all Americans who still, according to official statistics earn less than in 1999, such virtue-signaling is a luxury. Their basic needs are not being met, and they desperately need change, even if it's delivered by someone who is a long way from being their perfect candidate of 'Self-actualization'. It really matters to them what happens to the economy, jobs, the cost of healthcare and many other practical matters, where the Trump policy agenda -- especially if allied with a GOP-controlled Congress -- could bring positive forward movement after years of stagnation, hardship and anxiety. How dare anyone tell these Americans that they\u2019re wrong -- or worse, immoral -- to weigh up the choice that way? As Nikki Haley made clear, you don\u2019t have to agree with everything Donald Trump says or does to conclude that he would make the most positive, practical difference in the real lives of real people. In the end, isn\u2019t that what elections are supposed to be about?",

            "article_content": "For more than two years the American people, in a great majority, from left to right, have been in revolt against the political class and the financial elites in America. It is a revolt with historic parallels, most closely resembling the Jacksonian revolution of the 1820s. It is an uprising. It is a peaceful uprising of a people who see a country in decline and see nothing but failure in the performance of their leadership institutions. And they have signaled their intent to take back their country and to reclaim their sovereignty. Unfortunately, the analysts, the pollsters and most importantly the commentariat of the political class have never understood, and in fact are psychologically incapable of understanding what is happening. And for the entire cycle of this presidential campaign they have failed to grasp what was happening before their eyes \u2013 for it runs counter to everything they believe about themselves. In truth, they are suffering from cognitive dissonance\u00a0 believing in their righteous superiority and are not capable of realizing that it is they who have become the adversary of the American people. And therefore they have been wrong, in this entire election cycle, every step of the way. For them, American politics only began yesterday. They know little history and have no appreciation of the collective consciousness of the American people. Whether it is the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who came within a hair\u2019s breadth of knocking out the coronated nominee of the Democratic establishment or on the other side, the emergence of the total outsider Donald Trump, the most improbable candidate of all. In truth, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, sucked from the same trough even if it was from opposite ends. But the critical point that is missed, by almost everyone, was that neither Sanders nor Trump created this uprising. They were chosen vehicles \u2013 they did not create these movements, these movements created them. In less than a day we will know how far this revolt has come. But, make no mistake, whatever the outcome, this revolt is not ending, it is merely beginning. In less than a day we will know how far this revolt has come. But, make no mistake, whatever the outcome, this revolt is not ending, it is merely beginning. Several years ago, I began, with my colleagues at Armada, an ongoing, in-depth research project on what has become known as the \u201cCandidate Smith\u201d project. A good friend of mine, Lee Hanley, who sadly just passed away, volunteered to begin this project with only one charge: that we explore my hypothesis that something profound was happening in the collective consciousness of the American people. What we learned in our in-depth research was as astonishing as it was unexpected. It became clear from this really deep public opinion inquiry that American politics has entered an historic paradigm. What is emerging in what had been assumed to be the static political system was about to be reconfigured in ways and that we still do not know fully. But one thing is certain: the old rules of politics are collapsing and a new edifice is emerging. The conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is a tired falsehood. Overall, in the attitude structure of the American people, the elements of this new paradigm are commonly shared by upwards of 80 percent of the population \u2013 from the Occupy Wall Street movement on the left to the Tea Parties on the right. The political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgency. The larger atmosphere is dominated by three overriding beliefs: First, the American people believe that the country is not only on the wrong track but almost 70 percent say that America is in actual decline. The concept of decline is antithetical to the American experience. Second, for more than three centuries, the animating moral obligation of America has been the self-imposed obligation that each generation passes on to its children a better America than they themselves inherited. This is what makes us Americans. In Armada\u2019s polling we found that a majority of Americans believe that they are better off than their parents were. But a great majority says that THEIR children will be worse off than they themselves are today. This is the crisis of the American Dream. And it is no surprise that a majority of Americans agree that if we leave the next generation \u201cworse off\u201d that there will still be a place called \u201cthe United States\u201d but there will no longer be an \u201cAmerica.\u201d Third, when asked whether or not everyone in America plays by the same rules to get ahead or are there different rules for well-connected and people with money, a staggering 84 percent of voters picked the latter. Only 10 percent believed that everyone has an equal opportunity. These over-arching attitudes provide the framework for today\u2019s political revolt. Unfortunately, I suspect, if you asked these questions of the political, financial and media elite they would have a very different response. From the time I was a teenager and a self-starting pollster I have had an acute interest in the phenomenon of political alienation. \u00a0In our research, the current level of alienation that now grips the American electorate is staggering and unprecedented. Here are some of our latest results among likely voters from early October 2016: 1.\u00a0 The power of ordinary people to control our country is getting weaker every day, as political leaders on both sides, fight to protect their own power and privilege, at the expense of the nation\u2019s well-being. We need to restore what we really believe in \u2013 real democracy by the people and real free-enterprise. AGREE = 87%; DISAGREE = 10% 2.\u00a0 The country is run by an alliance of incumbent politicians, media pundits, lobbyists and other powerful money interests for their own gain at the expense of the American people. AGREE = 87%; DISAGREE = 10% 3.\u00a0 Most politicians really care about people like me. AGREE = 25%; DISAGREE = 69% 4.\u00a0 Powerful interests from Wall Street banks to corporations, unions and political interest groups have used campaign and lobbying money to rig the system for them. They are looting the national treasury of billions of dollars at the expense of every man, woman and child. AGREE = 81%; DISAGREE = 13% 5.\u00a0 The U.S. has a two-track economy where most Americans struggle every day, where good jobs are hard to find, where huge corporations get all the rewards. We need fundamental changes to fix the inequity in our economic system. AGREE = 81%; DISAGREE = 15% 6.\u00a0 Political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people. AGREE = 86%; DISAGREE = 11% 7.\u00a0 The two main political parties are too beholden to special and corporate interest to create any meaningful change. AGREE = 76%; DISAGREE = 19% 8.\u00a0 The real struggle for America is not between Democrats and Republicans but between mainstream American and the ruling political elites. AGREE = 67%; DISAGREE = 24% These numbers and many, many more from our research paint the true outlines of the emerging political paradigm and the insurgency that it has ignited. In fact, it is the last question above that is agreed to by \u201conly two-thirds\u201d of the American people. Despite everything we are told day and night \u2013 that political battle in America is between Democrats and Republicans \u2013 two thirds of the American people believe that the battle lines are drawn between mainstream America and its ruling Political Class. THIS is the battle of 2016 and beyond. These are findings that the reader has likely never been told. For they reflect the legitimate dissent of the American people from the actions and leadership of their establishment institutions. This is something the political class and mainstream media refuse to recognize much less acknowledge. Befitting the emerging new paradigm, 2016 has already been an election like none we have ever known. But it is not without some parallels to another election. In 1980, America was gripped with a foreign policy crisis, there hostages being held in Iran, inflation was exploding and the electorate was very unhappy. The country had two candidates for president: the incumbent \u2013 President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan. For the first time in polling history both candidates, Carter and Reagan, were viewed negatively by the American people -- although their negatives were nowhere near the level of Clinton and Trump\u2019s unpopularity. While the shock of Vietnam and Watergate had helped propel an unknown peanut farmer to the presidency, there was nowhere near the level of alienation and discontent that now grips America. I was Jimmy Carter\u2019s pollster and strategist in 1980 and I know, more than anyone, about what really happened. The entire Carter campaign was premised on painting the controversial Ronald Reagan as too risky to be president and too dangerous to entrust with nuclear weapons. Exactly a week before Election Day there was a fatal presidential debate (that I wanted to avert) which gave Ronald Reagan his chance to make his case. It shook up the election. The coalescing of voters around Carter began to break down. Within a couple of days Reagan had established a small lead over President Carter. On the Saturday before the election the race had rebounded into a tie or slight Carter lead. And then it all fell apart. My polling for the campaign told the story. By Sunday night President Carter was 5 points down and by Monday night the margin had exploded to 10 points down. The uniqueness of 1980 is this: In the history of American polling this was the only presidential election that entered the last weekend close and finished in a landslide. The only one. The question on the table now is: could 2016 be the second such election? If it is, it won\u2019t be for Hillary Clinton. The political class and the mainstream media have a narrative that Trump\u2019s late surge is the result of an intervention by FBI Director James Comey. That narrative, like every one they\u2019ve had over this cycle, couldn\u2019t be more wrong. The momentum of the election was already moving toward Trump before Comey\u2019s announcement to reopen of the Clinton email investigation. That event, like the presidential debate in 1980, tended to accelerate what was already in motion. No two elections are really the same, whatever similarities they share. And neither are 1980 and 2016. Here are a couple of differences \u2013 In 1980 there was no early voting. Without thinking through the consequences, this reform has resulted in millions of ballots being cast long before the campaign culminates. And that is almost surely an edge for Hillary Clinton and the better organized Democratic Party. While both elections in 1980 and 2016 feature an American public that attitudinally wants real change there are differences that have already been noted: Many polls show that by just about 2 to 1 voters do not want to continue the policies of President Obama. In 1980 disapproval of Carter\u2019s job performance did not extend to the personal feelings Americans had for Carter and the deep respect they had for his integrity. \u00a0(And of course, in both elections, Americans saw the country headed in the wrong direction.) As suggested before, the alienation and discontent of the American electorate is way beyond that of 1980. In 1980 the mainstream media was far more even-handed in its coverage and prided itself on journalism and not partisanship. As I look at some of the deeper polling results, the questions I have been able to inject into the Breitbart/Gravis polling questions of recent days, may be in the end, instructive. As with Jimmy Carter in 1980, Hillary Clinton is far more likely to be viewed as qualified to be president and possessing a better presidential temperament. But the results of the latest poll are worth pondering: Here are the most interesting questions and answers. \u00a0\u00a0First, voters were asked to agree or disagree with following question: For years, the political elites have governed America for their own benefit and to the detriment of the American people \u2013 this election is the best chance in our lives to take back our government. AGREE = 63% (with 46% strongly agreeing); DISAGREE = 31% Voters were then asked the same two questions of each candidate: Which is closer to your opinion if (Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump) wins: the political elites and special interests win; the political elite and special interests lose. By 65 percent to 35 percent voters said that if Hillary Clinton wins the political elites WIN.\u00a0 And by an opposite margin, the majority of voters said that by 57 percent to 43 percent the elites LOSE if Trump wins. Significant numbers of Clinton\u2019s own voters believe that her win is a victory for the unpopular elites and special political interests. So the question is, if these attitudes are salient in the voters\u2019 minds as they vote on Tuesday it could produce the biggest surprise of all in 2016. But regardless of who wins on November 8 this uprising of the American people has just begun.",

            "article_content": "Close presidential race in Texas as record number of people show up on first day of early voting Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. \"If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,\" Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. School officials have pointed to the recent firebombing of the North Carolina Republican Party headquarters and the shooting-up of another with a BB gun as the type of trouble they fear come Election Day. Talks of a rigged election, mainly spoken by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has also increased anxieties across the nation. Some are worried about clashes between the self-appointed observers and voters. Parent Alpay Balkir said he is glad children will be home. His 8-year-old son is a student in Falmouth, where the high school doubles as a polling place. \"If it's going to be as chaotic as they say it's going to be, it's a good thing. Kids should stay out of it,\" Balkir said. \"I don't know what the environment is going to be like.\" Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It's difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. \"There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering, that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?\" said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. \"If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.\" Though many have expressed concerns about the potential for violence, the National Association of Secretaries of State does not advocate having armed guards at polling stations because their presence could intimidate voters. Some of the pressure to close schools on Election Day or move voting is coming from parents. Sara Andriotis, a mother in the Easton, Pennsylvania, area, pushed for voting to be taken out of local schools. \"We were mostly concerned because of the risk that it puts our children in,\" she said. Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. \"If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: 'Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'\" he said. \"I just think we've reached the point where we need to look at other locations.\" That's happening in Hall County, Nebraska, which got out ahead of the trend in May when it moved six polling places out of schools for a primary. Those changes will remain in place next month. Voting will be held at three churches and one community center. Election officials elsewhere say that schools are vital places for voting and that removing them as polling places creates logistical headaches and voter confusion. \"We wouldn't be able to conduct voting without them,\" said Pam Anderson, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association. She said voting in schools has not generally been a concern in Colorado but acknowledged there is likely to be more security this year. Early voting has already started in some states. The preliminary numbers appear to show Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, with an edge in several of the roughly 10 battleground states that will decide the 2016 White House race.

Trump, speaks during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Thursday, July 21, 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Ivanka Trump, the daughter of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, cast her father as a \"fighter\" for working people, particularly working women, in her remarks to the Republican National Convention Thursday night. Ivanka, a senior executive in her father's business, the Trump Organization, noted that the company has more female than male executives. Then, matching a campaign promise by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, she vowed her father would \"fight for equal pay for equal work and I will fight for this too, right alongside him.\" Ivanka, Trump's older daughter and the last of four Trump children to speak at the convention, sought to underscore her father's personal warmth beneath the public persona. She recalled playing with \"Legos and erector sets\" in her father's office, as well as his efforts to help ordinary people suffering from hardship. \"He would talk to them and then draw on his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break,\" she said. \"And they would leave his office, as people often do after being with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again.\" Ivanka is expected to be a key surrogate for her father in the general election campaign, particularly as he tries to make up ground against Clinton among women.

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Orlando Donald Trump narrowly leads Hillary Clinton in the battleground states of Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio. That\u2019s according to Fox News statewide likely voter polls conducted Sunday through Tuesday evenings. Trump is helped by strong support from working-class white voters, while Clinton is hurt by a lackluster performance among younger voters and women. In each state, Trump\u2019s advantage is within the margin of sampling error. \u00a0Here\u2019s how the numbers breakdown state-by-state: Nevada Trump has a three-point advantage over Clinton among likely voters in the Silver State (43-40 percent). \u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson receives eight percent. \u00a0Nevada voters also can cast a ballot for \u201cnone of these,\u201d and that option takes four percent. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is not on the ballot in Nevada. Independents back Trump (42 percent) over Clinton (23 percent) and Johnson (21 percent). The Democrat is trailing expectations among women and younger voters. CLICK HERE TO READ THE NEVADA POLL RESULTS Those under age 45 are almost equally likely to back Clinton (42 percent) as they are to back Trump (39 percent) -- and Johnson garners double-digit support (11 percent). Women in Nevada backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 16-point margin in 2012, according to the Fox News Exit Poll. Clinton\u2019s up by just six points. Both Clinton and Trump supporters have a high degree of vote certainty (93 percent each). \u201cThere is a huge geographic disparity in Nevada,\u201d notes Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \u00a0\u201cClinton is ahead in Vegas and urban areas, while Trump leads outside Vegas and in rural areas -- this is an obvious advantage for Clinton in get-out-the-vote efforts.\u201d The race is mostly unchanged in a head-to-head matchup without Johnson: \u00a0Trump 46 vs. Clinton 42 percent. Views of President Obama\u2019s job performance are divided: \u00a049 percent approve, while 48 percent disapprove. \u00a0He won Nevada in both 2012 (by 6.7 points) and 2008 (by 12.5 points). North Carolina In North Carolina, Trump is up by five points among likely voters. He receives 45 percent to Clinton\u2019s 40 percent, and 6 percent favor Johnson. \u00a0Stein is not on the ballot. Whites back Trump by a 31-point margin (58-27 percent), while blacks support Clinton by 82 points (85-3 percent). Independents favor Trump (41 percent) over Clinton (24 percent) and Johnson (14 percent). And while voters under age 45 prefer Clinton by 46-32, Johnson gets 11 percent of them. CLICK HERE TO READ THE NORTH CAROLINA POLL RESULTS Ninety-five percent of Trump supporters and 90 percent of Clinton backers feel certain of their vote choice. In the two-way ballot, Trump\u2019s also up five (47-42 percent). North Carolina was red in 2012 (Romney by two points) and blue in 2008 (Obama by less than one point). \u00a0By a 50-46 percent margin, more voters disapprove than approve of Obama today. Ohio The Buckeye State is another must-win for Trump, and the poll finds him up by five points among likely voters: 42-37 percent. Johnson receives six percent and Stein gets two percent. Trump\u2019s edge over Clinton comes mainly from independents (+20 points) and working-class whites (+26). \u00a0Clinton\u2019s up by just three points among women. \u00a0Obama won them by 11 in 2012. Most of Clinton\u2019s (89 percent) and Trump\u2019s supporters (88 percent) are certain they will back their candidate. \u201cClinton\u2019s mistakes on the campaign trail have driven many disaffected Republicans into Trump\u2019s camp,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cJust as consequential is the fact Trump is ahead of Clinton among independents by 17-20 points in these states. \u00a0If that holds, he might actually pull this off.\u201d Meanwhile, by a 58-30 percent margin, voters approve of the job Republican John Kasich is doing as governor. \u00a0Among those who approve, 45 percent support Trump, 33 percent back Clinton, and 7 percent Johnson. CLICK HERE TO READ THE OHIO POLL RESULTS Without third-party candidates in the mix, it\u2019s Trump over Clinton by 45-40 percent. Currently, 47 percent of voters approve of the job Obama is doing, while 48 percent disapprove. \u00a0He won Ohio in both 2012 (by three points) and 2008 (by almost five points). \u201cTrump has been much more disciplined in his comments recently and is almost certainly benefiting from keeping his attacks focused on Clinton as opposed to other Republicans or Gold Star families,\u201d says Anderson. Meanwhile, Clinton trails Trump by two points among voters living in union households. \u00a0That voting bloc went for Obama over Romney by 23 points in 2012. Senate Races The polls, released Wednesday, also ask about the senate races in these key states, and find the races within the margin of error in Nevada and North Carolina, while Republican Rob Portman holds a double-digit lead in Ohio. \u00a0In each state, the GOP senate candidate fares slightly better than Trump. There\u2019s good news for Republicans in Nevada, where they hope to pick up the seat of the retiring Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid. \u00a0Joe Heck leads his Democratic opponent Catherine Cortez Masto by seven points: \u00a043-36 percent. \u00a0Independent American Party candidate Tom Jones trails with 6 percent and \u201cnone of these\u201d gets 5 percent. In North Carolina, incumbent Sen. Richard Burr bests Democratic challenger Deborah Ross by 43-37 percent, with Libertarian Sean Haugh at 6 percent. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman holds a 14-point lead over Democrat Ted Strickland: \u00a051-37 percent. \u00a0The incumbent senator tops the former governor by 28 points among independents. \u00a0Portman also garners the support of most Republicans (88 percent), as well as 15 percent of Democrats. \u00a0He won the seat in 2010 with 57 percent of the vote. \u201cWinning the four-to-five seats needed to regain control of the senate becomes a tricky proposition for the Democrats if the GOP gains the Reid seat and Burr holds on,\u201d notes Shaw. \u201cThe Democrats have to win their tight races in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and even that might not be enough.\u201d There\u2019s also a gubernatorial race in North Carolina. \u00a0Republican incumbent Pat McCrory tops Democrat Roy Cooper by 46-43 percent. \u00a0Libertarian Lon Cecil receives 3 percent. The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). \u00a0The polls were conducted September 18-20, 2016, by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among a sample of likely voters selected from statewide voter files in Nevada (704), North Carolina (734), and Ohio (737). \u00a0Bilingual interviewers were used in Nevada. \u00a0In all three states the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for the total sample of likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Head of Obama's transition team on president-elect's governing priorities The Hillary Clinton campaign on Sunday suggested the new batch of damaging WikiLeaks documents are bogus -- in an apparent attempt to defend what appears to be the Democratic candidate\u2019s candid views on such issues as Wall Street and the middle class. \u201cThey\u2019ve put out documents that are purported to be from my account,\u201d Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Podesta also attempted to explain Clinton\u2019s comments in the trove of campaign-related emails by arguing they were acquired by \u201cRussians\u201d hacking into the Democratic Party computer files to try to influence the November election. The WikiLeaks organization on Friday posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of Podesta\u2019s personal email account. Among the documents posted online was an internal review of Clinton\u2019s private Wall Street speeches to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public. In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, Clinton reflected on the necessity of \"unsavory\" political dealing, telling real estate investors that \"you need both a public and private position.\" To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she's \"kind of far removed\" from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. Podesta on Sunday dismissed the argument that Clinton indeed tailors her message to her audience. \u201cShe said all throughout this campaign she will crack down on Wall Street,\u201d Podesta said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that she said that she hasn\u2019t said in private that she doesn\u2019t say in public; she\u2019s put forward the most aggressive Wall Street plan of any candidate.\u201d He also said that people on Wall Street know how to \u201cgame the system\u201d and that Clinton wants to crack down on that culture to ensure there is no institution \u201ctoo big to fail and there\u2019s no person that\u2019s too big to jail.\u201d Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine on Sunday also questioned the veracity of the roughly 2,000 WikiLeaks documents. \"I don't think we can dig in documents dumped by WikiLeaks and just assume they're all accurate and true,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Some of the other hacked documents put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has struggled with repeatedly during the 2016 election. During the first general election debate, Clinton said she supports \"smart and fair trade.\" In another speech that year, Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. That's a position that plays right into political attacks leveled by Trump, who has accused Clinton of being bought and paid for by Wall Street. Clinton\u2019s top primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, repeatedly during their race called for Clinton to release transcripts of the speeches, for which she was paid millions. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Democratic presidential candidate receives extended ovation, addresses delegates in Philadelphia PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Democrats came to their convention here optimistic and hopeful that the country would never vote for Donald Trump.\u00a0 There have been some bumps in the road here. First, leaked emails showing that Democratic National Committee staff were clearly working on\u00a0 behalf of Hillary Clinton during the primary. This has filled the streets here with angry Bernie Sanders supporters, some of whom insist they won\u2019t vote for Hillary this fall or will back Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Democrats I spok with here also worry that Trump\u2019s efforts to woo disaffected working-class voters who backed Sanders could work. \u201cI\u2019ve seen first-hand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders,\u201d Trump said during his Thursday acceptance speech, a comment that seemed perfectly timed to take advantage of\u00a0 the DNC email scandal that exploded last Friday. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, may have resigned as the he DNC\u2019s controversial chairwoman, but she could be a potent symbol of a party that showed contempt for Sanders voters. Trump has now taken a 2 percentage point edge in the average of all the polls tracked by Real Clear Politics -- the first time he has taken a lead in that key metric.\u00a0 Polls show that for now Trump leads in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio, while has put longtime Democratic strongholds like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania into contention. \u201cTrump\u2019s portrait of a dark, crisis-ridden America where good jobs are scarce and life is grim sounds to some people in those states as their reality,\u201d says Michael Leary, a Hillary supporter from Philadelphia told me. Jim Bishop, a Sanders supporter from Indiana,, says he has met a lot of Sanders supporters here who will never vote for Trump, but could back the Green Party to build an alternative to establishment Democrats.\u00a0 If the Green Party wins more than 5 percent of the vote nationwide this November it would qualify for nearly $100 million in federal financing in the next election. Sanders as done all that he could to speak directly to the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d crowd at the Philadelphia convention. He has tried to disssuade his supporters from disrupting the convention yesterday.\u00a0 Sanders did not mention Wasserman Schultz or the email controversy in his own address to the delegates. Instead, he stressed that Clinton is a better choice than Donald Trump, and highlighted that his supporters had been able to get progressive ideas included in the party\u2019s platform.\u00a0 Despite his protestations of indifference, Donald Trump would have been pleased with even a smidgen of Bernie\u2019s helpful attitude\u00a0 when Ted Cruz addressed GOP delegates. Attempts to quell anger at the Hillary campaign will probably work to some extent. But the real problem Democrats confront in Philadelphia is this: Getting Sanders supporters out to vote might actually be a problem. Political analyst Harry Enten of the website FiveThirtyEight notes that : \u201cBefore the 2016 primaries, Sanders\u2019s supporters voted less frequently than other 2016 voters, and they were less reliably Democratic than Clinton supporters\u2026. In the 2012 general election, for instance, 88 percent of Clinton\u2019s 2016 primary supporters cast a ballot. Same with Trump supporters. And 87 percent of Cruz supporters voted in 2012. But just 79 percent of Sanders\u2019s voters did.\u201d No one believes that Sanders supporters are actually going to vote for Donald Trump - just 8 percent reported such sentiments in the latest Pew Research Poll. But staying home is quite possible -- after all some 40 percent of Americans do just that in every presidential election. They choose not to participate in a contest that many people, this year, as one delegate told me is really \u201ca choice of the evil among two lessers.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Bill Clinton speaks, Monday, Oct. 3, 2016 at Northbank Center in downtown Flint, Mich. Clinton is campaigning for his wife, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, in Michigan. (Jake May/The Flint Journal via AP) This year James Carville could sum up the key to the 2016 election by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s ObamaCare, stupid.\u201d Donald Trump wants to repeal ObamaCare. Hillary wants to expand it. The choice doesn\u2019t get any clearer than that. Knowing this, it\u2019s pretty clear that anyone who supports ObamaCare, supports Hillary. Anyone who despises ObamaCare and agrees it\u2019s a disaster is endorsing Trump. Enter Bill Clinton. Do Bill and his wife even speak to each other? Who is Bill Clinton campaigning for? First, a little education about the conservative position on ObamCare. Here is what I\u2019ve screamed from the highest mountains for the past eight years in thousands of commentaries, media appearances and four books: A) ObamaCare is a disaster for America. B) It\u2019s a nightmare for middle class Americans. C) It\u2019s a tragedy for small business. D) While poor people thinks it\u2019s hunky dory because they get it for free (who doesn\u2019t like free stuff?)\u2026middle class Americans are getting hosed. Their premiums, co-pays, deductibles are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling. It\u2019s unaffordable and unsustainable. It\u2019s turning middle class people into poor people dependent on government to survive. E)\u00a0Not only are premiums exploding, nothing is covered. Because of ObamaCare, health insurance no longer pays for anything. F) Because it\u2019s bankrupting 28 million small businesses, it\u2019s killing lots and lots of middle class jobs. G)\u00a0\u00a0Because no one has any money left after paying for ObamaCare bills and taxes, it\u2019s killing consumer spending and the entire U.S. economy. This is precisely why GDP is close to zero. Not one Democratic politician anywhere in America either understands or is willing to admit any of this. Until now. Guess who now agrees with me that ObamaCare is a disaster?\u00a0Former President Bill Clinton. You know, the guy married to Hillary. Bill Clinton announced it publicly just days ago in a speech in Michigan. Bill summed up everything I\u2019ve been saying and writing for eight long, lonely years. I guess he\u2019s been reading my books. Here are Bill\u2019s words: \u201cYou\u2019ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it\u2019s the craziest thing in the world.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, the current system works fine if you\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, if you\u2019re a lower-income working person. If you\u2019re already on Medicare or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.\u201d \u201cBut the people getting killed in this deal are the small-business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.\u201d That sounded like it came straight from my book \u201cAngry White Male.\u201d I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. Bill Clinton just validated and vindicated all the conservative critics of ObamaCare. He just admitted that everything I have ever said about what ObamaCare was -- and is -- correct. Now, keep in mind that Hillary thinks ObamaCare is fantastic. She thinks it\u2019s working just fine, with a few little tweaks. She thinks it should be dramatically expanded. She wants to raise taxes even higher. She wants more regulations. And she thinks the economy is hunky dory and we are on the verge of a great economic expansion. Which brings up two very important questions: Do Bill and his wife even\u00a0speak\u00a0to each other? Who is Bill Clinton campaigning for? I feel your pain, Bill. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s a POW blinking his eyes in Morse Code. He\u2019s trying to tell us all something. Thank you Bill for endorsing...Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the tightening of the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and why Hillary's Trump criticisms aren't sticking As poll after poll shows the presidential race tightening, Hillary Clinton has already fired most of her heavy artillery at Donald Trump. She has called him temperamentally unfit, too dangerous for the Oval Office and ignorant about foreign policy. She has said he makes racist statements and that many of his followers are in fact racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic and Islamophobic. She has said he\u2019s built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. She has denigrated his business record, mocked his corporate bankruptcies and accused him of stiffing small contractors. What else has she got? How do you stage an October surprise if you\u2019ve gone nuclear in July, August and September? No wonder Democrats are getting nervous. After all the stuff dumped on Trump by the Hillary camp and the media, he\u2019s tied in the CBS/New York Times poll, trailing by 1 point in a new Fox News poll, and ahead in such crucial states as Florida and Ohio. So what should Clinton do now? Rich Lowry made the point quite concisely in Politico: \u201cThe Clinton campaign has already used his greatest hits of most offensive statements in countless TV ads. I was appalled that Trump mocked a disabled reporter, but even I am sick of seeing the clip every other time I turn on the TV. If none of this has sunk Trump and the race gets even closer, what\u2019s left that is going to have a new and different shock value?\u201d This was always the danger in making the Clinton campaign primarily about demonizing Trump in a change election in which she is undeniably the establishment candidate. He does the same to her, but Trump is identified with a few signature issues: immigration, terrorism and using his business background to create jobs. Clinton has position papers on everything under the sun, but no single issue that generates excitement and no shorthand to sum up her candidacy. \u201cThe other guy\u2019s crazy\u201d isn\u2019t the most inspiring slogan. One thing that Clinton could do is sell herself as the better choice to the white working-class voters who are defecting to Trump. What will she do to make their lives better? These are folks who are drawn to the Trump brand because they\u2019ve heard so many empty promises over the years and want to shake up Washington. One thing she\u2019s barely done is to accuse Trump of flip-flopping after having supported Democratic policies in the past\u2014probably because she doesn\u2019t want voters to think he\u2019s actually a closet moderate. Trump, hardly an orthodox Republican, is trying to make inroads onto Democratic turf\u2014and appeal to women\u2014by proposing paid maternity leave and child-care tax credits. Clinton has her own proposals, but Trump got more attention by using his daughter Ivanka as a TV surrogate. It\u2019s been fascinating to watch conservative pundits say they don\u2019t favor an expansion of the welfare state, then quickly pivot to why this is good politics for Trump. There\u2019s no question that Clinton, back on the trail yesterday after fighting pneumonia, will continue hammering Trump, in part because that\u2019s what generates headlines. She asked whether America can put a \u201cloose cannon\u201d in charge of the country. But have we reached the point where we\u2019re desensitized to the terrible things these candidates say about each other?",

            "article_content": "Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to the audience at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., October 13, 2016. (REUTERS/Mike Segar) On the heels of defending a damaging 2005 video recording recently released wherein Donald Trump could be heard making lewd comments about his affinity for pursuing women by kissing and groping them, the Republican presidential nominee responded on Thursday to new allegations from five women, including a former reporter for People magazine, who collectively told the aforementioned magazine, The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post that he had sexually assaulted them several years ago. \"For The New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,\" Jason Miller, Trump's campaign spokesman, said in a statement regarding the new allegations. \"To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.\" Miller was referring to claims from 74-year-old Jessica Leeds, of New York, who told The Times that Trump grabbed her breasts and attempted to put his hand up her skirt without her consent more than 30 years ago in the first class cabin on a flight to New York. Another allegation in The Times\u2019 report, from Rachel Crooks, claims Trump kissed the real estate developer on the mouth in 2005 without her consent, echoing comments from the recording, wherein he said, \u201cI just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\u201d Although supporters of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton have been quick to condemn Trump for his comments and these new claims, Trump supporters and undecided skeptics alike are defending his character. Many people are questioning the veracity of these women\u2019s allegations\u2014 and particularly, if their comments are true, why they are only speaking up now. Trump has neither been charged with sexual assault nor have these women\u2019s claims been proven true, but from a psychological standpoint, waiting to admit sexual assault is not out of the ordinary, several experts told FoxNews.com. In fact, only about 10 to 15 percent of sexual assault cases are reported due to the shame, guilt and self-blame that these traumatic events can trigger, Dr. Bob Geffner, president and founder of the Family Violence & Sexual Assault Institute, who has been treating sexual assault victims for nearly 40 years, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThere\u2019s no research study that indicates even half of these get reported to anybody at any time,\u201d said Geffner, also a distinguished professor at the California School of Professional Psychology, San Diego. Experts define sexual assault as any type of unwanted, pressured or forced interaction of a sexual nature by one person on another. But an estimated 80 percent of these incidents do not involve what psychologists describe as the classic \u201cstranger danger\u201d scenario, wherein a man breaks into a woman\u2019s bedroom with a ski mask and weapon, forcing himself on her against her futile attempts to scream and defend herself, Mindy Mechanic, a psychology professor at California State University Fullerton, told FoxNews.com. Rather, victims\u2019 relatives, coworkers, friends or partners\u2014 be it a boyfriend, girlfriend, date, or a spouse\u2014 are the most common perpetrators of sexual assault. \u201cThere\u2019s that confusion that it doesn\u2019t fit the paradigm, and if you don\u2019t say this was a crime, then reporting isn\u2019t even on the table,\u201d Mechanic said. It is only when victims acknowledge they have been harmed and feel they\u2019re in a safe zone, where they will be believed and not scrutinized, that they are likelier to admit being sexually assaulted, Kenneth Yeager, director of the stress, trauma and resilience program of the Ohio State University Department of Psychology, told FoxNews.com. Feelings of having strength in numbers can compel admission as well. For example, of the more than 50 women who have accused Bill Cosby of drugging and/or sexually assaulting them in alleged assaults that date back to 1965, it wasn\u2019t until 2014 that a flood of allegations began to surface. \u201cIt does play psychologically to safety\u2014 it does play psychologically to, \u2018If this individual had the courage to do it, maybe I should have the courage to do it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to model our behaviors and take risks based on what we see other people doing, and sometimes that risk being taken by another can motivate individuals to take the risks. Oftentimes the outcomes are mixed, but knowing that you won\u2019t be doing that alone makes it easier to take the risk.\u201d Geffner said that perceived risk may be a lack of a support system or fear of public scrutiny. Brian Pinero, vice president of victim services at RAINN, the largest advocacy network for sexual assault victims in the United States, told FoxNews.com that usually these incidents involve power imbalances, which make victims feel that if they speak up at the time, they will be penalized. \u201cA lot of times, it can be tied to the job,\u201d Pinero said. \u201cPower isn\u2019t just defined by money or status at company\u2014 it could also be an important person in a family. So the ability to make a charge of that is, \u2018Prove it.\u2019 And that\u2019s the constant narrative of victims: You have to explain why they should be believed and justify why they should be helped because it\u2019s always, \u2018What were you wearing?\u2019 \u2018What were you drinking?\u2019 \u2018Why were you there?\u2019 \u2018Where were your girlfriends?\u2019\u201d Yeager likened delayed admission of sexual assault to that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which research suggests soldiers can wait upwards of years to admit due to similar feelings of shame and barriers like stigma. Just as with PTSD, sexual assault often brings feelings of depression, anxiety and flashbacks that can be debilitating for victims, and in severe cases, increase the risk of suicide. \u201cWhether it\u2019s trauma of sexual assault or whether it\u2019s trauma of a war situation, people tend to think in the terms of what are they in control of,\u201d Yeager said. He explained that most people are raised with something that\u2019s called a world belief: that, if you treat people right and do things right, good things will happen to you. When that belief system is disrupted by something like a traumatic event, people naturally begin to question their reality and role in the situation. Questions like \u201cWhat if?\u201d and feelings of, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault\u201d arise, \u201cbecause they\u2019re only looking at things they can control,\" Yeager said. As these feelings of shame, and self-blame and doubt begin to compound, most victims don't tell their direct support systems about their experiences, much less law enforcement. \u201cIf [victims] only begin to see the world as not a safe place, then you don\u2019t talk about these things,\" Yeager said. \"You don\u2019t share them because if you share them, it\u2019s only going to make things worse, and, \u2018Good people don\u2019t have these things happen to them\u2019\u2014 and that\u2019s the belief that becomes internalized when, in fact, they\u2019re victims.\u201d Trump has threatened to pursue legal action against The Times and the Palm Beach Post, claiming their reports are libelous.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host on whether Trump can actually win over Sanders supporters One of the strangest questions in politics is whether disaffected Bernie backers might wind up on the Trump train. It scrambles all the usual Beltway assumptions on left-right politics. After all, how could diehard supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2014who\u2019s so far left that he\u2019s unhappy with eight years of Obama liberalism\u2014move to a Republican who wants to build a wall on the Mexican border and temporarily bar Muslim immigrants? Part of the answer is that the electorate has changed. And part is that voters don\u2019t operate the way pundits do, with an issue-by-issue checklist that requires ideological consistency. Trump rails against a rigged system. Sanders rails against a rigged system. Trump even says the Democratic Party is screwing Bernie and, in a bit of mischief-making, urges him to run as an independent. They both tee off on unfair trade deals and play to middle-class economic anxieties. That populist approach touches a nerve far more than a bunch of carefully worded position papers. \u201cA lot of those people would come with me,\u201d Trump said of Sanders supporters yesterday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cI'm no fan of Bernie Sanders, but he's right about one thing: trade agreements.\u201d Many Americans go with their gut. Trump comes from outside the political system. Sanders is a veteran senator but until last year wasn\u2019t even a Democrat. They are both leading movements. No wonder there\u2019s some overlap. In the end, I think most of those feeling the Bern will fall into line and back Hillary Clinton. But the fact that Trump has a shot at a good chunk of them\u2014which could help put a few Democratic-leaning states in play\u2014is a sign of the scrambled politics of 2016. It\u2019s also a sign of a changing electorate. Trump was arguably the least conservative Republican in that field of 17. Sanders would have been the most liberal Democratic nominee since LBJ. National Review Editor Rich Lowry picks up that point: \u201cSanders\u2019s and Trump\u2019s styles and affects are very different \u2014 the rumpled, oddball lecturer in Socialism 101 vs. the boastful, power-tie-wearing business mogul \u2014 but they have worked in tandem to ensure that the center of gravity in this fall\u2019s presidential election will be further to the left than it has been in decades.\u201d Lowry argues that \u201cSanders and Trump have executed a squeeze play on the Madam Secretary. Sanders pushed her to the left on trade and Social Security in the primary, when she disavowed the Trans-Pacific Partnership that she helped negotiate and embraced increasing Social Security benefits. She probably won\u2019t be snapping back to the center on those issues in a general election because it would open her up to Sanders-like attacks from Donald Trump. Such is the shift in the tectonic plates of our politics that the presumptive Republican nominee for president, endorsed by voices on the right ranging from Sean Hannity to Mitch McConnell, is making a far-fetched but not entirely irrational pitch for the support of fans of a Vermont socialist.\u201d Let\u2019s take this a step further. If both parties are edging left, it doesn\u2019t come as some kind of backlash to a right-wing administration. Charles Krauthammer declares that \u201cafter nearly two terms of Barack Obama\u2019s corrosively unsuccessful liberalism \u2014 both parties have decisively moved left. Hillary Clinton cannot put away a heretofore marginal, self-declared socialist. He has forced her into leftward genuflections on everything from trade to national health care. At the same time, Bernie Sanders has created a remarkably resilient insurgency calling for \u2014 after Obama, mind you \u2014 a political revolution of the Left\u2026 \u201cThe Republicans\u2019 ideological about-face is even more pronounced. They\u2019ve chosen as their leader a nationalist populist who hardly bothers to pretend any allegiance to conservatism. Indeed, Donald Trump is, like Sanders, running to the left of Clinton on a host of major issues including trade, Wall Street, NATO, and interventionism.\u201d This was deemed heresy by true-blue conservatives during the primaries, but I kept reminding folks it would make Trump a stronger general-election candidate if he got that far. And there is growing nervousness on the left that Hillary could lose to The Donald: \u201cClinton has no chance of winning a majority of working-class white voters,\u201d Salon says. \u201cThey have voted heavily Republican for years, especially working-class men. In the 2014 midterm elections, for example, working-class whites voted for Republicans by a 30-point margin. But Clinton needs to win some of them. In 2012 Barack Obama won the support of about 35 percent of working-class whites, which was enough to help him win reelection\u2026 \u201cIf she lets Trump position himself as the tribune of the working class, she\u2019ll only dig a deeper hole for herself with blue-collar voters.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that an evolving electorate is driving some of this political upheaval. The growing proportion of minority voters means a Republican has to win more white voters to offset losses in that community. A new generation of younger voters takes for granted such matters as same-sex marriage, which used to be a Republican wedge issue. And voters who came of age during the Iraq war may share a wariness of military intervention, reflected in Trump\u2019s frequent criticism of George W. Bush\u2019s invasion. Perhaps Trump, who doesn\u2019t emphasize social issues, and Sanders, who doesn\u2019t emphasize foreign policy, both sensed this new reality. And maybe the idea that they share a certain appeal isn\u2019t so crazy after all.",

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: CLASS CLASH: HILLARY TRIES TO HEAD OFF WALKER Hillary Clinton gave a speech today calling for new regulations and hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to fight income inequality. The topic was a reaction to the rise of Bernie Sanders, whose socialist platform is catching fire among Democratic activists. But the timing is about someone else: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker, finally having birthed a budget in Wisconsin, is making his candidacy officially-official today with a rally in Waukesha. That location is no accident and neither is the fact that Walker\u2019s announcement video starts with him in dungarees and a Harley t-shirt. The message is that Walker is a middle-class guy with a blue collar background. Much as Clinton\u2019s husband endlessly touted his roots in Hope, Ark., Walker is running as the man from Waukesha. Maybe not so poetic, but not every top-tier presidential candidate gets a shout-out on the sign at the McDonalds where they used to work. (Plus, Bubba really grew up in Hot Springs\u2026) As Clinton sizes up the Republicans who mean trouble in the general election, she has to account for the name identification and enormous fundraising of Jeb Bush, the generational and historical appeal of Marco Rubio and now, the middle-class message of Scott Walker, the Kohl\u2019s candidate. Clinton is looking to bracket Walker\u2019s rollout with an appeal to the frustrations of workers left behind by the changing economy: a federal surge aimed at shoring up the battered middle class. Walker, not surprisingly, is expected to attack Washington elitism and centralization of power. Policy particulars do matter, especially as Walker tries to up his credibility quotient with a skeptical GOP intelligentsia. And Walker faces a double challenge as he tries to win the esteem (or at least acceptance) of the GOP elite: that he is ever more open to claims from other conservatives that he is flip-floppish. Advisers dropping blind quotes to National Journal about prospective pivoting to the center will be great fodder for those who call Walker inconstant. It\u2019s not quite \u201cEtch-a-sketch\u201d but it reflects the same kind of lunk-headedness on the part of process-obsessed advisers. Biography and attitude, though, generally matter more in politics. Walker\u2019s electability argument is that he as an outside Washington, blue-collar guy can best take on a Democratic candidate seen by many voters as of Washington and-out-of-touch. But to do that, he will have to face down a full field of Republicans, many whom have little to lose in their attacks on him.

The biggest upheaval comes from, who else but Donald Trump. While Trump\u2019s media super-saturation soaked many in the GOP field, hardest hit was the other prominent businessperson in the race, Carly Fiorina. Fiorina has much of the message and attitude that admirers of the current version of Trump have praised: tough on illegal immigration, breaking the back of the federal bureaucracy, bringing business-style accountability to government, etc. But Fiorina, who manages to state these positions without being accused of racism, is relatively little known while Trump started from a position of fame and has become a media omnipresence in the last three weeks. He will certainly do damage to other candidates in the race, and potentially to the eventual nominee. But the greatest harm will come to those, like Fiorina, who find themselves passed over for media coverage and stand the risk of missing out on the first debate next month on Cleveland. With Trump in the race, a rising star like Fiorina can\u2019t. Returning to the top 10 this week is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has ramped up his early-state and media presence ahead of a July 21 announcement.

Can the GOP keep the Senate? While most of the talking heads are talking about the presidential race, the contest for control of the Senate is heating up. And we want you to have your say. Democrats need to flip five seats from red to blue (and avoid losses on their own turf) to retake the Senate after the 2014 wave election swept the blue team into the minority. But which ones are the most vulnerable? There are 13 Republican seats up for grabs, but several, like the one from bright-red Louisiana look like a long shot for Democrats. Others, like the one from President Obama\u2019s home state of Illinois, look like low-hanging fruit for the minority party. But for the ones in between, it\u2019s hard to tell, especially so early in the cycle. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for your help.

            "article_content": "In this Sept. 29, 2016, photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Bedford, N.H. (AP Photo/John Locher) We live in a corrupt country. We thought America was different from a Banana Republic, but we were na\u00efve.\u00a0We were wrong. How do I know? Look no further than the panic among the media, establishment and political elite class about the possibility of Donald Trump taking power. Everyone in power is scared and desperate to stop Trump. They\u2019ll do anything and say anything to stop him from winning the White House. This presidential election looks like a carbon copy of the Brexit vote in UK only months ago. And, guess what? We are\u00a0seeing the same fear, panic and desperation among the\u00a0Washington ruling class. Trump is our Brexit. Let\u2019s call our version... TREXIT. There is a reason every living U.S. president and ex-president supports Hillary. There is reason most establishment politicians of\u00a0both\u00a0parties support Hillary. There is a reason the Bush family supports Hillary. There is a reason why connected Beltway insiders (like former GOP Senator Mark Warner) are supporting Hillary. There is a reason why the billionaires like Mark Cuban, Warren Buffett and Mike Bloomberg support Hillary (and despise Trump). There is a reason hedge fund CEOs have given Hillary almost $50 million vs. $19,000 to Trump. There is a reason that not\u00a0one\u00a0Fortune 100 CEO has given a donation to Trump. There is a reason why Hillary is setting all-time fundraising records and outraising Trump by a mile. -- It\u2019s all big money donations from Wall Street, banks, billionaires and billion dollar multi-national corporations. Every corrupt, greedy, entitled, fat-cat creep is lined up to hand a bag of cash to Hillary. Because they know if she wins, \u201cTHE FIX IS IN.\u201d They know under President Hillary the country is up for sale. They know they\u2019ll own the president of the United States. They know she\u2019ll hand them the keys to the taxpayers\u2019 vault. On the other hand, Trump couldn\u2019t care less about their resume, pedigree, title or wealth. He\u2019ll throw them out the door on their butts. They\u2019ll get rich under Hillary. They\u2019ll starve under President Trump. They fear Trump because they all feed at the public trough. Because they are all part of the slimy, corrupt system rigged against middle class Americans. Trump threatens to upset their apple cart. He will turn their worlds upside down. He will end their gravy train. The jig is up -- all of their fun at the people's expense ends on November 8th\u00a0if Trump is elected. They cannot afford to let Trump get into the White House, for fear\u00a0he'll gain access to the cooked books. Then their crimes and fraud and greed and bribery will be exposed. Then government bureaucrats are getting fired. People are going to jail. Career politicians and lifelong bureaucrats will lose their power and pensions. Companies will lose government contracts. It\u2019s simple. The people giving this record amount of campaign cash to Hillary are the people who are screwing us. -- These are the career politicians and elite political class that have gotten rich by rigging the system against us. These are the people who know the secret handshake. They wink when Hillary says \u201cI\u2019m for the middle class.\u201d Because they know this is code for \u201cGet ready for the great highway robbery. We\u2019re going to rip these poor helpless people off again.\" WINK WINK.\u201d They hate Trump, they fear Trump, they are desperate to stop Trump because they can never own him. He\u2019s not like Hillary. Hillary is like a NASCAR driver -- she should wear patches with corporate logos on her pantsuits. She is bought and paid for. She is owned by foreign governments and foreign companies. Think of all the evil despots who gave billions to her Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Every one of them gained access and government contracts or awards. Every one of them now owns President Hillary Clinton. Every one of them can get anything they want from President Hillary or they will blackmail her. Trump won\u2019t promise them a thing. You can\u2019t bribe a man worth billions. He doesn\u2019t need their dirty money. Amazingly, he doesn\u2019t\u00a0want\u00a0their money. Trump is winning despite being tight with a buck -- he literally runs his campaign for president by spending next to nothing. Hillary has outspent Trump by tens of millions of dollars per month, and she still can\u2019t pass him in the polls. The very last USC/LA Times poll of September has Trump up by 5 points. Trump doesn\u2019t need money. He campaigns only on the raw politically incorrect truth. Just like Brexit. All these hedge fund moguls and Fortune 100 CEOS and lawyers and lobbyists hate Trump because Trump is our Brexit. Just like Trump in our U.S. presidential election today, none of the media experts in the UK believed Brexit could win. Just like with Trump, the UK establishment elite was desperate. They threw everything at Brexit but the kitchen sink. They trotted out every political hack. They got every media endorsement. They tried to scare the voters with apocalyptic predictions of disaster and economic collapse. Every oddsmaker predicted Brexit would lose. Every poll showed Brexit losing. But the media experts and the establishment elites were all wrong about Brexit. The people ignored all their hysterical warnings and negative predictions. They\u2019d had enough. They didn't shout this time, they whispered. Then they turned the UK political world upside down. Brexit won. Trump is our Brexit. Just like Brexit, everyone I meet is whispering Trump's name. Just like Brexit, the American people have had enough. They no longer listen to the mainstream media or the establishment politicians. This is a revolution. On November 8th\u00a0it\u2019s our turn to shock the world. Get ready for TREXIT.",

            "article_content": "Dan Springer reports from Seattle America\u2019s suburbs: They\u2019re sprawling, replete with shopping centers and bike paths \u2013 and they\u2019re often where presidential elections are won or lost. But in a potential problem for the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump has not fared so well in the \u2018burbs so far this cycle. Even as the billionaire businessman attracted more primary votes this year than any Republican candidate in history, the battleground occupied by America\u2019s middle class is where he may have to make inroads if he is to defeat Hillary Clinton in November. \"Donald Trump speaks in language that many Americans like -- but they're not suburbanites,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Take Washington state\u2019s Duvall, a small but fast-growing suburb of Seattle. It's long been friendly territory for Republican candidates. But in last month's state primary, the Republican share of the vote in Duvall was 11 percent lower than it was in the 2008 primary. A GOP vote decline was\u200e seen in every city in the wealthy suburbs east of Seattle. But it wasn't just Washington state. In North Carolina, Trump lost three of the four largest counties, including those areas around Raleigh and Greensboro, where he won just 32 percent and 29 percent, respectively. In Iowa, he lost Polk County \u2013 which includes Des Moines -- to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, as well as the counties around Davenport and Iowa City. In the D.C. suburbs of Virginia, a state that is swing territory in the general election, Trump lost Prince William County with 33 percent and Loudon County with 28 percent. He also lost in the suburbs in the critical state of\u200e Ohio. He lost Cuyahoga with 32 percent, Franklin County with 22 percent and Hamilton County with 32 percent. Those counties include suburbs around Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, respectively. Trump, though, started off at a unique disadvantage in the Ohio primary, as he was competing against Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who won the state. By contrast, in the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton won all those counties except for a couple she lost to Bernie Sanders in Iowa. Joel Connelly, who is covering his eighth presidential election for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, suggested some suburban voters just aren\u2019t sold on Trump\u2019s message. \"Suburban voters want competence,\" Connelly said. \u201cThey are looking for someone who will govern efficiently, not get us into wars, not create chaos, because they live in an orderly world.\" Where Trump did remarkably well is among rural voters and working-class white voters in urban areas. His message that the economy is broken due to bad trade deals made by career politicians resonates \u2013 it\u2019s a message Trump hammered repeatedly on the campaign trail this week, even threatening to pull the U.S. out of NAFTA if necessary. \"If your ports aren't active, then your rural agriculture areas will suffer,\" said Don Benton, Trump's Washington state campaign director. \"Your inner city, if you don't have jobs, there's more people unemployed. So certainly it could have something to do with the fact that suburbia has always been a little insulated from the rest of the country.\" Republican Party leaders insist the suburbs will be in play come November, even though soccer moms and college-educated voters are proving a tougher sell for Trump.

            "article_content": "FILE -- April 27, 2016: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gives a thumbs up after giving a foreign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Every American woman who professes to believe in God has a responsibility to raise her voice in this election cycle and vote for a candidate who stands ready to restore America and that means American values as the strongest force for good and freedom that modern history has known. There is no doubt the women\u2019s vote will be the most sought after of all demographics since a woman is the nominee of a major party for the first time in history.\u00a0 But, most women I know are not so shallow as to vote for someone based on gender.\u00a0 They consider a number of factors when making an important decision based on a person\u2019s character and priorities. There can be debate and disagreement about Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton but little can be said about any Barack Obama legacy other than he rarely saw anything positive in America past or present.\u00a0 There was never any chance he would make America great again because he never thought America was ever great. Since the years Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cShining City on a Hill,\u201d there has been a steady decline in our national self-confidence and assertion that absolute rights and wrongs do not exist. Women of faith don\u2019t need a saint, but they want someone who will fight for them and their children and defend the honor of the nation. Trump respects American history and sees a clear path to a promising path for all Americans.\u00a0 He has lived the American dream and wants others to do the same. Americans rightly have a healthy skepticism concerning political matters, particularly the Republican Party.\u00a0 While the majority of Americans have dismissed the liberals and their party for some time, they have elected and then reelected Republicans who promised to be different, to reduce the size of government and make Washington work.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t different and they joined right in with the rest of the despised political class. Donald Trump promises he will be different.\u00a0 His campaign has certainly been like no other we have ever seen.\u00a0 He speaks in understandable sentences even though, sometimes, he says something crude or offensive. In Washington, the only opportunities to hear something truthful is when a politician stands too close to a microphone he or she doesn\u2019t know is turned on.\u00a0 Then we get to hear the truth by accident. Not so with Donald Trump, he says the most controversial and provocative thing without hesitation in a loud voice to the throngs at his rallies. And most Americans find his off-the-cuff manner refreshing and a welcome break from the careful and timid mumbling of official Washington of both parties. Mr. Trump promises that we will be allowed to wish each other \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d again in future Decembers and that political correctness will be discarded in favor of his \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to governing.\u00a0 No more apologizing, particularly when we believe we are right! Some leadership in what calls itself the \u201cconservative movement\u201d expresses reservation and concern about Trump\u2019s \u201cconservative populism\u201d as if there is something disconcerting about a conservatism which is popular. It is ironic that most rank-and-file conservatives have abandoned the hand-wringing of their supposed leaders just as union members have.\u00a0 All the bow-tied pundits and think tank recluses are being lost in the dust of grassroots conservatives who are rallying to Trump. Evangelicals, and especially evangelical women, are the key.\u00a0 They are not the average voter.\u00a0 They are smart, they are well-informed and they love their families dearly and feel a strong connection with the country. Trump is not the lesser of two evils.\u00a0 He is an imperfect man who has sacrificed a very comfortable life making successful real estate deals from his high-rise penthouse. Instead, he is calling evil out and attempting to do what is right as he sees it. I\u2019m reminded of President Reagan\u2019s promise that the best days of America always lie ahead. Optimism and hope in the country is critically important to restoring its greatness. What do women really want? They want leadership. They want a man who doesn\u2019t back down to the politically correct forces of the day. Something most politicians and even some ministers have done in recent years. Women of faith don\u2019t need a saint, but they want someone who will fight for them and their children and defend the honor of the nation. Donald Trump is a good man, a patriotic American and, maybe, the last hope for those of us who value rights given to us by God and recall fondly an America which cured diseases, built skyscrapers and stopped evil armies on the march.",

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Philadelphia PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Democrats know the importance of Pennsylvania in their quest to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, having won the state in six straight presidential races. But as they close out their convention Thursday in this state\u2019s largest city, picked with the White House in mind, Trump and his populist message appear to be making inroads with working-class voters across the Pennsylvania battleground. \u201cThis is consistent with his strategy of doing well in Rust Belt states, or at least well enough to cover the purple states that will almost certainly go blue, considering the kind of campaign he\u2019s running,\u201d Caleb Burns, a Republican strategist and partner in the Washington law firm Wiley Rein, told FoxNews.com on Thursday. He noted that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, had the labor and blue-collar vote in her corner in her failed 2008 presidential primary bid. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if Clinton can hold off Trump in the Rust Belt by going back to the blue-collar vote. If she can, it will be extremely difficult for Trump to find a path to victory,\u201d Burns said. He spoke just hours before Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf was set to give a closing-night speech at the convention, and presumably try to nudge home-state voters toward Clinton, inside the Wells Fargo Center in south Philadelphia. Trump, the Republican nominee, has made several campaign stops in Pennsylvania in recent months. \u201cMany companies are leaving,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month in Moon Township, west of Pittsburgh, near the West Virginia border. \u201cPittsburgh got wiped out,\u201d Trump told the enthusiastic crowd. \u201cManufacturing is down. Steel is down. Maybe I\u2019m old fashioned, but I love steel. Hillary \u2026 wants to put coal miners out of business. And it\u2019s not just Pittsburgh. We love Philadelphia, too.\u201d Trump won four of the five so-called Rust Belt states in the primary, named as such because their populations and economies have dwindled for generations as the country\u2019s manufacturing sector shrinks as a result of changing technology and jobs being shipped overseas. The only state Trump lost was Ohio, won by primary rival and Gov. John Kasich. And his decisive May 3 victory in Indiana was essentially the last stand for the Never Trump effort. Neither of the campaigns would comment for this report. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney came close to breaking the Democrats\u2019 stronghold on Pennsylvania -- losing to Obama by just 5 percentage points. Trump this election cycle is essentially deadlocked with Clinton in Pennsylvania, according to recent Quinnipiac University polls, though an NBC survey released July 13 shows him trailing by 9 percentage points. To win over the blue-collar vote, Trump must also make inroads with labor unions, which for decades have backed Democratic candidates and helped them get voters to the polls. The AFL-CIO -- with roughly 12.5 million members, making it the country\u2019s biggest and arguably most influential labor union -- last month endorsed Clinton, while making clear its opposition to Trump. \"We will run a sophisticated, targeted ground campaign,\u201d union President Richard Trumka said. \u201cAnd with the dire consequences Donald Trump poses for America\u2019s working families, it has to be.\" Still, not everybody appears willing to go along with the Big Labor endorsement. William Burger, a Pennsylvania drywall finisher with deep union ties, recently expressed his growing frustration with the Democratic Party and told Heat Street\u00a0that he\u2019s voting for Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the bullsh-t politics these guys [in the Democratic Party] are portraying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey act like they\u2019re doing something for us, and they\u2019re not. They\u2019re bending over backward for all the wrong reasons. \u2026 Almost every major city has been run Democratically, and they\u2019re all broke.\u201d The publication also reported that roughly 128,000 voters -- including nearly 85,000 Democrats -- switched their affiliation to the Republican Party, in just the first three months of this year. Among them were 5,000 voters in Philadelphia, the Republican City Committee told Heat Street. Douglas Smith, a Democratic strategist and partner at Kent Strategies, seemed optimistic Thursday about Clinton carrying Pennsylvania but also argued that a loss in the swing state wouldn\u2019t be as dire for her as it would be for Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have options,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary does, and Trump doesn\u2019t.\u201d He thinks the race will come down to the swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. \"[Democratic vice presidential nominee] Tim Kaine will become a citizen of those states,\u201d Smith said.",

Photo by Chris Hibben for Fox News. AMES, Iowa \u2013 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders narrowly finished second this winter in the state\u2019s Democratic caucuses, then left Iowa in a February snowstorm as a contender.\u00a0He returned Saturday on a warm autumn day to Iowa State University as a surrogate, offering his young, fervent supporters a more difficult pitch -- vote for Hillary Clinton. Some of his devotees remain unconvinced, even those the Clinton campaign selected to speak at this Clinton campaign event. \u201cShe doesn't care about us. Voting for a lesser of two evils, there's no point,\u201d Kaleb Van Fosson, a sophomore and Sanders supporter, said to the small crowd. After drawing light applause, Clinton campaign staff quickly escorted Van Fosson from the stage, as he criticized Clinton for her ties to financial institutions. \u201cI got a call the other day asking me if I wanted to speak for Hillary, basically they wanted to use me like a puppet,\u201d Van Fosson told Fox News. \u201cTrump\u2019s not any better, but Hillary Clinton is still terrible.\u201d Others in attendance agreed with Van Fosson, though most in the crowd appeared supportive of the Democratic nominee. \"He's made it evidently clear that Hillary Clinton is the right choice and over the summer,\u201d said Devon Graham, a local\u00a0Sanders supporter.\u00a0 \u201cI went fully behind Hillary and I'm really excited for her as a candidate but also excited that Bernie is supporting her as well.\u201d Sanders used much of his speech to bring attention to his signature issues -- corporate oversight, climate change and income inequality.\u00a0In endorsing Clinton, he acknowledged those\u00a0who dislike both nominees. \u201cGet beyond personality,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cAlright, you don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton, you don\u2019t like Donald Trump fine. You like yourselves. I hope so, if that means taking a hard look at the issues the candidates stand for. We\u2019re not running here for class president of the local high school. This is not a popularity contest. We are electing the most powerful individual in the world.\u201d Yet many still see Clinton\u2019s positions as too centrist and her remarks to Wall Street firms, provided by WikiLeaks, too deferential to financial firms\u2019 interests. \u201cThis is home of rural populism and it manifests in very different ways on theft and the right,\u201d said Rachel Caufield, an associate professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines. \u201cOn the left if manifests as a distrust of corporations and economic power.\u00a0And Hillary Clinton\u2019s message isn\u2019t resonating with those folks in the same way that say Barack Obama\u2019s did.\u00a0 You still have a lot of those folks who were diehard Bernie supporters who will continue to be Bernie supporters and they\u2019re not sure that Hillary Clinton embraces some of the ideological positions that they want to see in their Democratic Party.\u201d Clinton trails Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in Iowa by less than 3percentage points, according to an average of polls provided by Real Clear Politics. The latest state-provided returns show Iowa Democrats and Republicans have submitted fewer absentee ballots than they did by the same point in 2012.\u00a0Thus far, Republicans have returned a larger share of ballots, and Democrats a smaller percentage than they did in the last presidential election year. As of Friday, 238,029 Democrats and 196,611 Republicans had submitted ballots, according to the Iowa secretary of state. While the\u00a0Clinton campaign\u00a0relies on surrogates such as Sanders and the Obamas to coax their supporters to the polls, Clinton herself maintains a stead attack on her opponent. \u201cAmong most Democrats, the strongest case she\u2019s making right now is that she\u2019s not Donald Trump,\u201d Caufield said. Nor is she Sanders. \u201cI\u2019ve been to eight of his last 12 events, and the Bernie merchandise sells a lot better than the Hillary,\u201d said Daniel Richards, a campaign merchandise salesman from Springfield Illinois, as he unloaded a stack of Sanders T-shirts from his van. \u201cThis was the number one seller at the Democratic convention,\u201d Richards also said as he presented a green \u201cIt\u2019s always Bernie in Philadelphia\u201d shirt.",

For Republican presidential rival Donald Trump, the electoral map is as daunting as it is friendly to Clinton. To win, he must sweep all of the toss-up battlegrounds and go on to pick off at least one state where the Democratic nominee now has a solid lead, the wire service reports. The analysis considers preference polling, recent electoral history, demographic trends and campaign priorities such as advertising, travel and on-the-ground staff. It finds that to capture the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, Clinton must merely defend traditionally Democratic states and those where recent polls show she has large advantages, and then add just one of the states that The Associated Press now rates as a toss-up. Those states include Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. And that map may be a conservative estimate of Clinton's head start over the Republican nominee. In several states the AP rates as toss-ups, including New Hampshire, North Carolina and Florida, recent polls suggest current conditions may be favorable to Clinton, though there are few polls in those states or they have given her a relatively narrow upper hand. In other states, Clinton's advantage appears more formidable. In Pennsylvania, won by the Democratic nominee in every election since 1992, multiple polls conducted in July and August give the former secretary of state double-digit leads. That state illustrates the depth of Trump's problem: It's considered a linchpin of his strategy to win over working-class white voters in the Rust Belt. In Virginia, which handed its electoral votes to Barack Obama twice but was once a solidly Republican state, several August surveys show high single-digit to double-digit leads for Clinton. Colorado, too, shows no signs of reversing itself after twice supporting Obama. Trump has consistently trailed by large margins in surveys released there since mid-July. Polls released this month in Wisconsin and Michigan also found Trump facing significant deficits. Trump is left running from behind while also defending traditional Republican strongholds such as Georgia, where a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll suggests even that may be in play for Clinton. ------ Where the race stands today: SOLID DEMOCRATIC: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maine 2nd District, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington.

            "article_content": "Melania lays out her agenda as potential first lady Melania Trump and Ted Cruz both made their post-convention debut as Donald Trump surrogates on the campaign trail Thursday -- though the Texas senator and former primary contender did so without mentioning the GOP nominee by name at his initial appearance. Cruz joined Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence on the campaign trail in Prole, Iowa, a month and a half after he posted a tepid endorsement of Trump on Facebook. \u201cThis election has been one wild ride, but the stakes in this election have never been higher,\u201d Cruz told the audience. He noted that maintaining GOP control of Congress and \u201cputting a Republican in the White House\u201d amounted to the \u201cwhole enchilada.\u201d Standing at a podium with a Trump-Pence logo, Cruz praised several Iowa Republicans, including Rep. Steve King and Sen. Charles Grassley, but did not name Trump. Cruz did mention Trump at a later stop in Michigan, telling the crowd in Portage, \"You oughta vote for Donald Trump and Mike Pence and Republicans up and down the ticket.\" In Iowa and Michigan, Cruz delivered his pitch to the base, while Melania Trump made her first solo appearance in suburban Philadelphia, where Donald Trump is trailing Clinton. \u201cHe knows how to make real change. Make America great again is not just a slogan,\u201d she said, adding that as first lady she would be an advocate for women and children. Despite her husband\u2019s reputation for frank, sometimes crude talk, the native of Slovenia focused on family issues saying that the \u201cculture has gotten too mean and rough.\u201d Prior to her address, the Pennsylvania state Democratic Party sent out a copy of an old Michelle Obama speech that was labeled as an \u201cadvanced copy\u201d of Melania\u2019s speech, a reference to allegations of plagiarism that emerged after her Republican National Convention speech. Cruz and Melania Trump are the latest in a growing pool of surrogates campaigning for Trump, as Hillary Clinton deploys influential Democrats ranging from President Obama to Bernie Sanders to the trail. \u201cSurrogates can be very helpful in the final days of the campaign when it is far more important to energize and excite voters than to persuade them,\u201d Republican campaign strategist Chris Jankowski told FoxNews.com. \u201cI think it would have been wiser to have heard more from Ivanka and Melania all throughout September and October. This speech may have some impact ... but I am doubtful that it will have enough of an impact,\u201d Sarah Lenti, a Colorado-based Republican consultant, added. In battleground states where the margins are narrowing, the surrogates are making the biggest showing. Michigan, which has not voted for a Republican candidate for president since President George H. W. Bush in 1988, is such a case. A Fox2/Mitchell\u00a0poll released on Wednesday showed Clinton\u2019s lead in the Great Lakes state has narrowed to 3 percent. The week began with Trump rallying on Monday, while Donald Trump Jr. arrived mid-week to make stops at Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University. Ivanka Trump appealed to suburban women voters during a \u201cMichigan Women in Business Roundtable\u201d event. Not new to the role of surrogate, Obama fired up a Florida crowd with a feisty speech that went off-script as much as Trump. \u201cThis is the guy who spent 70 years -- his whole life -- born with a silver spoon, showing no respect for working people. He\u2019s spent a lot of time with celebrities,\u201d Obama told the audience in Miami. But Trump, the president said, does not hang out with working people unless they\u2019re cleaning his room or mowing the fairways. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make this guy your champion if you\u2019re a working person?\u201d he asked the crowd.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) CHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2013 After deadly floods washed thousands of\u00a0West\u00a0Virginians out of their homes last month, about 700 victims bypassed the shelter at the high school gym and got rooms at a luxury resort fit for royalty. Jim Justice, billionaire owner of The Greenbrier resort and Democratic nominee for governor, closed his hotel for business and opened it as a free shelter after the June 23 floods that killed 23 people, including 15 in Greenbrier County. Shooing away election talk, Justice said he put his gubernatorial campaign on hold for the two weeks following the floods to focus on victims. But a boost of good will from voters seems likely in return. There's a long history of storms and other natural disasters making or breaking political leaders \u2014 President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie drew praise for dropping partisan differences and working together after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, while then-President George W. Bush never fully recovered from his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Justice, on the other hand, is just a candidate \u2014 but he is also\u00a0West\u00a0Virginia's\u00a0richest man. His stately, white-columned hotel turned out to be right in the middle of the flood's worst destruction, putting him in a situation with little precedent in modern politics. \"Candidates have said things, made appeals or, normally, they criticize the response of elected officials, saying 'it's too slow, it's too little,' and that's how they win favor,\" said\u00a0Virginia\u00a0Tech associate public policy professor Patrick Roberts, who specializes in disaster politics. \"But I can't think of an instance where someone had the personal resources to really offer.\" Dating back to 1778, the 710-room Greenbrier resort has long been one of the jewels of\u00a0West\u00a0Virginia'stourism industry, hosting presidents and royalty and holding a once-secret underground bunker built for Congress in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War. The Greenbrier's golf course temporarily became a flowing brown river, just two weeks before it was to have hosted a PGA Tour golf tournament \u2014 an event that was ultimately canceled. Justice swears the storm's political implications never occurred to him. \"I don't do many things from a standpoint of what I think would be politically correct,\" Justice said. \"From this standpoint, that hasn't even entered my mind, honest to Pete.\" Justice's rival in November, Republican nominee Bill Cole, also stepped in to help after the floods, but with less fanfare. He helped secure tetanus shots for Nicholas County, brought port-a-potties to Clendenin, ran public service ads for donations at his car dealerships and collected 30 tons of goods for victims. Cole traveled into flood-ravaged regions essentially every day for two weeks. He made some campaign appearances that had been on the books for a long time, but said it was a 90-10 split in favor of flood work. Still, his efforts were overshadowed by Justice, who announced the reopening of The Greenbrier at a news conference with a banner reading \"God Bless The Great People of\u00a0West\u00a0Virginia\" draped behind him. \"I really went out of my way not to publicize it,\" Cole said, \"then all of a sudden, it was, 'Where are you?' ... 'Why aren't you doing something?'\" Cole, the state Senate president, added in an interview, \"To me, the fine line also exists if I'm out there looking for the TV cameras to get interviewed, then am I really helping or am I just looking for earned media?\" Cole said he's not judging Justice's actions. He considers the flood off limits politically. Whether Justice's intentions are pure, political or somewhere in between, no one disputes that he made an impact on a region in ruin. Among other efforts, he has raised $1.9 million for flood relief through his charity, Neighbors Loving Neighbors, including checks from celebrities like NBA legend Jerry\u00a0West\u00a0and PGA Tour golfer Bubba Watson. Another indirect benefit: Republican attacks temporarily fell silent against Justice for being delinquent on his bills, taxes, coal mine fines and other obligations. Local residents sang Justice's praises when they walked the resort's halls to grab a free lunch late last month. \"It's great PR,\" said Marybeth Beller, a Marshall University political science professor. \"The photos that played out in the (Charleston) Gazette-Mail (newspaper) showed ordinary working-class\u00a0West\u00a0Virginians all of sudden being able to stay at The Greenbrier with their families. It was a tremendous mark of generosity.\" And whether he thought about it or not, likely a mark of good politics as well.",

But will it last? Trump has spent much of his first full week as a candidate talking about a dispute over a beauty pageant and his feud with one of the networks that was to broadcast it. For those Republicans excited that Trump is bringing smackdown-style politics to the campaign, it ought to be a worrisome thing that he has given so much focus to fighting over (and thereby promoting) his business ventures. Trump, who seemed to have leveraged the boomlet around a potential 2012 candidacy into a lucrative television contract for a reality show, has been mostly focused of late on next month\u2019s Miss USA contest after one of his broadcast partners ducked out over comments Trump made about Mexicans. Trump and NBC profited from his 2012 non-candidacy. Will they be able to say the same of his 2016 run? Elsewhere in the rankings, Ben Carson\u2019s durable appeal among conservatives is impossible to deny. Carson won another straw poll over the weekend and his strength in recent polls demands attention. Meantime, the decline in support in the weeks since his announcement for former Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggests he is still looking for a foothold. Dropping out of the top 10 this week is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, but one assumes that it will be a temporary condition as he ramps up a campaign launch. But both he and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ought to pay heed to the struggles of former governors Perry and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. With moderate Jeb Bush and conservative Scott Walker continuing to lead the ranks for governors, it will be hard to move ahead. And speaking of Walker, he slips ahead of Marco Rubio this week as he continues to stay on the trail and score well with conservative audiences. But this week may decide his fate as tomorrow brings the start of the final budget crunch in his home state. Stay tuned\u2026.

Rove pushed back in a blog post saying that he never questioned the elder Bush\u2019s judgment, but did voice concern over Cruz making Bush\u2019s support public since incumbent then-Attorney General Greg Abbott had yet to announce if he were running. Abbott was appointed to the state Supreme Court by former President George W.

            "article_content": "FILE: March 11, 2016: Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., walks from the federal courthouse in Philadelphia, Pa. (AP) In the year of the supposed angry electorate, millions of frustrated voters have put their weight behind the outsider presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders but continue to back congressional incumbents -- ousting only one so far in hundreds of 2016 primaries contests. The lone victim was Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chaka Fattah, but his ouster appeared more about questionable ethics than frustration with Washington insiders. The 11-term congressman is facing a 29-count federal indictment related to racketeering, bribery and mail fraud. \u201cThe year of the outside candidate is a neat, tidy package put out by the media to a certain extent,\u201d David Payne, a Republican strategist and partner at Vox Global, said this week. \u201cBut it\u2019s only part of the story. Look at all of the insiders who are picking up 60 percent of the vote.\u201d Payne argues that House districts have been \u201cso carefully constructed\u201d by state party officials and others to \u201cremain stable\u201d that few primary races are now competitive. To be sure, members of Congress rarely lose a primary race, in which incumbents (typically) face a challenge from candidates in their own political party. Over the past three election cycles, just 17 congressional incumbents have been ousted in a primary -- four House members in 2014, five House members and one senator in 2012, and four House members and three senators in the so-called 2010 Tea Party revolution. With claims to as many as seven upsets in the 2010 primaries, the conservative, grass-roots Tea Party movement will likely have more success than the 2016 electorate in ousting incumbents. The 2010 defeat of three-term Utah GOP Sen. Bob Bennet, a reliable conservative, by Tea Party-backed Mike Lee indeed rattled the political class. But the race that now seems to stick with voters and others is the 2014 upset of House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor. The Virginia Republican and member of House leadership was stunningly upset that year by Dave Brat, a first-time candidate with Tea Party support. The post-script to the race suggests Cantor paid too little attention to his district. But beyond getting ousted over so-called \u201cideological purity,\u201d Capitol Hill lawmakers also often lose primaries amid an ethics scandal, as a result of redistricting (include eight in 2012), or are \u201caccidental candidates\u201d who get elected when, for example, their party\u2019s top candidate unexpectedly drops out. This year, Trump, a billionaire businessman and first-time candidate, beat more than a dozen Republican lawmakers or former elected officials to become the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. And Sanders, a self-describe democratic socialist, has kept his insurgent campaign alive in the Democratic primary by portraying front-runner Hillary Clinton as a Washington and Wall Street insider. Louis Jacobson -- a columnist for the magazine \u201cGoverning\u201d and a senior correspondent for the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 \u201cPolitiFact\u201d -- suggested Friday that if the angry electorate indeed exists, only \u201cbig personalities\u201d on the national stage appear capable of getting voters riled and into polling stations. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing a whole lot of it\u201d in gubernatorial and other state-level races, Jacobson said. He argued that congressional districts have become so blue or red over the years that it\u2019s nearly impossible for a challenger to be more conservative or more liberal that a sitting House member. And he suggested that Congress appears \u201camorphous\u201d among voters, who tend to know more about presidential candidate, which results in more targeted anger. Such a theory might help explain why Hill lawmakers continue to win 2016 primaries despite have historically low approval ratings. A recent Gallup survey found just 17 percent of Americans approved of the job Congress is doing. That rating has not exceeded 20 percent since October 2012. \u201cVoters generally feel (members) aren\u2019t very good,\u201d Jacobsen said.",

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders certainly can\u2019t seriously complain that there was anything \u201crigged\u201d about the Democratic nomination \u2013 delegate selection procedures.\u00a0 Clinton won by a margin of almost 4 million popular votes and a substantial majority of all elected pledged delegates in the primaries and caucuses and in DC. Sanders and many of his supporters appear to want to change the rules at the July Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\u00a0 I believe that is the wrong place to enact new rules governing the 2020 process.\u00a0 Instead, we should follow past precedent and the convention should endorse the appointment of a broad-based \u201creform commission,\u201d composed of grassroots Democrats and party and elected officials to evaluate and recommend future rules changes. For example, in 1982, the party reform commission headed by then Democratic Governor James Hunt of North Carolina recommended the establishment of unpledged \u201csuper delegates,\u201d comprised of all Democratic governors, members of congress, and DNC members and other party notables.\u00a0 Those recommendations were adopted by the Democratic National Committee and thus began the use of super delegates beginning at the 1984 convention and since. I was a member of the Democratic National Committee in 1982 and voted in favor of establishing super delegates.\u00a0 My major reason was recognizing that our national convention needed more governors and members of congress as delegates at the national convention, since they represent hundreds of thousands, even millions, of diverse voters.\u00a0 \u00a0But I also favored, as did most other DNC members, limiting their numbers.\u00a0 At the 2016 convention, Super delegates presently constitute only 15 percent of the total number of delegates at the 2016 convention.\u00a0 And at no convention since they were established in 1982 have most super delegates failed to support the candidate with the highest popular vote and majority of elected pledged delegates; and at none did they provide the margin of difference. But Senator Sanders and many of his supporters sees super delegates as undemocratic, since they can ignore the will of the voters of their states or congressional districts if they wish.\u00a0 Perhaps a new reform commission will decide to reduce the numbers of super delegates or increase the numbers of elected pledged delegates, or both, as a compromise. Sanders and many of his supporters also want future primaries and caucuses to be \u201copen\u201d \u2013 i.e., non- Democrats, such as Independents or even Republicans who register on Election Day, to be able to vote.\u00a0 They argue that would encourage independents to support the party nominee. But many Democrats (myself included) believe the party system needs to be strengthened, not weakened, and registered Democrats should be the only ones who vote for the party\u2019s nominee.\u00a0 Perhaps a new reform commission would find a compromise to allow registration as Democrats closer to the actual primary or caucus day than is currently the case in many states. A third rule change under discussion is to ban caucuses and require all states to use primary elections to select delegates.\u00a0 The argument in favor of this is that caucuses tend to favor party activists who have the time to sit for hours and then declare their vote openly \u2013 without a secret ballot.\u00a0 Thus they tend to disadvantage the elderly, minority voters, and working people who aren\u2019t able to spend that much time in the evening to vote and who don\u2019t like the idea of giving up their preference for a secret ballot. I would hope, however, that the special place of Iowa and Nevada as the first two caucus states be preserved.\u00a0 These first two caucuses require all presidential candidates in the early months to do retail, one-on-one personal campaigning.\u00a0 They have become an important part of our democratic process. The main point:\u00a0 Trying to make decisions on new rules for the 2020 nomination elections and beyond at the 2016 convention would be unwise.\u00a0 It could produce a divisive floor fight on procedural issues not of major concern to most Americans. Far better would be to follow precedent going back more than 50 years and pass a resolution establishing another reform commission.\u00a0 That way a united convention can focus its attention on what Democrats consider to be most important: electing Hillary Clinton as our next and first female president in U.S. history and uniting around the need to defeat Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "FILE: March 11, 2016: Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly introduces GOP presidential candidate Donald Phyllis Schlafly, the iconic pro-family activist who rose to fame in the 1970s when she campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment, has died at age 92, according to the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded. Schlafly had been an activist since the early Cold War era, but gained national prominence by leading traditional-religious women in the movement against the Equal Rights Amendment. President Reagan praised her campaign against ERA as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and called Schalfly \u201can example to all those who would struggle for an America that is prosperous and free.\u201d Schlafly rose to national attention in 1964 with her self-published book, \"A Choice Not an Echo,\" that became a manifesto for the far right. The book, which sold three million copies, chronicled the history of the Republican National Convention and is credited for helping conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona earn the 1964 GOP nomination. She went on to become one of the most influential pro-family activists in the 1980s and 1990s, and her support was courted by all GOP presidential candidates. She authored 27 books and thousands of articles. Founded in 1972, Eagle Forum focuses on pro-family and socially conservative issues and now has an estimated 80,000 members. Republican candidate Donald Trump praised the conservative activist in a statement released Monday evening. \"Phyllis Schlafly is a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement, and fearlessly battled globalism and the 'kingmakers' on behalf of America's workers and families,\" the statement read. \"I was honored to spend time with her during this campaign as she waged one more great battle for national sovereignty.\" Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called \"The Conservative Case for Trump\" that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was \"honored to spend time with her.\" In April, Schlafly\u2019s endorsement purportedly sparked uproar among Ted Cruz supporters on the Eagle Forum board of directors. In a statement posted on its website Monday afternoon, the Eagle Forum said Schlafly died at her home in St. Louis surrounded by family members. \u201cHer focus from her earliest days until her final ones was protecting the family, which she understood as the building block of life,\u201d read the statement. \u201cShe recognized America as the greatest political embodiment of those values. From military superiority and defense to immigration and trade; from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood, Phyllis Schlafly was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values.\u201d Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Schlafly was \u201can unflinching champion of many ideas Republicans have long held dear.\u201d \u201cThrough her tireless activism that continued even into her 90s, Phyllis Schlafly never wavered in giving a voice to millions of Americans concerned about preserving constitutional rights, strong families, and American greatness. Her influence will continue to be felt for years to come, and as we celebrate an iconic figure in the conservative cause, our thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends, and many admirers.\u201d Schlafly was born Aug. 15, 1924, and grew up in Depression-era St. Louis. Her parents were Republican but not politically involved. With the country involved in World War II during her college years, Schlafly worked the graveyard shift at the St. Louis Ordnance Plant. Her job included testing ammunition by firing machine guns. She would get off work at 8 a.m., attend morning classes, then sleep in the middle of the day before doing it all over again. The schedule limited her options for a major. \"In order to pick classes to fit my schedule I picked political science,\" Schlafly recalled in a 2007 AP interview. She graduated from Washington University in 1944, when she was 19. Her first taste of real politics came at age 22, when she guided the 1946 campaign of Republican congressional candidate Claude Bakewell, helping him to a major upset win. In 1952, with her young family living in nearby Alton, Illinois, Schlafly's husband, attorney John Schlafly Jr., was approached about running for Congress. He declined, but she ran and narrowly lost in a predominantly Democratic district. She also ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1970. Schlafly earned a master's degree in government from Harvard in 1945. She enrolled in Washington University School of Law in 1976, and at age 51, graduated 27th in a class of 204. Schlafly received an honorary degree at Washington University's commencement in 2008. Though some students and faculty silently protested by getting up from their seats and turning their backs to the stage, Schlafly called it \"a happy day. I'm just sorry for those who tried to rain on a happy day.\" She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

One report said up to 50 people were treated for heat-related illness as they awaited the Democratic presidential nominee, who ended up getting there 90 minutes behind schedule. Columbus Division of Fire official Rebecca Diehm could not confirm that number, but told FoxNews.com that EMS resources were on-scene to treat dehydration -- and in some cases transport people via stretcher inside to cool their body temperatures. The Clinton-Kaine rally, which was scheduled for 2:45 p.m. ET, did not start until almost 4:20 p.m. During that time, thousands of supporters endured temperatures in the high 80s while waiting outside the Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center in Columbus. According to The Toledo Blade, after arriving late, Clinton delivered remarks lasting 21 minutes. Running mate Tim Kaine's speech was 15 minutes. Earlier in the day, Clinton and Kaine were busy with other stops on their post-convention bus tour. On Sunday morning, Clinton stopped in Cleveland Heights to surprise the congregation at the Imani Temple Ministry. Her entourage also stopped in Ashland for ice cream on the way to her afternoon rally, the\u00a0Mansfield News Journal\u00a0reported. The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

            "article_content": "Steve Harrigan reports from Hollywood, Florida BEACH BRAWL FOR THE RNC?HOLLYWOOD, FLA \u2013 When the members of the Republican National Committee contemplated their spring meeting at the seaside not only did they not expect to be swarmed by reporters, candidates, and their campaigns, they probably didn\u2019t expect there to be much of anything expect for networking and sunset cruises. Instead they find themselves in the first battle of what promises to be a long war over how their convention will pick the party\u2019s 41st presidential nominee. As one committee member put it to Fox News First, \u201cThis is like a hurricane.\u201d The overriding purpose and concern of this committee is to stage a nominating convention every four years, especially in the era of super PACs and outside money, the fundamental job of the RNC is to stage a quadrennial convention. As disconcerting as it is for these members to face challenging odds in the general election, a more pressing and practical concern for these individuals is having a disastrous convention in Cleveland in July.  The way it is supposed to go, and has gone for forty years, is more akin to a big event like the Academy Awards than a matter of actual political consequence. But Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and his many new Washington-based consultants and lawyers are explicitly warning that this institution could fail spectacularly. In this in ominous warning, if Trump is not the nominee, the convention would still be a branding exercise alright, but it would just be branding the Republican Party as an undemocratic, incompetent, disaster. As one state party chairman put it, \u201cIf Trump comes up short, are we basically opening our wrists and bleeding out?\u201d There is certainly a path for Trump to clinch outright and win the 1,237 delegates he needs. Ask Larry Sabato at the University of Virginia, or ask Nate Cohn at the NYT, but the greatest likelihood is that even if Trump trumps in the northeast on Tuesday and figures out how to play the delegate game in Pennsylvania\u2019s complex system, he will still need the Republican equivalent of superdelegates to take the nomination. These are the 7 percent or more of delegates who will arrive in Cleveland not bound to any candidate. The most likely scenario is that Trump shows up just short and will rely on party stalwarts to give him the nomination to avoid the violence, division and upheaval that Trump and his team have warned of. It\u2019s a credible threat. That\u2019s not the only thing on offer from Team Trump. If his party will simply meet his demands there are rewards. In closed door meetings here, there is the promise of not just a Trump who plays the party game and hires the consultant class that so dominates the GOP apparatus, but also that Trump himself will change. They point to his mostly good conduct in the past three weeks. Yes, the insults were back on the campaign trail in Indiana on Wednesday, but so to was a respectful visit to the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Mike Pence, and more moderate postures on issues. The new-look Trump includes not just an effort to beef up his policy proposals, but also a more moderate side including transgender acceptance. Like, really moderate. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t many who relish the idea of a contested and maybe even chaotic convention. The many supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, as well as those still clinging to the idea of a political messiah who will be revealed at the convention came here in the belief that most of the party apparatus still favored blocking Trump. One diehard Cruz supporter put it this way: \u201cI still refuse to believe that the Republican Party will allow itself to be hijacked by a charlatan who attacks our party and our system every day.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s public menace and private persuasion there are many hold outs. But how many? The first ground on which that question will be tested surrounds an arcane and probably only symbolic procedural issue placed before the committee. Solomon Yue, a committee member from Washington state, wants the RNC\u2019s rules committee to recommend that the convention adopt different rules for how the process works. As it stands, the convention will be operated under the same rules that the House of Representatives does. That means no filibusters, no funny business, and nearly absolute power for whomever wields the gavel. And just as it is in the House that person is Speaker Paul Ryan. What Yue and a sizable number of committee members want is to use the same kind of procedure that state parties, subcommittees of the RNC, and your local rotary club follow: Decentralized power with many opportunities for delegates to block the process. Yue hasn\u2019t stated a public preference for any candidate, but he has said that he is concerned about the party leaders, including Ryan, railroading dissident delegates. At first it was assumed that the issue here would be whether an establishment switch-a-roo would deprive Trump of the nomination in favor of a more electable candidate.  But as the new, consultant-backed Trump campaign hoves into view like a party boat pulling up at the dock, the debate has shifted on the question of the rules. Now, it seems that it is the Cruz delegation that has the most to lose under a heavy speaker\u2019s gavel. Not only could Cruz be thrown over for a moderate establishmentarian, but might also face the possibility of an establishment yielding to Trump, and slamming the door on the first ballot without Cruz ever getting to stage a floor fight. Picture the moment: Trump arrives in Cleveland just a couple of dozen delegates short of the prize, but many of the delegates and their preferences are in dispute. Cruz\u2019s team would hope to be able to disqualify some delegates or even unbind some that don\u2019t have autonomy on the first ballot. A powerful parliamentary officer can shut down procedural tactics, calls for further debate, or the re-visitation of credentials or rules. Ryan could hammer closed the selection process on round one, and send furious Cruz backers out to the Cuyahoga night.  The rules committee vote that will be held later today will not be binding on the convention and will not have anything to do with the allocation of precious delegates. But what it will be is the first, best indication we have about whether the RNC is ready to take up occupancy in Trump Tower. Cruz camp makes general election argument to GOP elite - Time: \u201cIn a private meeting with members of the Republican National Committee, the Cruz campaign\u2019s high command, including campaign manager Jeff Roe, strategist David Polyansky, and delegate-hunters Ken Cuccinelli and Saul Anuzis, made the case for Cruz as the party\u2019s stronger choice for the general election and argued he\u2019d help down-ballot GOP races.\u201d [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a0845;\u00a0Cruz\u00a0559; Kasich 147 (1,237 needed to win)]WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Science Daily: \u201cA new study, by researchers from the University of Cambridge and the Zoological Society of London, shows how baboons monitor each other for changes in behaviour that indicate food has been found, such as hunching over to scoop it up.

            "article_content": "U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver July 1, 2016. REUTERS/Rick Wilking - RTX2JA54 (REUTERS/Rick Wilking) Hillary Clinton claims the economy does better with a Democrat in the White House--that\u2019s simply false. Unless a president presides over an absolute disaster\u2014as did George W. Bush or Herbert Hoover\u2014comparing one with another is tricky business. Too much depends on the domestic circumstances each inherits and conditions in the wider global economy. The best recent apples to apples comparison is between the tough situations Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama faced when they assumed high office and how the fortunes of America's families subsequently progressed\u2014with Reagan relying on conservative prescriptions and Obama on activist government to fix things. Obama took office during a punishing financial crisis and recession. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent but under his tutelage, the economy has reclaimed more than 14 million jobs and employment is up 11 percent. Clinton\u2019s pronouncements that the economy runs better with a Democrat in the White House, and Americans would be better off doubling down on Obama\u2019s economic policies, simply don\u2019t bear the test of facts. \"The Gipper\" faced tough times too\u2014a bruising recession, double digit interest rates and unemployment reaching 10.8 percent. Subsequently, the economy added more than 19 million jobs and employment increased 22 percent. Reagan accomplished so much because he lowered taxes, curbed the growth of non-defense spending and relied on private decision making to guide recovery. He cleared a path for businesses, large and small, to invest as they deemed fit and raise wages as they needed to compete for good workers. Obama increased taxes and micromanages businesses through an avalanche of new regulations. To pacify a middle class under siege and Americans underemployed or not working at all, he offers more government giveaways, such as writing down college loans and mortgage debt, and incessant preaching that many ordinary folks are victims of racism, sexism and the evil machinations of the well-off. Through the first 26 quarters of Mr. Obama's recovery, GDP growth has averaged 2.1 percent, whereas during the comparable period for Reagan, GDP advanced at a 4.6 percent annual pace. And whereas Reagan's social safety net merely assisted the unemployed, Mr. Obama's pays the unemployed to be idle. The 7 million American men between the ages of 25 and 54 who are neither employed nor are looking for work are rewarded with food stamps, the earned income tax credit if their spouse is a low-income worker, and federal health care subsidies\u2014and even virtually free health care through Medicaid in many states. For many folks refusing to do much to work at all, he offers an even more attractive benefit\u2014free money in the form of a government pension. Nowadays, Americans are living longer and healthier lives and work is generally less physically challenging, yet the number of adults ages 16 to 64 certified as permanently incapable of working by the Social Security Disability Insurance program now stands at 5.1 percent\u2014about double the figure in Reagan's day. A broken appeals system offers a decided advantage to those crafty applicants who hire a lawyer \u2014 a situation the Obama administration expresses no real interest in fixing. On the campaign trail, Clinton is offering Americans more of the same\u2014$1 trillion in higher taxes to pay for free college tuition, daycare for pre-K children, bigger ObamaCare subsidies, extending Medicare to Americans as young as 50, and several other initiatives. To further micromanage the economy, she proposes to generalize to the national level the California Fair Pay Act, which requires even the smallest employers to justify to government supervisors pay and hiring decisions. For hard working families, the difference in results is remarkable. During the Reagan years, annual family incomes rose for white Americans and minorities alike\u2014to about $3,900 overall. During the Obama presidency, those are down to about $1,660 overall and about $2,200 for African-Americans. The social indicators are terrible, too. -- The middle class is shrinking, suicides and drug abuse are up, fertility is falling precipitously, millions of college graduates are in low paying jobs, and home ownership is at a 48 year low. Quite simply, Clinton\u2019s pronouncements that the economy runs better with a Democrat in the White House, and Americans would be better off doubling down on Obama\u2019s economic policies, simply don\u2019t bear the test of facts. It's time for change. It's time for a Republican in the White House.",

            "article_content": "Is the 2016 Honda Pilot the ultimate wingman? Gary Gastelu checks in to check it out. Want to feel like a celebrity? Forget the Lamborghini. Save the quarter-million bucks and buy a Honda Pilot instead. I\u2019m serious. The all-new 2016 model I tested had the townsfolk swarming around it like bees to sweet, sweet crossover honey every time I parked it. They gathered, gawked and used the word \u201cawesome\u201d to describe it more times than any pilot since Capt. Sully. Awesome? A Honda Pilot? Granted, I got my hands on one before it went on sale, so it was the first one anyone had seen, but I was still amazed at its impact. I suspect that will change when it\u2019s everywhere, which shouldn\u2019t take too long. (Honda) The new Pilot marks a return to form for Honda\u2019s three-row not-a-minivan. The last generation was a boxy, pug-nose affair that tried too hard to look like a truck. Its sales were respectable, but nevertheless disappointing. So this time around, Honda has gone back to the 2003 original\u2019s successful formula and basically made a supersized CR-V. In fact, the Pilot\u2019s resemblance to Honda\u2019s best seller is so uncanny that I walked up to a CR-V in a parking lot one day and tried to get in. If I\u2019d succeeded, I would\u2019ve noted that the cabins share a similar style, too, but quickly realized I\u2019d entered less cavernous space. (Honda) The Pilot is huge from front to back. There\u2019s room for tall folks in the third row and four carry-on suitcases behind it. The center console\u2019s storage compartment could double as a bassinet. The top-of-the-line Pilot Elite comes with second row captain\u2019s chairs that slide forward with the press of a button for easy access to the cheap seats. Other trim levels have a bench in the middle and provide accommodations for eight. (Honda) The driver and front passenger get the best seats in the house, of course, and they\u2019re heated and cooled in the Elite. Cushy on top, but perfectly supportive, they\u2019re more comfortable than any chair in my home and would give the ones in the Acura MDX a run for their money. I mention that car because the Pilot is basically its lower-priced clone. But aside from the Acura\u2019s arguably nicer leather upholstery and snobby brand cachet, the Honda is just as good. Even though it\u2019s nearly 300 pounds lighter than the one it replaces, the Pilot gets an updated 3.5-liter V6 that increases power from 250 hp to 280 hp, and is matched to a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel-drive starting at $30,875. You can work your way through seven trim levels \u2013 picking up a nine-speed automatic and one of the best all-wheel-drive systems I\u2019ve ever tested along the way \u2013 up to the Elite, which tops out at $47,300. It\u2019s not built for off-roading, per se, but the AWD is so good that if you floor the accelerator on a dirt or gravel trail, there\u2019s barely any slippage and absolutely no stumbling. The Pilot just pulls away with authority. Plus it will tow up to 5,000 pounds. On the road, it can shuffle the power from the front to the back and between the rear wheels as necessary, much like the MDX\u2019s fantastically named Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive (which I suspect is pretty much identical to the Pilot\u2019s). There also are settings for mud, sand and snow that were tuned in the wilds of exotic places like Russia, Dubai and Minnesota. The engine is smooth, sounds great and is fun to rev. The nine-speed transmission has a sport mode that\u2019s almost too aggressive in the way it stays in the lower gears and firms up the steering. But the Pilot is so light on its feet and handles so well that getting frisky with it is acceptable, and its ride quality is a buttery bliss. Take it easy and it delivers the best combined fuel economy in its class, 22 mpg, and the cabin stays so quiet that if someone spilled a box of pins on the carpet you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking they queued up the drum solo from \u201cMoby Dick\u201d on the stereo. I don\u2019t carry around an electronic sound meter, but I honestly don\u2019t recall the last Bentley I drove being any more peaceful inside. The audio system is controlled by Honda\u2019s latest touch-screen infotainment interface, which, like most of these, would be improved with knobs for volume and tuning. It\u2019s a little short on the bells and whistles, and the only music apps it currently supports are Pandora and Aha (and, yes, that is funny). But it has the latest version of SiriusXM satellite radio, which keeps a 30-minute running recording of all 12 of your presets that allows you both to travel back in time and combine several channels into one. \u201980s on 8? Bah, I want it all on 8! The ceiling-mounted, Blu-ray equipped rear-seat entertainment system is a little retro in a world dominated by tablets, but Honda says about a third of Pilot customers still want one, and they will get what they want. The tech is more of-the-moment on the driver aid front. The Pilot has an incredibly effective camera-based lane-keeping assist, and a separate road departure mitigation system. Start drifting toward a line on the road and it will let you know it, setting off alarms and nudging you back on track. The Pilot also has radar cruise control and can prevent or mitigate collisions with other cars and pedestrians. It gave a couple of false positives on twisty two-lane roads with traffic approaching in the other lane, but otherwise, all systems were go. My only real complaints are those missing knobs and an idle-stop feature that shuts the engine when the car\u2019s not moving. It\u2019s the default mode, so if you\u2019re not into it, you need to deactivate it every time you start the car. There also are ceiling-mounted seatbelts for the center seats in the second and third rows that are clumsy to use and reveal the Pilot\u2019s other close relation: the Odyssey minivan. I know, that lineage doesn\u2019t sound too awesome. But the Pilot definitely is. ---------- 2016 Honda Pilot Base price: $30,875 As tested: $47,300 Type: 7 to 8-passenger 4-door crossover Engine: 3.5-liter V6 Power: 280 hp, 262 lb-ft torque Transmission: 9-speed automatic MPG: 19 city/26 hwy",

National Review editor weighs in on 'America's News HQ' Donald Trump suggested Sunday that he might have to \u201csell a building\u201d from his real estate empire to finance a general election run, amid reports that wealthy GOP donors won\u2019t support his bid and Trump\u2019s repeated vows that the donor class won\u2019t \u201ccontrol\u201d him. \u201cThese are people who won\u2019t have access to the White House,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends Weekend.\u201d \u201cThey want to have control over me. \u2026 I don\u2019t want people telling me what to do.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were in response to a New York Times story published Sunday that stated several GOP mega-donors won\u2019t support a Trump candidacy. (It follows a report by the newspaper several weeks ago that billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson is willing to give Trump as much as $100 million for his presidential campaign -- a purported record-setting amount for the wealthy casino magnate.) Trump said Sunday that he financed his primary campaign with millions of his own money and small-dollar donations. He also said he has borrowed against his own assets and that he is working with Washington Republicans to raise money, but acknowledged the tremendous cost of a general election race. \"To finance a billion dollars I would have to sell a building,\" he said. \"Will I do that? I could. I have the option of doing it.\" In the phone interview, Trump also said he is heartened by recent polls showing him and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton running neck-and-neck in a possible November matchup. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday showed voters favored Trump over Clinton 46-to-44 percent. Trump also appeared to criticize Clinton\u2019s remarks Saturday night at the Trayvon Martin Foundation event, in which she suggested Trump, endorsed by the influential National Rifle Association, wants gun in classrooms. \u201cI don\u2019t want guns in classrooms, although in some cases teachers should have guns in classrooms,\u201d Trump said. Trump also suggested that he might get some Democratic cross-over votes from those who support Clinton challenger Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cA lot of Bernie Sanders voters, they don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton. \u2026 They think she\u2019s crooked Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cJust look at her record.\u201d",

DANA PERINO: Matt, we need your help. The campaign has taken its toll, mentally and physically. Chris Stirewalt, my co-host on \u201cPerino & Stirewalt: I'll Tell You What\u201d described it this way: \u201cThe road to Election Day stretches over two years\u2019 worth of missed flight connections, gas station pizza, pointless controversies, angry flacks, \u202a11 pm rallies and \u202a5 am charter plane takeoffs, interchangeable motel rooms with the same popcorn-finish ceilings and about 2,000 cups of coffee.\u201d You can imagine that leaves a person feeling sluggish and weak. I'm thinking we need the recipe for a \u201ccampaign cleanse.\u201d DP: So Matt, here are a few questions for you\u2026 What's the most important first step -- nutrition, exercise, or sleep? MATT DELANEY: When it comes to managing the stress of this election cycle, sleep is definitely the first place I would start. Stress can be a great thing for our bodies when it is acute and followed by an adequate recovery period (this is how adaptation occurs). However, when it becomes chronic and we are not permitted enough time to recover, there can be serious negative health implications. A missed flight, an intense workout, waking up to a new WikiLeaks release, or the thought of Trump having the nuclear codes all have the potential to stress our systems (some more than others), but a good night sleep (7-9hrs) will leave us more resilient and better prepared to handle whatever comes at us the next day. On the other hand, if we were kept awake all night by noisy neighbors in and adjacent hotel room, we would wake up vulnerable to new stressors and their effect would further compound the prior damage. Trying to build fitness on a system that is already under recovery will lead to illness and/or injury, so if you want to make it to November and through the next four years start making sleep and recovery a priority. DP: Do you recommend trying to go cold turkey or easing your way back onto the right track? MD: How many of us have woken up on a Monday morning after a long weekend of dining out swearing off sugar and alcohol for a week? I know I have. Now how many of us after that week (if we even made it through the entire thing without breaking) found ourselves outdoing our previous indulgences as soon as the self imposed ban was lifted? If your answer is no, congratulations, because you are in the minority. For the rest of us lacking an iron will, cold turkey strategies will generally end in a relapse and feelings of guilt, which may take us further down the spiral. Consistency is the best way to get on track and stay there, so realistic expectations and a sustainable strategy are imperative. Small improvements made over a long period of time will help change our behaviors and create healthier habits. If we overreach with our goals or go to extremes with our interventions, we will be destined to repeat the cycle. DP: So \u2013 cutting one cup of coffee, one glass of wine, and one cigarette \u2013 is a realistic goal? (By the way, I don\u2019t smoke\u2026asking for a friend\u2026really!) MD: Cutting one of each might be realistic for some, but for others it might be as simple as switching from a venti coffee to a grande. The key is making the changes easy to implement and maintain. In the coffee example, once your body has adjusted to the reduced caffeine content in the grande you can make a seamless transition to the tall. Also, in this scenario you are simply reducing the amount which is generally easier for people to handle. \u201cCutting\u201d things from your diet can feel like a punishment and the denial of certain items may lead to increased cravings. DP: Let's say that a person hates kale (that would be me), what are some go-to foods that can help feed the brain and shed whatever ails a person (whether they've gained weight on the campaign trail, or picked up bad habits - too much caffeine or even started smoking again)? MD: Not a fan of kale? No Problem. There is no shortage of options when it comes to green leafy vegetables, but they are only part of the equation. If you really want to optimize your health try keeping your diet as colorful as possible (no, skittles do not count), by consuming a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Fresh, colorful foods contain a broad spectrum of phytonutrients not found in your gas station pizza, which can boost energy levels, improve immune function and aid in cellular repair. In addition to phytonutrients, healthy fats like those found in avocados, coconut oil, salmon and eggs (whole eggs) are high in omega-3 fatty acids which are known to enhance brain function and reduce inflammation. DP: What is a phytonutrient? MD: They are chemicals produced by plants used to keep themselves healthy (you may also hear them referred to as phytochemicals). They work in combination with each other as well as with the vitamins and minerals also found in plants, to provide a number of health benefits (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, improved immune function, etc.) --Sounds delicious! (I\u2019m trying to have a positive attitude). DP: You're a proponent of rest days -- how can you convince these hard charging individuals that their bodies and minds will be better off if they take some time to relax? MD: Rest days are an important part of any well-rounded program, but trying to get a motivated, hard charging individual to hit the breaks is usually much more difficult than getting a sedentary person to move. Most of the time the problem lies in the literal interpretation of the word rest. People generally think of it as a day off, which may work for some, but for others it can simply mean a decrease in the intensity of their workout. If the thought of a day off scares you then take a yoga class, go for a walk, get a massage or engage in any low threshold activity of your choosing. DP: So it doesn\u2019t mean you get to lie catatonic on a couch for the weekend? MD: Lying catatonic is definitely my preference (although my kids never allow it) and could be a welcomed change of pace for those who are constantly on the go. When was the last time you had nothing to do? Seriously think about it. We tend to over-pack our schedules, running from one place to another and stressing about if we will be able to get everything done. In that case, even getting to a yoga class or booking a massage could be more of a stressor than a way to relax. If your life sounds similar to the scenario I just mentioned, then schedule yourself some downtime and allow your brain and body some much needed time to recharge. If you could suggest three things that someone can do immediately to jump back on the healthy bandwagon, what would you have them do? MD: At Equinox we look at health and performance through an MNR (movement, nutrition and regeneration) lens because they all play an equally important role, so any plan to get back on track should incorporate elements of each. My top three interventions to begin immediately would be as follows. First, normalize your bedtime/wake schedule to restore balance to your circadian rhythms and allow for enough sleep opportunity. Second, begin to reintroduce colorful, phytonutrient dense fruits and vegetables into your diet to increase energy and boost immune function. Lastly, get up and move daily. Initially what you do will be less important than the fact you are doing it, so start with activities you enjoy and begin creating new healthy habits. Basically, you\u2019re saying we\u2019re not all total failures and everything is going to be ok? MD: No, we are not total failures. However, this \u201cmore is more\u201d mentality that most of us have come to adopt as somewhat of a mantra is not improving our chances at longevity. If you want to work hard and play hard you need to recover equally as hard\u2026and if you want everything to be okay in the long run, I would suggest finding a healthy balance between the three. DP: And I recommend getting a dog \u2013 then you\u2019ll have to go for lots of walks!",

            "article_content": "Catherine Herridge reports from Washington, D.C. PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton, who spent the entirety of her presidential primary campaign battling allegations over her improper use of a personal email server while secretary of state, once again faces an email headache just days before her crowning as the Democratic presidential nominee. This time, the leak of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee, some of which indicated an anti-Bernie Sanders bias at the very top of the organization, led to the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The controversy now hangs over the start of the convention as Sanders supporters prepare to protest, outside and potentially inside the convention hall. On Monday, Schultz tried to explain her new role in the party, vowing to get to work electing Hillary Clinton. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me every day between now and November 8on the campaign trail,\u201d she said, even as Sanders supporters waved signs in front of her and shouted, \"Shame!\" On the sidelines, Sanders supporters and others angry at the Democratic establishment are poised to turn out, potentially in the thousands, on Monday to protest all over Philadelphia. This, before the convention formally gavels in late Monday afternoon \u2013 after which Sanders himself, as well as liberal icon Elizabeth Warren, are set to speak. Whether they can help to unify the divided party remains to be seen. But while Wasserman Schultz\u2019 resignation could calm the email storm, the liberal wing still appears intent on protesting over other grievances including Clinton, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, picking Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate. Norman Solomon, a Sanders delegate from California, said Sunday that Clinton picking a\u00a0centrist like Kaine is an \u201cassault\u201d on the progressive agenda. He said the roughly 1,250 Sanders delegates connected to his Bernie Delegates Network are considering walking out during the Virginia senator\u2019s expected acceptance speech at the Wells Fargo Center, and they are even looking into contesting his nomination. He said their response \u201creflects anger and disappointment\u201d over Clinton and like-minded Washington Democrats\u2019 control over the party. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what to expect\u201d on the convention floor, Solomon also said. The uncertainty and rancor on several fronts puts the Democrats in a similar position as the Republicans when they entered their convention a week ago looking to soothe tensions between their presidential nominee and those who backed his primary rivals. Only the clashes on the Democratic side have already outmatched last week\u2019s fireworks in Cleveland, with Wasserman Schultz\u2019 resignation standing as a stunning development on convention eve. The political spectacle already has distracted from the historic convention where Clinton is set to become the first female presidential nominee of a major party. While Wasserman Schultz has been largely sidelined from the convention -- though she will open and close it -- Sanders is set to speak Monday. In a written statement, he praised the DNC chairwoman for stepping down. \u201cDebbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working people\u00a0and young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,\u201d he said. The resignation comes after WikiLeaks on Thursday released roughly 20,000 DNC emails, with more revelations emerging Sunday about Wasserman Schultz criticizing the Vermont senator to staffers. \u201cHe isn't going to be president,\u201d she wrote in one May 21 email, also saying that Sanders vowing at the time to replace her as chairwoman was a \u201csilly story.\u201d Clinton chief strategist Joel Benenson, on \"Fox News Sunday,\" defended the fairness of the primary elections and said the DNC would conduct a full review of the emails. He said people should not jump to conclusions. \"The DNC\u2019s impact in these things is minimal compared to the results. What candidates and campaigns spend and do on the ground, talking to voters day in and day out, that\u2019s what determines who wins,\u201d he said. On Sunday in Philadelphia, several large protests took place near City Hall, in nearly 100-degree temperatures and under the watchful eye of city police officers. \u201cA lot of Democratic supporters labeled Bernie Sanders supporters conspiracy theorists. The WikiLeaks confirms what we thought all along,\u201d said Perry Mitchell, a 32-year-old Maryland resident who came to Philadelphia to participate in protests. FoxNews.com's Joseph Weber contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Pullman was a company town until the late 19th century, when it was absorbed into Chicago. (Pullman State Historic Site) A Chicago neighborhood that takes its name from an American icon and played a key role in the industrial revolution, the organized labor movement and the nation's struggle for civil rights will have its place in history marked with a national monument. Pullman, a south Chicago neighborhood that began in the 1880s as company housing for the Pullman Palace Car Co., the railcar manufacturing company that revolutionized travel in America, has been named a National Park. The federal government has designated the neighborhood a national historical park and commissioned the Pullman National Monument to memorialize the historical significance of the neighborhood of approximately 7,000 people, some of whom worked as train porters and maids or in the plant that churned out thousands of cars used for everything from luxury travel across the country to subway service in America's biggest cities. \"We were enthusiastically supported to come and work with this community and tell the story,\" said Jon Jarvis, service director of the National Park Service. \"It\u2019s a great day for the community and a great day for the Park\u00a0Service.\" \"I can't explain what Pullman means to me, in my heart. We have a bond.\" Rail magnate George Pullman started the neighborhood around his manufacturing plant to serve as housing for his workers. The 203-acre \"company town\" featured tenements, churches and even schools for the thousands of workers and their families who would toil making and working on so-called \"Pullman cars.\" Thousands were newly emancipated African-Americans who moved up from the South and found a willing employer in Pullman. But the place the tycoon, who died in 1897, occupies in both the labor and civil rights movements is steeped in controversy, despite what may have been progressive hiring practices for the times. The Pullman Palace Car Co., which over it century in existence was known by a strong of variations, all bearing the name of its founder, was the site of a seminal labor dispute clash between African-American workers and George Pullman. Historians say the railroad strike of 1894 helped pave the way for civil rights and unions. In 1925, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters formed and was recognized as the first labor union led by African Americans. Chicago bought the town from Pullman in the 1890s, and the neighborhood became officially incorporated into the Windy City. It has remained a primarily African-American neighborhood, with many longtime residents recalling firsthand the days before Pullman Company, as it was last known, turned out its last subway cars for Chicago, New York and Boston in the 1980s. The Pullman Clock Tower building was refurbished by the state, but remains empty. (National Park Service) \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic place and I\u2019m glad to be born and raised here and that my mother was born and raised here,\" said Marilyn Gartelmann Quiroz, 74. \"She came from a very poor family, but we raised ourselves up,\u201d Quiroz and her husband of 50 years, Al, joke they are third generation \u201cPullmanites.\u201d Her mother was born in one of the blockhouses in Pullman, the same building that Quiroz\u2019s husband would later be born in. Her father and her father\u2019s uncle worked at Pullman, and her father\u2019s uncle moved through the ranks from the bottom of the company to become a plant manager. Quiroz, 74,\u00a0who now works as a switchboard operator at Columbia College, said the community was always\u00a0proud of their working-class backgrounds. She said her husband and brother-in-law, who worked at the plant until it closed, have been ecstatic over the news of the Pullman National Monument. \u201cThe two of them are walking around like they\u2019re going to bust they\u2019re so happy and so full of pride for the neighborhood,\u201d she said. The landmark site will be roughly 15 blocks long and about five blocks wide, Jarvis said. But don\u2019t expect to see employees dressed in late 1800 or early 1900 dress. The point of the monument is to bring attention to the history of the area and celebrate the community already established. \u201cPeople live here, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll freeze it in time,\" Jarvis said. \"This is a living, breathing community.\u201d Jarvis said the Park Service\u2019s next step is to plan how the visitor center will be designed inside the six-story clock tower that loomed for decades above the plant. They\u2019d like to include a welcome center, museum, educational classrooms, a theater, and other features typical for a National Park Site. The National Parks is being gifted a vintage, mint condition\u00a0Pullman Palace Car to show visitors exactly what one of the rail cars looked like. Jarvis said the planning phase will take about six to eight months and construction another two and a half years. He\u00a0believes the site will be ready in about three years. Although the neighborhood suffered after the Pullman Company went out of business, there are hopeful signs. \u201cThere\u2019s a revitalization going on here and it\u2019s the perfect time for the National Park Service to join in,\u201d said Jarvis. Today, the neighborhood remains a working class, predominantly African-American community (Pullman State Historic Site) The National Park Foundation announced the Pullman National Monument has already received $8 million in donations to help establish a visitor center and to fund programming. Jarvis says it\u2019s a very significant chunk of the money needed for construction. According to a spokeswoman for the National Park Foundation, the $8M is great down payment for the infrastructure and programming needs. Due to the condition of the buildings at the site, a lot of work will need to be done to be able to handle visitors. And more donations will be needed to finish everything. Refurbishing the Clock Tower, which will become the visitor\u2019s center for the new national monument, will be a major expense. The building burned in the 1990s, was redeveloped by the state of\u00a0Illinois, but remains vacant. \u201cIt\u2019s a big empty shell,\u201d said Jarvis. Quiroz said she can\u2019t wait to see the Clock Tower restored. Even more, she longs to see the Hotel Florence, named after George Pullman\u2019s daughter, up and running again. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them put a little effort into the hotel. We had such good times working there, it was a block from home, who could complain?\u201d said Quiroz. Quiroz worked in the hotel for 14 years, before it was shut down. \u201cI can\u2019t explain what Pullman means to me, in my heart,\" Quiroz said. \"We have a bond.\"",

            "article_content": "J. D. Vance (Harper) Editor's note: The following is excerpted from the new book, \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis\" by J.D. Vance (Harper, June 28, 2016). I went to Yale to earn a law degree. But that first year at Yale taught me most of all that I didn\u2019t know how the world of the American elite works. Every August, recruiters from prestigious law firms descend on New Haven, hungry for the next generation of high-quality legal talent. The students call it FIP\u2014short for Fall Interview Program\u2014and it\u2019s a marathon week of dinners, cocktail hours, hospitality suite visits, and interviews. On my first day of FIP, just before second-year classes began, I had six interviews, including one with the firm I most coveted\u2014Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP (Gibson Dunn for short)\u2014which had an elite practice in Washington, D.C. The interview with Gibson Dunn went well and I was invited to their infamous dinner at one of New Haven\u2019s fanciest restaurants. The rumor mill informed me that the dinner was a kind of intermediate interview: We needed to be funny, charming, and engaging, or we\u2019d never be invited to the D.C. or New York offices for final interviews. When I arrived at the restaurant, I thought it a pity that the most expensive meal I\u2019d ever eaten would take place in such a high-stakes environment. Before dinner, we were all corralled into a private banquet room for wine and conversation. Women a decade older than I was carried around wine bottles wrapped in beautiful linens, asking every few minutes whether I wanted a new glass of wine or a refill on the old one. At first I was too nervous to drink. But I finally mustered the courage to answer yes when someone asked whether I\u2019d like some wine and, if so, what kind. \u201cI\u2019ll take white,\u201d I said, which I thought would settle the matter. \u201cWould you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?\u201d I thought she was screwing with me. But I used my powers of deduction to determine that those were two separate kinds of white wine. So I ordered a chardonnay, not because I didn\u2019t know what sauvignon blanc was (though I didn\u2019t) but because it was easier to pronounce. I had just dodged my first bullet. The night, however, was young. At these types of events, you have to strike a balance between shy and overbearing. You don\u2019t want to annoy the partners, but you don\u2019t want them to leave without shaking your hand. I tried to be myself; I\u2019ve always considered myself gregarious but not oppressive. But I was so impressed by the environment that \u201cbeing myself\u201d meant staring slack-jawed at the fineries of the restaurant and wondering how much they cost. The wineglasses look like they\u2019ve been Windexed. That dude did not buy his suit at the three-suits-for-one sale at Jos. A. Bank; it looks like it\u2019s made from silk. The linens on the table look softer than my bedsheets; I need to touch them without being weird about it. Long story short, I needed a new plan. By the time we sat down for dinner, I\u2019d resolved to focus on the task at hand\u2014getting a job\u2014and leave the class tourism for later. My bearing lasted another two minutes. After we sat down, the waitress asked whether I\u2019d like tap or sparkling water. I rolled my eyes at that one: As impressed as I was with the restaurant, calling the water \u201csparkling\u201d was just too pretentious\u2014like \u201csparkling\u201d crystal or a \u201csparkling\u201d diamond. But I ordered the sparkling water anyway. Probably better for me. Fewer contaminants. I took one sip and literally spit it out. It was the grossest thing I\u2019d ever tasted. I remember once getting a Diet Coke at a Subway without realizing that the fountain machine didn\u2019t have enough Diet Coke syrup. That\u2019s exactly what this fancy place\u2019s \u201csparkling\u201d water tasted like. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with that water,\u201d I protested. The waitress apologized and told me she\u2019d get me another Pellegrino. That was when I realized that \u201csparkling\u201d water meant \u201ccarbonated\u201d water. I was mortified, but luckily only one other person noticed what had happened, and she was a classmate. I was in the clear. No more mistakes. Immediately thereafter, I looked down at the place setting and observed an absurd number of instruments. Nine utensils? Why, I wondered, did I need three spoons? Why were there multiple butter knives? Then I recalled a scene from a movie and realized there was some social convention surrounding the placement and size of the cutlery. I excused myself to the restroom and called my girlfriend: \u201cWhat do I do with all these damned forks? I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself.\u201d Armed with her reply\u2014\u201cGo from outside to inside, and don\u2019t use the same utensil for separate dishes; oh, and use the fat spoon for soup\u201d\u2014I returned to dinner, ready to dazzle my future employers. The rest of the evening was uneventful. I chatted politely and remembered my sister\u2019s admonition to chew with my mouth closed. Those at our table talked about law and law school, firm culture, and even a little politics. The recruiters we ate with were very nice, and everyone at my table landed a job offer\u2014even the guy who spit out his sparkling water. It was at this meal, on the first of five grueling days of interviews, that I began to understand that I was seeing the inner workings of a system that lay hidden to most of my kind. Yale\u2019s career office had emphasized the importance of sounding natural and being someone the interviewers wouldn\u2019t mind sitting with on an airplane. It made perfect sense\u2014after all, who wants to work with an unpleasant person?\u2014but it seemed an odd emphasis for what felt like the most important moment of a young career. Our interviews weren\u2019t so much about grades or r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, we were told; thanks to our educational pedigree, one foot was already in the door. The interviews were about passing a social test\u2014a test of belonging, of holding your own in a corporate boardroom, of making connections with potential future clients. The most difficult test was the one I wasn\u2019t even required to take: getting an audience in the first place. All week I marveled at the ease of access to the most esteemed lawyers in the country. All of my friends had at least a dozen interviews, and most led to job offers. Two years earlier, as a state university graduate, I had applied to dozens of places in the hope of landing a well-paying job after college but was rebuffed every time. Now, after only a year at Yale Law, my classmates and I were being handed six-figure salaries by men who had argued before the United States Supreme Court.\u00a0 I was most certainly no longer in Kansas.",

            "article_content": "Gary Gastelu says the high-performance 2016 Cadillac ATS-V coupe is money. A lot of it. Cadillac wants you to stop thinking of it as an SUV company, despite how much you love your Escalade. That goes for you SRX owners, too, including the 56,000 who have joined the ranks this year. Together, the two models account for well over half the automaker\u2019s sales, and its boss admits it needs even more crossovers in the lineup to keep pace with the import luxury brands that have co-opted this very American type of vehicle to great $uccess. But instead of owning and driving that bandwagon, Cadillac has been busy loading up its showrooms with good old-fashioned cars, a segment that is in decline both industrywide and at the automaker, where they\u2019re down a combined 23 percent through October. Nevertheless, despite the recent truck takeover, the idea of the \u201cluxury car\u201d persists. Of course, luxury alone isn\u2019t good enough for the power brokers of today. You have to deliver ridiculous amounts of performance with it. That\u2019s why there is now a large Cadillac sedan, the CTS-V, that can go over 200 mph. I\u2019m not even sure my dad does the speed limit when he\u2019s cruising around in his vinyl-roof, white-on-white 2006 DTS that he\u2019s still very happy with. But all the cool kids are in on the game, and the cheer captain of that clique has long been the compact BMW M3, now known as the M4, unless you get the sedan, which is still the M3. Regardless, Cadillac has them all covered. The 2016 ATS-V builds on the company\u2019s excellent ATS lineup, which launched to much-deserved acclaim three years ago. The coupe and sedan were designed with driving, not cruising, in mind. Their shared platform is so performance-minded that it serves as the basis of the new Chevrolet Camaro. To step things up many notches from the mainstream models, the ATS-V gets a 3.6-liter twin-turbocharged V6 rated at 464 horsepower. That\u2019s nine more than the V8 in the Camaro can muster, and it\u2019s delivered in a quieter, more sophisticated manner, as is the tendency for turbos. You can channel it through an 8-speed automatic, or six-speed manual transmission, which is the fun way to go. The stick has a few automated tricks, however, including a simple clutch-drop launch control; a rev-match that blips the throttle to smooth out downshifts; and a no-lift shift feature that lets you keep your foot on the floor while changing gears under acceleration. The first two work well all the time; the last not as much. I remember being more impressed with it on the 2008 Cobalt SS, but it\u2019s also not very necessary. The ATS-V goes like stink pretty much regardless of how you approach it. 60 mph? Gone in under four seconds. The quarter-mile follows in just over 12. Those were six-figure supercar times not too many years ago. Cadillac says the ATS-V is good for a top speed of 189 mph, and though the track I attacked in an ATS-V coupe didn\u2019t have a stretch long enough to confirm that, I found no reason to doubt it. But fast in a straight line is easy stuff. The turns are where a sports car needs to work its magic. The standard ATS already feels solid as a cold stone, but the ATS-V\u2019s engineers added bracing above and below the engine to help the chassis even better resist getting twisted. Adjustable, active shock absorbers trim out the ride and make it more than bearable in Tour mode, but it\u2019s always a little on the stiff side \u2013 and that\u2019s the first thing your passengers will mention to you. Actually, they\u2019ll probably remark on the looks of the ATS-V. Order it with the carbon fiber track package (that\u2019s not a suggestion, it\u2019s a must) and the very edgy body extensions combine with the slight wedge profile of the car to give it a kind of 1980s over-the-top supercar style. This was confirmed by the stroller-bound toddler whose head twisted like an owl when he was unable to remove his eyes from the ATS-V as his mom pushed him past the car and down the block. The flair is also functional; it improves aerodynamic downforce. Those holes in the hood? They\u2019re less about heat and more like a pressure release valve that helps keep the front of the car from lifting off the road, while the prominent chin splitter digs into the airflow from below. Fast or slow, the ATS-V\u2019s steering is quick, responsive and perfectly-weighted, though its electric assist does numb things a bit. The seat of your pants knows when the front tires start losing grip before your hands do. You have to try hard to make that happen. The ATS-V has tons of grip and is incredibly neutral. Its world class Performance Traction Management system gives you as much or as little assistance you need to take it to the limit, which is on par, if not beyond the M3/4\u2019s. It's mechanicals are just missing that extra layer of lanolin German cars always seem to be drenched it. As for the luxury bit, the interior is a gorgeous collection of leathers and microfiber suede, and optional sport seats with their adjustable bolsters really dial up the cool. The only letdowns are the dated, frustrating touch controls on the center stack and a flat, plain-Jane instrument cluster that doesn\u2019t look even as good as the one in that Cobalt SS I mentioned earlier. This is not a superficial criticism when you consider that, along with the view out the windshield, it\u2019s the thing you spend the most time looking at in the ATS-V \u2013 and especially since Cadillac has a very cool digital instrument cluster available in its parts bin. You deserve more for the $63,660 you pay for the ATS-V before you start adding options, which easily push the price over 70 grand. So while the ATS-V is about as far from an Escalade as you can get, it turns out that it costs just as much. Seeing as Cadillac won\u2019t sell nearly as many of them, it almost makes you wonder why it bothered going to the trouble of making it. But as long as they keep their eyes on the road and their foot the floor, the people who buy one will be satisfied it they did. ---------- 2016 Cadillac ATS-V coupe Base price: $63,660 Type: 4-passenger, 2-door coupe Engine: 3.6-liter turbocharged V6 Power: 464 hp, 445 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed manual MPG: 17 city/23 hwy",

            "article_content": "Carl Cameron reports from the campaign trail with the Republican nominee Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he can be competitive in states long considered Democratic territory. On Sunday, the real estate mogul will test his appeal to voters outside the GOP heartland by holding rallies in five states that all went for President Barack Obama four years ago. Democrat Hillary Clinton, by contrast, planned events in Ohio and New Hampshire, traditional battleground states where recent polling has shown her either in a virtual tie or trailing Trump. The states Trump plans to visit Sunday include Iowa, which has gone Republican just once in the past seven presidential elections (George W. Bush in 2004);\u00a0 Minnesota, which hasn't supported a Republican nominee since Richard Nixon in 1972; Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't since George H.W. Bush in 1988; and Virginia, whose 40-year run of reliably voting Republican was ended by Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trump's breakneck swing comes on the heels of a wild Saturday night out West.\u00a0A brief scare disrupted his rally in Reno, Nev., when Secret Service agents suddenly hustled Trump off the stage. The agency later said that someone near the stage had shouted \"Gun!\" but that a subsequent apprehension of a man and search revealed no weapon. Trump returned a few minutes later to resume his remarks and declared \"We will never be stopped.\" Trump did not mention the incident at his final event of the evening, a raucous rally in Denver. He did brag that scheduled trips to Michigan by Clinton and Obama meant that his message had put Democrats on the defensive in that state. \"They're getting a little worried,\" Trump said. \"I know Hillary, all of a sudden she's making all of these trips, she's going all over the place. She was supposed to be home sleeping. \"You see, Michigan was never really in play for a Republican,\" he added. \"But you know what? It's in play for us because all of their cars are being made now in Mexico.\" Trump again criticized Clinton for holding a get out the vote event with hip-hop artist Jay Z Friday in Ohio, calling it \"demeaning to the political process.\" \"My language is nothing compared to what Jay Z was doing [Friday] night,\" Trump said of the \"Big Pimpin'\" singer. The former secretary of state had more star-studded events planned this weekend, sharing the stage with pop star Katy Perry in Philadelphia Saturday night. \"Tonight, I want to hear you roar,\" Clinton said before introducing Perry, who hugged her\u00a0while wearing a purple cape bearing the words, \"I'm with Madam President.\" On Sunday, the Democratic nominee planned to campaign in Cleveland with basketball star LeBron James. The final-days scramble highlighted sharp differences between the candidates in a turbulent 2016 campaign season. Backed by Obama and her party's political elite, Clinton spent much of the last year fighting to unify the president's coalition of minorities and younger voters, aided at times by Trump's deep unpopularity among women in both parties. Trump has courted working-class white voters on the strength of his own celebrity, having scared off many would-be Republican allies during a campaign marred by extraordinary gaffes and self-created crises. Just four weeks ago, a video emerged in which a married Trump admitted to kissing women and grabbing their genitalia without their permission. Clinton also faced extraordinary challenges of her own in recent days after the FBI confirmed plans to renew its focus on the former secretary of state's email practices. The development is seen as particularly threatening for Clinton in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire that don't offer early voting. At least 41 million Americans across 48 states have already cast ballots, according to an Associated Press analysis. That's significantly more votes four days before Election Day than in 2012. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Employee Rights Act aims to spread power among union members Republican lawmakers took a first step Monday toward trying to fundamentally change the way unions operate, introducing legislation that would restrict how they spend campaign money -- and could keep cash away from Democratic candidates in 2016. Their complaint: Unions are taking advantage of dues-paying members and sending their money to Democratic candidates whether members like it or not. The Employee Rights Act, introduced Monday by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah., and Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., would allow union members to tell their bosses they don't want their share of dues going to certain candidates or causes, without fear of retaliation. It also would seek to stop intimidation tactics by requiring secret ballots for employee elections regarding issues like unionizing or striking. Any bid to restrict union political donations could have a big impact on Democrats, who get the lion's share of union campaign money. According to the Center for Union Facts, unions in 2012 contributed nearly $90 million to Democratic Party and aligned organizations. \"Forty percent of the union members are Republicans, yet virtually 100 percent of money that they've raised, and it's considerable money, goes to elect Democrats,\" Hatch told Fox News. But now, some Democratic strategists are accusing Republicans of ignoring the needs of hardworking union members, and instead just trying to re-route sizable campaign contributions. \"Democrats have been supported for years by working people and the unions, and that's why Republicans want to bring this up,\" strategist Chuck Rocha said. \"They want to take that money out -- the only real money left on the left side. There's a few big left donors, but we don't have a Sheldon Adelson.\"",

            "article_content": "Top strategist for the campaign says there's no reason for Trump to change on 'The Kelly File' Facing a prospective tab of more than $1 billion to finance a general-election run for the White House, Donald Trump reversed course Wednesday and said he would actively raise money to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete with Hillary Clinton\u2019s fundraising juggernaut. His campaign also is beginning to work with the Republican National Committee to set up a joint fundraising committee after his last two rivals\u2014Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2014dropped out in the wake of Trump\u2019s resounding Indiana win on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ll be putting up money, but won\u2019t be completely self-funding,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee said in an interview Wednesday. Trump, who had largely self-financed his successful primary run, added that he would create a \u201cworld-class finance organization.\u201d The campaign will tap his expansive personal Rolodex and a new base of supporters who aren\u2019t on party rolls, two Trump advisers said. The new plan represents a shift for Trump, who has for months portrayed his Republican opponents as \u201cpuppets\u201d for relying on super PACs and taking contributions from wealthy donors that he said came with strings attached. Mr. Trump\u2019s creation of a joint fundraising committee comes eight months behind that of his likely general-election foe, Clinton. She and the Democratic National Committee reached an agreement last August to create the Hillary Victory Fund, which raised more than $60 million through the end of March. Of that, about $13 million has been transferred to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, while nearly $6 million has gone to the DNC. The former secretary of state raised more than $213 million for her campaign through the end of April, on top of more than $67 million raised by her allied super PACs.

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) 1. Somebody forgot to tell the moderator that he was supposed to moderate and not debate Donald Trump.\u00a0 Lester Holt, of the Nobody But Clinton network, was clearly in the tank for Hillary Clinton. I suspect he was secretly auditioning to be her press secretary.\u00a0 Just \u00a0tally the number of times Holt interrupted Trump and pressed him on follow up questions and then compare that number to Hillary\u2019s. As we say in Dixie, Hillary got some home-cookin'. 2.\u00a0Hillary Clinton does not hold the American people in high esteem. She previously referred to us as a \u201cBasket of Deplorables\u201d and irredeemable. But during the debate she accused us of having an \u201cimplicit bias\u201d against African-Americans. She seems to believe the only way to redeem all of us gun-toting, Bible-clinging Deplorables is to shame us into submission. 3. If Donald Trump\u2019s record on women is fair game, then so is Hillary\u2019s. She needs to be called out for taking money from countries that treat women as second-class citizens. She needs to be called out for the terrible things she said about her husband\u2019s \u201clady friends.\u201d Hillary also took a swipe at Trump\u2019s achievements. She said the only reason he was successful was because of his father. To be fair, Trump could argue that the only reason for Hillary\u2019s success is because of her husband. 4. Trump needs to let go of the birther stuff \u2013 even if the mainstream media won\u2019t. And he needs to either release his tax returns or come up with a better excuse for why he won\u2019t. 5.\u00a0There was no clear winner \u2013 but that does not mean Trump lost. In spite of the Mainstream Media\u2019s disgusting narrative, millions of Americans tuned in to discover that Trump does not wear gold-lined bed sheets or burn crosses at Mar-a-Lago. 6. There is bipartisan agreement that Hillary should never do another shoulder shimmy on national television. Ever.",

Two Republican rivals to Speaker John Boehner have declared themselves, with Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas and Ted Yoho of Florida announcing their candidacies over the weekend. And as Alex Pappas reported, the leader of the effort to topple Boehner, Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., has spent weeks trying to build the 28-member coalition he needs to deny Boehner a 217-seat majority. The coverage has been intense, but is Boehner really in danger? Nope. Despite the announcement from at least six other GOP lawmakers that they won\u2019t be voting for Boehner, this looks like a dead letter. [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel sets the scene for the incoming Congress.]Moral minority - Boehner\u2019s supporters have pledged that even if the speaker fell short on the first ballot, they will hold successive votes until he is reelected. Even so, multiple ballots would be a moral victory for Boehner\u2019s foes. History is certainly against the insurgents. No election of a speaker has gone beyond the first ballot since 1923, when Frederick Gillette, R-Mass., won re-election on the ninth ballot. Forcing so rare a moment would get attention for the movement and foreshadow deeper difficulties for Boehner on looming votes on immigration, spending, taxes and other hot topics. But is even a moral victory in reach? Nah.Whipped - Just look at the pool of potential votes for the Jones plan, which are presumably lawmakers from the most conservative districts in the country. Here\u2019s one metric: Of the 30 House districts in which Obama fared the worst in 2012, many are represented by members of Boehner\u2019s leadership team, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise and committee chairmen including Jason Chaffetz and Hal Rogers. And the same is true as you page through other less-red districts. The votes just aren\u2019t there. A similar effort to unseat Boehner came to a clattering end in 2013, and the speaker has more clout now. With Republicans in control of the Senate, Boehner\u2019s friendship is more valuable to ambitious members who would like to see bills passed and headlines made. These are not unknown facts to Jones & Co., who fell out with Boehner long ago. So what\u2019s the point? [To do - You could scour around the Internet for 30 stories today about what to expect in the opening weeks and months of the 114th Congress, which convenes tomorrow. Or, you could just let David Drucker do the work for you.]Elimination round - There\u2019s no downside for Jones, Yoho and Gohmert, who have already been frozen out of leadership love. The move generates attention and headlines from both conservatives yearning for a more ideological speaker as well as liberals who just want to see the fight. But there may be some downside for the movement the men seek to lead. This gambit stands to be another disappointment for an insurgency that came up empty with convoluted procedural plays on blocking Obama\u2019s temporary executive amnesty as well as a bid to defund his health law. Failures such as these shrink rather than grow insurgencies, especially when they are conducted in very public fashion to the jeers of the press corps and pundit class. If the conservative rebels in the House and Senate make one resolution for 2015 it ought to be this: Next time, win one.MCCONNELL KINDLES HOPE ON TAX DEALThe Hill: \u201cThis much is true: Both President Obama and top Republicans are saying the right things about tax reform right now. Whether that means that the two sides will make the progress in 2015 necessary to overhaul the tax code before Obama leaves office is another question entirely\u2026Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has said that tax reform is on the short list of issues - also including trade and infrastructure improvements - with the best chance for bipartisan cooperation once Republicans take full control on Capitol Hill in January. And Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who will be the House's top tax writer next year, has said he's willing to compromise on one of the GOP's top priorities for reform - that the individual and corporate systems be revamped together\u2026And while Ryan has said that he's willing to work with Obama on tax reform, he's also been far from confident those discussions will lead to anything.\u201d WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...It is finally 2015, that far off exotic time that Marty McFly transported to in the 1989 classic, \u201cBack the Future II\u201d. The Atlantic compares the future McFly expected to find in 2015 to what really exists. Many of the technological predictions in the film came true in varying degrees however two key components missed were the development of Internet and the evolution of mobile phone technology. Cell phones didn\u2019t exist in the film instead featuring banks of phone booths. The internet didn\u2019t seem to exist in the film at least not in the individualized devices as expected today. JVC glasses are pretty close cousins to today\u2019s Google Glass though not nearly as mobile as the Google device. Fax machines dominated business communication in the film, a technology that is just about obsolete today. To their credit, the filmmakers did accurately predict a smart watch, flat screen televisions and facial recognition technology. Society has yet to see the Hoverboards and flying cars featured in the film but have no fear there is still time as McFly didn\u2019t go to the future until 4:29 pm on Wednesday October 21, 2015.

Following the Dallas Cowboys win over the Detroit Lions Sunday, Christie was seen celebrating with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

John Kasich in Ohio, Gov. Bruce Rauner in Illinois, Gov. Nikki Haley in South Carolina, and Gov. Terry Branstad in Iowa.\u00a0HUCKABEE SCRAMBLES GOP FIELDWe can\u2019t yet know whether Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who on Saturday gave up his Fox News Channel show to pursue a presidential run, can upend the GOP field as he did with an upset victory in Iowa and seven other states in 2008. But he has already changed the race. The presidential aspirations of every other potential candidate counting on working-class voters and Evangelical Christians took a hit this weekend. That would certainly include Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Dr. Ben Carson and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Even libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., whose father saw strong support among Evangelicals in 2012, had to reconsider his strategy. Huckabee\u2019s high name identification and durable popularity in Iowa and other states with large numbers of blue-collar Christian voters will make it harder for others to do as he did and use Iowa as a staging ground for a broader insurgency. Huckabee\u2019s move raises interesting possibilities for mainstream candidates too. If Paul, Cruz, Santorum and Carson were all to proceed, the conservative vote in Iowa could be so splintered, that candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, might consider making a play in otherwise unwinnable Iowa. A tough fight for values voters would also create opportunities for Midwestern Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio and particularly Mike Pence of Indiana to try to run as fusion candidates.Dough, yo - WaPo: \u201cIf Mike Huckabee is going to make a serious run for the Republican presidential nomination, he will have to do something he was unable to do in 2008: raise millions of dollars and build a sprawling national campaign to complement the well of support he has among evangelicals and grass-roots activists in early primary states\u2026 A senior Huckabee aide \u2026 The aide said Huckabee\u2019s team anticipates the need to raise about $50\u00a0million by the time of the Iowa caucuses in early 2016, with the money divided between the campaign\u2019s budget and a super PAC, and said Huckabee has done much work to make that a reachable goal.\u201dPerry prepping Iowa rollout - The Hill: \u201cTexas Gov.

Rand Paul [R-Ky.] could have a financial edge over many of his prospective presidential rivals in 2016 due to a quirk in timing and election law that lets him to tap his biggest donors for campaign cash twice. Paul has said he plans to seek Senate reelection and, if he runs, the Republican presidential nomination simultaneously. And because he would be campaigning for two federal offices, he would be eligible to have two open federal campaign committees at the same time. Thus, his largest donors could give $2,600 to his presidential primary campaign and another $2,600 to his Senate account for the primary. While federal rules do limit how he could spend the money, veteran election lawyers say diligent accounting could allow for legal cost-sharing between the two committees, saving Paul's presidential bid precious dollars and letting him collect bigger checks from his biggest contributors.\u201dTOP IOWA DEMS NOT FEELING THE LOVE FOR HILLARYWSJ: \u201cIowa Democratic leaders say they are troubled by the prospect that Hillary Clinton could win the state\u2019s 2016 presidential caucuses without a serious challenge, a view primarily rooted in a desire for a more liberal candidate or at least a robust debate about the party\u2019s policies and direction. Interviews with more than half of Democratic chiefs in Iowa\u2019s 99 counties show a state party leadership so far reluctant to coalesce behind Mrs. Clinton. County Democratic officials also voiced qualms about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to win a general election and her fundraising ties to Wall Street firms and corporations, which remain a target of liberal ire. Many county officials said they would like to see senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont enter the race, though they were split over whether any could gain traction and overtake Mrs. Clinton\u2026Beyond the personal, some worry Mrs. Clinton might not be best-positioned to defeat the eventual Republican nominee, concerned her candidacy wouldn\u2019t be exciting enough to draw in the younger voters who backed Mr. Obama.\u201dTHAT BAR IS FULL OF CLOWNSThe Cincinnati Enquirer reports that Paul Miller plans to open Bircus Brewing Co. later this year, an offshoot of his current business Circus Mojo that currently operates in the city\u2019s Ludlow Theater.

But Miller is well aware of potential customer fears; his clowns do not wear makeup. \u201cYou can be funny or funny looking,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe choose to be funny.\u201d Whew. \u201cOur goal is really to \u2026 have people be wowed by the destination of having some circus acts going on and pretty girls hanging from the ceiling,\u201d said Miller, who founded Circus Mojo after his own circus and acting career.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

            "article_content": "Sophisticated investors know that the main reason why stocks are near all-time highs is that record low interest rates have caused most asset classes to boom. Today, however, most companies are struggling to achieve even modest topline growth and are running out of costs to cut.\u00a0 For the next market move up, companies must improve their net income. Which candidate\u2019s tax policy can help deliver that? Donald Trump has proposed reducing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. This means 85 percent of pretax earnings would come through to post tax net.\u00a0 This is opposed to today\u2019s 35 percent federal corporate tax rate that permits only 65 percent to come through to post tax. That 20 percentage point increase above 65 percent is a 30 percent increase across the board in net income. How many stocks in your portfolio are expected to show 30 percent earnings growth in 2017? How high do you think your stocks would go if every one of them exceeded analysts' earnings expectations by 30 percent next year? If future years' earnings all would be 30 percent higher than the present outlook, wouldn\u2019t that mean more cash flow, more dividends, and higher stock prices? In contrast, Hillary Clinton has promised to raise business taxes by $275 billion to fund her proposed infrastructure plan.\u00a0 America\u2019s businesses taxes are already the highest in the world.\u00a0 Clinton\u2019s tax hike would make our companies even less competitive on domestic soil, accelerate offshoring, and reduce job growth.\u00a0 Of course, this tax hike would significantly reduce net income as well, with the expected downward pressure on stock prices. Under Trump, tax rates for individual investors would also go down \u2013 with two favorable implications.\u00a0 First, more earned income would be available for consumption and investment. A married couple with two children and a nanny would enjoy more than a 30 percent tax reduction \u2013 a growth stimulant. Second, while higher brackets would get relatively less tax relief under the Trump plan, there would still be some. Because people with earnings of $75,000 or more are the mainstays of stock market investing, there would be additional savings \u2013 a strong growth and market plus. In contrast, Hillary Clinton proposes fining investors for any gains they realize over less than a six year time period \u2013 as opposed to the one-year holding period under current law. Duration means added risk and lower returns, especially now that we are in the uncharted Never-never land of zero interest rates and unprecedented geopolitical uncertainty. More broadly, our economic recovery, feeble as it has been, is now seven years old. It has been very rare historically for our economy to keep growing for more than seven consecutive years. Thirteen years would be off the charts altogether. In today's world of low yields on stocks, capital gains are more important than ever, and one of the great aspects of capital gains has been their favorable tax treatment. Hillary Clinton would change all that. Think how hard it is to find a stock that will outperform the market every year for six years. Most investors find it hard enough to find stocks that will outperform for more than the one-year holding period now needed for capital gains treatment. With stocks near all-time highs, what do you think is the likelihood that a bull market will continue for six more years? We would say slim to none.",

            "article_content": "After General Motors turned off its engine over a year ago, Pontiac officially cruised to a stop on Sunday, Oct. 31, as its agreements with dealerships across the country expired and the company officially ended business. We take a look at five of the company's cars responsible for the rise and fall of the iconic American brand. DETROIT \u2013 After General Motors turned off its engine over a year ago, Pontiac officially went out of business on Sunday, Oct. 31, as its agreements with dealerships across the country expired. The 84-year-old brand, moribund since General Motors decided to kill it last year as it collapsed into bankruptcy, had been in decline for years. It was undone by a combination of poor corporate strategy and changing driver tastes. Even before GM's bankruptcy, Pontiac's sales had fallen from their peak of nearly one million in 1968, when the brand's speedier models were prized for their powerful engines and scowling grills. At Pontiac's pinnacle, models like the GTO, Trans Am and Catalina 2+2 were packed with horsepower and sported colors like \"Tiger Gold.\" Burt Reynolds and Sally Field fled the law in a Firebird Trans Am which raced through the 1970s hit movie \"Smokey and the Bandit.\" By the late 1980s, though, Pontiacs were taking off their muscle shirts, putting on suits and trying to act like other cars. The brand had lost its edge. Bill Hoglund, a retired GM executive who led Pontiac during its \"We Build Excitement\" ad campaigns in the 1980s, blames the brand's demise on a reorganization under CEO Roger Smith in 1984. That overhaul cut costs by combining Pontiac's manufacturing, engineering and design operations with those of other GM brands. \"There was no passion for the product,\" says Hoglund. \"The product had to fit what was going on in the corporate system.\" Although the moves were necessary to fend off competition from Japanese automakers with lower costs, they yielded Pontiacs that looked and drove like other GM cars. By 2008, the last full year before GM announced Pontiac's shutdown, sales were 267,000, less than a third of those sold in 1968. Formed in 1926, Pontiac made cars for the working class until a sales slump in the 1950s nearly killed it. GM revived the brand by connecting it to auto racing. From then on, each Pontiac sales boom was driven by speed; each bust generally featured outdated or boring rides. The brand's most storied muscle car, the GTO, came about when some GM engineers took a small car called the Tempest and put a powerful V8 engine under the hood. The letters stood for \"Gran Turismo Omologato,\" Italian for \"ready to race.\" Sparked by the GTO, the Pontiac brand thrived, making up 17 percent of the 5.4 million cars and trucks GM sold in the U.S. in 1968. The GTO even spawned its own 1960s hit song. \"C'mon and turn it on, wind it up, blow it out GTO,\" was the chorus of the tune by Ronny and the Daytonas. Pontiac's decline stemmed from a lack of a consistent strategy or leadership. Executives rotated through every few years on their way up the corporate ladder, each with a different vision. Some even tried to make Pontiac a luxury brand. One strategy that eventually hurt the brand was rebadging: putting the guts of less powerful GM cars inside the skins of Pontiacs. Big economic shifts also damaged the brand. Two gas spikes in the 1970s steered Americans toward smaller cars with more fuel-efficient engines, areas dominated by Japanese automakers in the U.S. About two dozen unsold Pontiacs now linger at dealerships around the country, including a maroon G5 coupe that sits awkwardly in a no-man's land between used cars and new models next to the showroom at Orr GM Superstore near Little Rock, Ark. The car, which is really just a poky Chevrolet Cobalt gussied up with a spoiler, fancy wheels and the red arrowhead Pontiac logo, has been on the lot for more than 700 days. Sales Manager Alex Valencia has knocked almost $7,000 off the sticker price, down to $16,585. Despite spells of success during the last 30 years, Pontiac never returned to its supercharged sales of the 1960s. A low point was the late 1990s, when Pontiac came up with Aztek, an attempt to merge campers with SUVs and win over young, outdoorsy Americans. The vehicle, which seemed more like a cross between a minivan and armored car, flopped. In the mid-2000s, GM tried to rekindle the brand with powerful sedans, such as the G8, which harkened back to the GTO. But dealers wanted a full model lineup, and GM gave them renamed Chevrolets, diluting Pontiac's performance image, says Bob Lutz, GM's former product guru who headed up the effort to reinvigorate Pontiac. This year, Pontiac's sales are less than 1 percent of the 2.2 million cars and trucks GM is expected to sell. GM built the last Pontiac in May. Even after their Pontiac agreements expire, GM dealers will continue to service the cars and honor their warranties. But after this weekend, any new Pontiacs that remain on dealer lots will be considered used cars by GM.

Despite its prime perch, the $32,000 car hasn't sold. Augelli gets emotional when speaking of Pontiac's end. \"I miss it already,\" he says. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "This color-coded map shows where the tallest and shortest women lived in 1914 and 2014. (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)) The tallest men in the world live in the Netherlands, and the tallest women call Latvia home, according to the largest study ever done on people's heights. The vast project included data from more than 1,400 previous studies that had the heights of more than 18.6 million people in 200 countries. These studies included the heights of people who were 18 during every year between 1914 and 2014, allowing the researchers of the new study to track changes in average heights over time. They found, for instance, that South Korean women and Iranian men showed the largest increases in average height over the past 100 years, with South Korean women gaining an average of 8 inches (20.2 cm) between 1916 and 2014, and Iranian men growing an average of 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) taller. [Know Your Roots? Human Evolution Quiz] Men and women in the United States also experienced a growth spurt, but to a lesser degree. In 1914, U.S. men were the third tallest in the world, and U.S. women were the fourth tallest. But despite increases in height of 2.2 inches and 2 inches (6 cm and 5 cm), respectively, U.S. men are now ranked 37th and women are ranked 42nd, the study found. In the United Kingdom, both men and women have gained about 4.3 inches (11 cm) over the past 100 years, jumping from 57th to 38th place (for women) and 36th to 31th place (for men). In China, the stature of men and women has increased about 4.3 and 3.9 inches (11 cm and 10 cm), respectively, from 1914 to 2014. In the modern world, the top 10 tallest nations are all in Europe, and none of them are English-speaking nations, the researchers found. Some countries hit plateaus over the past 30 to 40 years, although they showed increases in height during the first half of the century, the researchers found. For instance, the United States plateaued, as did the United Kingdom, Finland and Japan. However, other countries, such as Spain, Italy and several Latin American and East Asian countries, are still increasing in height, they found. In contrast, other countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, have actually seen declines in height over the past 30 to 40 years. In these countries, the stagnation or decreases in height could be due to a mix of the wealthy people already receiving the maximum amount of nourishment and health care, and lower-class people getting subpar nutrition, especially during pregnancy, study co-author James Bentham, a research associate at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, told Live Science. People's height is partly determined by genetics, but nutrition and environmental factors also play a role, the researchers said. Because conditions such as childhood illness and poor nutrition during pregnancy and childhood can stunt growth, the average height of people can serve as a proxy for how healthy their nation is, the researchers said. Moreover, being taller is associated with longevity, higher education and better earnings, the researchers wrote in the study. Tall people are also less likely to experience heart disease and stroke, and taller women and their children are less likely to have complications before and after childbirth, they said. [Blossoming Body: 8 Odd Changes That Occur During Pregnancy] But it's not all rosy for tall people. Research shows that tall people are more likely to get some cancers, including colorectal, breast and ovarian cancers, and possibly pancreatic and prostate cancers, they said. \"This study gives us a picture of the health of nations over the past century, and reveals the average height of some nations may even be shrinking while others continue to grow taller,\" study lead researcher Majid Ezzati, a professor at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said in a statement. \"This confirms we urgently need to address children and adolescents' environment and nutrition on a global scale, and ensure we\u2019re giving the world's children the best possible start in life.\" Ezzati added that the English-speaking world, especially the United States, \"is falling behind other high-income nations in Europe and Asia Pacific.\" These differences in height, when combined with reports about increased obesity, could be a red flag about people's health, and emphasizes the need for better nutrition throughout life, he said.

            "article_content": "(iStock) Whether you're a working mom or a stay-at-home mom, have babies or big kids, your life is filled with so many responsibilities that every day feels like you\u2019re already running a marathon. Although you know that exercise can help you lose weight, sleep better and feel less stressed, fitting in a workout is something you and many moms struggle with. In fact, 47 percent of moms exercise less than three days a week and 15 percent don\u2019t exercise at all, a report by Edison Research found. Although you might think you have really good excuses for not working out, experts say there are ways you can sneak in a workout. Here are 6 exercise excuses you\u2019re probably making and what you can do to solve them today. 1. I don\u2019t have timeTrying to carve out a 60-minute Spinning class and a shower is not only unrealistic but it may be unnecessary. In fact, just one minute of intense exercise can have the same health benefits as a 45-minute sweat session, a recent study in PLOS One found. The key is to change your mindset and choose to make your workouts a priority by finding ways to fit them in, said Lisa Reed, a pre- and post-natal fitness expert and owner of Lisa Reed Fitness in Washington, D.C. For you that might mean waking up 30 minutes before your kids do, adding your workout to your calendar so nothing else takes precedence or using your lunch break to go for a walk. Set small goals like a 10-minute walk every day, or two, 25-minute workouts a week and then feel good about your accomplishments. \u201cYou\u2019re taking those little moments that come up and making them work for you which can feel like a relief and that you\u2019re not helpless,\u201d said Leah Keller, a pre- and post-natal fitness expert in San Francisco, Calif. and creator of The Dia Method. 2. I\u2019m too tiredWhether you have a newborn baby or a 3-year-old who wakes you up every night, you\u2019re tired 24/7. Exercise can give you a burst of energy that can last for hours, but if you\u2019re too tired to hit the gym, a short, invigorating workout that makes you feel energized and not depleted might make more sense. Take a brisk walk around the block, put on some music and dance with your kids or do some Yoga poses that will give you the stamina to get through the day. Although working out can give you more energy, on days when you\u2019re so exhausted that an easy walk can feel like a stretch, be kind to yourself and sit this one out. \u201cIf what you need most that day is a nap, please take a nap,\u201d Keller said. 3. I don\u2019t have childcareYou don\u2019t have to have a regular babysitter or full time childcare to work out. Find a gym or a YMCA that offers affordable childcare, swap babysitting with another mom, take a mommy and me fitness class or hire a mother\u2019s helper to play with your kids while you work out. 4. It\u2019s too expensive\u00a0 Gym memberships, class packages and personal trainers are pricey but there are plenty of affordable and free fitness programs. Outdoor activities are a no-brainer, or look for new fitness apps, online programs and at-home videos. 5. My body will never be the sameIf you think you\u2019ll never get back to your pre-baby weight, shrink your waist or tighten your tummy, you might think what\u2019s the point? Yet just because you had children doesn\u2019t mean your body will stay this way\u2014you might have to switch up your diet and workouts. Instead of trying to aspire to the celebrities who are in bikinis two weeks after giving birth, be realistic and set one goal at a time to work towards. Also, silence your inner critic and focus on what you love most about your body. \u201cKeep your mindset on that and when you exercise, you\u2019re going to get in better shape,\u201d Reed said. 6. I feel guiltyIf you\u2019re like most moms, you spend a lot of time feeling guilty about what you did or didn\u2019t do. Yet making time for yourself is something you should never feel guilty about. Sneak in a workout and you\u2019ll feel happier, less stressed and better able to conquer motherhood. \u201cWhen we do give ourselves a little bit of time for our own mental and physical health, we are better mothers because of it,\u201d Keller said.",

            "article_content": "Three pilots earn Armed Forces Air Medal for saving E-2C Hawkeye when cable snapped sending plane on plunge of carrier deck Dramatic footage released by the U.S. Navy shows a close call earlier this year on the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. After an arresting cable broke as an E2-C Hawkeye aircraft was landing on the ship on March 18, the plane flew off the end of the carrier. The footage shows the plane, with its distinctive radar on top, disappearing over the side, but then reappearing after it recovers. The Navy awarded three pilots-- Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Browning, Lt. Cmdr. Kellen Smith, and Lt. Matthew Halliwell-- from that plane the Armed Forces' Air Medal in a ceremony aboard the Eisenhower this month. Kellen Smith, who was the plane's copilot, said they heard a \"loud snap\" as the plane slowed. \"When we would normally be coming to a stop, we weren't,\" Smith said in a statement. \"Our years of training kicked in and we reacted on instinct. I slapped back the ditching hatch (Hawkeyes do not have ejection seats) as we cleared the deck and began a deep settle (significant descent).\" He estimated that they came within about 10 feet of the water before the plane pulled back up. Halliwell wasn't at the ceremony-- he's now an instructor, the Navy said. An E2-C Hawkeye on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on June 28, 2016. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Anderson W. Branch/Released) The Navy credits the crewmembers with saving the aircraft, which is part of a group called the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron One Two Three, or VAW-123. They\u2019re also called the Screwtops. They fly a plane called the E2-C. It\u2019s the biggest plane to currently take off and land from an aircraft carrier, according to the Navy, and it weighs more than 25 tons and has a wingspan of 80 feet, which is only about 13 feet shorter than some models of the Boeing 737.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama answers a question Tuesday, June 17, 2014, in Pittsburgh. (AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Poll shows Obama hits new low on foreign policy \u2022 Baier Tracks: Three takeaways from Hillary interview \u2022 Sounds spammy: IRS expands claims of \u2018lost\u2019 emails \u2022 New AFP ad says Rahall \u2018sold W.Va. out\u2019 \u2022 Can\u2019t touch this POLL SHOWS OBAMA HITS NEW LOW ON FOREIGN POLICYWhat\u2019s the cause of President Obama\u2019s sudden urgency on foreign policy? Perhaps because he has a serious problem with the American electorate. In the wake of the Veterans Affairs scandal, the release of five Islamist leaders from a U.S. prison and the sectarian slaughter in Iraq, Obama\u2019s poll numbers are a disaster. Public approval of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy fell again in the WSJ/NBC News poll, sliding to a new all-time low of just 37 percent. Immediately after his re-election, Obama enjoyed 52 percent approval on the subject in the poll. Obama\u2019s overall job approval rating fell to 41 percent, tying his worst-ever performance in that measure, first recorded three months ago. Obama also hit a new low on his personal approval, with 45 percent holding negative attitudes about him compared to 41 percent holding positive views. On the question of his ability to govern, Obama\u2019s administration was viewed as somewhat or entirely incompetent by half of respondents, worse than the measure for the administration of George W. Bush in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A staggering 54 percent said Obama \u201ccannot lead and get the job done.\u201d Running the clock on Iraq - Under pressure across the political spectrum over U.S. inaction in a collapsing Iraq, President Obama will meet today with congressional leaders. The White House calls these \u201congoing consultations\u201d but a more apt description would be that the president is playing for time and exploring the option of punting to Congress. \u00a0A chorus from all sides, reminiscent of the broad, bi-partisan support for the 2003 Iraq invasion, is loudly urging some form of military action. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein called for \u201cdirect\u201d U.S. military action against the Sunni militants now in control of northern Iraq and menacing Baghdad. Like many, including 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Feinstein also wants President Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s out. Meanwhile, former Vice President Dick Cheney, in a WSJ opinion piece, says Obama\u2019s actions in Iraq before and after the recent militant advances have increased the strategic threat to the United States. [\u201cRarely has a U.S. President been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many.\u201d \u2013 former Vice President Dick Cheney in a WSJ op-ed.] Urgency? Well maybe not - While the president has repeated ruled out U.S. boots on the ground in Iraq, he has already dispatched nearly 300 troops to guard U.S. assets in Iraq and is now contemplating sending another 100 elite military members in advance of contemplated airstrikes. That and other options will be on the table at the White House meeting with Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, Minority leader Mitch McConnell, House speaker John Boehner and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (she\u2019s not a fan of action). \u00a0The administration\u2019s urge to \u201cconsult\u201d recalls the quick about-face Obama executed on Syria last year, when U.S. airstrikes were thought imminent only to see the president fob off the issue to Congress. Obama ultimately chose to do nothing. Hillary: It\u2019s Maliki\u2019s fault - \u201cThat is a recipe for continuing instability and if there\u2019s going to be a real stand against these extremists who are worse than even is being reported publicly in terms of what they\u2019re doing and how they behave, then there has to be a different government and I don\u2019t think [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki] is the person to lead Iraq.\u201d \u2013 former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an interview with Fox News. BAIER TRACKS: THREE TAKEAWAYS FROM HILLARY INTERVIEW\u2026 \u201cMy takeaway from the interview: First, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still convinced the anti-Islamic video played a role in the Benghazi attack. She does so despite zero evidence now that that is the case; despite former deputy CIA Director Mike Morrell testifying that he was surprised when Susan Rice raised the video on those Sunday shows; despite the fact that commanders in the field and Greg Hicks, who was at the embassy in Tripoli at the time, have testified they knew this was a coordinated attack and there was no protest from the start; and despite the fact that we have heard from survivors who said they knew exactly who was behind the attack real time as it was going on, and so did the leadership. Second, Clinton says she\u2019s taking responsibility for \u201cbeing Secretary of State when it happened\".\u00a0 And that's about it.\u00a0 The security decisions, she says, were handled below her.\u00a0 And while she points to the \u2018fog of war\u2019 and \u2018all kinds of intelligence was flying around\u2019 - she decided on the video in the first press release on the subject while Ambassador Stevens is still missing. Third, she created daylight between her and President Obama on working with Iran, on calling for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to step down, and on the state of the economy saying \u2018she understands why 64 percent of Americans\u2019 think we're on the wrong track. It was a different type of interview, but there are some interesting tidbits in there on a host of topics.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier. [In the new WSJ/NBC News poll, Clinton enjoyed improved ratings on key attributes since her last presidential run, with 38 percent of respondents she is \u201chonest and straightforward.\u201d Voters were evenly divided, though, on whether they would support her presidential run.] What would Hillary do? - Asked by Special Report Anchor Bret Baier if alleged Benghazi terrorist Ahmend Abu Khattala arrested in Libya Sunday should be read his Miranda rights and tried in U.S. civilian court, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded: \u201c[I]f I were president and the FBI and the Justice Department and our law enforcement came and said \u201cWe\u2019re finally ready, Mr. or Madame President, to go and capture and detain the terrorist and we have enough evidence to successfully prosecute him in our courts\u201d \u2013 which have proven very successful at prosecuting terrorists \u2013 I would say, \u2018Then I\u2019m ready to give the order.\u2019\u201d \u201cPresident Obama made this commitment when he first took over the presidency, he was going to close down Guantanamo, so now we don\u2019t have a place to detain these high-value terrorists that we really should be doing is getting intelligence from them. We are under severe threat of Islamic terrorism, that\u2019s a sad and unfortunate threat.\u201d \u2013Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., discussing on bringing Khattala to the U.S. to Megyn Kelly on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d SOUNDS SPAMMY: IRS EXPANDS CLAIMS OF \u2018LOST\u2019 EMAILSFox News: \u201c\u2018It looks like the American people were lied to and the IRS tried to cover-up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this investigation,\u2019 House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., and Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., said in a statement. Republicans on the committee said the agency knew as early as February that emails were missing. \u2026 But Republicans remain dubious about the agency\u2019s claims that the rest simply disappeared. Camp and Boustany said Tuesday that the problem goes beyond Lerner, revealing the IRS \u2018cannot produce records from six other IRS employees involved in the targeting of conservative groups.\u2019 Among those figures is former chief of staff to the commissioner, Nikole Flax. Boustany and Camp said in a statement: \u2018The timeframe for which Ms. Flax\u2019s communications are purportedly unrecoverable covers when the Washington, DC office wrote and directed the Cincinnati field office to send abusive questionnaires, including inappropriate demands for donor information, to conservative groups.\u2019\u201d [New at Fox News Opinion: Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative group that was targeted by the IRS, writes \u201c[The IRS is] so brazen in its commitment to the Obama administration that it will peddle obviously implausible stories to conceal and continue its wrongdoing.] Team Obama has history of \u2018lost e-mails\u2019 - Washington Examiner: \u201cGawker has been trying since at least 2012 to obtain emails between reporters and Philippe Reines, a former State Department official and longtime aide to Hillary Clinton. Yes, Gawker editor John Cook wrote the State Department nearly two years ago for all emails between Reines and reporters from various news groups, including the New York Times and BuzzFeed, and State has yet to fulfill his request. Sure, Cook has received an official response from the State Department, but the federal agency still hasn\u2019t given up the emails. \u2018After a thorough search,\u2019 Sheryl Walter, the director of State\u2019s Office of Information Programs and Services, said in a statement addressed to Cook, \u2018... no records responsive to your request were located.\u2019 Her response, dated months after Cook\u2019s initial 2012 Freedom of Information Act request, is curious considering that it was Reines\u2019 job during his tenure at State to act as a go-between with reporters and then-Secretary of State [Hillary Clinton].\u201d Hillary on IRS targeting: \u2018Let\u2019s investigate it\u2019 - Unlike many of her Democratic friends, Hillary Clinton calls for the IRS investigation to continue, especially since a large chunk of e-mails have gone up missing. \u201cI think maybe the right thing to say is \u2018let\u2019s investigate it,\u2019 but do it as a nonpartisan, as fair-minded, and fair and balanced as we can,\u201d Clinton said to Greta Van Susteren Tuesday. When asked if the IRS investigation, as President Obama put it in 2013, a \u201cphony scandal\u201d Clinton disagreed that \u00a0\u201cI think what President Obama means there is there really wasn\u2019t a lot of, you know, evidence that this was deliberate but that\u2019s why the investigation needs to continue.\u201d Watch the full interview here.

That meal better come with caviar.] They support estate taxes\u2026 in theory - Bloomberg: \u201c[Bill Clinton] and Hillary Clinton have long supported an estate tax to prevent the U.S. from being dominated by inherited wealth\u2026[but to] reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth. These moves, common among multimillionaires, will help shield some of their estate from the tax that now tops out at 40 percent of assets upon death.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...More roads, more traffic? That\u2019s the finding of traffic engineers studying ways to deal with congestion in America\u2019s cities and suburbs. Adam Mann of Wired looks at how proponents of government spending for public transportation and road construction have both been wrong when it comes to alleviating traffic jams. The solutions, Mann says, likely lay in creating incentives for certain behaviors among commuters and other drivers. \u201c\u2026if congestion pricing is a non-starter, a more rational approach to parking could be a good secondary step in easing congestion. Parking in most cities is far cheaper than it should be, and it\u2019s too often free. \u2018Because it\u2019s free, people will misuse it and it will be full all the time,\u2019 said [University of Pennsylvania transportation economist Gilles Duranton]. Drivers searching for parking contribute significantly to road congestion. \u2018There are some estimates that say in the central part of cities up to 30 percent of driving is people just cruising around for parking,\u2019 Duranton said.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

NEW GOP FIRM TRIES DATA-DEPENDENT STRATEGYBuzzfeed: \u201cEchelon Insights\u2019 co-founders, veteran GOP digital strategist Patrick Ruffini and pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, said [their new polling firm, Echelon Insights,] will merge the campaign crafts of telephone surveys, focus groups, and data analytics to help Republican clients rethink the way they deploy resources and shape their messages. \u2018The idea is to have data and information as the nerve center and the hub of how decisions are being made on campaigns, instead of just relying on the highest-paid person\u2019s opinion,\u2019 said Ruffini. Traditionally, he said, campaigns are made up of competing factions, with pollsters in one corner, digital staffers in another, and a Stuart Stevens-like guru at the head of the organization, making decisions after he hears out his staffers\u2019 arguments. Echelon will seek to overturn that model by combining those efforts into one comprehensive intel-gathering operation.\u201d POWER PLAY: DOES CHARLIE CRIST HAVE A PRIMARY PROBLEM?Now that former state Sen. Nan Rich has officially qualified to run in Florida\u2019s gubernatorial race on the blue team, Republican-turned-independent-turned Democrat Charlie Crist\u2019s path to victory in the August 26 primary is not so predictable.\u00a0Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida, left the party while running behind Marco Rubio in 2010.\u00a0 Florida\u2019s Gov.Rick Scott has his own popularity problems, but has drawn even with Crist in the polls. Watch Chris Stirewalt break it all down in just 90 seconds here. Florida dems bring up old issue in new TV ad - TampaBay.com: \u201cThe Florida Democratic Party\u2019s first TV spot of the 2014 governor\u2019s race airs this week and attacks [Republican] Gov. Rick Scott over an old weakness: Medicare fraud. \u2018Maybe you\u2019ve heard about what was the largest Medicare fraud in history, committed when Rick Scott was a CEO,\u2019 says the ad. \u2018Or that Scott\u2019s company paid record fraud fines of $1.7 billion.\u2019 \u00a0The commercial is similar to those that appeared in the 2010 election when Scott's Republican rival, Bill McCollum, and then his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, wanted to ensure that voters knew about the 1997 fine paid by Columbia/HCA, a hospital company Scott built.\u201d NEW AFP AD: RAHALL \u2018SOLD WEST VIRGINIA OUT\u2019Conservative group Americans for Prosperity launches a new attack ad against Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va. today, in an unusual move for the group backed by Charles and David Koch. The group has mostly focused on Senate races and the issue of Obamacare, but this $400,000 ad buy targets Rahall on coal. The one-minute spot features Christina Underwood from Mount Nebo, W.V. whose coal-mining husband lost his job three times in the last six years. \u201cThe war on coal is war on working class families,\u201d said Underwood. \u201cNick Rahall did not stand up to the EPA. He is not doing the job that he is supposed to be doing.\u201d Underwood said teary-eyed \u201cYou have sold West Virginia out. Families are suffering because of you.\u201d Republican nominee state Sen. Evan Jenkins hopes to unseat Rahall in November. New addition to the family - Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, part of the network of activist groups backed by the Koch brothers, announced Tuesday the launch of Freedom Partners Action Fund, a new tax-exempt organization focusing \u201con the disastrous impact of government intrusion and irresponsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars specifically as it relates to energy policy, health care policy, federal spending and regulations, and opposing government cronyism,\u201d according to the press release. Marc Short, president of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, said \u201cFPAF will support candidates who share our vision of free markets and a free society and oppose candidates who support intrusive government policies that push the American Dream out of reach for the American people.\u201d Short also notes FPAF is independent from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. NRCC HOLDS $30 MILLION FOR TV ADSThe Hill: \u201cThe National Republican Congressional Committee has reserved $30 million worth of fall TV time across 26 districts, tipping its hand about where it thinks the most competitive battles will be this November. The NRCC's reservations include 17 Democratic-held seats and nine where Republicans are defending incumbents or open seats, a sign they expect to play offense this fall. The money matches, with $18.7 million for offense and $11.5 million for defense. The biggest investment is $3.3 million for Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.). The NRCC also plunked down $2.8 million for Rep. Frank Wolf's (R-Va.) seat in Washington, D.C.'s expensive media market, matching the $2.8 million the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already placed.\u201d DCCC not so impressed \u2013According to a DCCC press release, DCCC reserved $44 million in fall airtime in 36 competitive districts, touting the larger price tag and number of markets. \u201cInstead of crowing about their 12 seat-pickup prediction, maybe the NRCC should have spent more time recruiting strong candidates and building strong campaigns in districts that they have now abandoned,\u201d said Josh Schwerin of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

What he believed to be a possum was really a porcupine. How do you say quills in Portuguese? Metro reports: \u201cInstead of scaring the animal, he ended up with 400 porcupine quills in his hand. Despite going to the local hospital, where he received three shots of anesthetic, the pain continued. Mr. Moror\u00f3 was forced to get a tetanus jab and a course of antibiotics afterwards.\u201d If you\u2019re having any troubles today, just check out the picture of the varmint swatter\u2019s hand before doctors did their work. Yikes. AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cJustice trumps everything in domestic politics. But in war, intelligence is more important.

It\u2019s something like a low-key Lent. Think of the haunting strains of \"O come, O come, Emmanuel\u201d for Advent versus the sonic blast of George Frideric Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah\u201d for Christmas. Even though Christians know that these are just thought exercises and spiritual disciplines, the spreading gloom still sometimes seems real. Ash Wednesday or Advent vespers can leave believers in a fog of gloom. The tomb is full. The manger is empty. But Christmas always comes. Easter always comes. The fog will be burned away. Christians intellectually understand what has happened and what will come, but emotions overawe intellect. For Republicans, December of every fourth year acts as something of a secular Advent. There will be a brokered convention. The party will rupture and break. The House and Senate are doomed. The divisions are so deep that they cannot be overcome. A third-party candidate will arise and hand the election to the Democrats. Woe betide! The gloom is gloomier this year than most. And the political press leans in to whisper into anguished ears, \u201cDoomed, doomed, doomed\u2026\u201d There is silly talk from party leaders about how to deny Donald Trump the nomination at the Republican National Convention \u2013 wishful thinking born of desperation. They shouldn\u2019t kid themselves. If Trump gets the delegates, he will get the nomination and there\u2019s nothing any \u201cestablishment\u201d can or will do about it. And if Trump doesn\u2019t get enough delegates, somebody else almost certainly will. The idea that the convention will be deadlocked is (for now) exclusively the province of political journalists that would love to cover it and long-shot candidates who need some reason (beyond vainglory) to continue their campaigns. Now, predictions of a re-united party and an orderly convention can hardly be delivered with the same certitude with which Christians can await December 25. Trump\u2019s wealth and celebrity do afford him the chance to play spoiler if he chooses. The overpopulated GOP field does make it harder for the party to sort itself out. And the chaotic, dangerous condition of the world certainly creates a scenario in which dark Advent dreams could become real. But in every year past, the deep angst of December has faded and Republicans have found some way to survive, endure and, occasionally, win elections. So if you are one of the GOPers caught in the December fog, give yourself a break. The Halleluiah Chorus is almost certainly still to come. [If you missed Kristen Soltis Anderson\u2019s smart, useful piece on how polling works (and doesn\u2019t), you should do yourself the favor.] 2016 GOP POWER INDEX: AHEM\u2026Fox News First is not the kind of political note that would say \u201cwe told you so,\u201d but in this case we\u2019ll make an exception. Sen. Ted Cruz clambered atop the 2016 GOP Power Index on Sept. 28, knocking off longtime leader Jeb Bush. Now, 11 weeks later, polls nationally and in Iowa confirm what we have long held: that Cruz\u2019s ability to unite religious conservatives and libertarian-leaning Republicans would be a potent combination. And Cruz looks far different from other conservative insurgents in two ways. First, his resources and campaign discipline are built to last, especially with Southern states moving up in the calendar this year. Second, as the unquenchable fire that is Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy burns through the open prairie of the GOP, the settlers are looking nervous in their cabins. Cruz may be an insurgent, but he is an insurgent within the establishment and is doctrinally conservative.\u00a0 If the choice was between Trump and Cruz alone, even the crustiest barnacles on the hull of the USS Establishment would assent to Cruz. While Cruz would mean a tough general election with Hillary Clinton, Trump portends generational damage for his adoptive party. For all those reasons, the Power Index mostly stands pat this week. One big change this week: Ben Carson\u2019s downward trajectory in the polls reaffirms what we have long supposed: that there will be no second act for his campaign given the availability of attractive alternatives for his supporters in Cruz and Rubio. His replacement, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has turned his New Hampshire hype into something of substance. If Cruz\u2019s most likely final rival, Sen. Marco Rubio, suffers a blowout in February, Christie is shaping up to be the one to chase him. But the auguries all still \u2013 and increasing volume \u2013 point to a helluva stretch run between Cruz and Rubio. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 5)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0; 6) Chris Christie [previously unranked] On the radar -\u00a0\u00a0Ben Carson,\u00a0John Kasich,\u00a0Rand Paul,\u00a0Mike Huckabee and\u00a0Rick Santorum[Watch Fox:\u00a0Chris Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

In the end, the network announced that Paul would be allowed to participate in the main stage, stating Paul was \u2018showing viability\u2019 by polling at 5% in a Fox News Iowa poll released Sunday morning, but it did not explain\u2014as it did in the case of Fiorina\u2014how it let Paul, whose polling average considered by the network is below the required 4% in the state, on stage.\u201d POWER PLAY: CONSERVATIVE SCOREKEEPERS Paul Mero, head of the Leadership Project for America PAC, explains why his group\u2019s method of ranking candidates is unique.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Today in 1799, George Washington breathed his last breath, dying (most likely of quackery) at his beloved estate, Mount Vernon, at the age of 67. Washington only had about two-and-a-half years of his long-awaited retirement before he met his end. During his many years away from home at war and as president, Christmas was one part of life at Mount Vernon for which Washington yearned most \u2013 understandable given how he spent some Christmases. What would Christmas look like to our nation\u2019s first president? Much of it would look familiar today, including a church service and large gathering of family and friends. The Washingtons loved to entertain and Christmas was no exception. The day typically included a feast followed by the seasonal activity of foxhunting. Something that would have been missing? St. Nicholas paying a visit and a glittering evergreen tree. Both would not be popular in America until the first large wave of German immigrants reached our shores in the mid-1800s.

According to\u00a0Time magazine, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), plans to file a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics alleging that Clinton gave Neptune Minerals \u2018special access to the State Department based upon the company\u2019s relationships with Secretary Clinton\u2019s family members and donors to the Clinton Foundation.\u2019 \u201cThe complaint comes two weeks after emails released by the State Department show that Clinton, now the Democratic presidential front-runner,\u00a0ordered a senior State Department official to look into the request from\u00a0Marc Mezvinsky.

            "article_content": "Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, talks upcoming proposal, weighs in on 2016 election Alaska Republicans are joining with Democrats in taking drastic action to save the state\u2019s ObamaCare insurance system from spiraling into crisis, as all but one insurer flee the state and health care costs soar. While state Republicans remain largely opposed to the health care law, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a bill earlier this month that aims to prevent massive premium hikes and keep the ObamaCare system afloat for the thousands of residents already in the system. The measure was introduced by Gov. Bill Walker. \u201cOver the past two years, my team and I have received hundreds of calls and emails from Alaskans who say health care costs are increasingly unaffordable,\u201d Walker, once a Republican and now an independent, said in a statement. \u201cThis legislation will provide relief from substantial premium increases for 23,000 Alaskans who are insured through the private marketplace as we continue work to bring more insurers into Alaska.\u201d Walker\u2019s office said that three insurers have left Alaska since 2015, and that the one remaining insurer, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield, would have to pull out or pass costs on to customers if the state does not offer relief. The legislation establishes a state health insurance fund to stabilize rates for all Alaskans by subsidizing costs for high-cost customers, according to Politico, which earlier reported on the move. The costs would be covered by existing funds from a tax on insurance premiums that all insurance companies pay. \u201cHad this problem not been addressed this year, it would have cost the state more than $200 million next year,\u201d Lori Wing-Heier, Division of Insurance director, said in a statement. The bill passed both chambers with almost unanimous bipartisan support, and will soon go to the governor\u2019s desk for his signature. State Senate Democratic Leader Berta Gardner told FoxNews.com the bill was necessary in part due to Alaska\u2019s unique situation, which makes health care particularly expensive. \u201cBecause Alaska is a very high cost area and we have a small scattered population, insurance companies are not eager to do business here,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cCosts are high and there are relatively few people. For instance there is no rheumatologist in the entire state.\u201d Gardner rejected the claim that the crisis has been caused by ObamaCare: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long standing problem, well before the Affordable Care Act.\u201d State Rep. Lora Reinbold, who was the sole House Republican to vote against the bill, told Politico she objected to the legislation as \u201cfailed federal policies continue to take tremendous toll on state budgets.\u201d However, Republican U.S. senators offered support for the legislation and laid the blame for the crisis at the feet of ObamaCare. Sen. Dan Sullivan told FoxNews.com in a statement that Alaska is facing a \u201cdifficult predicament\u201d imposed on it by a law that has caused Alaskans to lose their doctors and has shrunk the market. \u201cNow the state is facing the difficult predicament of having to spend even more taxpayer dollars to prop up this failing system. It\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThis is exactly why we voted to repeal ObamaCare\u2014which was vetoed by the president--and why we will continue to work to undo the damage that\u2019s been done under this law.\u201d Meanwhile Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the legislation necessary to prevent Alaskans losing coverage. \u201cSenator Murkowski commends the Alaska State Legislature for working to address the problems in Alaska created by the Affordable Care Act and doing what is necessary to avoid thousands of Alaskans losing their coverage,\u201d a spokeswoman for Murkowski told FoxNews.com.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is proposing significant changes to Social Security and Medicare to keep the costly federal entitlement programs on solid financial footing. Bush outlined his proposals on the website Medium.com on Tuesday, the day before the third Republican presidential debate, in Colorado. Bush said he wants to gradually raise the retirement age for full benefits, adding one month each year, beginning in 2022 when the retirement age becomes 67 under current law. By 2034, the retirement age under his plan would be 68; by 2046 it would be 69. Currently, it's 66. To encourage retirees to continue working, he would reduce benefits to those who want to retire early and increase benefits to those who work past their retirement age. He seeks to eliminate the $15,720 limit on income for working seniors already receiving Social Security. For those working beyond age 67, he proposes eliminating the 6.2 percent payroll tax. Bush also said he would change the formula used to determine benefits by lowering monthly retirement checks to wealthier recipients. At the same time, he would increase to about $15,000 the minimum Social Security payment for people employed at least 30 years. He also would lift the 10 percent limit employers can withhold from workers contributing to a 401(k) plan and help small businesses create those plans for employees. \"If we do not have an honest conversation about what it will take to protect Medicare and Social Security, we fail seniors and we fail the next generation of Americans,\" writes Bush. On Medicare, Bush proposes a similar plan pushed by Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, expected to replace outgoing House Speaker John Boehner. Bush proposes a \"Medicare premium support\" program to provide seniors with a fixed amount to pay for \"guaranteed coverage options\" to obtain traditional Medicare or purchase a private health insurance plan. Seniors could also choose a specialized insurance plan that targets medical conditions like diabetes or Alzheimer's. Under his plan, Bush said he would increase \"means-testing\" to calculate premiums, lowering subsidies to wealthier retirees. A senior, for example, earning $160,000 a year would receive a 35 percent federal subsidy as compared with the current 50 percent subsidy. He said the federal government would base its premium on the average price of private plans, and predicts it would lower premium costs by an average of 6 percent annually. He also would allow seniors to keep contributing to their tax-free Health Savings Accounts to cover out-of-pocket expenses. Other GOP candidates, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have outlined changes to the expensive federal entitlement programs. Social Security's retirement trust fund has enough money to pay full benefits until 2035. Medicare's giant trust fund for inpatient care won't be exhausted until 2030. Nearly 60 million people receive Social Security benefits, including 42 million retired workers and dependents, 11 million disabled workers and 6 million survivors of deceased workers. Total enrollment is rising each year as baby boomers reach retirement age. About 55 million retirees and disabled people get Medicare.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Joe Heck on Monday entered the race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, setting in motion what could be one of the top Senate races of 2016. Heck made the announcement in a video posted online, citing his background as a medical doctor in the emergency room and on a military deployment to Iraq. He talked about the struggles his family endured growing up and having the help of a union and social services when his father was out of work. \"When my father needed emergency surgery, Medicare covered it. That's why I'll protect Medicare and Social Security and preserve it for future generations,\" Heck said in the three-minute video on his website. The Republican congressman will likely face off against Reid's hand-picked successor, former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. The Democrat announced her candidacy in April and saw one potential primary foe -- U.S. Rep. Dina Titus -- decide against running in favor of seeking re-election to the House. Lieutenant Gov. Mark Hutchison, former Assemblywoman Heidi Gansert, Las Vegas City Councilman Bob Beers and former Lieutenant Gov. Brian Krolicki -- all Republicans -- also have decided against running, clearing the way for Heck. Popular Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval announced last month that he wouldn't seek the seat held by the 75-year-old Reid. Sandoval said he wanted to focus on improving the state's infrastructure and higher education system rather than embarking on a demanding campaign. Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, announced in March that he would not seek a sixth term and immediately backed Cortez Masto. The decision came after an exercise injury left Reid blind in one eye. Heck served in the state Senate between 2004 and 2008 and won the congressional seat in 2010 after defeating Titus by less than 2,000 votes. He won re-election by big margins in 2012 and 2014, even though Democrats have a slight edge in voter registration in the district. Heck has spent more than two decades as an Army reservist, including three active-duty tours and a deployment in Iraq. He's also the only one-star general in Congress. Heck was born in New York and moved to Nevada in 1992. He lives in Henderson with his wife, Lisa, and three children.",

            "article_content": "President Obama said Wednesday that he's ready to sign good bipartisan legislation to fix Medicare's doctor payment problem, without endorsing any specific legislation. Without a fix, doctors face a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees, the consequence of a 1990s budget law that Congress has repeatedly waived. The House is expected to vote Thursday on a bill with rare support from both top leaders in the House that would permanently fix the problem. Obama backed the idea of a fix at a White House event marking this week's five-year anniversary of his signing the Affordable Care Act, while stopping short of backing the House compromise. \"As we speak, Congress is working to fix the Medicare physician payment system. I have my pen ready to sign a good bipartisan bill,\" he said. The House bills calls for a period of basically stable reimbursements, followed by gradually shifting a larger share of doctors' pay so that it's keyed to quality, rather than quantity, of service. The Medicare fix is packaged with an extension of children's health insurance, funding for community health centers and dozens of other provisions. The outlook in the Senate is unclear. Drafted with the unusual support of both top leaders in the House -- Speaker John Boehner for the GOP and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi -- the bill is aiming for the political center. That seemed to have collapsed on health care in the battles over President Barack Obama's overhaul. The legislation is being criticized from the political right and the left. Conservatives don't like that most of the cost will be added to the federal deficit. Liberals object to higher premiums for upper-income beneficiaries, when drug companies are not being asked to share the burden through Medicare rebates. Obama also announced a cost-cutting effort that the White House calls a Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network. The White House says more than 2,800 health care providers, patients and consumer groups have agreed to take part. The goal is to tie more payments for health care services to the quality -- not quantity -- of services rendered. Earlier this year the administration set a goal to tie 30 percent of Medicare payments to quality and value, but Obama wants to go further. \"A central notion in the Affordable Care Act was we had an inefficient system with a lot of waste that didn't also deliver the kind of quality that was needed that often put health care providers in a box where they wanted to do better for their patients, but financial incentives were skewed the other way,\" Obama said. \"We don't need to reinvent the wheel -- you're already figuring out what works to reduce infections in hospitals or help patients with complicated needs,\" Obama told health care providers gathered in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the West Wing. \"What we have to do is to share these best practices, these good ideas, including new ways to pay for care so that we're rewarding quality.\"",

            "article_content": "Kelly Wright reports from New York Hillary Clinton remains ahead of Donald Trump with just three weeks until Election Day. She has a six-point lead over Trump, 45-39 percent, in a new Fox News Poll of likely voters. \u00a0Clinton was up by seven points last week (45-38 percent) and by two in early October (44-42 percent). \u00a0Gary Johnson stands at 5 percent and Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein at 3 percent. In the head-to-head matchup, Clinton\u2019s up by 49-42 percent. \u00a0It was 49-41 percent at the end of last week (Oct. 10-12). Clinton\u2019s advantage over Trump is at the edge of the poll\u2019s margin of error in the four-way contest and outside the margin of error in the head-to-head ballot. The national poll, released Tuesday, was conducted Saturday through Monday. \u00a0The third and final presidential debate will be moderated by Fox News Channel\u2019s Chris Wallace in Las Vegas Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS A large gender gap marks the four-way race, as Trump is ahead by 7 points among men, while Clinton is up 17 points among women. \u00a0She also leads among non-whites (+51 points) and younger voters under 30 (+19). \u00a0Johnson and Stein get the support of one in five of these young voters. Whites with a college degree favor Clinton (+9 points), while whites without a degree go for Trump (+27). \u00a0He\u2019s also the choice among whites (+10 points), veterans (+17), and those who regularly attend religious services (+16). Trump has an edge among independents (+7), but is hurt by a lack of party loyalty. \u00a0Only 80 percent of Republicans back him. \u00a0Eighty-seven percent of Democrats support Clinton. The two are about equally matched on strength of support and interest. \u00a0About two-thirds of each candidate\u2019s supporters back their choice \u201cstrongly,\u201d and almost all of their supporters are extremely or very interested in the race. There are, however, major differences on temperament and judgment. \u00a0Overall, 61 percent of voters say Clinton has the temperament to serve effectively as president. \u00a0Sixty-one percent think Trump doesn\u2019t. By a 7-point margin, voters say Clinton has the judgment to serve (53-46 percent). \u00a0It\u2019s the reverse for Trump, as by a 23-point margin they believe he lacks the judgment (37-60 percent). That goes a long way toward explaining why Clinton is preferred over Trump by more voters when it comes to making decisions about using nuclear weapons (+25 points), handling an international crisis (+19), and handling foreign policy (+18). While the two are more closely matched, Clinton also comes out on top on nominating Supreme Court justices (+6 points), as well as on handling the issues of Social Security/Medicare (+8), immigration (+6), and terrorism (+4 points). However, Trump tops Clinton by six points on handling the economy -- and voters say that\u2019s the most important issue facing the country. \u00a0Clinton briefly had the edge last week (+3 points). Otherwise, Trump has consistently had a single-digit advantage on the economy. Republican pollster Daron Shaw says if the election focus is on creating jobs and spurring economic growth, then \u201cTrump is very competitive.\u201d \u00a0Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. Despite her close ties to the Obama administration, by a slim 47-44 percent margin, voters pick Clinton over Trump as the one who will \u201cchange the country for the better.\u201d More registered voters would feel \u201centhusiastic\u201d or \u201cpleased\u201d if Clinton were to win in November (37 percent), than would feel that way about a Trump win (30 percent). Both candidates receive more negative reactions to them winning (displeased/scared) than positive ones (enthusiastic/pleased). \u00a0Over half would feel negatively if Trump were to become the next president (56 percent), including 46 percent who would feel \u201cscared.\u201d \u00a0For Clinton, 48 percent would react negatively, including 31 percent \u201cscared.\u201d Seventy-six percent of Democrats would feel scared about a Trump presidency. \u00a0Far fewer Republicans, 56 percent, say a Clinton victory scares them. It\u2019s well-established that neither candidate is seen as honest by the electorate. \u00a0Yet on specific scandals, the poll finds a difference: \u00a0more voters think Clinton is lying about how her emails were handled while she was secretary of state (67 percent) than think Trump is lying about the allegations women are making against him (51 percent). \u00a0Even so, the email issue matters less in vote choice, as 24 percent of those who think Clinton is lying still back her, while just 8 percent of those who believe Trump is lying support him. While neither is beloved, Trump\u2019s personal ratings are worse than Clinton\u2019s. \u00a0She has a net negative rating of 4 points (47 percent favorable vs. 51 percent unfavorable). \u00a0Trump is under water by 19 points (40 percent favorable vs. 59 percent unfavorable). Again, the party faithful aren\u2019t all with Trump: \u00a022 percent of Republicans have a negative opinion of him. \u00a0That\u2019s more than twice the number of Democrats who view Clinton unfavorably (9 percent). Even so, 77 percent of Republicans view Trump favorably, which is much more positive than their view of some of his GOP primary opponents: \u00a0Ted Cruz (59 percent), Jeb Bush (56 percent), and John Kasich (44 percent). \u00a0Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump surrogate, is viewed favorably by 72 percent of Republicans. Clinton (91 percent favorable) has higher favorable ratings among Democrats than some of her surrogates, like former President Bill Clinton (88 percent favorable) and former Vice President Al Gore (76 percent favorable). The stand-out is First Lady Michelle Obama, who gets a 59 percent positive rating overall, and a 95 percent favorable among Democrats. Pollpourri Are the media being fair to the candidates? \u00a0Many voters don\u2019t think so. Fifty-one percent say news coverage of Trump has been fair (46 percent) or biased in his favor (5 percent). \u00a0Yet 43 percent say it\u2019s been unfairly biased against him. On the other hand, more than 8-in-10 think coverage of Clinton has either been fair (55 percent) or unfairly positive (27 percent). \u00a0Only 11 percent feel it\u2019s been anti-Clinton. Seventy-eight percent of those backing Clinton think her coverage has been fair or in her favor. \u00a0For Trump, that number is just 13 percent. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 15-17, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 912 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump answers a question during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (Joe Raedle/Pool via AP) Since Hollywood is revisiting Bill Murray movies (if you\u2019re lucky, you missed the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d reboot), why not another run at \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d? With this plot twist: instead of a weatherman trapped in Punxsutawney, it\u2019s some unfortunate soul stuck in Trump Tower and charged with debate prep. With every day the same: advise Donald Trump to stick to the economy, wrong-track America and a corrupt and compromised political system as embodied by Hillary Clinton \u2013 without making it overly snide, disparaging or unwarranted. Only, each and every time, Trump fails to deliver the goods. Anyone who was three credits shy of their college degree and took one last course pass/fail recognized Clinton\u2019s approach in Las Vegas: do as little as possible to avoid flunking. Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate in Las Vegas: need you ask? Here are some observations about the final live, nationally televised encounter between Clinton and Trump. Third Time Wasn\u2019t The Charm. Thrice now, Trump has had 90 minutes to make his argument for his brand of change over Democratic status quo, with tens of millions of voters tuned in. Thrice now, he\u2019s failed to seal the deal. I base this on one standard: sound bites. Trump didn\u2019t generate positive ones about his vision. To the extent the debate is rehashed over the next few days, the video will be of Trump refusing to say he\u2019ll accept the election\u2019s results if he\u2019s on the losing end, or calling Clinton a \u201cnasty woman\u201d. Consider the findings from Tuesday\u2019s Fox News Poll: On the economy \u2013 the paramount issue in this election \u2013 Trump tops Clinton by six points. In 2012, Mitt Romney led President Obama by 9 points. On foreign policy, Clinton has an 18-point lead. In 2012, Obama led by only 8 points. Now, the number that speaks to why Trump trails in this contest: asked with candidate can change the country for the better, Clinton leads by three points. Three months after the GOP national convention, Trump has failed to convert his outsider status to an advantage. If he goes on to lose the race, then that failure should be in the lead paragraph of his political obituary. Medicated? Try Premeditated. \u00a0Anyone who was three credits shy of their college degree and took one last course pass/fail recognized Clinton\u2019s approach: do as little as possible to avoid flunking. The forced smile, rehearsed sound bites, eyes constantly looking down at her notepad to make sure she didn\u2019t forget what she studied in debate prep? All the stuff of a candidate playing out the string. About those eyes looking south: it\u2019s the stuff of a pedestrian debater. Hillary\u2019s only new twist tonight: repeatedly mentioning that she was serving the public when he was hosting \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d The cynical Clinton calculation: she could get away with the same empty calories about adding jobs, fighting ISIS, the evils of Trumponomics and bringing together the nation for a group hug because she doesn\u2019t fear her opponent exploiting her weakness. Though she was clad in a white pant suit tonight, Clinton has a fondness for yellow attire bright yellow \u2013 a personality color associated with cheerfulness and creativity, plus a tendency to over-analyze and engage in methodical thinking. That latter trait would be an understatement as far as Hillary Clinton goes. According to the WikiLeaks dispatches, she selected her running mate a year before she received the Democratic nomination. Her campaign mulled over no less than 85 campaign slogans last year. Chris Wallace. The \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor led off with an adult question about the Supreme Court and interpreting the Constitution \u2013 and didn\u2019t let up. The directness was refreshing: was Trump okay with Russian meddling in elections; how does the $275 billion Clinton infrastructure proposal differ from Obama\u2019s $800 billion lemon of a stimulus plan? Fifty minutes into the debate came Wallace\u2019s telling moment, when the dialogue shifted to temperament. Here, Wallace let each candidate have their two minutes; he didn\u2019t step in mid-answer, as have previous moderators, which is what prompts the bias talk. When Clinton tried to sidestep his question about the Clinton Foundation, Wallace pulled her back on course \u2013 just as he pushed Trump on his foundation\u2019s choices. My only criticisms: Wallace didn\u2019t bring up the horror that is the $20 trillion national debt until a few minutes remained in the debate; entitlement spending was relegated to the very end (how many viewers had switched to the Cubs-Dodgers game?). The penultimate question perfectly captured this election: Trump didn\u2019t have an answer as to how to safeguard Social Security and Medicare. Clinton wants to protect benefits \u2013 even enhance benefits \u2013 with no details on how she\u2019ll pay for it. Ugh. Must We Suffer Again? What to make of the presidential debate process now that it\u2019s (mercifully) concluded? Every four years, it starts with the best of intentions. Yet, the end product disappoints. In 2016, a troubled America didn\u2019t get the policy dialogue it deserved. Too many times, the question of the moderator\u2019s role clouded what should be a clean celebration of democracy. This isn\u2019t to suggest that the Commission on Presidential Debates should be put out to pasture, but I would like to suggest two reforms. First, ditch the lone moderator and go back to how presidential debates worked from 1960-1988 \u2013 a moderator backed up by a panel of three or more journalists. Spreading the questioning might help with the bias question. Second, lower the bar for who gets on the stage. At preset, the Commission allows only candidates who are on the ballot in enough states to earn 270 electoral votes \u2013 as long as they\u2019re polling at 15 percent or higher in a composite of national surveys. Why not lower the latter number to 10 percent and give the third-party candidates a fairer chance at prime-time exposure? The good thing about pondering debate reforms for 2020 and beyond: it means this election\u2019s end finally is in sight.",

FROM RESET BUTTON TO NAZI TALK, HILLARY THE HAWK RETURNSFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put some distance between herself and the Obama administration on Russia\u2019s strong-arm tactics in Ukraine. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, compared recent Russian troop deployments in the region to policies implemented by Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. \u201c[This is like] what Hitler did back in the 30s,\u201d Clinton told donors at a charity event in California, according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. \u201cAll the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they\u2019re not being treated right. I must go and protect my people and that\u2019s what\u2019s gotten everybody so nervous.\u2019\u201d Later in her remarks, Clinton described Russian ruler Vladimir Putin as a man \u201cwho believes his mission is to restore Russian greatness ... When he looks at Ukraine, he sees a place that he believes is by its very nature part of Mother Russia.\u201d More [A New Pew-USA TODAY poll shows 15 percent of respondent cite Benghazi as Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s most negative point in her career.] Reset yourself - Clinton lost her last presidential bid in part because of liberal concerns over her hawkishness on Iraq and Afghanistan. That left the door open to then-Sen. Barack Obama who depicted her as a handmaiden of Bush-era aggression. When Clinton took her post as Obama\u2019s Secretary of State, she seemingly took on much of his geo-political view, including the belief that Russia is more of an ally than adversary. That most painfully revealed itself when Clinton presented her Russian counterpart with a \u201creset\u201d button (albeit mistranslated). With sharp eyes on her next White House run, Hawkish Hillary has returned to the roost. [\u201cThere are moments when I look down, shake my head and say \u2018I can\u2019t believe we lost to these guys.\u2019 [Mitt Romney] was right, I think the President was incredibly na\u00efve on his Russia policy.

Is Hillary getting ready for a libertarian? - Sen. Rand Paul made his clearest sign yet that he\u2019s preparing a 2016 run, as he asked state officials in Kentucky to clear him for a dual Senate re-election while seeking another federal office. He\u2019s part of a growing non-interventionist wing of the GOP, a movement that has many establishment Republicans alarmed. With Clinton soaring above potential Democratic challengers and her turn seemingly having arrived, a more hawkish stance would give her a chance to peel off more moderate Republican voters concerned about the libertarian direction of the party. It might de-motivate the Democratic base, so she will have to use sparingly. Baier Tracks:\u00a0Historical \u2018Iron\u2019-y\u2026A little historical irony today: On this day 68 years ago at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo. former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, now considered one of the opening rhetorical shots of the Cold War. In his \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 speech, Churchill\u00a0condemned the Soviet Union\u2019s policies in Europe and declared, \u2018From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.\u2019 Specifically, Churchill\u00a0warned against the expansionistic policies of the Soviet Union and\u00a0advised that in dealing with the Soviets there was \u2018nothing which they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness.\u2019 The speech was warmly received by then-President Harry Truman, a Missourian, who was on stage with Churchill. \u00a0The question is, 68 years later, could Churchill's warnings apply to a former KGB agent named Vladimir Putin. And how would Churchill's speech be received by the Obama administration, which at least so far, insists Putin wants an \u2018off-ramp\u2019 to the situation and a communication strategy that seems to center around making sure everyone understands that this is not \u2018Rocky IV.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier. ORGANIZING FOR ACCESS: CONTROVERSIAL DONOR GOT FACE TIMEOrganizing for Action, the continuation of President Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign as a no-limits fundraising machine is in hot water. The NYT reports OFA \u201c\u2026acknowledged Tuesday that its executive director had set up a White House meeting for a New Jersey businessman entangled in a lawsuit with a federal agency, who then pledged to raise $100,000 for the group one day after the meeting. The group\u2026 also said that on three occasions its fund-raisers or other employees had tried to steer potentially controversial donations to allied liberal groups that did not disclose their donors. The contributions include the check promised by the businessman, written by an acquaintance reportedly seeking a presidential pardon for a 1991 Medicare fraud conviction. Organizing for Action did not accept the contribution, and no evidence has emerged that the administration took action to help either man. Last week, the group fired the fund-raiser involved in soliciting the $100,000 contribution, Samantha Maltzman. But the revelations\u2026thrust into controversy an organization that had hoped to play a major role in advancing Mr. Obama\u2019s second-term agenda but has faced criticism since its inception for providing big donors with access to the president and some of his closest aides.\u201d Headed by Obama\u2019s former campaign manager Jim Messina, OFA is the first permanent campaign apparatus operated for a re-elected president, a move that caused considerable anxiety among watchdogs left, right and center. OBAMA PROJECTS $5.5 BILLION BAILOUT FOR INSURERSPresident Obama has given his first estimate for how big the initial bailout for insurers will be under his signature health law: $5.5 billion. Democrats prefer the name \u201crisk-corridor,\u201d but the taxpayer-funded pool to keep private insurers afloat amid ObamaCare upheavals will surely sound to voters like a bailout. And based on prior experience, we can expect that number to be a low estimate. More from The Hill.

Officials say they were only generally aware Sebelius would be seeking support from outside groups. \u2026emails show that White House Office of Public Engagement staffers participated in weekly conference calls with HHS and Enroll America.

OBAMA\u2019S PICK FOR TOP DOJ POST PUTS DEMS IN A JAMIt\u2019s a tough time for Senate Democrats to have to consider President Obama\u2019s appointment of the former lawyer of a cop-killer who is celebrated by the far left, but a vote on the controversial nomination is scheduled for today. From the WaPo: \u201cMore than 30 years have passed since the Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. But the case remains an internationally-known political lightning rod. And, this week, lightning is striking in D.C. The latest incarnation of the Abu-Jamal trial comes as it threatens to derail the nomination of Debo P. Adegbile, President Obama\u2019s nominee to head the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. He previously worked as legal counsel to the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, which helped Abu-Jamal get his death sentence overturned and has represented him at various points since\u2026 Faulkner\u2019s widow, the Fraternal Order of Police, and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) have mounted a crusade to block the nomination. And recent developments suggest they might prevail. \u2026 The first sign that the Adegbile nomination could be in real trouble came last week, when Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said he would not vote in favor of confirmation\u2026 Senators facing a difficult vote include: Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Kay Hagan (D- N.C.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.).\u201d \u2013 Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream is following the hearing.

A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed to Fox News Tuesday a report in The Orlando Sentinel that the office is conducting a domestic-violence battery investigation into the accusations submitted in a report Sunday by Lolita Grayson. The paper reported that Lolita Grayson, who filed from divorce from the congressman in January after nearly 24 years of marriage, claimed her husband pushed her against a door after showing up unannounced at their home. Lolita Grayson said she fell to the ground, and kneed Rep. Grayson in the stomach to defend herself. She then called 911. Lolita Grayson said that the congressman also told her in the presence of their children he planned to leave her \u2018in the gutter\u2019 and would give her nothing in the divorce\u2026Grayson\u2019s spokeswoman Lauren Doney said Tuesday the congressman firmly denies the \u2018frivolous\u2019 allegations made by his wife, and that witnesses at the scene also have stated her version of events is an \u201coutright lie.\u201d Doney claims Lolita Grayson was the one who attacked Rep.

The two political action groups are on opposite sides of a pitched battle that will play out in GOP primaries across the country this year. The two congressmen-turned-activists will debate this question: Are tea partiers hampering the conservative cause or is the GOP establishment to blame? Washington Examiner\u2019s Tim Carney, a visiting fellow at the think tank, will moderate. The event starts at 5:30 p.m. ET. You can watch live here. ARE THEY HIGH IN D.C. OR SOMETHING?The District of Columbia is taking a big step toward decriminalizing recreational use of marijuana, with Mayor Vincent Gray poised to sign a council-passed measure that would make possession of up to an ounce of pot the criminal equivalent of a parking ticket \u2013 a $25 fine and no charges on the offender\u2019s record. U.S. Park Police won\u2019t go so easy on the Mall and other federally patrolled areas, but the rest of the city is set to become a safer space for smoking, though public puffers will be subject to the same fine for those nailed under public intoxication statutes. As USA Today reports, cops won\u2019t be able to act on the skunky smell of pot, but would actually have to see smoke before investigating. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s not a blink. That\u2019s a KGB agent lying through his teeth, which is what they train to do for all of their lives. I mean, when Hitler went into the Sudetenland, he claimed it was in response to a desire on the part of the population. This is what all dictators do. The idea that somehow it\u2019s a blink, because he\u2019s waiting to see if he wants to take the rest of Ukraine, and that\u2019s a sign of weakness?

            "article_content": "The Justice Department on Friday unsealed charges in its largest-ever criminal health-care-fraud case, charging three individuals with using a network of doctors, hospitals and health-care providers across South Florida to improperly bill more than $1 billion to Medicare and Medicaid. Philip Esformes,\u00a0the owner of more than 30 Miami-area skilled-nursing and assisted-living facilities, was the project\u2019s mastermind, the indictment alleged.\u00a0He and two co-defendants, along with other co-conspirators, allegedly paid and received bribes and kickbacks to get thousands of patients admitted to facilities Mr. Esformes controlled. In those facilities, they were often given medically unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments, which were then billed to Medicare and Medicaid, according to court papers. Esformes attorneys Marissel Descalzo and Michael Pasano of Carlton Fields said their client \u201cadamantly denies these allegations and will fight hard to clear his name.\u201d The case was brought as part of an interagency Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which operates in nine locations across the country, officials said. Since its creation in March 2007, the task force has charged nearly 2,900 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for more than $10 billion, they said. Fraud continues to plague the roughly $600 billion Medicare program, though new criminal cases have slowed in recent years. Fraud enforcers have brought fewer cases since 2013, but convictions and settlements since the start of the decade have netted Medicare between $1 billion and $2.5 billion annually, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Inspector General.

            "article_content": "As the polls continue to take shape after the conventions, we\u2019re seeing Hillary Clinton further solidify her lead with African Americans, Latinos, voters under 30 and women. She\u2019s made considerable gains with independents and is, miraculously, chipping away at Donald Trump\u2019s lead with white Americans. But what we don\u2019t know is which side of the aisle a critical voting bloc will land: seniors. In the latest CNN/ORC Poll, Clinton received just 35% of the 65 and older vote as Trump earned 53% \u00a0from the AARP wing. This could spell bad news for Clinton as seniors have only increased their voting power. In the 2000 election, voters 65 years and up made up 14% of the electorate and in the 2012 election, the same group made up 16% of all voters and had become considerably more Republican. Senior voters have become one of the biggest voting groups, eclipsing both African Americans and Latinos who made up 13% and 10% of the 2012 vote respectively. In an election where Trump will not do as well as previous Republicans have with Latinos, African-Americans and women, it is crucial that Trump over performs with senior voters if he wants any chance of winning this race. A February poll found that a majority of senior voters feel neglected by the candidates. Indeed, 70% said that Clinton and Trump weren\u2019t paying enough attention to their issues \u2013 a big gamble as seniors are a bloc that actually show up to vote. In the November 2010 midterm elections, 61% of citizens 65 and older turned out to vote. This was higher than any other voting contingent. Just like all voters, seniors want to know that the candidates understand their particular set of circumstances. And after the last few years when low interest rates have dealt a serious blow to retirement plans hurting the wallets of seniors across the nation, both Clinton and Trump need to spend more time talking dollars and cents with older Americans. So what can the candidates do? Hit the two most important issues in this election, the economy and national security, hard with seniors\u2019 circumstances in mind and do the same for healthcare, an obvious high priority for the elderly. Donald Trump\u2019s bleak description of the state of the American economy may resonate with seniors. A Bring the Vote Home poll found that 63% of senior citizens disapprove of Barack Obama as President. In addition, the same poll reported that 76% of senior\u2019s feel that the country is on a seriously wrong track. While Trump hopes to woo elder voters with his promise of a new direction he thus far lacks the specificity of policy to dramatically win this argument. Clinton should emphasize her well detailed platform while also playing off President Obama\u2019s endorsement as the most qualified person to ever run for President. And she should play up her role as the candidate to protect Americans from national security threats. In a July Pew Poll, 80% of Americans stated that terrorism and national security are top issues in deciding who they\u2019re voting for this November. Hillary Clinton can win senior voters by continuing the \u2018patriotic shift\u2019 of the Democratic Party they framed at the convention. She must take in stride the label of being tough on ISIS and speak of her experience hunting down Osama bin Laden as proof that she will keep America safe. Finally, to keep seniors on their side, both candidates need to reiterate their support to protect healthcare programs that are working, especially when costs have been skyrocketing and approval for the President\u2019s signature plan continues to struggle. To accomplish this, both candidates should show their support for Medicare Part D, a program created in 2003 to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs, mostly benefitting senior citizens. Hillary Clinton has suggested reforms to Part D by introducing Medicaid-style rebates for Part D beneficiaries. What she does not realize is that mandatory rebates leads to increased premiums and limited choice. In an economy where many senior citizens are struggling to keep their heads above water, this is not a policy position that will help her gain their critical votes. On the Republican side, Donald Trump has broken with much of the GOP by calling for Medicare to negotiate its own prices. This goes against Trump\u2019s open-market, capitalist spirit as allowing Medicare to negotiate its own prices would lead to a $36 billon loss in research and development for biopharma companies. Clearly, too much is at stake for the presidential candidates to be pushing these unsound policies for Medicare Part D. Not only would the overwhelming majority of senior citizens who rely on Part D be adversely affected, but those individuals' families and their healthcare providers would be left to pay a considerable price. Medicare Part D should be lauded for its success and efficiency, especially in economic terms, not used as a political pawn leaving our senior citizens at risk. After all, in an election\u00a0where the majority of seniors are already feeling like their votes aren\u2019t being courted, both Trump and Clinton can\u2019t afford to further alienate this crucial voting bloc.",

            "article_content": "Many family physicians don't believe lung cancer screening can reduce deaths from these tumors, and some don't offer tests even to longtime smokers, a U.S. survey suggests. Nearly all agreed that early cancer detection is more likely with low-dose computed tomography (CT) than with traditional x-rays. But only 41 percent believe low-dose CT scans in asymptomatic individuals can reduce deaths from lung cancer, the survey found. Even for a 60-year-old patient with a long history of smoking, 12% of family physicians said they would not recommend any screening and another 9% said they would suggest only an x-ray. Study author Jan Eberth, a public health researcher at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, and colleagues note in the journal Cancer that the American Academy of Family Physicians has said there isn't enough evidence yet to recommend or discourage these tests. But the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), along with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services and \"multiple professional societies and organizations,\" do support the use of CT scans for high-risk patients including some current and former smokers, the authors note. The researchers analyzed data from surveys completed by 101 family physicians in South Carolina in 2015. Most of the doctors were white, male and had graduated from medical school at least a decade ago. When asked about the risks of low-dose CT scans, 88% expressed concern about unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and about half said they worried about exposing patients to stress and anxiety or radiation. About half would screen a 70-year-old former smoker who quit more than 20 years ago - a situation when groups like the USPSTF and Medicare recommend against it. In another situation where screening isn't recommended - a 50-year-old nonsmoker with 30 years married to a smoker - 22% of family physicians said they would offer screening. The survey was started in 2015 before Medicare changed its payment polices to cover CT scans for lung cancer screening and counseling sessions discuss test with patients, Eberth noted. One limitation of the survey was that researchers changed it later in the year to follow up with participants and ask about how Medicare coverage might influence screening decisions, the authors note. \"Primary care physicians may be overwhelmed with the amount of new information required to understand the data regarding lung cancer screening, potential benefits, and with discussing risks,\" Dr. Ticiana Leal, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \"Chest x-rays for screening is a failed strategy,\" said Dr. Vinay Prasad, a researcher at Oregon Health and Science University who wasn't involved in the study. \"Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer showed a strong benefit in one randomized trial, though there are a number of caveats and nuances there that may give one pause,\" Prasad added in an email. \"At a minimum, the potential benefits and potential limitations should be discussed with appropriate patients as part of shared decision making.\"",

            "article_content": "The GOP-led House Budget Committee Thursday gave party-line approval to a sweeping balanced budget plan, but the measure faces a rewrite next week to overcome opposition from the party's defense hawks. The 22-13 vote advances the measure for a House floor debate next week. The measure adds $36 billion to President Barack Obama's request for overseas war funds in an effort to get around tight limits on the Pentagon budget. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the measure would be amended on the floor to lift restrictions that panel deficit hawks have placed on accessing the additional funding. Boehner told reporters that he was confident the House would pass the measure next week despite anger among tough-on-spending conservatives such as Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., who want much of the additional Pentagon money to be paired with budget cuts. The panel vote came after Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., abruptly adjourned the committee Wednesday night after panel conservatives insisted that more than $20 billion of the additional Pentagon spending be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the $3.8 trillion budget. Across the Capitol, the Senate Budget Committee kicked off debate on its companion measure, which contains slightly milder cuts to programs like Medicaid than the House plan. Both plans rely on deep but often unspecified cuts to the social safety net that advocates for the poor say could force millions of people off programs like Medicaid and food stamps. \"What they are proposing is to cut programs for some of the most vulnerable people in this country -- the elderly, children, sick low-income people\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"At the same time they want to give significant tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations.\" Republicans counter that balancing the budget is a moral imperative and that controlling Washington's spiraling spending will strengthen the economy and preserve retirement programs like Medicare for decades. \"We know that a balanced budget will mean more opportunity and a healthier economy for hard-working American families,\" Price said. In the Senate, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was hoping to rewrite the budget to add war funding in hopes of matching Obama's request for a $38 billion Pentagon increase. The original GOP plan, written by new Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., and released Wednesday afternoon, stuck to Obama's war funding request and immediately came under attack. The cuts aren't going anywhere so long as Obama occupies the Oval Office. And Republicans aren't showing much interest in advancing them beyond the hypothetical confines of Congress' arcane budget process, which involves first passing a nonbinding budget measure and then following up with binding legislation to implement it. Senate Republicans, already eyeing the 2016 elections, balked at a politically sensitive House plan to turn health care coverage for seniors into a voucher-like program for those who enroll beginning in 2024. But most of the focus behind the scenes was on efforts by defense hawks to add to the Pentagon's budget, whose core would essentially be frozen for the third year in a row in the fiscal year beginning in October unless lawmakers intervene. Procedural obstacles prevent Republicans from simply increasing the budget for defense as Obama recommended in his budget, financed by tax increases and spending cuts elsewhere. The GOP solution is to pad war accounts that aren't bound by tight budget limits set by the return of automatic cuts known as sequestration. The House plan, which had stalled because of the fight between defense hawks and tea party forces, would add $36 billion to Obama's $58 billion request for overseas military and diplomatic efforts in the war against terror. \"The Senate budget as introduced fails to prioritize our national defense after years of damaging cuts to our nation's military,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a potential presidential candidate. But the House panel is loaded with fiscal hard-liners who rejected the leadership's bid to increase the war funding by another $2 billion -- to $38 billion -- and remove limits on accessing the funds. \"Our responsibility, as a defense hawk myself, is to fund the military but also to pay for it by offsets,\" said Budget panel member Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. \"We can find a way to pay for $20 billion.\" Boehner, however, negotiated an agreement with Price and Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, to insert the $38 billion -- which matches increases sought by Obama for core Pentagon operations -- when the budget comes to the floor next week. \"We've walked everybody through it and we think we're in a good place,\" Boehner said. Successful action on the budget would pave the way for a veto confrontation over Obama's signature health care law, since a filibuster-proof measure to repeal much of it could make its way through the Senate.",

            "article_content": "On 'Special Report,' Rich Edson explains why insurance costs will rise again Americans in markets across the country could be looking at double-digit premium hikes under ObamaCare next year, according to a new study that's already fueling election-year finger-pointing. The Kaiser Family Foundation report found premiums for popular low-cost plans under the health care law are projected to increase an average 11 percent in 2017. Among the sharpest projected increases are: 26 percent in Portland, Ore.; 21 percent in the District of Columbia; and 16 percent in New York City. The study focused on the two least-expensive -- and very popular -- \"silver\" policies. It specifically examined the impact of rising premiums on those whose income exceeds the limit to get government subsidies to defray the cost of mandatory insurance. The income cutoff for those tax credits is $47,520 for an individual and $97,200 for a family of four. \"Several factors will influence how premiums will change in 2017, and there is reason to believe\u00a0that increases will be higher than in recent years,\" the report said. The findings were based on 14 metro areas across the country. The Portland, New York and D.C. increases were for ObamaCare\u2019s lowest-cost Silver Premium plan. Costs are projected to decrease in just two metro areas -- Providence, R.I. (13 percent) and Indianapolis (4 percent). The full picture on 2017 premiums will emerge later this summer as the presidential and congressional elections head into the home stretch. The next ObamaCare signup starts a week before Election Day. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wants to build on President Obama\u2019s signature health law while Republican nominee Donald Trump wants to repeal and replace it. Washington Republicans were quick to point out the projected increases and try to tie them to Democrats seeking re-election in November. \u201cThis latest round of double-digit premium increases for consumers is just further evidence that ObamaCare has failed to make health care affordable for Americans,\u201d Bob Salera, a National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman, said Wednesday. \u201cHouse Democrats\u2019 continued support for ObamaCare is a slap in the face to the families who are facing rising costs as a direct result of President Obama\u2019s failed health care law, and voters will hold them accountable in November.\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Meredith Kelly called the NRCC statement \u201ca desperate attempt to distract from what this election will really be about: Donald Trump.\u201d The administration remains steadfast that proposed rates are not \u00a0what consumers ultimately will pay, citing an April 12 Department of Health and Human Services report and arguing that the average premium in 2016 for people with tax credits increased just $4, from $102 to $106 a month, despite headlines suggesting double-digit hikes. \u201cAnd consumers will benefit from shopping and tax credits again this year,\u201d HHS spokesman Benjamin Wakana told FoxNews.com. \"This is just the beginning of the rates process ... proposed rates aren\u2019t what most consumers actually pay.\" Wakana also argued \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of consumers qualify for tax credits that reduce the cost of coverage below the \u201csticker price.\u201d The Kaiser analysis examined the impact before subsidies are calculated, however, and found the changes in the second least-expensive plan were almost identical -- with the same three metro areas having similar projected increases and just Providence and Indianapolis showing projected decreases. Kaiser said the two plans are significant because they are the most common choices in the marketplaces and the second-lowest is the benchmark used for subsidies. The cheaper plans typically have higher deductibles, with overall costs ranging from market to market. The study found the monthly premium for a 40-year-old nonsmoker in 2017 in the least-expensive Silver plan will range from $192 in Albuquerque, N.M., to $482 in Burlington, Vt. Final rates may change if regulators push back on the requests from insurers. Most workers and their families are covered by employers, but about 12 million people get private coverage through ObamaCare insurance markets. Nearly seven in 10 pick the mid-tier silver plans. About 2 million marketplace customers, though, make too much to qualify for the subsidies. And an estimated 3 million to 5 million who buy their policies outside of markets such as ObamaCare do not receive financial assistance. For both the subsidized and the unsubsidized, willingness to switch plans may be crucial in keeping premiums more manageable next year. \u201cIf they stay in their same plan they may see a higher premium increase,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, the analysis\u2019 lead author. The premium increases follow major insurers reporting significant losses, enrollment lower than hoped for, new customers being sicker than expected and other problems. Medicare and Medicaid, federal agencies that oversees ObamaCare, said recently that the health insurance markets are still in an early trial-and-error stage which could go on for another couple of years, or well into the next president\u2019s term.

(AP) A New Jersey man who faced a fine for flying flags supporting Donald Trump\u00a0outside his home had charges against him dropped by a judge Wednesday. Joseph Hornick was ticketed on March 25 for violating a West Long Branch ordinance that restricts the display of political signs until 30 days before an election. New Jersey\u2019s primary is set for June 7. Hornick was ticketed after a resident, who is a former Democratic councilman, called police and questioned why his complaints about the flags to the municipal code enforcement officer had not resulted in a citation, NJ.com reported, citing a police report. The town considered the flags supporting the presumptive Republican nominee to be in the same vein as political lawn signs, acting borough administrator Lori Cole said. Hornick\u2019s lawyer argued that the ordinance was vague on whether it applied to flags. Judge Louis Garippo Jr. agreed, calling the law \u201csomewhat vague.\u201d He said he was dismissing the case \u201cin the interest of justice. The state's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union joined the dispute, saying people have the right to express their political beliefs every day. Hornick had faced a minimum fine of $100. The maximum penalty is a fine of $2,000, 90 days in jail or both. \"Let the flags fly. Let 'em fly,\" Hornick said afterward, according to NJ.com. \"You take my freedom away, I'd rather sit in jail, bottom line.\" Hornick's attorney, Eric Sherman, said the borough council is now in the process of drawing up a new ordinance that addresses the issue of the clutter of political signs without infringing on rights.

            "article_content": "Insight from Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton hasn't been the Democratic nominee for even a day, and already the party's newly anointed 2016 ticket is facing questions over flip-flopping on key issues \u2013 immediately drawing fire from Donald Trump, who accused Clinton of betraying her supporters. Clinton and vice presidential pick Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., grappled with claims of flip-flopping on both the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and federal funding of abortion. Longtime Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told Politico late Tuesday that he believes Clinton will ultimately support the TPP, with some tweaks. When asked if Clinton would come around now that she is the nominee, McAuliffe said: \u201cYes. Listen, she was in support of it. There were specific things in it she wants fixed.\u201d Killing the deal has become a rallying cry for supporters of Bernie Sanders, many of whom arrived in Philadelphia carrying signs with the letters \"TPP\" crossed out.\u00a0Sanders claims the deal would benefit big corporations, while sending jobs abroad and lowering wages. Clinton, who once supported the proposal, tried to muffle that outcry during the primary season by reversing her support, in a rare break with the Obama administration. Yet that was before Sanders\u2019 plucky revolution was formally quashed Tuesday night. As McAuliffe's remarks caused a stir overnight, his spokesman later walked them back, and said the governor was merely expressing what he hoped Clinton would do as president and that he has \u201cno expectation\u201d that Clinton would change her position. The Clinton campaign also flatly denied the claim, saying McAuliffe \u201cgot this one flat wrong.\u201d The back-and-forth drew immediate fire from Trump, who has also opposed the deal, accusing Clinton of betraying her supporters. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. \u201cJust like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP,\u201d the billionaire tweeted. The controversy came as her vice presidential pick, Virginia Sen. Kaine, is changing his position on an amendment that restricts the use of federal funds for abortions. An aide confirmed to Fox News Tuesday that Kaine, who is Catholic and says he is personally opposed to abortion, has made a commitment to Clinton that he will support the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Kaine has a mostly pro-choice record in the Senate, but has made an exception for the Hyde Amendment. Kaine\u2019s change in position comes as a new Knights of Columbus-Marist poll shows 62 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion. Forty-four percent of Democrats, 84 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents oppose the funding, according to the poll.

            "article_content": "(AP) For the past eight years, Democrats have focused on the fear of not having health insurance as a justification for ObamaCare. As a result, 20 million people now have coverage who didn't have it before.\u00a0 But the net cost is projected to be over $1 trillion dollars over the next decade, and having health insurance still doesn't guarantee that your particular health problem will be properly taken care of or that the doctor you need to help you will be available. Hillary Clinton promises to expand ObamaCare coverage to millions more and to add bells and whistles that will cost billions more dollars. But even if she wins the presidency and the Democrats regain control of the Senate, it is very unlikely that her additions will be passed through a Republican-controlled House. In contrast, Donald Trump promises to repeal ObamaCare if he becomes president. But even if he wins and Republicans retain control of Congress, a full repeal would require 60 votes to pass the Senate. Far more likely would be the kind of simple majority budget reconciliation vote that allowed ObamaCare to pass in the first place. This would likely be a partial repeal, with the most unpopular pieces such as the Mandates and the Independent Medicare Advisory Board stripped away, and more popular pieces of the plan, such as the ability to stay on your parents' policy until the age of 26, retained. But assuming that the candidates have their way, how would health care change in the U.S. with a Clinton versus a Trump presidency? Clinton would attempt to increase government control with increased cost to the taxpayer and expanded entitlements while Trump would work to privatize, with more out-of-pocket payments with tax incentives (HSAs) and increased competition. If elected president, Clinton wants to lower out of pocket copays and deductibles and limit out-of-pocket drug costs for families. She would increase coverage to include the first three sick visits per year without a deductible or co-pay. She proposes having the federal government provide up to $5,000 per family for out of pocket health costs. She would add a public option as an alternative to buying private insurance on the state exchanges. She suggests increasing transparency with all aspects of information sharing including the exchanges. All these changes involve more government involvement and increased cost to the taxpayer. Clinton would hope to make Medicare available for purchase for all those over 50. She proposes extending the Medicaid expansion from 32 to all 50 states. The face of the health care system is changing. There is a growing doctors' shortage and more Nurse Practitioners and Physicians Assistants are being added to compensate. Patients are faced with high deductibles, skyrocketing premiums, and limited choices. Cutting down on co-pays and deductibles -- as Clinton suggests -- is a worthy goal that would make it easier for patients to utilize their insurance when they are sick. But these expensive reforms won't make people healthier. Whereas improving your diet, exercising more and losing weight as Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine advocates, could decrease overutilization of health care services. Donald Trump hopes to drive down premiums by introducing competition across state lines (portability). A key feature of his plan is to make all health insurance premiums tax deductible. He would cap the employer tax exclusion for health care while expanding employer sponsored wellness programs. Like Clinton, Trump favors greater transparency for doctors and hospitals on pricing. Portability of health insurance and price transparency should introduce more competition and drive down prices. Currently a common procedure like a Cardiac Echo or CT scan can cost several times more at one facility than another. Trump wants to maintain Medicare as it is, though he is under pressure from Speaker Ryan and the GOP to privatize Medicare. When it comes to Medicaid, Trump favors block grants to the states. This relies on the principle that states know the needs of their citizens best. This is already working in Ohio, where Governor Kasich has turned Medicaid into a money-saving program which encourages efficiency and teamwork. In terms of prescription drugs, both Trump and Clinton favor introducing more competition by allowing overseas drug companies to compete with our companies and allowing Medicare to negotiate prices. Perhaps the signature proposal of Trump's plan is his expansion of tax deductible Health Savings Accounts which allow you to pay out of pocket for your health expenses. Trump would structure these plans to accumulate year to year. He proposes permitting HSA use by other members of your family as well as making them part of the patient's estate that transfers after death. He would encourage young people to choose high deductible insurance plans but use their HSA's for common problems. In Indiana, Trumps running mate Governor Mike Pense has already utilized mandatory contributions to HSAs to incentivize the Medicaid expansion. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have innovative ideas on health care, but Trump's ideas could save more money. Keep in mind that Americans spend less out of pocket for their health care than almost any other country in the industrialized world. Clinton's proposals would worsen that dichotomy whereas Trump's expanded HSA's would help reverse it. When patients take more responsibility for their health and are more aware of the costs because they have to pay directly, smarter less wasteful decisions are made. ObamaCare creates a large government/insurance interface that shields costs from consumers.",

            "article_content": "Hillary has made no public remarks despite being cleared in the server investigation; Jennifer Griffin explains on 'Special Report' Hillary Clinton on Saturday proposed increasing federal money for community health centers and outlined steps to expand access to health care across the nation. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, made the proposal as a nod to primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, at the Democratic National Convention's full Platform Committee meeting in Orlando, Fla. However, Sanders, who has yet to endorse Clinton, failed in his quest to include opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in a draft of the Democratic Party's policy positions because several amendments against the deal were voted down by Clinton supporters. The platform will be announced at the party's nominating convention in Philadelphia starting July 25. On health care, Clinton's campaign says the proposal is part of her plan to provide universal health care coverage in the United States. Clinton also is reaffirming her support for a public-option insurance plan and for expanding Medicare by letting people age 55 year and older opt in. \"We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\" Clinton said in a statement, with the convention just a few weeks away. Clinton's campaign noted that Sanders had promoted doubling money for primary care services at federally qualified health centers. Money for these centers was increased under the Affordable Care Act, an effort led by the Vermont senator. According to the Clinton campaign, the candidate\u2019s proposal would make money for these centers permanent and expand it by $40 billion over the next 10 years. Her campaign said the money would be mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation. The proposal would more than double the money for the centers, which currently get $3.6 billion annually. Sanders, in a conference call after the Clinton campaign's announcement, said her proposal \"will save lives\" and \"ease suffering\" and represented \"an important step forward in expanding health care in America and expanding health insurance and health care access to tens of millions of Americans.\" The health care proposal follows on Clinton's recent announcement of new ways to tackle college affordability, including a plan that ensures families with annual incomes up to $125,000 pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities. That initiative also was seen as a response to Sanders' call for free tuition at all public colleges and universities, an idea popular with the young voters who flocked to his rallies. Clinton's policy overtures come as Sanders appears to be close to supporting her candidacy. Two Democrats with knowledge of Sanders' plans told The Associated Press that Sanders was closing in on offering his public endorsement of Clinton. The Democrats spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations they were not authorized to disclose. Clinton's campaign has announced a stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday but did not say whether Sanders also would attend. Sanders told reporters that the two campaigns \"are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing this country.\" Clinton and Sanders frequently clashed over health care during the primaries. Sanders campaigned on a \"Medicare for all\" plan that would have provided universal coverage. Clinton said that would undercut President Barack Obama's health law, rely too heavily on GOP governors and reopen a contentious debate with Republicans in Congress. Clinton's health care priorities have centered on capping out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and providing tax credits for families facing high medical costs. She has reiterated her support for a \"public option\" for states to set up their own health insurance plan to compete against private insurers. Sanders was instrumental in passing legislation that would allow that. Both supported a public insurance option at the national level but opposition from moderate Democrats prevented that proposal from being included in the health overhaul law. Sanders scored a major victory Friday when the committee approved \u00a0an amendment calling for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The self-described \"democratic socialist\" had repeatedly called for the increase during his surprisingly strong campaign for the Democratic nomination. Clinton, had backed a $12 minimum wage, while saying she approved a $15 minimum wage in certain places. An early draft of the platform contained language more consistent with Clinton\u2019s position, saying that \u201cAmericans should earn at least $15 an hour\u201d without explicitly calling for that to be the new federal minimum. However, the 187-member committee approved an amendment saying an increase from the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour to $15 should happen \u201cover time.\" On the trade deal, during a combative meeting in a hotel ballroom, members of \u00a0full Platform Committee voted down amendments to explicitly oppose the deal and to oppose a vote on it in Congress. Instead, they endorsed an amendment that included stronger language governing trade deals, including the TPP. Sanders and Clinton have come out against the trade deal, but President Obama supports it. Clinton supporters, including labor leaders, believed that toughening the trade language made enough of a statement without directly opposing the president, whom they did not mention during their public comments. The amendment said that trade deals \"must protect workers and the environment and not undermine access to critically needed prescription drugs.\" It went on to say that Democrats would apply those standards \"to all trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\" Labor leaders said after the vote that their amendment made clear where they stand on TPP and that they oppose \"bad trade deals.\" But Sanders backers expressed their frustration with boos and angry shouts. Sanders supporter Benjamin Jealous, a former president of the NAACP argued that language opposing the TPP would help Democrats win the presidential election in November. \"I want us to stop making it harder for us to win and start making it easier for us to win,\" he said. Since Clinton effectively clinched the presidential nomination, Sanders has aggressively campaigned to include his progressive policies in the party platform. He has won a number of concessions, including a win Friday with an amendment calling for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 over time, indexed to inflation. The previous platform draft had not included explicit language on a $15 federal minimum wage. The party guidelines also have language endorsing steps to break up large Wall Street banks and urging an end to the death penalty. But Sanders is looking for more before the meeting concludes. He wants the platform to support a carbon tax to address climate change and seek a freeze on hydraulic fracking. The roughly 15,000-word platform is a nonbinding document that serves as a guidepost for the party. After the Orlando meeting, the document will be voted on at the convention in Philadelphia this month. The Orlando meeting is not the final stop for the Sanders' efforts. He could seek to revive some of these issues at the convention. Sanders has so far avoided endorsing Clinton, but appears to be closing in on backing her campaign. He told reporters Saturday that the campaigns are \"coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing this country.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The orders' decision reflects a trend that has left the church in America with more nuns over age 90 than under age 60.  (AP Photo/Jim Fitzgerald) (The Associated Press) NEW YORK \u2013 For 98-year-old Sister Angela Rooney, it was one of the most jarring moves of her life. She always thought she would live out her days as she had for decades, in a convent under the time-honored Roman Catholic tradition of younger nuns dutifully caring for their older sisters. But with few young women choosing religious life, her church superiors were forced to look elsewhere for care, and in the past year have sent Rooney and dozens of other nuns to Jewish Home Lifecare, a geriatric-care complex in the Bronx founded as a nursing home for elderly Jews. \"I wanted my convent, my great big chapel, my Stations of the Cross,\" Rooney said. \"The very name 'Jewish Home' turned me off. ... I don't think anyone came here with a heavier heart than me.\" Rooney and 57 other sisters, ages 73 to 98, have since adjusted nicely to their new accommodations and neighbors, becoming an active part of classes and continuing their ministry with good deeds like holding the hands of dying patients on the hospice floor. \"This is home now,\" said 83-year-old Sister Grace Henke. \"When we first came, we were fish out of water.\" It's an unusual situation that reflects a reality of the nation's Catholic nuns in the 21st century: Fewer young women are devoting their lives to religious orders, and those who are already nuns are aging and facing escalating health care needs. There are now more sisters over age 90 than under age 60, said Mary Gautier, a researcher at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University. The center's 2009 study found that 80 percent of the nuns in the country were over 60. \"Their model of caring for their older sisters is no longer sustainable,\" said Robin Eggert, president of the Realm consulting group, which has worked with several nuns' orders to find solutions. Eggert said a number of women's religious orders have partnered with outside organizations offering skilled nursing, assisted living and other levels of care, but \"We've never done Jewish before.\" The Sisters of Charity of New York has seen its numbers decline from a 1960s peak of 1,350 to 270 today, and no new sisters had joined in the U.S. in 20 years. It was the first order to put out a request for proposals that was answered by the nonprofit Jewish Home Lifecare. Two other orders based in Manhattan, the Franciscan Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary and the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, followed. Several of the nuns now living at Jewish Home, including retired teachers, social workers and nurses, said they were very happy after some original hesitation. \"We've almost all, 95 percent, accepted and acclimated. Those who were resistant have kind of calmed down,\" said 92-year-old Sister Rosemarie Bittermann. \"It certainly fit our needs,\" said Sister Loretta Theresa Richards, 86. \"We can stay together, we have our own little chapel. They went out of their way to find a space for us to have Mass. I have to say it was so nice I was a little reluctant, because I took a vow of poverty.\" Some things are different, however. While Jewish Home Lifecare is now nondenominational \u2014 most residents are Christian \u2014 its Jewish heritage remains apparent, with a resident rabbi and kosher-style meals in the independent living residences. \"I miss the bacon,\" Richards said. Added Sister Maria Goretti Mannix, 83: \"I notice that we never get ham or pork chops. The food is good, though.\" The nuns' care is funded through a combination of Medicaid, Medicare, the New York archdiocesan health plan, payments from the order itself and the individual sisters' scant assets. While the nuns were allowed to room near one another \u2014 most are on the same floor as several colleagues \u2014 they were also encouraged to join the home's open-to-all activities. \"I saw a sign for 'Play Reading,'\" said Sister Connie Brennan, 78. \"The first week I just listened. The second week I had a part. I think I might be a murderer.\" Regina Melly, a senior vice president at Jewish Home Lifecare, said the sisters have greatly benefited the Bronx campus. \"This has succeeded more that we could have imagined,\" she said. \"From the beginning, they talked about continuing their ministry here, and they've touched the other residents and staff from the day they arrived. You'll see, in the dining room, they don't sit all together, they sit with the other residents. The people here love them.\" Nuns have been learning Spanish, teaching English and packing medical packages for overseas. Eggert said the sisters, \"since they feel they are one big family,\" have been especially attentive to residents who don't get regular visits from relatives. As the oldest nun to make the move, the once-skeptical Rooney said she has, in a sense, been \"converted\" by the kind welcome the nuns received. \"Now I go to the Jewish services as well as the Mass.\" ___ Associated Press Religion Writer Rachel Zoll contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) It's been a rocky road of late for biotech company Theranos and its beleaguered founder, Elizabeth Holmes, and a new major roadblock has now emerged, the Wall Street Journal and AP report. Per a press release issued Thursday evening, the company announced it received a notice from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and it wasn't good news: In response to a 2015 review of Theranos' lab in Newark, Calif., sanctions have been issued, including an undisclosed financial penalty, no more Medicare or Medicaid payments for lab services, and revocation of regulatory approval\u2014which includes a ban on Holmes \"owning, operating, or directing a lab\" for at least two years. \"We accept full responsibility for the issues at our laboratory in Newark,\" Holmes says in the release, noting Theranos has already started \"comprehensive remedial actions,\" including \"rebuilding the Newark lab from the ground up.\" Holmes adds the company is \"disappointed\" by the feds' decision but is \"committed to fully resolving all outstanding issues.\" The revocation won't take place for another 60 days, but the Newark lab won't be doing patient testing during that period; its Arizona lab, however, will still be open for business. The Journal notes the sanctions could be put off if Theranos appeals the CMS decision, though it adds that such appeals have rarely been won. (This just weeks after Theranos got dumped by Walgreens.)

SHOVEL READY: TEAM OBAMA SEES ISLAMIST THREAT AS JOBS PROBLEMToday is the start of the White House conference on \u201cviolent extremism,\u201d which is the administration\u2019s preferred euphemism for Islamist terrorism and militancy. The point is to gather government officials from around the world to discuss strategies for dealing with extremists of every kind. The actual purpose is to show that the president is doing something about a war effort Americans are deeply dubious about . One of the spokeswomen for the State Department certainly set the tone for the big to-do in an interview with MSNBC. And Marie Harf certainly had a doozy of a Kinsley gaffe. She explained to an exasperated Chris Matthews that it wasn\u2019t about winning military conflict with ISIS or other Islamist militants, but rather dealing with \u201croot causes.\u201d She offered this to Matthews demand for a more robust offensive: \u201c\u2026we cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.\u201d So what is the way to victory? \u201cWe need, in the longer term, medium and longer term, to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it\u2019s lack of opportunity for jobs...\u201d Ah. [WashEx: \u201cAccording to a\u00a0Brookings Institution\u00a0survey of American Political Science Association scholars, they put Obama on the worst, not best, list by a margin of nearly three-to-one.\u201d]\u2018And his momma cried\u2026\u2019 - \u201cGood jobs for good wages\u201d sounds like an increasingly far-fetched campaign slogan in several parts of America as salary stagnation remains upon us. But if you think selling it Nashua, N.H. is tough, try Yemen. When people are eating grass and dirt, long-term economic recovery would sound just plain silly. When they\u2019re eating grass with murderous Islamists pointing Kalashnikovs at them, it would sound downright cruel. But that\u2019s what Harf said. She argued that the U.S. should work to end to the poverty that \u201cmakes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47\u201d instead of \u201ctrying to start a business.\u201d In this version, a budding entrepreneur is trapped in a hopeless society and eventually turns to \u201cviolent extremism\u201d [wink, wink] in frustration. It is like Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cIn the Ghetto\u201d but for global Jihad. This doesn\u2019t quite explain why certain poor people are peaceful while others seem to be increasingly falling prey to \u201cviolent extremism\u201d [nudge, nudge] but it\u2019s not an insane point of view\u2026 for an Elvis song, or Methodists missionaries or the International Monetary Fund. For the government that is charged with protecting America, however, this is some wild stuff.[WaPo: \u201cShiite militias backed by Iran are increasingly taking the lead in Iraq\u2019s fight against the Islamic State, threatening to undermine U.S. strategies intended to bolster the central government, rebuild the Iraqi army and promote reconciliation with the country\u2019s embittered Sunni minority.\u201d]More vox, less populi - Leave aside the issue of whether Islamist militants are actually primary causes of much of the economic suffering of these nations. The real deal here is how long such a strategy might take given the nature of the economic disadvantage in the countries where Islamists are running riot. We\u2019re talking decades or centuries. That\u2019s a pretty stunning lack of urgency. But it seems to be in keeping with the president\u2019s recently outlined position that Americans\u2019 worries about Islamists are a media-driven distraction from other issues. The real things are global warming and sustainable agriculture, you see. Beheading people or shooting up a magazine office is just a symptom\u2026 As it becomes clearer that this really is the administration\u2019s view the president and his party (and its presumptive nominee) will pay a heavy political price.BAIER TRACKS: COURT SHAKES UP AMNESTY FIGHT ON HILL\u2026\u201cAs is so often the case, states lead the way. A lawsuit filed by 26 states against President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, took a big step forward. On Monday, a federal judge blocked the president\u2019s actions granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen\u2019s decision puts a freeze on the president\u2019s plan, the first phase of which was supposed to begin Wednesday. While the administration will no doubt appeal the ruling, this decision could provide a legislative opening for the Homeland Security funding bill that is stalled in the Senate. The bill is being blocked by Democrats and would also be certainly vetoed by the President should it pass. So what is the way out of the standoff? \u00a0The Republican argument may be to ask how they could fund anything that has been blocked by the courts and go full steam ahead on offense. Or, Republicans may be so encouraged about the chance for legal remedy that the looming showdown is drained of some of its urgency and move toward compromise. We\u2019ll see what they choose.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.Pump it up - The Hill: \u201cThe Obama administration is ratcheting up pressure on Republicans to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which faces a shutdown without action by Congress after Feb. 27.\u00a0Congress appears stuck on the issue because the House is insisting that the funding bill also overturn President Obama's executive actions on immigration that have provided legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants\u2026Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and other agency officials are also expected to press the case over the coming days, with one senior official there calling the push for full funding a \u2018huge priority for this department.\u2019 Johnson is trying to convince Republicans to bend. The department says Johnson has already visited with at least 20 lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the funding situation, and placed more than a dozen phone calls to members.\u201dOBAMACARE DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR SOMEThe Hill: \u201cThe Obama administration is giving some customers an extra week to buy health insurance if they have faced long wait times or other issues when trying to submit applications over the final sign-up weekend. Customers who experienced difficulties with ObamaCare signups will have until Sunday to buy coverage, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] announced in a statement one day after the official enrollment period ended.\u201d [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on ObamaCare.]WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...While the celebrations of Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Carnival in Brazil get all the attention, today is significant for Christians all over the world as the last day before the start of Lent, a season of somber reflection before the faith\u2019s highest holiday, Easter. But for many, the feasting and revelry done with abandon on Bourbon Street or in Rio is replaced by the humble pancake. The English-born tradition of a modest feast on Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word \u201cshrive,\u201d meaning to present oneself for penance or confession) has become synonymous with pancake suppers, which once sounded like a pretty tame as an indulgence by American standards. But given current dietary attitudes about sugar, gluten and fat, pancakes have returned to a position of decadence. So this brings us to a key question of doctrine: Thick or thin? While there are many devotees of flapjacks as thick as a pillow, making those is as simple as following the directions on a store-bought box. But if you want to go thin to win, here\u2019s how: Mix two teaspoons of sugar very thoroughly into two eggs. Then stir in 3 cups of milk and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Then gently add just one-and-a-quarter cups of white flour until the batter is combined but not perfectly smooth. Let the batter stand for 15 minutes. Then heat up your best cast-iron skillet to medium-high and slide in a pat of butter. Pour a ladleful of batter into the foamy butter and cook for a couple of minutes until nicely browned. Flip it over and even up the other side for about a minute. Serve hot with butter and either jelly or powdered sugar and lemon. A few plates of those will keep you feeling penitent for at least 40 days! Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Chris Christie gave the first glimpse of what he'd do if Americans elected him to the White House while speaking to New Hampshire Republicans in the presidential battleground state tonight. \u2018Within the first 100 days, if I were to run for president and be elected, we would change this tax system in this country so that people and companies aren't leaving the country anymore,\u2019 Christie said during a brief question and answer session with audience members at the Concord and Merrimack County GOP Annual Lincoln Reagan Day Dinner. \u2018Secondly, we would pass a national energy policy, and one that takes full advantage of all of the resources that we have available to us to help grow our economy and make the world a more peaceful and stable place,\u2019 he said. \u2018And the third thing is ... is to reestablish American leadership around the world.\u2019\u201dGlad I caught you - David Drucker is keeping track of which Republican lawmakers\u2019 phones are ringing with calls from GOP Sixteeners in pursuit of a well-timed endorsement.

He\u2019s the one to watch this Presidential cycle.\u201d--Ian Tan, Perth, Australia \u201cMy overwhelming choice though has to be Rick Perry who ran the second largest state for FOURTEEN years with balanced budgets, and left Billions of Dollars in a \u2018Rainy Day Fund.\u2019 During Obama's reign - Perry has helped Texas create one-third of ALL the jobs created in the U.S.\u00a0That's the leadership we need.\u201d--Doug Mathes, Houston, Texas. \u201cIn a state brimming with potential 2016 Presidential candidates, the voters are talking about [Scott Walker].\u00a0 Not Rand Paul whose father hails from Texas as does Jeb Bush and of course our former outstanding Governor Rick Perry and our rock star Senator Ted Cruz.

The toughened ex-senators. These are the blue-chip recruits many Democrats believe are essential to winning back control of the U.S. Senate in 2016 after a midterm drubbing cost them their majority. Less than four months after the painful losses, Democratic officials have begun charting a path back to Senate control that runs through more than half a dozen blue and purple states where the presidential campaign is expected to boost Democratic turnout. But even in that favorable terrain, the party faithful fear they could fall short if marquee challengers don\u2019t step forward, since their talent pool is shallow and they are trying to unseat a well-prepared group of Republican senators.\u201dSHHHHHH\u2026.If you are longing for some peace and quiet, the American Association for the Advancement of Science has the spots for you. In their latest research, scientists have mapped the noise levels across the country on an average summer day. Using acoustic data fed into a computer algorithm researchers modeled gradations in audio levels including variables such as air and street traffic. The deepest blues predominantly occurred in the western portions of the country including Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and the Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. These areas had levels under 20 decibels similar levels as prior to European colonization, significantly lower than most cities which averaged 50 to 60 decibels. The National Park Service will put the research to use identifying where human noise affects that are considerably more sensitive than human ears and impacts the animals\u2019 abilities to hunt small insects and rodents.AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201c[T]he ideology of ISIS is clearly supremacist in the sense that anybody who is not Islamic in their understanding is to be either enslaved or eradicated in a genocidal movement.

He said he has plenty of time to decide. \u2018I haven\u2019t made up my mind on that. I have plenty of time to do that, in my view,\u2019 Biden said. \u2018If I am wrong, I\u2019m dead wrong, but there\u2019s a lot the president and I care about that has to get done in the next two, three months and when you run for president you\u2019ve got to run for president \u2014 and I\u2019m not ready to do that \u2014 if I am ever going to be ready to do that.\u2019\u201d [The vice president speaks at a symposium for University of Notre Dame students in Washington, D.C. today.] \u201cIt\u2019s a little early for endorsements since [Hillary Clinton] just announced yesterday.

She will participate in a small roundtable discussion focused on education.]Ad hits Hillary on trust - America Rising is out with a new ad today that rakes through Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record on Benghazi, Syria and Russia and domestic scandals past and present. The ad, called \u201cTrustworthy?\u201d concludes with a narrator voiceover saying, \u201cLess than half say Mrs. Clinton is honest and trustworthy\u201d and Clinton is heard saying, \u201cI think I\u2019m probably the most transparent person in public life.\u201dEd Henry wants to know: When does Hillary meet the press? - \u201cMonticello, IOWA -- Will Hillary Clinton start taking any actual questions from reporters \u2013 as well as voters \u2013 today? So far Clinton\u2019s nascent presidential campaign has only been serving up tiny morsels about her road trip to this tiny hamlet in the eastern portion of the Hawkeye State.\u00a0\u2026 So we have learned that when she stopped in Pittsburgh Sunday night, Clinton ordered room service and -- as luck would have it -- the menu had a section labeled Scooby snacks. (Perhaps a hotel worker with a silly sense of humor). Then of course there was Monday\u2019s stop at a Chipotle south of Toledo. Again, we learned she had a chicken burrito bowl (with black beans and some guac). But the odd photo of surveillance video showing the candidate behind dark sunglasses showed no actual interaction with voters. \u2026 The van finally made it to an undisclosed location here in Iowa on Tuesday, yet still no sign of an interview or press availability. Remember just yesterday Marco Rubio entered and did his tour of Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos and NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep.\u00a0\u2026 Nobody has been able to say the same to Clinton since she has not yet strapped on a helmet for an interview. Her aides say they will come later, for now she will focus on voters with her first event today with students and educators at a community college. For now, the press corps is getting tiny morsels about her snacks. But we are getting a little, well, hungry.\u201d \u2013 Ed Henry.

Senate leaders are expected to enforce limited debate on the amendments, creating the high bar of 60 votes for passage, according to a lobbyist familiar with the talks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to amend this bill to death; we want three simple amendments,\u201d Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday from the Senate floor. Reid did not specify what proposals the amendments would contain. But two people familiar with the talks, including a Senate Democratic aide, said Democrats want a four-year extension of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, the removal of abortion-related language known as the Hyde Amendment and a repeal of the Medicare therapy cap.\u201d [Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel reports live from Capitol Hill]As tax day nears, Congress tells IRS to \u2018stand down\u2019 - The Hill: \u201cSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) warned the IRS on Monday to stand down from any efforts to broaden out new rules governing social welfare groups. Two days ahead of Tax Day, Hatch told the IRS commissioner, John Koskinen, that any such move would undercut the agency\u2019s efforts to regain the taxpayers\u2019 trust. Koskinen took over the agency after the IRS acknowledged singling out Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status, a controversy that still rages almost two years later and caused many senior IRS officials to lose their jobs.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026It was 150 years ago today, in a moment that would come to be seen as a tragedy for North and South, John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, entered President Abraham Lincoln box in Ford\u2019s Theater and killed the president with a single shot to the head.

[Scott Walker] continues to send strong signals that he\u2019ll run for president, but his announcement may not come for several months. The governor found himself getting a lot of attention early, following a speech he delivered to a conservative gathering in Iowa. Since then, several Republicans have entered the 2016 race, but not Walker. John Rink is a political science professor at UW-Platteville. He says the governor does not want to be overshadowed by other announcements. Rink thinks it would be a smart move for the governor to announce this summer. The professor says by that time, many of the serious candidates will have declared and Walker would have the spotlight to himself...The delay would also allow Walker to get his ducks in a row, according to UW-Stevens Point Political Science Professor Dennis Riley.\u201dHuckabee on immigration: Nobody will \u2018play by the rules\u2019 - Daily Caller: \u201cFormer Arkansas Gov.

            "article_content": "Every week, Fox News contributor Karl Rove wraps up the last week in politics and offers an inside look at the week ahead. \u201cEvents, dear boy, events\u201d: When asked what he feared most as his nation\u2019s leader more than half a century ago, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan reputedly replied, \u201cEvents, dear boy, events.\u201d Last week, America\u2019s leaders \u2013 and presidential candidates \u2013 had to deal with important events. Two black men \u2013 one in a Baton Rouge, La., convenience store parking lot and another in a car in a suburb of St. Paul, Minn. \u2013 were shot dead by police officers. Then a black racist responded by ambushing 12 white police officers in Dallas, killing five. Events have intruded into the presidential campaign, and these issues \u2013 cop shootings and violence against police \u2013 will remain front and center for the foreseeable future. With more attacks on police over the weekend in Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and Texas and additional protests against police shootings across the country, many Americans are deeply concerned that the country is coming apart. This sentiment will not go away easily. How Did They Do? Both candidates did well, especially Donald Trump, whose statement was posted on Facebook and picked up by the networks and cables. He strongly defended the police, while calling the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile \u201csenseless\u201d and saying \u201cracial divisions have gotten worse.\u201d Though Hillary Clinton appeared at a conference of black religious leaders to urge national guidelines for use of force by police, both candidates canceled campaign rallies on Friday, with Clinton postponing one with Vice President Joe Biden. As Judiciary Committee chairman, Biden steered through the 1994 crime bill that some black activists condemn as having caused too many young black men to be incarcerated. People are not looking for a politician or office-seeker in these terrible events. They are searching for their next president, a person who will help heal the country. These issues will remain part of America\u2019s public dialogue, and both candidates have strengths in dealing with them. Trump is viewed as a strong leader and comes across as a true supporter of law enforcement. Clinton has adopted a more unifying tone in her campaign and, driven by a desire to maximize black turnout, strives to be more emphatic with the African-American community. Ironically, the candidate who deals with these issues in a more apolitical way \u2013 projecting strength and unity, finding a positive voice to call the country together, defending the vital role of the police and the rule of law while demonstrating a concern with justice for those wrongly killed \u2013 is the candidate who will most likely benefit. People are not looking for a politician or office-seeker in these terrible events. They are searching for their next president, a person who will help heal the country. Guilty, but unindicted: Last week started with FBI Director James Comey finding Clinton guilty of setting up an unauthorized private email server, being \u201cextremely reckless\u201d in handling classified material and making false statements to the American people about why she did it, whether she sent or received classified material and if she handed over all her official emails. Then he refused to indict. This issue is not going away. How did they handle the email controversy? Clinton and her surrogates said the fact that she escaped indictment meant this issue is now old news. But she\u2019s been found guilty in the court of public opinion as dishonest and untrustworthy; everything she said about her private server turned out to be a lie. And the \u201cchance\u201d meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the report in the New York Times that Clinton might keep Lynch as A.G. added to the perception that there\u2019s one set of rules for the Clintons and one for everyone else. Surprisingly, in his first rally after Comey\u2019s announcement, Trump spent most of his Cincinnati speech on Wednesday defending his campaign\u2019s use of a Star of David in a weekend tweet. Trump\u2019s failure to dwell on Clinton\u2019s email scandal meant the headlines were all about the Star of David, not the case against Hillary. He\u2019s got plenty of time to return to the issue, but Trump missed a big opportunity. Simply screaming \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d at rallies won\u2019t make this controversy the important part of the decisions of swing voters it should be. Leftward, Ho! Hillary continued her long march to the democratic socialist fringe of the Democratic Party last week, seeking to appease Bernie Sanders\u2019 followers by endorsing free college for anyone whose family income is less than $125,000 (as long as the kid goes to a public university). She then came out for the \u201cgovernment option\u201d in health care, meaning a single-payer socialist system like in most of Europe, allowing people 55 or older to enroll in Medicare (whose hospital trust fund is already going bankrupt in 2030) and other platform planks backed by the Sandernistas. Her allies and President Obama\u2019s people rebuffed the Berniacs when they proposed a plank that explicitly opposed a vote on Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership in the lame duck congressional session after the election. Coming Attractions: Sanders will endorse Clinton this week, but will that mean the end to further challenges to the Democratic Party\u2019s rules or any additional platform fights? I doubt it. The Republican rules and platform committees meet this week in Cleveland. Are there likely to be fights? Maybe some scrambling about the rules, but with little consequence for this year\u2019s convention. Watch the resolutions committee meetings, however. There could be significant struggles about the platform, some of it driven by principled disagreements, some of it jockeying for the future. Veep: This is the week Trump must decide on his running mate and maybe announce him or her, though he could hold the news until the convention. The running mate has little effect on the election\u2019s outcome (unless the pick is seen as a big mistake), but the choice and the decision-making process contribute to the impression voters develop about the nominee\u2019s leadership abilities. Most insiders had Newt Gingrich at the front of Trump\u2019s list until recent days, when former Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Michael Flynn emerged as a serious contender. Like Trump, Flynn is a political novice and outsider. Another possibility is Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a former House Republican leader who is now a Midwest governor with a reputation as a conservative and outsider.

            "article_content": "Major health insurer backs off Affordable Care Act expansion plan; fallout explained on 'America's Newsroom' Aetna\u00a0became the latest health insurer to cast doubt upon its future in the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges after it called off a planned expansion Tuesday and suggested it could abandon that market completely. A departure by\u00a0Aetna, the nations' third-largest insurer, could further reduce the number of choices for customers and eventually push insurance prices higher. Competition by insurers is a key feature of the exchanges, designed to keep a lid on prices, but several insurers are abandoning them because they are losing enormous amounts of money. Aetna\u00a0said Thursday it has been swamped with higher than expected costs, particularly from pricey specialty drugs, and it will take a hard look at its current presence on exchanges in 15 states. When asked by The Associated Press whether that meant the insurer might leave the exchanges entirely or just some markets in 2017, CEO Mark Bertolini said: \"All of the above.\" Major insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. have already said they are scaling back their exchange participation in 2017, and several smaller, nonprofit insurance cooperatives are winding down business after losing millions. The exchanges have helped millions of people gain health coverage, many with assistance from income-based tax credits. But insurers say this relatively small slice of their business has led to large losses because claims have been higher than expected and they are getting less government help than they thought, among other issues. Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer Anthem Inc. recently reported a surprising loss from its exchange business. Aetna\u00a0said Tuesday it now expects to lose $300 million this year from individual coverage it sells on the exchanges, or triple what it lost last year. Earlier this year,\u00a0Aetna\u00a0had said it hoped to break even in 2016. The insurer covers about 838,000 people and got hit with higher pharmaceutical costs than it expected. Bertolini told analysts Tuesday that a federal risk adjustment program designed to assist insurers that take on high-cost patients hasn't helped with this expense. \"These people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it, but it's really about how the system works,\" he said. Despite the losses and concerns voiced by insurers, federal regulators remain hopeful about the public exchanges. Consumers \"will continue to have a robust set of choices\" when they return to the exchanges to shop for 2017 coverage, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Marjorie Connolly said in an email. She said insurers are adjusting to the exchanges and regulators are working to strengthen them, and she expects that they will \"continue to thrive for years ahead as a place where insurers compete for business and consumers have access to a range of affordable coverage options.\" Aetna's\u00a0exchange problems didn't prevent it from topping second-quarter earnings expectations. The Hartford, Connecticut, insurer said Tuesday that its profit grew 9 percent to $790.8 million. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, amounted to $2.21 per share. Analysts expected earnings of $2.11 per share on average, according to Zacks Investment Research. Aetna\u00a0also posted better-than-expected operating revenue of about $15.9 billion in the period. The insurer also said Tuesday that it plans to sell part of its Medicare Advantage business in an effort to preserve its $34-billion acquisition of Humana. The Department of Justice sued late last month to stop that deal and Anthem Inc.'s $48-billion acquisition of Cigna Corp. mainly due to concerns about their impact on competition. Both Anthem and\u00a0Aetna\u00a0have vowed to contest the government lawsuits in court.\u00a0Aetna\u00a0and Humana have agreed to sell some of their Medicare Advantage business to another insurer, Molina Healthcare Inc., for around $117 million. Medicare Advantage plans are privately run versions of the government's Medicare program for the elderly. The insurers say this deal should help alleviate regulator concerns that an Aetna-Humana combination would stifle competition in too many Medicare Advantage markets. Aetna\u00a0shares climbed $1.30 to $115.75 in midday trading Tuesday, while broader indexes slipped.",

            "article_content": "In this photo taken Sept. 24, 2013, just cut stacks of $100 bills make their way down the line at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health care tab is expected to surpass $10,000 per person for the first time this year, the government said Wednesday. The new peak suggests the Obama administration will pass the problem of high health care costs on to its successor. (AP Photo/LM Otero) (AP2013) The nation's\u00a0health\u00a0care tab this year is expected to surpass $10,000 per person for the first time, the government said Wednesday. The new peak means the Obama administration will pass the problem of high\u00a0health\u00a0care costs on to its successor. The report from number crunchers at the Department of\u00a0Health\u00a0and Human Services projects that\u00a0health\u00a0care spending will grow at a faster rate than the national economy over the coming decade. That squeezes the ability of federal and state governments, not to mention employers and average citizens, to pay. Growth is projected to average 5.8 percent from 2015 to 2025, below the pace before the 2007-2009 economic recession but faster than in recent years that saw\u00a0health\u00a0care spending moving in step with modest economic growth. National\u00a0health\u00a0expenditures will hit $3.35 trillion this year, which works out to $10,345 for every man, woman and child. The annual increase of 4.8 percent for 2016 is lower than the forecast for the rest of the decade. A stronger economy, faster growth in medical prices and an aging population are driving the trend. Medicare and Medicaid are expected to grow more rapidly than private insurance as the baby-boom generation ages. By 2025, government at all levels will account for nearly half of\u00a0health\u00a0care spending, 47 percent. The report also projects that the share of Americans with\u00a0health\u00a0insurance will remain above 90 percent, assuming that President Barack Obama's law survives continued Republican attacks. The analysis serves as a reality check for the major political parties as they prepare for their presidential conventions. Usually in a national election there are sweeping differences between Democrats and Republicans on\u00a0health\u00a0care, one of the chief contributors to the government's budget problems. But this time the discussion has been narrowly focused on the fate of Obama's law and little else. Republican Donald Trump vows to repeal \"Obamacare,\" while saying he won't cut Medicare or have people \"dying in the street.\" Democrat Hillary Clinton has promised to expand government\u00a0health\u00a0care benefits. Both candidates would authorize Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which the report says will grow somewhat more slowly after recent sharp increases. Obama's\u00a0health\u00a0care law attempted to control costs by reducing Medicare payments to hospitals and insurers, as well as encouraging doctors to use teamwork to keep patients healthier. But it also increased costs by expanding coverage to millions who previously lacked it. People with\u00a0health\u00a0insurance use more medical care than the uninsured. Despite much effort and some progress reining in costs,\u00a0health\u00a0care spending is still growing faster than the economy and squeezing out other priorities, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group that advocates for reducing government red ink. \"No serious candidate for president can demonstrate fiscal leadership without having a plan to help address these costs,\" she said. \"No matter whether a candidate has an agenda that focuses on tax cuts or spending increases, there will be little room for either.\" The $10,345-per-person spending figure is an average; it doesn't mean that every individual spends that much in the\u00a0health\u00a0care system. In fact, U.S.\u00a0health\u00a0care spending is wildly uneven. About 5 percent of the population \u2014 those most frail or ill \u2014 accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to a separate government study. Meanwhile, half the population has little or no\u00a0health\u00a0care costs, accounting for 3 percent of spending. Of the total $3.35 trillion spending projected this year, hospital care accounts for the largest share, about 32 percent. Doctors and other clinicians account for nearly 20 percent. Prescription drugs bought through pharmacies account for about 10 percent. The report also projected that out-of-pocket cost paid directly by consumers will continue to increase as the number of people covered by high-deductible plans keeps growing. Wednesday's report was published online by the journal\u00a0Health\u00a0Affairs.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Rand Paul says victims' families have the right to their day in court Distribution of power is the essence of the U.S. Constitution. In fact, the Constitution does very little to pave the way for efficient government; rather, sparking conflict among the three branches in an effort to make power diffuse. Even in an atmosphere of constant conflict, however, a rare constitutional meteor shower is about to light up the skies. At issue is a white-hot bill approved by both bodies of Congress to permit families of 9/11 terrorism victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. President Obama wants to veto the measure. Both bodies of Congress are tentatively prepping to override Obama\u2019s veto. The founders entrusted the legislative branch with extensive powers. But writing in Federalist paper #73, Alexander Hamilton worried about restraining the legislature. Hamilton suggested that the executive branch might hesitate to contest the legislative branch. So Hamilton pushed for a presidential veto: a mechanism where the executive could overrule the legislature and hold it in check. \u201cVeto\u201d is Latin for \u201cI forbid.\u201d But, conflict is the quintessence of the U.S. Constitution. So Hamilton advocates something less than an absolute veto for the president. He suggests tipping the scales back in favor of the legislature \u2013 if both bodies of Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution dictates how a bill becomes a law. It states that both bodies of Congress must approve the package and requires the president\u2019s signature. Here\u2019s where the veto escape clause lies. If the president disagrees with the bill, \u201che shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated.\u201d Congress then has the option of attempting an override. Still, an override effort is not mandatory. If the president returns a bill to sender, he must issue his veto message within 10 days (excluding Sundays) of receiving the legislation. A bill becomes law without the president\u2019s signature if he doesn\u2019t veto the bill within the 10-day threshold. President George Washington first used his veto pen on April 5, 1792, on a measure dealing with congressional reapportionment. It would be another 53 years before Congress overrode a veto. Congress overrode a veto by President John Tyler on March 3, 1845, on a bill dealing with the construction of revenue-cutter ships. The override proved to be an ignominious punctuation point to Tyler\u2019s fluky presidency. Tyler\u2019s term expired the next day. Congress has never overridden one of Obama\u2019s vetoes. Lawmakers stumbled to override the president on bills dealing with the Keystone pipeline and repealing ObamaCare. Congress last successfully overrode a presidential veto in July, 2008. A Democratic House and Senate overrode the veto of President George W. Bush on a Medicare package. The veto and override apparatus sets up the ultimate conflict between the executive and legislative branches. The Constitution entrusts a lot of power to the people via the legislative branch. But with a veto override option, the Constitution returns the ultimate authority to the bodies representing the people -- if lawmakers muster a supermajority in both chambers. The Senate originated the 9/11 bill. So it was up to the Senate to send the measure to the White House. The Senate did so on Monday, Sept. 12. That set in motion the 10-day calendar (excluding this past Sunday) which requires Obama to veto the bill by 11:59:59 p.m. ET Friday, Sept. 23 or the bill becomes law regardless. It was thought the Senate could approve all of its work for the fall last week and skip town. That would have been the perfect scenario for the Obama administration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., itches to cut loose vulnerable GOP senators facing competitive re-election bids. Also, it was doubtful the president would veto the bill while he huddled with world leaders at the start of the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week. Many thought it was unlikely the Senate would reconvene prior to the election for an override vote. Moreover, punting the override vote until after the election inoculated lawmakers who may oppose the bill. Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution requires a recorded roll call tally to document how lawmakers vote on an override. So, postponing an override vote protects lawmakers from bad optics of \u201copposing 9/11 family victims.\u201d But Congress hasn\u2019t figured out a way to expeditiously finish its work to fund the government \u2013 this week, let alone last week. So Congress will meet at least through next week. And McConnell plans a veto override effort in the coming days. So expect the president to veto the bill Thursday or Friday and return the package to Capitol Hill alongside an exhaustive set of objections. Terrorism and foreign policy are emerging as a major theme for the GOP just six weeks before the election. There were this weekend\u2019s terror attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. The House is voting on multiple bills dealing with the so-called \u201cransom\u201d the U.S. paid to Iran to release hostages. Congressional Republicans might not be able to duplicate the efforts of lawmakers in 1845 when they handed President Tyler a veto on the day before he left office. But the GOP can sure saddle Obama with a big defeat on a national security issue just before an election with the first successful override of a veto.

            "article_content": "Trump plots big TV ad blitz When Donald Trump and his team were planning his presidential campaign, they drew up a budget of $25 million for television advertising in the third quarter of this year. They wound up spending zero for the rest of 2015. That is about to change. Sources in the Trump camp say they will soon launch a major ad blitz that could cost at least $2 million a week, and possibly several times that. The initial wave of ads will focus on Trump\u2019s vision and his stance on key issues\u2014no bio spots necessary for the celebrity candidate\u2014but that could change if any GOP rivals target him with negative commercials. \u201cIf you attack Trump, he will attack you 10 times as hard,\u201d an adviser says. \u201cWe will not allow any attack to go unanswered.\u201d The Trump camp is working with a Florida-based advertising firm, as widely reported, but also with several other media companies, some of which are well-known in the political community, the sources say. Their advantage, in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond, is that the bombastic billionaire can just write a check for the TV campaign. Some pundits have expressed skepticism that Trump really wants to dig deeply into his personal fortune, but these sources insist he is ready to do just that\u2014perhaps as much as $100 million for advertising overall. \u201cOur Super PAC,\u201d says the adviser, \u201cis Donald Trump\u2019s bank account.\u201d The original plan was to saturate the airwaves so that the real estate mogul could define himself before his GOP rivals did it for him. But Trump says he had no need to do that because he generated such saturation coverage, all of it free. If Trump pours big bucks into an ad campaign\u2014and no budget has been set\u2014he could again confound the prognosticators. While Trump enjoys a 20-point lead in national polls and dominates many state polls, he and Ted Cruz have been trading the lead in Iowa, where a win could give the Texas senator momentum and let some air out of the Trump invincibility balloon. A Gravis poll just before Christmas had Trump and Cruz tied in Iowa at 31 percent. Journalistic skeptics also question whether Trump is doing what it takes in the ground game and whether his voters, some of them new to politics, will actually show up. The New York Times recently reported that \u201cMr. Trump has fallen behind in the nuts and bolts of organizing. A loss in Iowa for Mr. Trump, where he has devoted the most resources of his campaign, could imperil his leads in the next two nominating states, New Hampshire and South Carolina, where his get-out-the-vote organizations are even less robust.\u201d In the early \u00a0caucus state of Nevada, says the Wall Street Journal, \u201cthe Trump campaign has just four aides working out of campaign offices in Las Vegas and Reno. And they are playing catch-up with other campaigns.\u201d Trump advisers dispute such reports, citing the hiring of 17 paid staffers in Iowa and 15 in New Hampshire. But let\u2019s assume what once seemed unthinkable for the pundit class, that Trump wins the Republican nomination. The new conventional wisdom is that he\u2019ll get creamed in the general election. But could the political soothsayers be wrong about this as well? Trump himself tweeted over the weekend, \u201cThe same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.\u201d Still, the polls suggest that Trump could have a tough time, especially with Hillary Clinton holding a built-in Electoral College advantage against any Republican challenger. Trump has a 68 percent unfavorable rating among women, according to last week\u2019s Quinnipiac poll\u2014which is one reason Clinton fired back that his recent comment about her being \u201cschlonged\u201d in 2008 suggests sexism. In a Q poll out in early December, Trump had an 87 percent unfavorable rating among blacks, and 84 percent of Hispanics had an unfavorable view of him. Such a cataclysmic outcome would push ever higher the percentage of white voters that Trump would need to win. Back in September, though, a SurveyUSA poll found Trump with 25 percent support among African-Americans. It seems unlikely that Trump would more than double the black vote that George W. Bush won in his 2004 reelection. But anything significantly higher than the 6 percent of blacks that Mitt Romney won against President Obama would be an improvement. Trump advisers argue that his unconventional candidacy could change the electoral map\u2014particularly his appeal to blue-collar workers who are Democrats and independents. They believe his street-tough persona could put such industrial strongholds as Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania in play. He takes some moderate positions for a Republicans, such as not touching Medicare and Social Security. Trump\u2019s say-anything style could certainly create headaches for Clinton, an essentially conventional politician despite her ground-breaking gender. And there are two other sets of numbers to consider. Trump has a daunting 59 percent unfavorable rating in the most recent Q poll, but Hillary\u2019s unfavorable, at 51 percent, isn\u2019t much better. And in the latest CNN survey, Clinton beats Trump by only 49 to 47 percent in a hypothetical matchup, within the margin of error. He fares worse in other polls, trailing Hillary by 7 points in Quinnipiac and 11 points in the latest Fox poll. Still, for a political neophyte running against a former first lady, senator and Cabinet member, those are the kind of deficits that can be made up in a long campaign. A July CNN poll found only 51 percent of Republicans viewing Trump favorably; by this month the figure had risen to 72 percent. It\u2019s entirely possible that Trump will get shellacked if he wins the Republican nomination. But if the pundits\u2019 awful track record is any indication, all bets could be off.",

Consider what administration officials announcing the new exemption for medium-sized employers had to say about firms that might fire workers to get under the threshold and avoid hugely expensive new requirements of the law.

To keep the money flowing, the website would have to hit specific benchmarks between 2011 and 2013.

From the committee: \u201cThe truth is that Democrats slashed Medicare Advantage to pay for ObamaCare. Nearly 15 million seniors nationwide (close to 30% of all Medicare beneficiaries) rely on Medicare Advantage plans for their Medicare coverage. Many of these are low-income seniors who choose these options because they can\u2019t afford the Medigap policies that more financially secure seniors use.\u201d Targets include Sens.

Her obituaries have mostly focused on her wildly successful pre-World War II career as a child star, but Americans have also been reminded of Black\u2019s second career as a conservative politician and diplomat.\u00a0 Her twenty years of service included\u00a0her appointment in 1969 as delegate to the U.N. General Assembly, and ambassadorships to Ghana under PresidentGerald Ford and Czechoslovakia during the first Bush administration.\u00a0 Her trajectory follows that of another actor turned politician, Ronald Reagan. In fact, both had a miserable flop of a movie to thank for their success in later life. \u201cThat Hagan Girl\u201d was supposed to cement Black as an adult star following her success as a love-sick teenager opposite Cary Grant in \u201cThe Bachelor and the Bobbysoxer.\u201d Eager to make it a hit, studio bosses strong-armed Reagan into accepting his role as role as Black\u2019s character\u2019s putative father/benefactor/lover (yuck). Reagan, not wanting to play a part that might give even Woody Allen the creeps, sought mercy in the form of a re-write, but to no avail. Filming was a nightmare, with Regan catching viral pneumonia and missing the birth of his child with then-wife Jane Wyman. The movie was such a famous flop that it sealed Reagan\u2019s reputation as a b-list actor, rather than the a-lister he seemed to be in films like \u201cSana Fe Trail\u201d and \u201cKings Row.\u201d Reagan would later cite the box-office debacle as a turning point in his life and career, beginning his pivot away from acting and toward politics. The terrible film also derailed Black\u2019s hopes of becoming a leading lady, and she retired from Hollywood soon after. Twenty years later, both Reagan and Black had new spouses and new careers in politics, him as a candidate for California governor and her running for a House seat.

It\u2019s not just that the change is a reversal of the GOP stance that the law is beyond repair, but also that it was quietly tacked on to an irregular, unannounced March 27 voice vote on the annual delay of Clinton-era Medicare cuts. [Good luck passing the House budget plan now, by the way.] The ObamaCare change, which came at the behest of business groups struggling with ObamaCare implementation, isn\u2019t controversial itself, but Democrats are crowing that they have finally broken the GOP blockade. Embattled Democrats are desperate to show that they are working to repair the struggling law, and say this is the moment they can begin to start shifting the ObamaCare debate. The strategy, outlined for Politico, is to show Democrats at work on pernicious but peripheral problems with the law. The goal is to protect the Democratic majority in the Senate and thereby the law itself. [The Hill looks at the move by embattled Democrats like Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., to block ObamaCare hikes to rates for the popular Medicare Advantage program amid further alienation from older voters for their party.] Reid takes a (little) risk - The strategy of seeming to mend ObamaCare from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his team is a perilous one. As angry as conservative Republicans are at the sneaky tactic of tucking the fix into the bill, if it is the start of Reid & Co. allowing ObamaCare legislation through a years-long blockade, GOPers could stand to benefit. Democratic divisions have not much been on display because Reid allows so little activity in the Senate, but they are real and are likely to get worse as the pressure of midterms takes its toll and as the party braces for a return to its \u201890s-era partnership with Wall Street. [Er\u2026 - \u201cThe Congress of the United States, which wrote [ObamaCare], the members which are proud of what they have done are happy to not run away from what we have done, very proud of what we have accomplished.\u201d \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in an interview with CNN.] Threading the needle - What Democrats hope to do is restore some measure of trust on the issue of health care lost amid the stumbles of ObamaCare and simultaneously brand Republicans as intransigent and cruel. The conventional wisdom in Washington remains that the GOP shouldn\u2019t risk worsening infighting and opening itself up to counter criticism by settling on a replacement for ObamaCare. But as Democrats start to see the advantages of being seen as fixing the law, Republicans are in dire need of an answer as to what they propose. Pfeiffer pfeels pfine - The Hill: \u201cWhite House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer on Sunday rejected the suggestion that Republicans will take control of the Senate in the midterm elections, saying that the GOP argument to repeal ObamaCare is a \u2018political loser.\u2019 \u2018I'd say we believe we're going to keep the Senate,\u2019 Pfeiffer said on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation\u2019\u2026\u201d TAKING AIM AT INCOME INEQUALITY\u2026 ELSEWHEREToday, President Obama will today sign two executive orders aimed at male-female wage discrepancy (like the one at the White House).

JEB BUSH TWEAKS BASE, SAYS GOP NEEDS \u2018BIGGER VISION\u2019 FOR 2016\u00a0 There certainly no pandering to the GOP base as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sat down with Fox News\u2019 Shannon Bream. Bush pleaded for mercy for illegal immigrants, saying \"It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family,\" to illegally enter the United States. The interview, part of this weekend\u2019s 25th anniversary celebration of his father\u2019s presidential library, Bush also reiterated his support for Common Core federal requirements for public schools, saying it was misunderstood by foes to be a national curriculum. The two-term Florida Republican clearly knew the impolitic nature of his immigration answer, prefacing his comments by saying \u201cI\u2019m going to say this and it will be on tape \u2013 so be it.\u201d [Read the NYT take on Bush\u2019s waters-testing weekend: \u201cOffstage, Mr. Bush gave indications of interest throughout the weekend. He approached one guest to ask if he was still working for another Republican known to be positioning for a presidential campaign; told yes, Mr. Bush moved on without further comment.\u201d] If he\u2019s in it, it\u2019s to win it - Bush reaffirmed his time frame for a 2016 decision of later this year, similar to that given by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Discussing his criteria for his decision, Bush asked \u201cCan a candidate run with a hopeful, optimistic message run? Hopefully with enough details to give people a sense \u2026that it's not just idle words and not get thrown, not get back into the vortex of a mud fight?\u00a0 Can you do it, in my case, can one do it joyfully, without being tied to all the convention of the politics of here and now. And the other is it okay for my family?\u201d\u00a0 Bush added \u201cit turns out that not running has generated more interest than if I said I was running.\u201d Bush also suggested his blunt talk about conservative sacred cows like immigration was part of a larger vision. \u201cWe need to elect candidates that have a vision that is bigger and broader and candidates that are organized around winning the election, not making a point,\u201d Bush told Bream. \u201cWinning allows the big things to get solved. Winning gets the country back on track, in my mind.\u201d More from \u201cAmerica\u2019s News Headquarters.\u201d Paul: \u2018adapt or die\u2019 - Sen.

Rick Santorum will speak at the event for party activists June 14.\u201d] BUBBA LEANS RIGHT, CALLS FOR SPENDING CONTROL, COMPROMISE\u00a0On a campaign visit to his boyhood hometown of Hot Springs, Ark., former President Bill Clinton touted the need for bipartisan cooperation and emphasized the importance of a balanced budget. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to control spending, if you decide to spend the money you\u2019ve got to raise it, got to have enough revenues to cover what you decide to spend, and you have to have some economic growth to drive the debt down,\u201d Clinton said, according to KATV. Clinton was stumping for a pair of Arkansas Democrats over the weekend, his former Emergency Management Director James Lee Witt and the former North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hayes, both Democrats trying to crack the GOP\u2019s monopoly on federal offices in the state. Clinton has previously campaigned for embattled Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and the gubernatorial bid of former Rep. Mike Ross, D-Ark. Frozen \u2018till Hillary has chosen - WSJ looks out how 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s numerous shadow campaigns are spelling trouble for other prospective Democratic contenders: \u201cWhen advisers to a fundraising group backing a prospective 2016 Clinton bid came calling in late January, hedge-fund manager and political heavyweight Orin Kramer said he met them in his New York office and agreed to write a check. When another potential candidate, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, tried to reach him, Mr. Kramer said he didn't take the call\u2026 That organizational advantage coupled with her renown as a former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state have prevented other prospective Democrats from getting a toehold in the race.

You get a freebie question for the ridiculousness of that question.\u201d) When asked to offer his thoughts on 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton the Chicago mayor said, \u201c\u2026while Bill Clinton was seen as centrist and Hillary less so during the White House years, that is not true. They are clearly different speakers, which is central to leadership. Bill Clinton can go with or without a text. I think Hillary is equally eloquent when she lets go of that text.

Today, the world\u2019s most populous free nation began its national election with 815 million citizens eligible to vote. The process, which began in remote border provinces, will last for the next six weeks. India has more voters than the United States, Brazil and Indonesia combined.

((AP)) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 New caveat on Obama pledge: Pay to keep your doctor \u2022 No hiding sticker shock on revamped ObamaCare site \u2022 ATF under fire for domestic gunrunning stings \u2022 Huckabee a base player in S.C. \u2022 Surprised by \u2018Joy\u2019 NEW CAVEAT ON OBAMA PLEDGE: PAY TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR - Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a top architect of ObamaCare and one of the top salesmen for the troubled health law, added a major condition to President Obama\u2019s oft-repeated pledge that Americans would be able to keep their current doctors after the law was imposed. Chris Wallace pinned Emanuel down on the promise during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Emanuel initially sought to wave off the looming worries about disruptions in the \u201cDoc Shock\u201d as caregivers and hospitals either reject government insurance or new ObamaCare approved policies don\u2019t give access to previously available practitioners. Emanuel claimed it was \u201ca matter of choice\u201d whether Americans would buy insurance that covered top-quality care. \u201cThe president guaranteed me I could keep my doctor,\u201d Wallace finally demanded. \u201cAnd if you want to, you can pay for it,\u201d Emanuel said. Check it out here. [WSJ: \u201cIt's nice to hear a central planner embrace choice, except this needs translating too. The truth is that you may be able to pay more to keep your doctor, but only after you choose one of ObamaCare's preferred plans that already costs you more than your old plan that ObamaCare forced you to give up.] What is this ObamaCare of which you speak? - \u201cNo one has launched a big PR campaign to get these people signed up because of the problems with the federal Web site. We are about to launch a big PR campaign, and that, I think, is going to persuade a lot of people to sign up.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of ObamaCare, on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.\u201d [Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream looks at the legal challenges to ObamaCare\u2019s contraception mandate and how successful they could be.] NO HIDING STICKER SHOCK ON REVAMPED OBAMACARE SITE - The revamped online home of ObamaCare launched early this morning, with the site now allowing visitors to see costs before enrolling. NYT reports, \u201cFor policies offered in the federal exchange, as in many states, the annual deductible often tops $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a couple\u2026 Higher deductibles are one tool that insurers can use to hold down premiums. Many have also held down premiums on the exchanges by limiting the choices of doctors and hospitals available to consumers in their provider networks.\u201d [Watch Fox: correspondent Peter Doocy examines the costs and continued concerns with ObamaCare\u2019s problem plagued Web site.] WORSENING WOES FOR MARYLAND OBAMACARE - With low enrollment and massive technical problems, Maryland\u2019s ObamaCare program is becoming a poster child for the state-level failings previously overshadowed by the program\u2019s federal-level crash. Director Rebecca Pearce resigned over criticism for taking a Cayman Islands vacation in the midst of the crash. It spells trouble for early ObamaCare supporter Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, D-Md., as he weighs a 2016 presidential bid. WSJ has more. [Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, D-Md., is making his first foray on the international stage with a trip to El Salvador.

Millions of people are losing their plans and doctors-fraud!\u201d Lauren Ashburn of \u201c#MEDIABUZZ\u201d tracks the Twitterverse every day in Top Twitter Talk.] just Someone set us up the Medicaid bomb! -\u00a0 Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, writes in The Medicaid Time Bomb that 1.46 million of about 1.6 million Americans enrolled in ObamaCare have actually signed up for Medicaid. \u201cIf that trend continues, it could bankrupt both federal and state governments\u2026 Already Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for 48% of federal spending. Within the next few years, those three programs will eat up more than half of federal expenditures.\u201d CRUZ\u00a0TOP LAWMAKER AT MANDELA MEMORIAL - It\u2019s no shock that President Obama is heading to South Africa today for Tuesday\u2019s state funeral of Nelson Mandela, but heads snapped at the announcement of the ranking U.S. lawmaker at the service: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz will be the only senator to attend, though many members of the House will be on hand, particularly those in the Congressional Black Caucus. Cruz took a lot of heat this weekend from supporters and detractors alike for his tribute to Mandela on Facebook. Gingrich asks conservative critics of Mandela\u2019s early tactics: \u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d - \u201cAfter years of preaching non-violence\u2026 Mandela resorted to violence against a government that was ruthless and violent in its suppression of free speech. As Americans we celebrate the farmers at Lexington and Concord who used force to oppose British tyranny. We praise George Washington for spending eight years in the field fighting the British Army\u2019s dictatorial assault on our freedom. Patrick Henry said, \u2018Give me liberty or give me death.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Newt Gingrich in a statement posted on his Web site. What will you do now? - Former South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who served during the final years of the apartheid era, reflects on Nelson Mandela for Fox News Opinion: \u201cHis death is irreversible, his legacy, undying. All of us, the government, the voters, civil society, the churches, are faced with an inescapable challenge: are we going to honor and sustain his legacy or deviate from it.\u201d Which way to the Axis of Evil box? - More than 70 world leaders will be in South Africa this week to attend the memorial for Nelson Mandela, including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Cuban leader Raul Castro and Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe leading some to believe there could be some uncomfortable encounters with President Obama. As Breitbart points out, it\u2019s a two-way street, Islamist members of the Iranian press wonder if it is a \u201c\u2019trap\u2019 laid by the \u2018great Satan.\u2019\u201d ATF UNDER FIRE FOR DOMESTIC GUNRUNNING STINGS - The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel uncovered some highly questionable tactics being employed by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms across the country. The revelation stemmed from the discovery of a head shop in Milwaukee that was a front for an ATF sting and led to the discovery of similar practices around the nation. \u201cATF agents befriended mentally disabled people to drum up business and later arrested them in at least four cities in addition to Milwaukee. In Wichita, Kan., ATF agents referred to a man with a low IQ as \"slow-headed\" before deciding to secretly use him as a key cog in their sting. And agents in Albuquerque, N.M., gave a brain-damaged drug addict with little knowledge of weapons a \"tutorial\" on machine guns, hoping he could find them one.\u201d Other alleged tactics included enticing teenagers to drink and smoke pot at government-provide hangouts and paying the disabled to get neck tattoos advertizing a bogus pot paraphernalia store. [Watch Fox: Chief Political Correspondent Carl Cameron has the latest developments on the ATF\u2019s controversial tactics.] Cops use phony cell towers to grab data - Nearly one in four local law-enforcement agencies are engaging in a tactic known as \u201ctower dumping.\u201d The tactic gives police data concerning the identity, activity and location of any phone that connects to a targeted cell phone tower over a set span of time. According to records obtained by USA Today, several agencies also set up fake cell towers as part of a program called \u201cStingray\u201d that tricks nearby phones into connecting to a police data feed. OPTIMISM BLOOMS FOR SMALL SCALE BUDGET DEAL - Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, signaled they wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a budget deal. A contentious point has been Democrats\u2019 calls for extending 99-week unemployment benefits set to expire towards the end of the month, but speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Durbin said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached a point where we\u2019ve said this is it, take it or leave it.\u201d Portman echoed those statements by saying the issue should be dealt with separately, outside of the budget. House and Senate negotiators have a self-imposed deadline of this Friday the 13th, to present a deal. While this agreement could skirt another government shutdown, Congress is not completely out of the woods yet. Their next battle will be a Feb. 7 deadline\u2014when the Treasury will seek another debt limit increase. Fox News has more. WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Economist James Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute tackles President Obama\u2019s charges against Ronald Reagan\u2019s economic policies in Income-Inequality Revisionism: \u201cMany Americans recall the 1980s as the beginning of an improbable Long Boom when pro-market policies reversed what at the time had seemed like unstoppable economic decline. [Obama], however, described the Reagan revolution as the moment when the postwar \u2018social contract began to unravel\u2019 and \u2018trickle-down ideology became more permanent,\u2019 leading to decades of dangerously unbalanced economic growth\u2026 If we\u2019re going to do a lot better, though, we need to draw the right lessons from the past \u2013 not distort it to promote stale ideological agendas.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., is pretty obviously having fun hosting his weekend show on Fox News, but a new poll out of South Carolina may inspire him to slip his running shoes back on. The poll from Gravis Marketing shows Huckabee ahead of the pack among potential Republican 2016 candidates in the Palmetto State. Huckabee leads with 18 percent, but former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., is close behind with 17 percent. Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., clocks in at 14 percent, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, holds the floor with 13 percent and Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky. and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., each saw 8 percent support. CAMPAIGNS BEGIN AT HOME - Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., emphasized the importance of his family in deciding whether he will seek the presidency in 2016. However, he is \u201cseriously thinking about it.\u201d Paul told \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d that his wife is currently saying \u201cno\u201d to a possible run and that he fears how politics take \u201ca toll on family.\u201d CANTOR LAMENTS VIRGINIA WOES - Virginia Republican leaders spent the weekend licking their wounds and putting together a strategy for the next election at a weekend retreat at The Homestead. From the Roanoke Times: \u201c[House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said] that recent election defeats \u2018have inflamed a lot of tension and, as a result, we\u2019ve been witnessing a lot of finger-pointing and a lot of blame and feelings of resentment. When our party is not united, and when we fail to offer a plan that connects with people and the problems they\u2019re having, we lose at the ballot box,\u201d Cantor said.\u201d The party will hold a June 7 convention to nominate a challenger to take on Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie confirms to The Washington Post that he is considering a run. YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: OH, THE IRONY - President Obama\u2019s touting corporate success is ironic after spending most of his presidency championing the role of government in American enterprise. That was the sentiment viewers shared with Charles Krauthammer during Friday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d As measured by Bing Pulse, all parties agreed with Krauthammer when he called Friday\u2019s jobs report \u201cgood\u201d and that after five years progress is finally being seen. Both genders showed strong disagreement with the president\u2019s statement, \u201cI have an open door policy where I want people to be bringing me bad news on time so that we can fix things.\u201d Discussion of who should take the fall for ObamaCare\u2019s botched rollout saw heightened viewer engagement. Weekly Standard Senior Writer Stephen Hayes drew agreement across the spectrum when he noted the president has not fired anyone over the rollout debacle. Krauthammer saw high agreement from both genders with his quip, it was as if President Obama \u201cwandered into the White House on a White House tour and discovered himself in the Oval Office as president.\u201d Bing Pulse tracked 164,000 viewer votes, take a deeper data dive and see the full results here. Julie Pace, Stephen Hayes, and Charles Krauthammer will take their seats on the panel tonight, now you can too. SUPER TROOPERS \u00a0- Vermont State Police had to corral about 10 chickens that were creating a traffic hazard on I-89 early last week.

Thirty-two bars, nine lines of lyric, but with an awful lot of America in them: those \u2018presents on the tree\u2019 from last century's oughts, a gift for a faraway Jewish mother in the Twenties, homesick GIs sitting cross-legged on faraway shores and listening to Bing on USO Christmas tours... \u2018Christmas Eve will find me/Where the love-light gleams/I'll be Home for Christmas/If only in my dreams.\u2019\u201d SURPRISED BY JOY - If you\u2019re struggling to tap into your Christmas spirit, you will be hard pressed to find anything better than this: The Air Force Band pulling a massive flash mob concert at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to deliver a soul-swelling rendition of Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring.\u201d Even Frank Cross would well up.

DEBT SOARS DESPITE BUDGET DEAL - Fox News: The good news: The national parks are open, furloughed federal workers are back on the job, and the government will not cut off benefit payments because it can\u2019t borrow. The bad news: The national debt is back on course to hit $17 trillion any day now, with no deal in sight to ever reverse the climb.

((AP)) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

Having spent three times more money than his rival and with the backing of his popular patrons, Bill and Hillary Clinton, McAulliffe was breezing to victory just three weeks ago. But his once-stout lead in the polls over Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli nearly vanished as voter outrage over the crash landing of ObamaCare nearly wrecked the race. A double-digit lead turned into a three-point scrape. Exit polls showed intense opposition to ObamaCare that helped Cuccinelli, who was written off by the national GOP and who had to lug along the scandal-plagued administration of Republican incumbent Gov. Bob McDonnell. [Watch Fox: Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, previews Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Senate hearing in the 9 a.m. ET hour] Exit strategy - It looks like if Cuccinelli had another week to tag McAuliffe for his unflinching support of President Obama\u2019s unpopular new entitlement, the race might have ended differently. What if he would have had another year? That\u2019s the reality facing vulnerable Democrats on the 2014 election cycle. As Republican candidates without Cuccinelli\u2019s structural problems contemplate months and months of public frustrations with administrative failures, cancelled policies and premium spikes, the path to a Senate majority starts to look a little clearer as the fortunes of Democrats in red states and swing states continues to dim. \u201cDemocrats had to come up with plan. They couldn\u2019t possibly stand by because of the administration\u2019s inability to produce functioning Web site.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d Brickbats - Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testifies again today about the botched launch of ObamaCare.\u00a0 Following a contentious House hearing last week, Sebelius might have hoped for a friendlier reception by the Democratic led Senate. Not going to happen, Madam Secretary. The furor over President Obama\u2019s post-facto promise revision of his pledge to allow Americans to keep their insurance policies \u2013 more than 3.5 million of which are being cancelled \u2013 have raised the stakes dramatically. Add in McAuliffe\u2019s near collapse and you have a recipe for intraparty fighting. The administration can only weather this storm if most Democrats stick together. But the string of stumbles from team Obama will make even some loyalists wonder if they can survive the backlash. [A \u2018crisis of confidence\u2019 - Washington Examiner: \u201cSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman [Democrat] Barbara Mikulski delivered a hefty dose of criticism to Marilyn Tavenner, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, who came to testify before a Senate panel about the health care law rollout. \u2018I believe that there's been a crisis of confidence created in the dysfunctional nature of the Web site, the canceling of policies and sticker shock from some people.\u2019\u201d] Baier Tracks: Eye of the needle\u2026\u201cA win is a win. And clearly the Terry McAuliffe win is big for the Democratic Party and a particular friend who used to be Secretary of State and who may run for president. That said, the internals of the exit polls are a little scary for Democrats. Despite all of the money McAuliffe spent painting Ken Cuccinelli as an extremist, independents split their vote three ways: 47 percent for Cuccinelli, 38 percent for McAuliffe and 15 percent for third-party candidate Robert Sarvis. But scariest of all: It appears ObamaCare narrowed the gap in this race in the final days. While 46 percent of Virginia voters support ObamaCare, a 53-percent majority oppose it.\u00a0 That includes 41 percent who said they strongly oppose the law.\u00a0\u00a0Cuccinelli tried to make the race a referendum on the health law and President Obama, who campaigned with McAuliffe over the weekend. That wasn\u2019t ultimately successful, despite a 53-percent majority disapproving of the job Obama\u2019s doing. Threading the needle for Democrats \u2013 distancing themselves from ObamaCare while embracing the president and their party \u2013 will likely get increasingly tougher into 2014.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier TOPTWEETS - @laurenashburn\u2019s top tweet pick for this morning: WSJ\u2019s National Politics Editor Aaron Zinter, \u200f@aaronzitner7h \u2018We were on our own,' Cuccinelli strategist complains -- says GOP abandoned its nominee. wapo.st/HFDVSJ \u00a0 [Lauren Ashburn of \u201c#MEDIABUZZ\u201d tracks the Twitterverse every day in Top Twitter Talk.] BAD TIMING FOR A RED STATE SWING - President Obama is in Dallas today to raise money for congressional Democrats and plump for his embattled law. On Thursday, Obama is scheduled to give a speech in New Orleans, the home town of one of the most vulnerable Democrats next year Sen. Mary Landrieu. Fox News First wonders whether she will be very busy with legislative business that day. What she\u2019s working on is pushing a bill that would be a huge public embarrassment to the president if it comes to a vote: legislation that would codify Obama\u2019s original \u201cif you like it\u201d promise. Having voted against Republican efforts to temper the law\u2019s disruptive effects, Landrieu needs some cover. Quickly.

But with concrete evidence that law is shaping up to be an even greater political liability than it was in 2010, it\u2019s a tough sell. The fact that the test case came in Virginia, a state Obama won twice, makes it even tougher. If ObamaCare is an anchor in purple America, it\u2019s a torpedo in red states.

            "article_content": "He says Russian comments sarcastic Glenn Greenwald, the uber-liberal journalist who obtained the NSA leaks from Ed Snowden, says that anti-Trump bias in the media is utterly complete and total. \u201cThe U.S. media is essentially 100 percent united, vehemently, against Trump, and preventing him from being elected president,\u201d he told Slate. Greenwald says he has no problem with that because Trump poses \u201cextreme dangers,\u201d and I think he\u2019s overstating the case when it comes to bias. But the comment is telling. Kathleen Parker, the moderately conservative Washington Post columnist, says two Republican friends called to tell her during the Democratic convention: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Parker, who never considered herself a member of the GOP, says: \u201cWith its acceptance of Trump, the party has implicitly embraced the most un-American of litmus tests for citizens and immigrants based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Republicans are becoming ideologues of exclusion and marginalization, with hints of oppression to come.\u201d I cite these examples because I think the core argument that Hillary Clinton and her allies pushed at the Democratic convention\u2014that Trump is beyond the pale\u2014resonates with plenty of folks in the press. The New York Times described the effort in Philadelphia as attempting \u201cto portray Mr. Trump as a dangerously unstable figure,\u201d built on the notion \u201cthat the American system was designed to prevent the rise of a dictator.\u201d And the paper gave that theme front-page play. Even Clinton\u2019s media supporters didn\u2019t argue that she gave a great convention speech, or made progress in fixing her problems on likability and trustworthiness. She drew the most praise for her anti-Trump mockery. The press mostly panned Trump\u2019s speech as a dark exercise in fear-mongering. Since he focused so heavily on the problems facing America, most pundits said, he allowed Clinton to seize the mantle of optimism and uplift. But here\u2019s the thing: Plenty of voters are angry, as Hillary acknowledged in her speech. For them, Trump is the candidate of change. Clinton, despite her husband\u2019s insistence that she is a change-maker, is the candidate who literally and figuratively embraced Barack Obama, meaning she wants to build on the last eight years. So the election may turn on how frustrated\u2014or satisfied\u2014the country is. The media underestimated the success of the Cleveland convention, which gave Trump a significant bump in the polls. (Early indications are that Clinton is getting a similar bump from Philly.) One thing Clinton didn\u2019t do is attack Trump for wanting to abolish Social Security and Medicare. He\u2019s also for a boost in the minimum wage. Both sides recognize this isn\u2019t a classic left-right election. It\u2019s about strength and personality, insider vs. outsider, and who can make the sale on generating jobs and fighting terrorism. Trump\u2019s theme is that Hillary is weak, beholden to special interests and, well, crooked. Clinton\u2019s theme is that The Donald is crude, reckless, inexperienced and ignorant, while she sweats the details. Now that the conventions are behind us, we\u2019ll see which of these arguments gets more traction in the press.",

Sharpton\u2019s arrival comes just two days after Obama embraced the controversial activist and former FBI informant at a New York event hosted by the liberal broadcaster. Obama used the Sharpton event to accuse Republicans of trying to reverse the 1965 Voting Rights Act and intentionally suppress black voters with state laws requiring voters to show identification. \u201cThe real voter fraud is those that try to deny our rights by making arguments about voter fraud.\u201d Obama compared the ID laws to the Jim Crow restrictions of the segregated South and cast himself as a modern-day civil rights leader. It may not wash with most voters, but will it be enough to frighten the Democratic base into action? [WSJ: \u201c[A blueprint first sketched out by a Yale University law student four years ago], which seized on a mostly ignored provision of the 1965 [Voting Rights] law, has become the government's strategy for challenging states it believes are enacting discriminatory voting laws, including North Carolina and Texas.\u201d] It worked before - While liberals may be enthused that the president is back to attacking Republicans on matters of race, it\u2019s not a risk-free path. The administration discovered the dangers of ham-handed outreach last week with a botched effort to alarm the single, female voters on whom Democrats rely. After getting pasted over their pay-equity gambit, though, the Obama Democrats are showing no reticence about applying blunt political force to sensitive topics, this time on race. But as campaign watchers learned in 2012, audacious negativity is not something of which Team Obama is afraid. In fact, the forecast for the coming election is increasingly negative and hostile. Remember, whatever was said about Obama\u2019s unprecedentedly negative re-election campaign, it certainly worked. Top house Dem: GOP animated by racism - Fox News: New York Rep. Steve Israel said Sunday a significant part of the Republican Party is \u2018animated by racism,\u2019 marking the third time in recent days that a leading Democrat has appeared to make race an issue and drawn a sharp response from Republicans\u2026 Israel made his comments after Attorney General Eric Holder testified Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, then suggested the next day at a forum on civil rights that the past five years in Washington have been marked by \u2018unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.\u2019\u201d [\u201cThis strikes me as kinda crybaby stuff from Holder.

Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, who inspired virtual legislatures of politicians and became generational touchstones... [President Obama] has so far had little such influence. That is all the more remarkable considering he came to office tapping into spirit of volunteerism and community service that pollsters say is widespread and intense among young people. Mr. Obama has come to represent that spirit, but he has failed, pollsters say, to transform it into meaningful engagement in the political process. \u2018If you were to call it an Obama generation, there was a window,\u2019 said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. \u2018That opportunity has been lost.\u2019 He said the youth who came of voting age around the time of the 2008 election have since lost interest in electoral politics, and pointed to a survey he conducted last year among 18- to 29-year-olds. Although 70 percent said they considered community service an honorable endeavor, only 35 percent said the same about running for office.\u201d DOCTORS DESPAIR AT OBAMACAREThe Daily Beast: \u201cUnfortunately, things are only getting worse for most doctors, especially those who still accept health insurance. Just processing the insurance forms costs $58 dollars for every patient encounter, according to Dr. Stephen Schimpff, an internist and former CEO of University of Maryland Medical Center who is writing a book about the crisis in primary care. \u2026 What worries many doctors, however, is that the Affordable Care Act has codified this broken system into law. While forcing everyone to buy health insurance, [ObamaCare] might have mandated a uniform or streamlined claims procedure that would have gone a long way to improving access to care\u2026 Industry leaders are fixated on patient satisfaction, despite the fact that high scores are correlated with worse outcomes and higher costs. Indeed, trying to please whatever patient comes along destroys the integrity of our work. It\u2019s a fact that doctors acquiesce to patient demands\u2014for narcotics, x-rays, doctor\u2019s notes\u2014despite what survey advocates claim. And now that Medicare payments will be tied to patient satisfaction\u2014this problem will get worse. Doctors need to have the ability to say no. If not, when patients go to see the doctor, they won\u2019t actually have a physician\u2014they\u2019ll have a hostage.\u201d OBAMACARE STRAINS TAX ENFORCEMENTHere\u2019s one thing that might improve ObamaCare\u2019s popularity - AP: \u201cAs millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday\u2019s tax deadline, their chances of getting audited are lower than they have been in years. Budget cuts and new responsibilities are straining the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to police tax returns.

Boeing, she said, \u2018has just agreed to double its contribution to $2 million.\u2019 Clinton did not point out that, to secure the donation, the State Department had set aside ethics guidelines that first prohibited solicitations of Boeing and then later permitted only a $1 million gift from the company\u2026\u00a0The November 2009 episode was an indicator of a mutually beneficial relationship between one of the world\u2019s major corporations and a potential future president.

The company\u2019s ties came into play again this month when its in-house lobbyist, former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating, co-hosted a fundraiser for Ready for Hillary, the super PAC backing her potential presidential run. The Boeing relationship meshed well with efforts by Clinton to expand the State Department\u2019s advocacy of U.S. economic interests abroad, part of a broader philosophy that has emphasized partnering government with businesses to solve problems.

            "article_content": "Simon Rosenberg, former Bill Clinton campaign adviser, and Morgan Ortagus, former financial intelligence analyst for the Treasury Department, join the debate Newly announced double-digit premium hikes for those on the ObamaCare exchanges are handing Donald Trump a political weapon in key swing states where residents could be facing rate increases even higher than the national average. The administration announced Monday that premiums for a midlevel plan are set to rise an average of 25 percent in 2017 in the 39 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov. The rate hikes vary widely across different cities and states, but several battlegrounds could be facing increases that are considerably higher. According to administration figures, the average premium increase for a popular \u201csilver\u201d plan will rise 116 percent in Arizona; 40 percent in North Carolina; and 53 percent in Pennsylvania. These projections do not factor in taxpayer subsidies, which many enrollees \u2013 though not all \u2013 would receive to defray the cost. OBAMACARE FALLOUT: AS PREMIUMS RISE, SO DOES COST TO TAXPAYERS The impact on swing states was not lost on the struggling Trump campaign, which blasted out a lengthy email Tuesday declaring \u201cObamaCare\u2019s failure hits swing states hard\u201d and detailing projected rate increases \u201cfrom Arizona to Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cObamaCare has to be repealed and replaced,\u201d Trump said Tuesday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d calling the law a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He\u2019s been hammering the premium woes on the stump ever since the administration on Monday outlined the hikes, which many states already had been reporting for weeks. The ObamaCare news comes as Trump has slipped in the polls, seemingly suffering from a battering of bad news that started with the leak of a 2005 tape showing him making crude comments about women and accelerated with multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault which he adamantly denies. Meanwhile, the daily drip-drip of embarrassing revelations from thousands of leaked emails from Hillary Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s account do not seem to have seriously damaged the Democratic nominee\u2019s poll numbers. #Obamacare under the microscope: Exploding costs, fewer options for coverage leave enrollees in Arizona reeling pic.twitter.com/vndkJnwpW1 Still, polls show Clinton with only a slight lead in a number of battlegrounds, including those being hit hard by premium increases. In Pennsylvania, she leads by an average of 5 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average. In Arizona, her average lead is just over a point. In North Carolina, she is ahead by 2 points. And while ObamaCare hikes are not hitting voters in the critical states of Ohio and Florida as hard, Trump now has the edge over Clinton in Ohio \u2013 and a new Bloomberg Politics poll showed him ahead by 2 points in Florida, where Trump is campaigning heavily and ripping ObamaCare on a regular basis. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to swing the election but [premium hikes] certainly could have an impact,\u201d said Marc Thiessen, former speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, citing the impact in battleground states. The ObamaCare problems could also fuel the case of Republicans running in tight House and Senate races, as they try to hold their majority on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday that Republicans are offering a plan to repeal the law and replace it \u201cwith real, patient-centered solutions that fit your needs and your budget. We don't have to accept this kind of sticker shock.\" He and Trump both said the law is \u201cblowing up.\u201d But Democrats say these claims over overheated. \u201cTrump\u2019s latest claim that the Affordable Care Act is \u2018blowing up\u2019 is as unfounded as his claim that he\u2019s \u2018winning the election,\u2019\u201d Democratic National Committee Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in a statement. \u201cThe fact is: 20 million Americans have coverage under the ACA who wouldn\u2019t otherwise, and the national uninsured rate is at its lowest in our nation\u2019s history. It\u2019s true that some premiums for midlevel health plans on the federal exchange could rise in the future, but it\u2019s also true that for most Americans on those plans, their ACA subsidies will rise to keep the plans affordable.\u201d A Clinton campaign spokeswoman contrasted her approach with Trump\u2019s. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to build on the progress we\u2019ve made and fix what\u2019s broken, while Donald Trump would rip up the ACA, reverse the progress we have made and start this fight all over again,\u201d spokeswoman Julie Wood said. \u201cClinton has a serious plan to improve choices and increase competition, including a public option and a Medicare buy-in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and Cal Thomas (Tribune) NEW YORK \u2014 If there is one explanation for Donald Trump\u2019s success it is this: Unlike most Republicans, he fights back. He may not have the late Muhammad Ali\u2019s finesse, but he sees himself as more than capable of dealing a \u201cknockout\u201d punch to Hillary Clinton in November. That ought to be the goal of any GOP presidential nominee. During an interview in his Trump Tower office Monday, I asked about his temperament, a subject often raised by critics. Hillary Clinton recently said he shouldn\u2019t be trusted with the nuclear codes and that he is so thin-skinned he might start a war. Trump said, \u201cShe\u2019s the one who raised her hand for the war in Iraq and I\u2019m the one who has been fighting it from the beginning \u2026 [Hillary] is the one who has a terrible temperament \u2026 she\u2019s weak \u2026 she has a hair trigger and it\u2019s just the opposite with me. I have a strong temperament. \u2026 I couldn\u2019t have built the strong companies I\u2019ve built if I didn\u2019t have a strong temperament.\u201d Well, yes, and many considered Teddy Roosevelt just as brash and his likeness made it onto Mount Rushmore. What about the references to race and ethnicity that have brought criticism from leading Republicans? I suggested that most Americans don\u2019t care about the civil lawsuit against Trump University (which alleges the university is a scam), the ethnic background of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the case or whether Trump is being treated \u201cfairly.\u201d What Americans care about are jobs, the economy and terrorist threats. Does Trump plan to pivot from such things and start focusing on what resonates with most voters? \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s starting very soon.\u201d In a statement released Tuesday, however, Trump addressed the Curiel issue one more time. \u201cIt is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. \u2026 I do not feel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial\u2026\u201d He then vowed not to speak about the matter again. In our interview, Trump noted he has received more votes than Ronald Reagan. Yes, but primaries are but a small percentage of the larger number of people who will vote in November. A considerable number of them will vote for Hillary Clinton; some conservatives and Republicans will refuse to vote for Trump. Trump says his formula for making America great again begins with putting the country first: \u201cI hate to use the word \u2018change,\u2019 because Obama used to use that word \u2026 but (people) are hungry for real change; they\u2019re hungry for making things right.\u201d He\u2019s right and both parties share the blame for the dysfunction. Trump\u2019s plan for reforming Social Security and Medicare, the main drivers of our debt, consists of eliminating \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d and growing the economy to a point where there will be sufficient money to sustain these programs for decades to come. He promises that the list of judges provided to him by The Federalist Society and The Heritage Foundation will either be the ones he nominates to federal benches, \u201cor people exactly like them. In fact, I\u2019m going to expand the list by four.\u201d Trump rejects the notion of a \u201cliving Constitution,\u201d preferring the view of the late Justice Antonin Scalia that the document means what it says. He favors school choice, especially for minority children in failing public schools, a position he thinks will help get him African-American votes. He says President Obama, not him, has divided the country, pitting rich against poor and blacks against whites. \u201cI had hoped Obama would be a good cheerleader for the country. He\u2019s really brought the opposite in spirit to the country. He\u2019s a very negative force.\u201d He adds, \u201cIf we have four years of Hillary I don\u2019t know if we can ever come back.\u201d If Donald Trump does adopt a positive view of America that is inclusive of all Americans, he might be able to resonate with a majority of voters. Will he? We\u2019re about to find out.",

            "article_content": "Greece's PM Alexis Tsipras defiant in address The big, fat Greek fiscal crisis might seem like a far-away problem. The birthplace of democracy teeters on the edge of a financial collapse which holds the potential to fracture the European Union and shred its common currency. But while most Americans aren't lending Greece's troubles much attention, it's only a matter of time before the meltdown fuels a new debt debate in Washington. The Treasury Department announced a few days ago that the federal debt is frozen at $18.112 trillion. The debt has stalled at that threshold since mid-March, just $25 million below the debt ceiling of $18.113 trillion. Congress had suspended the debt cap in February 2014 through mid-March of this year, and it was determined that Treasury Secretary Jack Lew would simply declare a \"debt issuance suspension period\" after federal obligations exceeded that mark this past March, which he did. So that doesn't mean the U.S. isn't racking up additional debt. It's just that Congress switched off the speedometer that gauges national debt. But that's a short-term fix. The expectation is that Congress will have to either re-suspend or raise the debt restriction in October or November. Congress and President Obama entered an epic saga over raising the debt limit in the summer of 2011. The national debt resonated as a campaign issue in the 2010 midterm elections. Tea Party loyalists bent on cutting spending descended on Washington as a rebuke to Obama's first two years. A similar battle could play out this autumn. And the fight over Greece's debt will inevitably be linked to America's fiscal woes. But fixing the problem in Washington won't be easy. The only way Congress forged an agreement to raise the debt limit in 2011 was by agreeing on $1.2 trillion in spending cuts. Either a so-called \"supercommittee\" of bicameral, bipartisan lawmakers was going to hash out a plan to make the cuts -- or an indiscriminate system of across-the-board reductions would do that for them. The supercommittee failed. Soon afterwards, automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, set in. Sequestration marks one of the few instances in recent years where lawmakers have actually curbed spending. But now there's a bipartisan call to extinguish the sequester. Part of the reason is that members of Congress from both sides fret that the federal government is skimping on the programs it really needs. Sequestration hems in lawmakers. On its face, it may seem as though the sequester is a success -- serving as one of the few factors to regulate congressional spending. That's true. But it's a failure when it comes to bringing down the national debt. Here's why: there are two types of federal spending, \"mandatory\" and \"discretionary.\" The federal government spends a little over $3 trillion each year. \"Mandatory\" spending composes two-thirds of that spending, and pertains to funds spent without any annual direction or appropriation from Capitol Hill. Entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- plus interest on the debt -- make up mandatory spending. Those are the biggest drivers of the debt. Certainly Congress could step in and start to reduce those programs if it wanted to curb overall federal spending. But cuts to popular entitlement programs could be political suicide. Meantime, Congress still controls \"discretionary\" spending, or the remaining one-third of the budget. That amounts to a little over $1 trillion. Congress decides how much money it will cough up for various programs and departments. But here's the rub: sequestration only slashes funding on the discretionary side of the ledger. It never touches mandatory spending, the section of federal outlays where some cuts could actually make a difference. And now we're back to Greece and what the fiscal experience in Athens portends for Washington. Greece allots about 56 percent of its yearly spending on social programs like entitlements. The U.S. already exceeds that, with mandatory spending clocking it at 66 percent of overall expenditures. Debt is the common denominator between the U.S. and Greece. Most Americans might not understand the broader implications of a Greek debt meltdown. It's just all Greek to us now. But if Congress and future presidents don't get a handle on the debt, it could be all American in a few years.

The effect of ObamaCare so far seems to be un-insuring those already covered and then re-enrolling some of them. A pair of new surveys say that the years-long effort to get Americans without health coverage to sign up for ObamaCare has fallen flat. A study by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. says that of the millions of Americans who have signed up for insurance under ObamaCare, only about a quarter were previously uninsured. Why? A study by the left-leaning Urban Institute says that only one in 10 of those without insurance enrolled as of last month and that nearly a quarter of those eligible to enroll had never heard of the program. [\u201cThat's not a data point that we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way.\u201d \u2013 Gary Cohen of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services when asked by insurers how many of the enrollees were previously uninsured, via National Journal] Self-destruct cycle - The McKinsey study found that the main reason uninsured Americans who knew about the program weren\u2019t signing up was that they believed they could not afford the benefits. This is part of a self-destruct cycle for ObamaCare. The more delays the president enacts in a bid to save his law, the more distorted the insurance marketplace is likely to become. The pressure is growing on Obama delay the looming punishment for those fail to comply by the end of this month. He is so far refusing Democratic pleas for mercy, knowing that such a delay would cause insurance costs to soar even higher as the industry tried to accommodate new, expensive ObamaCare beneficiaries without the policy checks from the million or more healthy, less expensive consumers who actuaries say will sign up to avoid the penalties. If Americans are shunning ObamaCare because it is too expensive now, imagine what will happen if that kind of rate spike come into play. [Pessimism, fear and anger were the most common emotions voters expressed about ObamaCare in the latest Fox News Poll About 38 percent of voters favored the health law, while 57 percent opposed it. Results here.] President says he won\u2019t delay deadline for ObamaCare fines - Washington Examiner: \u201cMaking a direct sales pitch to Hispanic voters on Thursday, President Obama insisted that his administration would not delay the March 31 deadline for consumers to obtain health insurance or pay a fine. \u2018We are going to enforce the deadline,\u2019 the president said at a town hall\u2026 \u2018You have time now to sign up,\u2019 Obama insisted. \u2018If everybody waits until the last minute \u2026 then in some ways it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy\u2019\u2026When asked whether the latest delay was an admission of a problem with the health law, Obama replied, \u2018No, no, no\u2019\u2026\u201d [\u201cAnd none of the information that is provided in order for you to obtain health insurance is in any way transferred to immigration services. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been very clear about.\u201d \u2013 President Obamaurging Hispanic consumers to enroll in ObamaCare.] If only they had this before the ObamaCare vote - Samsung is about to go public with a new wearable app that increases a readers\u2019 word per minute by four times, reports Elite Daily.\u00a0Boston-based Spritz manipulates the format of the words to line them up with the eye\u2019s natural motion of reading.

BOEHNER PUSHES ENERGY POLICY IN UKRAINE RESPONSEHouse Speaker John Boehner offers his take on the Crimea crisis in a WSJ OpEd: \u201cIn response to Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, President Obama should announce a series of steps that will dramatically expand production of American-made energy, beginning with lifting this de facto ban on exports of U.S.-produced liquefied natural gas. Taking this step would also create American jobs and lower prices for our consumers and small businesses when coupled with other moves that would bolster energy production in North America. These include construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, ending the Obama administration\u2019s embargo on our supplies of oil and gas from federal lands and waters, and halting the effort to take coal out of America\u2019s electricity generation mix. The president doesn\u2019t need legislation from Congress to make these changes. This is something the commander in chief can do right now in the face of Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression.\u201d [Roll Call: \u201cSome Senate Republicans said the upcoming aid package for Ukraine could draw an amendment adding sanctions on Iran, although others cautioned against that approach.] Dr. K\u2019s Prescription: Check your history - Charles Krauthamer examines the revival of the Great Game in Crimea:\u00a0 \u201c[President Obama] says [Russian ruler Vladimir Putin] is on the wrong side of history, and Secretary of State John Kerry says Putin\u2019s is \u2018really 19th-century behavior in the 21st century.\u2019 This must mean that seeking national power, territory, dominion \u2013 the driving impulse of nations since Thucydides \u2013 is obsolete.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., a top-tier 2016 contender, is on friendly turf today as he addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington. He won the straw poll at last year\u2019s conclave and his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, won twice. But the younger Paul will take the podium today amid a national discussion on foreign policy as Russia plays aggressor in Eastern Europe. Will Paul\u2019s\u00a0 embrace of a libertarian, non-interventionist foreign policy play will with GOPers frustrated with what they say is President Obama\u2019s weak posture on the world stage. Paul previewed his message in a Thursday appearance on \u201cHannity,\u201d emphasizing the need for an aggressive reform message at home. \u201cWe need to be the party that is not for revenue-neutral tax reform; we need to have be the party who wants to stimulate the economy and be proud of that.\u201d Paul said. Paul has staked out a foreign policy posture on Russia, which he outlined in an opinion piece for Breitbart\u00a0 arguing that there is little America can do to push Russia out of the Crimean Peninsula. Different tone - Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fl., who headlined at CPAC Thursday, urged action from the administration and said Russian ruler Vladimir Putin \u201cis trying to reconstitute the power and the influence of the former Soviet Union.\u201d Potential 2016 contenders Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., both also took time to denounce Putin\u2019s aggression and call for a more muscular American position.

Mark Udall, got a double-barreled dose of good news out of a straw poll of GOP caucus-goers. Republican activists gathered this week to pick delegates for the party\u2019s June nominating convention and participated in a straw poll of their preferences for statewide offices. Gardner not only coasted to victory in the Senate straw poll, but got encouraging signs about the state\u2019s gubernatorial contest. Illegal immigration hardliner Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., who played spoiler in 2010 with a third-party gubernatorial bid, saw little support among the party faithful for his second try.

The former secretary also told the audience she hoped it wouldn\u2019t be the case \u2018that one decision would color collaboration\u2019 between the United States and Canada.\u2019\u201d This is a tricky one for Clinton. The corporate and union interest that have funded her career and are ready to underwrite her presidential run want the pipeline built. But the liberal Democratic base, which is highly alarmed about what its members believe to be global warming, dislike the idea of making gasoline cheaper and easier to get for Americans. Plus, many Democratic patrons are now making big money in businesses that rely on the government making energy more expensive. Clinton was able to escape from her administration post without rendering a verdict. [65 percent of respondents in a WaPo/ABC news poll support constructing the Keystone Pipeline XL] BUBBA TOOK BIG BUCKS FROM STRUGGLING HOSPITALWashington Times: \u201c[Former President] Bill Clinton accepted a $225,000 speaking fee from the nonprofit Washington Hospital Center smack in the middle of two big rounds of layoffs in 2012 \u2014 one of a number of tax-exempt organizations that have paid big money to hear the former president talk.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host on why Clinton's policies haven't sparked a movement like rival Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton\u2019s grip on the nomination is hardly threatened by Bernie Sanders winning West Virginia. But she sure is having trouble generating excitement. And the reason has to do with her incremental approach to the presidency. It may be sensible and realistic, but it\u2019s a snooze. While Sanders is drawing huge crowds who are feeling the Bern, Clinton is running a position-paper campaign -- that is, when she\u2019s not deflecting the latest broadside from Donald Trump. Maybe that helps explain why she\u2019s won 23 states and he\u2019s won 19, although hers are much bigger and have given her a virtually insurmountable delegate lead. Clinton\u2019s not-so-subtle argument running against Trump is that she\u2019s a tested leader who wouldn\u2019t do crazy stuff. But much of what she talks about is tweaking government\u2014and tweaking doesn\u2019t get the voters\u2019 pulse rate up. Take a release I got the other day on Clinton\u2019s \u201cbold new goal\u201d: Limiting child-care costs to no more than 10 percent of a family\u2019s income. She would boost the salaries of child-care workers by creating the Respect And Increased Salaries for Early Childhood Educators (RAISE) initiative. She would increase child care on campuses by spending $235 million more on the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program (CCAMPIS). She would give student parents scholarships of up to $1,500 through the Student Parents in America Raising Kids (SPARK) program. All this sound like more bureaucracy and more federal spending, if not at the wildly expensive Sanders free-college-for-all level. As the Washington Post smartly noted the other day, Clinton would crack down on Wall Street by expanding a regulatory form\u2014one that is already 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out. Clinton wants to give students a tax credit worth up to $2,500, the paper noted, if they fill out Form 1098-T and Form 8863 and make a series of calculations. On some issues, like free trade, Sanders has pulled her to the left. And she veered left the other day on health care, where Bernie famously doesn\u2019t think ObamaCare goes far enough and wants a single-payer health system run by the government. Clinton this week came out for a public option that would give those 50 or 55 and up the opportunity to buy into the Medicare program, which would be a large step toward government-run health care\u2014and miles from what she pushed as first lady. She is the opposite of a bumper-sticker candidate. She uses many words but rarely utters memorable phrases. Trump, of course, is having his own stutter-steps on policy. Having proposed a massive tax cut that by some estimates would add up to $10 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, his campaign has asked CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow and former Wall Street Journal writer Stephen Moore for suggestions on bringing down the cost. In the end, the election isn\u2019t likely to be decided on specific policy positions. He will run to her left on some issues, especially military intervention. Clinton and Trump offer dramatically contrasting styles, one a cautious creature of government, the other a bombastic businessman who denounces government. Many critics say Trump , who told the New York Times the primaries gave him a \u201cmandate\u201d to be provocative, needs to tone it down. But perhaps Hillary needs to dial it up.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host reacts to Donald Trump's trade speech and how he it succeeded in putting Hillary Clinton on the defensive Donald Trump has broken with the Republican Party. Not in terms of renouncing his party label. Not in terms of joint fundraising. Not in terms of the Cleveland convention, although many GOP luminaries will be staying away, including the only two living Republican ex-presidents. No, Trump is parting company with decades of Republican religion on free trade\u2014and that dramatizes how he is a different kind of nominee with an appeal to many working-class Democrats. (And by the way, the new Quinnipiac poll showing him trailing Hillary Clinton by just 2 points may or may not be an outlier, but it has upset the conventional media wisdom that she has a huge lead and he\u2019s hanging on by his fingernails.) I\u2019ve been arguing for a year that Trump is serving a mixed ideological buffet that includes some moderate and even liberal fare. This is why many traditional GOP conservatives oppose him, but it\u2019s also why he exerts a strong pull on white working-class Democrats. And it\u2019s why Trump has been openly urging Bernie Sanders supporters to get behind him. It\u2019s certainly not because of his stance on social issues. The Supreme Court disappointed conservatives this week by striking down a Texas law that had forced many of the state\u2019s abortion clinics to close, and the Trump campaign made no comment. Trump has also taken the classic Democratic stance on making no changes to Social Security and Medicare, despite growing concern that these entitlement programs eventually face insolvency. But trade is emerging as one of Trump\u2019s signature issues. He has always hit hard against trade with China, but he tied together many economic threads in a scripted speech this week, denouncing global trade as \u201ca rape of our country.\u201d And the media sat up and took notice. Politico\u2019s lead: \u201cDonald Trump doubled down on economic populism and protectionism in a speech Tuesday, effectively taking conservative orthodoxy on free trade and tossing it onto the trash pile rising behind him.\u201d The Washington Post put it this way: \u201cDonald Trump on Tuesday channeled more than a year\u2019s worth of fiery and freewheeling protectionist rhetoric into an uncharacteristically disciplined address, putting him out of step with decades of conservative economic orthodoxy and even some of his own prior positions.\u201d Among other things, Trump challenged Clinton to oppose passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in any form\u2014a point reinforced in an email to reporters yesterday: \u201cClinton now weakly says she only has issues with the TPP \u2018currently...in its current form,\u2019 politician-speak for saying she will approve it at the very earliest opportunity.\u201d This is a strong issue for Trump for a variety of reasons. A good chunk of the American public believes we\u2019re getting screwed by bad trade deals. Unlike on other issues, such as abortion, Trump has been consistent on the subject, even criticizing Japanese trade back in the 1980s. \u201cThey dump the cars and the VCRs and everything else,\u201d he told David Letterman. And it is a prickly issue for Clinton. Her husband pushed through NAFTA back in 1993\u2014with the help, it is often forgotten, of many congressional Republicans. Clinton strongly supported the TPP as secretary of State. And yet, under pressure from Sanders, she backed away from that trade pact during the primaries, expressing various reservations without totally abandoning it. The Democrats, who champion labor unions, have always been conflicted on trade, since it costs some of their supporters jobs as factories and production move abroad. But the Republicans have been staunch supporters of free trade, as Mitt Romney was in 2012. And that\u2019s why the Chamber of Commerce immediately criticized Trump\u2019s speech, insisting that \u201ccontrary to rumor, the benefits of trade greatly outweigh the costs.\u201d Donald Trump is not a Chamber of Commerce Republican. That should be clear by now. His stances on immigration and terrorism tend to be divisive, but his position on trade reinforces his argument that the system is rigged against average Americans. The media seemed mainly amused by the fact that Trump delivered his speech in front of a wall of garbage. But this is far from a garbage issue for his campaign.",

            "article_content": "Republicans slam the administration for wasting billions on a flawed system; Rich Edson reports on 'Special Report' ObamaCare will reduce work hours equivalent to 2 million jobs in the next decade amid a host of incentives not to work or to work less, a new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report says -- the latest blow to President Obama\u2019s signature health insurance plan. The report estimates the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, will make the labor supply shrink by 0.86 percent in 2025. This amounts to a shrinkage equivalent to approximately 2 million full-time workers. The nonpartisan CBO estimates that the decline will come primarily due to workers responding to changes made by the law to federal programs and tax policy. The agency points to the introduction of health care subsidies tied to income as a key factor -- which in turn raises effective tax rates as someone\u2019s earnings rise, therefore reducing the amount of work Americans choose to do. \u201cSubsidies decline as income increases, reducing the return on earning additional income,\u201d the report says. \u201cThat decline is effectively an increase in recipients\u2019 effective marginal tax rate, so it generally reduces their work incentives through the substitution effect.\u201d Since the subsidies also reduce the burdens attached to unemployment, the CBO predicts that the law will create additional \u201cwork disincentives\u201d for those who are unemployed for part of the year. It concludes that the exchange subsidies will contribute to half of the overall reduction of the labor supply. The report also points to direct taxes, such as ACA\u2019s hike of the payroll tax on high earners for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Program, as a reason for discouraging some from working. Another pressure on wages will come from the employer mandate, which imposes a penalty on employers if they have more than 50 employees and do not provide insurance. The CBO predicts that within a few years this charge will be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages. In what will be seen as a positive by ObamaCare\u2019s supporters, the CBO predicts that a contributing factor to the shrinkage in the labor force will be the consequence of insurance subsidies that will make it easier for some people to stop working, or work less, without losing health insurance. \u201cSome people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\u201d the report says. Republicans hailed the report as yet more proof the controversial law is not working. \u201cWhen the President\u2019s health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases health care premiums and taxes, it\u2019s clear the law is not working for the American people,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement. \u201cThe CBO\u2019s latest report confirms yet another broken promise and negative consequence stemming from ObamaCare,\u201d Hatch said. Unfortunately, until Democrats and the president are willing to address these failures, the American people will be left to stomach the devastating side effects of this ill-advised health law.\u201d The report comes at an awkward time for the Obama administration: just days after the Senate passed a bill that would repeal key parts of the law. The White House has said that President Obama will veto the legislation.",

Consider: Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has caused an eruption on Planet Hillary after refusing to back down from his claim that former President Bill Clinton is a \u201csexual predator\u201d because of his assignations with a 22-year-old intern in the Oval Office. Subsequent to Paul\u2019s doubling and then tripling down on the claim, the former president announced that he would head to Paul\u2019s home state later this month to campaign for a Democratic Senate candidate \u2013 a sure sign that the former president doesn\u2019t want anyone thinking that Paul has him cowed. The husband of the 2016 Democratic frontrunner is on a collision course with a leading contender for the 2016 GOP nomination, and it\u2019s all over Bubba\u2019s mid-1990s sexcapades. Time bomb - A timely moment, then, for the Washington Free Beacon to share details of previously unpublished memos and archive material from Diane Blair, a longtime friend of 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. The document cache is a trove of goodies for opposition researchers, with insights on many of the Clintons\u2019 most famous scandals. Why do such things exist? The Beacon explains: \u201cDiane Blair\u2019s husband, Jim Blair, a former chief counsel at Tyson Foods Inc. who was at the center of \u201cCattlegate,\u201d a 1994 controversy involving the unusually large returns Hillary Clinton made while trading cattle futures contracts in the 1970s, donated his wife\u2019s papers to the University of Arkansas Special Collections library in Fayetteville after her death [in 2000].\u201d The files have only recently been opened to the public and never explored by any media outlets. Would you rather be \u2018slick\u2019 or \u2018ruthless\u2019? - \u201cOn May 12, 1992, Stan Greenberg and Celinda Lake, top pollsters for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, issued a confidential memo. The memo\u2019s subject was \u2018Research on Hillary Clinton.\u2019 Voters admired the strength of the Arkansas first couple, the pollsters wrote. However, \u2018they also fear that only someone too politically ambitious, too strong, and too ruthless could survive such controversy so well.\u2019 Their conclusion: \u2018What voters find slick in Bill Clinton, they find ruthless in Hillary.\u2019 On spinning intern sex - \u201cOn July 28, 1997, President Clinton was facing yet another wave of allegations from yet another woman. Kathleen Willey had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her, and Blair faxed a Drudge Report item about her claims to one of the president\u2019s aides. Blair\u2019s handwritten note attached to the story: \u201cDo we take Matt Drudge seriously?\u2019 Six months later, Drudge would break the story of an affair between Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky\u2026When Clinton finally admitted to the relationship after repeated denials, Hillary\u00a0 Clinton defended her husband in a phone call with Blair. She said her husband had made a mistake by fooling around with the \u2018narcissistic loony toon\u2019 Lewinsky, but was driven to it in part by his political adversaries, the loneliness of the presidency, and her own failures as a wife.\u201d \u2018Whiney women\u2019 - \u201cIn a Dec. 3, 1993, diary entry, Blair recounted a conversation with the first lady about \u201cPackwood\u201d \u2013 a reference to then-Sen. Bob Packwood, an influential Republican on health care embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal. \u2018HC tired of all those whiney women, and she needs him on health care,\u2019 wrote Blair. \u2018I told her I\u2019d been bonding w. creeps; she said that was the story of her whole past year\u2019\u2026Days after President Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, the first lady called Blair in good spirits, telling her friend that, \u2018Most people in this town have no pain threshold\u2026\u2019\u201d \u2018Single-payer necessary\u2019 - \u201c\u2018At dinner, [Hillary] to [Bill] at length on the complexities of health care \u2013 thinks managed competition a crock; single-payer necessary; maybe add to Medicare\u2026As the First Lady prepared to testify before Congress in September 1993, Blair wrote that \u2018she\u2019s begun to see that they don\u2019t really care about the issues but want to feel they\u2019re part of the process. So she\u2019s slobbering over their \u2018craft\u2019 as she testifies.\u2019 Hillary Clinton\u2019s testimony is seen in retrospect as the high point of her failed health care campaign.\u201d \u2018IT\u2019S MY SPEECH\u2019: HILLARY SHUNNED BUBBA\u2019S EDITSThe Hill: \u201cHillary Clinton refused to allow her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to alter her 2008 Democratic Convention speech \u2026according to\u2026 the soon-to-be-released \u2018HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton\u2019\u2026 \u2018While she had been on the mock stage at the convention center, Bill had delivered edits. He had ripped up the structure and added some of his own poetic flourishes... But Hillary was having none of it. Bill and the set of advisors she had hired from his 1996 campaign had proved disastrous at developing her message and strategy for the campaign. She was the one in the hot seat now \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s my speech,\u2019 she declared as she left to find [Bill].\u201d In orbit - From New York magazine\u2019s weird interview with Hillary\u2019s lead attack dog, Philippe Reines: \u201cI think she\u2019d be better off not hiring anyone [for the 2016 campaign] over the age of 35\u2026 And I think they should all be on a barge or on some kind of orbital platform that can only transmit to the Earth and not receive from it.

You come back to Earth the day after the election.\u201d KEY OBAMACARE CONTRACTOR HAS ETHICS WOES\u201cAccenture, the contractor hired to fix ongoing problems with the federal health exchange website, has been heavily criticized by some of its largest clients, including federal agencies, according to a published report. The Washington Post reports that the U.S. Postal Service Inspector General's Office recommended this past June that the agency consider terminating more than $200 million in contracts with Accenture. The recommendation cited an \u2018absence of business ethics\u2019 by the firm, including a 2011 settlement with the Justice Department to resolve allegations of \u2018kickbacks\u2019 and \u2018bid-rigging\u2019 in federal contracts. Accenture, which paid $63 million to resolve the claims, denied the allegations.\u201d More [Fox News: \u201cThe glitches and other problems with the ObamaCare website that sparked a national firestorm are similar to those military veterans using the federal government\u2019s online benefits system have routinely faced for about the past 18 months\u2026\u201d ] Obama regulatory backlog grows - Daily Caller: \u201cTwenty-eight significant Obamacare regulations are still waiting for approval, according new study from the free-market American Action Forum (AAF), including five-month old rules surrounding the individual mandate. \u2026The IRS itself may soon be struggling to get ready for its own\u2026[ObamaCare] responsibilities in time.

[WSJ: \u201cHospitals backed the health-care law because it promised to create new, paying customers.

Ra\u00fal Labrador [R-Idaho], Michele Bachmann [R-Minn.], Justin Amash [R-Mich.], and Thomas Massie [R-Ky.]\u00a0The move, which has not been endorsed or floated by House leadership, would require either the majority of Republican members to vote \u2018present\u2019 or have a handful of Republicans vote \u2018yes\u2019 with Democrats to have such a bill clear the House\u2026 Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, said that\u2026 Republicans shouldn\u2019t \u201cshoot for the moon,\u201d but fight for something they see as achievable \u2014 like approval of the Keystone pipeline\u2026 It\u2019s the \u2018vote no, hope yes\u2019 caucus,\u2019 he added.\u201d [George Will and radio host Laura Ingraham had a fiery exchange over immigration during \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d watch the debate courtesy of Daily Caller.] WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...National Review\u2019s Kevin Williamson considers Men at Work: \u201cThe diversity of human interests, human desires, and human abilities is in effect infinite, and so too, therefore, are the uses of labor and opportunities for employment.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will lay out his vision for education reform in a speech this afternoon at Miami-Dade College. Rubio will share his own personal experience of carrying over $100,000 in student loans when he was first sworn in as a senator. The potential 2016 candidate will offer his plan for making higher education work, including income-based repayment options for education loans. From Fox News First\u2019s early glimpse of Rubio\u2019s prepared remarks - \u201cThose with the right advanced education are making more than ever. But those that do not are falling farther and farther behind. The result is a growing opportunity gap between haves and have-nots, those who have advanced education and those who do not. And if we do not reverse that trend, we will lose the upward mobility that made America exceptional\u2026The problem is that we are trying to prepare people for the new economy using a higher education system built for the old economy. As a result, many high-skilled, high-paying industries suffer from a shortage of labor, while too many low-paying industries suffer from a surplus\u2026For millions of Americans trapped in low-paying jobs or at risk of dropping out of school, higher education may be the only way they will ever be able to move to a better paying job. What they need is more affordable degrees or career education options that are tailored to their specific needs and talents\u2026\u201d Tech surge - \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t our education system found a way to harness [free online learning] and allow it to count toward a person\u2019s post-secondary education? The answer is that we have a broken accreditation system that favors established institutions while blocking out new, innovative and more affordable competitors. \u2026 Reforming this biased and broken system is crucial to opening broad, innovative pathways to higher education for all Americans\u2026Enacting these and other innovative policies to reform higher education should be among our most urgent priorities. Because what is at stake is our very identity as an exceptional nation. \u2026 But just like the industrial revolution at the turn of the last century, this new era offers the real opportunity to build the great American middle class.\u201d CHRISTIE GETS COLD SHOULDER FROM ILLINOIS GOPWith a good shot to reclaim the governorship this fall amid the state\u2019s fiscal collapse under Democratic control, Illinois Republicans are hoping New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., won\u2019t leave any baggage when he comes to Chicago Tuesday for a fundraiser. Christie is coming for long-scheduled events for the Republican Governors Association, of which he became chairman shortly before his embroilment in a scandal surrounding dirty tricks used by his aides as part of his re-election bid last year. While Democrats will be deploying operatives to the Chicago to whip up as much media attention for the Christie visit as possible, none of the GOP contenders showed any interest in rubbing elbows with their fellow GOPer. From the Chicago Sun-Times: \u201cBrian Sterling, a spokesman for Illinois Treasurer Dan Rutherford, said \u2018he knows nothing about the event and is not involved in any way.\u2019\u201d PRYOR LOOKS FOR COVER ON VETS VOTESenate Democrats today will start an effort to get back on offense after months of hiding out from ObamaCare. First on the docket is a bill to eliminate reductions to cost-of-living increases in veteran\u2019s benefits sponsored by embattled Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. It\u2019s nearly identical to legislation from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., which Pryor and his fellow Democrats blocked as an amendment to a budget deal last year. The only difference is that Pryor\u2019s plan uses deficit spending for the $6 billion rather than reallocated funds from other programs. Even if the Pryor deficit-spending version doesn\u2019t pass, it will allow him to muddy the water in Arkansas about his vote against the Sessions amendment. That\u2019s particularly important given that Pryor\u2019s likely opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hey, look over here - National Journal outlines the effort for vulnerable Democrats to use Senate votes to go trolling for midterm voters back home: \u201cAlso this week, the Senate might take up a bill cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The Bipartisan Sportsmen\u2019s Act has a number of provisions, including one that permits electronic duck stamps and exempts lead fishing tackle from certain regulations. Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska has come to the fore as a leading proponent of the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue that divides the Democratic caucus\u2026 Sen. Mary Landrieu, who faces a tough contest in Louisiana against GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, helped pass a bipartisan bill that prevents flood-insurance premiums from spiking. It's an issue that provides her a point of contrast with the White House, which has said it opposes parts of the law\u2014though it stopped short of saying the president would veto the legislation.\u201d COBURN BACKS SASSE IN NEBRASKA GOP PRIMARYRetiring Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., may be staying silent on his preference in the increasingly crowded field of Republican candidates hoping to replace him, but Coburn did speak up about the marquee GOP Senate matchup in Nebraska. Coburn is backing Midland University President Ben Sasse, citing the work the two did together when Sasse was in Washington a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration. Coburn made his endorsement in an interview with the Lincoln Journal Star: \u201cRepublican conservative icon Tom Coburn [R-Okla.] phoned last week to express his support for Ben Sasse in Nebraska's Republican Senate race\u2026 \u2018I had a lot of interaction with Ben when he was at HHS and found he has unbelievable character,\u2019 Coburn said. \u2018He is a totally open and honest guy who is very responsive and very responsible... If Ben was running in Oklahoma, I'd vote for him,\u2019 Coburn said.\u201d The GOP frontrunner in the race to replace retiring Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., is former state Treasurer Shane Osborn.

DO YOU KNOW PABLO?California Republican Pablo Kleinman made the rounds in Washington last week to try to convince party leaders that he\u2019s not so long of a shot in his bid to unseat longtime Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. Kleinman paid us a visit too, and he makes a very convincing argument. It\u2019s a heavily Democratic district in suburban Los Angeles, but some recent races show that Republicans can be competitive, especially given the infighting that has plagued local Democrats of late. Kleinman, a Jewish immigrant from Argentina who has become a successful Internet entrepreneur, got a glowing write-up from WaPo columnist Jennifer Rubin: \u201cAsked to describe his political leanings he says, \u2018I\u2019m socially moderate and fiscally conservative\u2019\u2026 he looks and sounds more like an international businessman than a Republican politician. \u2026 If there is to be a new kind of Republican for newer and younger Americans, Kleinman is the sort of candidate the party will need to attract. \u2018If we can show we are coherent on issues, then we can be an appealing choice\u2019\u201d OH, JOEDaily Caller\u2019s Alex Pappas reports that \u201csources close to\u201d MSNBC morning show host Joe Scarborough said he is seriously considering running for president as a Republican in 2016. Scarborough, a former Republican who represented a north Florida House district for three terms in the 1990s, rose to fame swatting his own party on the liberal cable network after leaving office. It may sound funny that such a public critic of the GOP would put his lucrative TV career on hold for a ultra-long-shot bid to lead the party he so often laments. Says Pappas: \u201cBut behind the scenes, those who know Scarborough are not laughing. It\u2019s widely believed at MSNBC \u2014 including among network brass \u2014 that Scarborough is actively mulling a presidential bid, sources said.\u201d [Ed. note: There are such people as \u201csources close\u201d to morning television hosts? Hey, Brian Kilmeade, who do you have on your roster?] LE PEW, PARTY OF ONE President Obama and his French counterpart Francois Hollande are visiting Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello today and are touting their unity as liberals and international interventionists in a joint op-ed.

But today is the day that he has promised to provide some context and details of the new military campaign, which remains a point of great concern across the political spectrum. The move to announce and eventually commence an escalated air war against the Islamist army known as ISIS may have stopped Obama\u2019s recent slide in support, which intensified after Obama\u2019s ill-advised Aug. 20 golf outing following a statement in which he said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d about the beheading of an American captive. But misgivings abound. Today, the president gives the speech at the United Nations that Obama and his team have said would provide the context and details for this new military campaign. [We hope it was at least an Americano - Daily Caller: \u201cPresident Barack Obama returned a formal military salute with a one-handed coffee-cup salute Tuesday, only a few hours after he dispatched the nation\u2019s military on their attack mission into northern Syria. White House aides posted the sloppy salute video on\u00a0Instagram.\u201d] Neither fish nor foul - The administration has set huge expectations for the president\u2019s speech today in a bid to buy time to work out some kind of strategy that might appease voters who still believe that the president begins this latest military mission without a clear aim toward victory. Those opposed to military intervention see the president stumbling to war under political pressure while more hawkish Americans are deeply skeptical that Obama will actually reverse his prior mistakes in Libya and Afghanistan and commit the resources and energy necessary to make the Syria war a success. [Time: \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s war against ISIS has come a long way from Sinjar Mountain\u2026. warfare has pulled hard at Obama ever since. And the record so far leaves little reason to think it\u2019s finished with him.\u201d]Tough crowd - But the venue the president has chosen to lay out his vision for the war will make his task much harder. It must have sounded good when his team was in full damage-control mode to buy a bit of time and push questions forward to a grand address in a grand setting. When we see the advance hints at what the president will say, however, we get a clear sense that he is not comfortable drawing hard lines in front of an international community. Remember, the majority at the UN is deeply resentful of American power, and the international community that once saw Obama as a departure from decades of past American militarism and celebrated his coming as a repudiation of the past is not going to cheer at the news of more air strikes. If the president gets up and makes what sounds like a scattershot approach \u2013 sweeping by Ebola, global warming and income inequality \u2013 he might mute the anxieties of his audience in New York, but he will certainly leave Americans more skeptical.WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Happy birthday, Supreme Court! The Judiciary Act \u00a0landed on President George Washington\u2019s desk on this day in 1789. With his signature, Washington established the tribunal made up of six, not nine, justices who were to serve on the court until death or retirement. The first set of judges included John Jay as chief justice, and John Rutledge, William Cushing, John Blair, Robert Harrison, and James Wilson to be associate justices. All of the appointments were confirmed by the Senate in just two days. The first term, held at the Royal Exchange Building in New York City, proved of little consequence as the court had no docket and made no decisions. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

But with underwater job approval numbers in states with key races like 34 percent (Louisiana), 38 percent (Iowa) and 39 percent (North Carolina), what he can mostly do is stay away. Less than six weeks to go in a campaign season that has seen vulnerable Senate Democrats shy away or in open rebellion with the president, not surprising is a report that Obama is planning to trim back on a tentative October campaign calendar that already has him visiting only deep blue states and just one competitive Senate contest, Michigan. \u201cIn just the past few weeks, the list of expected stops has shrunk, with several campaigns that were requesting the president as recently as late August now pulling back those requests,\u201d Politico reports.

Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. The DSCC ad promotes Udall as a candidate for liberty and freedom while supporting women\u2019s rights and raising the minimum wage. The NEA ad features several Hispanic voters talking about education and dreams for their children while hitting Gardner on his immigration record.DSCC HITS COTTON ON MEDICAREThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee hits Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., in this ad on his stance on Medicare reform, with a woman saying, \u201cHe voted to cut Medicare he wants to make it a voucher, and he\u2019d make our prescriptions more expensive.

Jim Webb said Tuesday that he is \u2018seriously\u2019 considering a run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. During an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Webb, a decorated Vietnam veteran\u00a0 and former Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, said that he will continue to have discussions over the comings months \u2018among people I respect and trust\u2019 about a White House run. \u2018I am seriously looking at the possibility of running for president,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Webb\u00a0said. \u201cWe want to see if there is a\u00a0support\u00a0base for people who would support the programs that we are interested in pursuing.\u2019\u201dOLIGARCH BUBBLE WRAP Daria Radionova was looking for a way to keep up with the drivers of the exotic and luxury cars that dominate London\u2019s Knightsbridge district, home to the oligarch set that swarms to the city from the Middle East and Russia. Radinova, a 21-year-old described the Daily Mail as a \u201cbusiness student\u201d from Russia, didn\u2019t call home asking for a new Lotus or Bugatti, instead she got her current ride, a 2011 Mercedes CLS 350, covered entirely with Swarovski crystals. \u201c'The people who did it came over from Russia and worked for 12 hours a day for two months on the car,\u201d she bragged to the Daily Mail, to which she showed off to photographers.

The startup has figured out a way to offer cheaper prescriptions even to people without insurance A New York startup company wants to make the process of obtaining prescription drugs easier and cheaper for patients across the nation\u2014 including those people who don\u2019t have health insurance. Blink Health, founded by brothers Geoffrey and Matthew Chaiken, boasts savings of up to 95 percent on more than 15,000 different medications including Prilosec, Propecia and Xanax. To start, patients log on to the website BlinkHealth.com and search for their prescription by typing in the drug name. Once Blink Health finds the drug, patients pay for it online or through an app, and obtain a Blink Card which acts as a proof of purchase. Patients can then present the card to their local pharmacist when picking up their prescription and pay nothing at the pharmacy. The website requires no membership fees and allows patients to cancel purchases at any time. The Chaikens said 50 percent of prescription drugs the website offers are less than $10 and that even with a strong insurance plan it\u2019s possible to save more through Blink Health. The company says it keep costs low through collective purchasing. For more information, visit BlinkHealth.com.",

DESPERATION DROVE OBAMA STUMBLE ON BERGDAHLWhy did Team Obama so badly botch the publicity of the release of five Islamist militant leaders in exchange for an accused Army deserter? The deal was sure to have been controversial, but might have, if done with humility and a low-key approach, engendered respect. Instead, the publicity blitz backfired on the administration. New Fox News polling explains how the struggling White House team ended up here, with Democrats in open rebellion and President Obama\u2019s old rivals in Hillaryland taking potshots at his judgment? Desperation seems to be the thing. After a damaging turn with the revelation of widespread abuse of veterans at government hospitals and deepening concerns about the administration\u2019s foreign policy setbacks in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the president\u2019s previous strong suits are a shambles. The desire to return to the high point of his presidency, the killing of Usama bin Laden and subsequent Afghan drawdown, was understandable. But with a milky foreign policy speech at West Point, N.Y. and then the accused deserter PR fiasco, Obama finds himself in even worse position. But the poll shows us why he got greedy for a big win. [No sale - A classified White House briefing Wednesday for Senators, many bruised over the administration\u2019s go-it-alone deal with the Taliban, apparently fell flat. Fox News: \u201c[M]any said the briefing did little to quell their concerns, with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., saying he left the briefing with more questions than answers.\u2026] Worse than Bush - The latest Fox News poll shows Obama\u2019s job approval on foreign policy, previously his most reliably good measure, slipping to the bottom of the heap, with just 36 percent approval, lower even than on the economy and health care, his perennial weak spots. But what ought to truly terrify Democrats who are running for office is that a president whose unofficial foreign motto was recently revealed to be \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid sh*t\u201d is widely seen as incompetent. Obama was viewed as less competent than both of his predecessors, with a 48-percent plurality saying that Obama\u2019s administration is less competent than that of George W. Bush, including 18 percent of Democrats. That\u2019s dire, given Bush\u2019s low ratings on those issues at this point in his tenure. Worse still, the poll shows that 55 percent of voters, including 53 percent of female voters, believe the president has made America less safe. [The survey, which was taken before full details had emerged about ransomed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s alleged desertion and the dangers posed by the released Taliban members were widely known, showed split opinion on support for the deal. But as to the question of whether negotiating with the Islamist terrorist group would encourage more American hostages to be taken, 84 percent agreed.] And kind of like Nixon - George Will: \u201cThe 44th president, channeling - not for the first time - the 37th (in his post-impeachment conversation with David Frost), may say: \u2018When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u2019 Already the administration says events dictated a speed that precluded complying with the law. \u2026 This episode will be examined by congressional committees, if they can pierce the administration's coming cover-up, which has been foreshadowed by the response to congressional attempts to scrutinize the politicization of the Internal Revenue Service. If the military stalls on turning over files to Congress pertaining to the five years of Bergdahl's absence, we will at least know that there is no national institution remaining to be corrupted.\u201d Kelly File: White House \u2018Swift Boat\u2019 charge gets broadside from the right - Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., told Fox News host Megyn Kelly Wednesday allegations by administration aides that Sgt.

He betrayed that. That is the most sacred trust you have in the military.\u201d Watch the full interview \u00a0courtesy of the \u201cKelly File.\u201d And volley from the left - On MSNBC, staunch Obama defender Chris Matthews cried, \u201cWait a minute! The swift boating of\u00a0John Kerry\u00a0was a dishonest PR campaign!\u201d Matthews continued, \u201cWhere\u2019s the dishonesty in the portrayal of Bergdahl so far? I haven\u2019t seen it. What\u2019s been misconstrued about him so far?\u201d The Judge\u2019s Ruling: unfaithful to duty - New Today at Fox News Opinion Judge Andrew Napolitano asks Can President Obama faithfully enforce the laws?: \u201cThe president has a serious problem with competence and with fidelity to his oath. In one week, he has alienated and demoralized much of the intelligence community by revealing the true name of one of them and by releasing their worst nightmare back into the theater of Middle East warfare. He has, as well, flagrantly failed to enforce federal law by materially aiding a non-state terrorist group condemned by American law. This is almost inconceivable in an American president.\u201d HILLARY HAMMERED ON WALL STREET TIESFormer Gov. Brian Schweitzer, D-Mont., who is continuing to paint himself as a liberal alternative to Hillary Clinton, laced into the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, telling Time magazine, \u201cYou can\u2019t be the candidate that shakes down more money on Wall Street than anybody since, I don\u2019t know, Woodrow Wilson, and be the populist. You can\u2019t be the one to say we\u2019re going to focus on rebuilding America if you voted to go to the Iraq war. There were 30 some Democrats who voted against that.\u201d Asked what questions Democrats should be asking in choosing their 2016 nominee Schweitzer wasn\u2019t subtle: \u201cAre we going to choose more leadership that is going to roll over and get scratched on the belly by corporations like a fat dog?\u201d And what would Schweitzer\u2019s strategy be if he decides to take on the Team Hillary? \u201cLook, if you wanted to make a big machine that matches the machine that is likely to be built around Hillary then you would have to have started eight years ago. But if the outcome is always known with a superior slow moving army then we would still be part of England and we would still have a king,\u201d\u00a0he said. Load \u2018em up - As the blitz surrounding release of Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cHard Choices\u201d goes into overdrive, Ready for Hillary will take to the highway in a bus, shadowing the 2016 frontrunner coast-to-coast. Dubbed the \u201cHillary Bus,\u201d the group said they plan to follow Clinton on to several locations on her book tour, with additional stops at college campuses and state fairs. Ready for Hillary called the bus a \u201cmobile advertisement allowing our organization to reach new supporters in every corner of America,\u201d as they plan to enlist a \u201cgrassroots army of supporters who are encouraging her to run.\u201d While no schedule for the tour has been released, the bus does have its own Twitter account that says it is \u201cgetting ready to fire up the engine.\u201d Putin talks Hillary: \u2018Maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman\u2019 - Russian PresidentVladimir Putin offered his own critique of Hillary Clinton during an interview with French press Tuesday. According to the English transcript, released by the Kremlin Wednesday, Putin criticized Clinton for being \u201cweak.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better not to argue with women,\u201d said the Russian president. \u201cBut Ms. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements. Still, we always met afterwards and had cordial conversations at various international events. I think even in this case we could reach an agreement. When people push boundaries too far, it\u2019s not because they are strong but because they are weak. But maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman.\u201d [The latest Fox News poll finds Clinton getting a boost in favorability, 54 percent view her favorably while 43 percent do not. That is up five points from an April poll.] Team Clinton goes after NYT - Washington Free Beacon: \u201cSome of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest aides blasted the New York Times for what they said was unfair coverage of the former first lady during a recent secret meeting with the paper\u2019s Washington bureau\u2026Sources said the meeting included Clinton advisers Philippe Reines and Huma Abedin, as well as Times Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan and national political reporter Amy Chozick, who has been on the Clinton beat for the paper.

It\u2019s the final resting place of 9,387 American men who died in the Normandy invasion, which began 70 years ago. Time is quickly robbing us of first-person recollections of the most audacious successful amphibious invasion in history. D-Day is longer ago for Americans living today than the end of the military occupation of the South following the Civil War was for the Americans of 1944. The grass has done its work. As you go about your business today, please take a moment to imagine the feelings of your countrymen on the eve of the invasion. Men who would soon be standing on the pitching deck of a tiny landing craft, hearing the sound of German bullets ricocheting off of the metal bow in front of them. And if you will excuse us for being preachy, please also consider whether what we as citizens and as a society are doing is worthy of their sacrifices. It isn\u2019t worth much for us to be in awe of their courage if we\u2019re not making the best use of the liberty they helped secure. Remember, gratitude is an action word.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., poised to win his party nomination outright on Tuesday and the runoff in Mississippi looking increasingly like a foregone conclusion, attention is shifting to Oklahoma\u2019s June 24 Senate primary as the next example of the ongoing range war between the Republican establishment and conservative outside groups. The race has just turned ugly and it looks from a distance to be a reprise of May\u2019s Nebraska contest that featured an establishment-backed candidate versus one with insurgent support. In this version, former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon is the outside man, while Rep. James Lankford, R-Okla., is playing the inside game to win the seat being vacated by the retirement of conservative hero Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. As the primary approaches and national reporters look to rekindle the once-fading narrative of Republican civil war, the focus is shifting to Oklahoma. But does the outside-inside definition really fit in the Sooner State? [New On Fox News Radio - Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. is facing a six-way primary challenge next week in the Palmetto State. Listen to this week\u2019s Balance of Power Podcast for a preview of the race and more fallout from Tuesday\u2019s primaries.] Mixed up - Outside groups backing Shannon have touted polls they say show the former House speaker surging past the two-term congressman from Oklahoma City. But a poll from a pro-Lankford group says quite the opposite, showing the congressman up by 22 points. The Lankford campaign released another survey in late May showing him up substantially and still gaining. Lankford\u2019s strength in must-win Oklahoma County is also nothing to sneeze at. In fact, one can assume that the decision to go on the attack by Shannon\u2019s outside backers is an acknowledgement that Shannon is trailing as the primary nears. And the fact that Shannon subsequently denounced the ads running on his behalf further emphasizes the complexities of the race. Lankford, who is only in the fourth year of his first elected office and the former longtime director of a huge Baptist summer camp in the state, has the backing of outside favorites like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Benghazi select committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. A source close to the Lankford campaign declined to respond to the attack ads directly, but took strong issue with the idea that Lankford is an insider. \u201cLook, Oklahoma is an extremely conservative state and voters have two very conservative candidates to choose from,\u201d said the Lankford team member. \u201cNational reporters will say what they want, but it doesn\u2019t fit here.\u201d Dr. Maybe? - The missing piece in this race is the man who both candidates are endless invoking: Coburn himself. Coburn hasn\u2019t taken a position, and doesn\u2019t seem inclined to, which is understandable given the way he had to buck his party elders to win and remain in the House and Senate over the past 20 years. But his blessing for either of the contenders would be enormous in a state where Coburn has gone from ornery outsider to lionized leader. If Coburn\u2019s support for Nebraska GOP Senate nominee Ben Sasse changed that race, imagine what it might do at home. Neither side is ruling the possibility of last-minute support. \u201cAnyone who says they know what Dr. Coburn is going to do obviously doesn\u2019t know Dr. Coburn,\u201d said member of Lankford\u2019s team. MCDANIEL CAMPAIGN STAFFER\u2019S ACCESS TO BALLOTS PROBEDClarion-Ledger: \u201cThe Hinds County [Miss.] Sheriff's Department is investigating why three people, including a high-ranking Chris McDaniel campaign official, were found locked in the Hinds County Courthouse in Jackson [Miss.] hours after an election official says the building was closed early Wednesday morning. Hinds County Sheriff's Department spokesman Othor Cain said investigators are trying to figure out how Janis Lane, Scott Brewster and Rob Chambers entered the courthouse. They were inside until about 3:45 a.m., Cain said. Brewster is a former coordinator of presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's Mississippi operation and is currently McDaniel's campaign coalition coordinator. \u2018There are conflicting stories from the three of them, which began to raise the red flag, and we're trying to get to the bottom of it,\u2019 Cain said. \u2018No official charges have been filed at this point, but we don't know where the investigation will lead us.\u2019\u2019\u2019KINGSTON GETS GINGREYAthens Georgia Banner-Herald: \u201c[Rep.

Fox News First has a preview of the attack: \u201cTwenty-four hours after Majority Leader Harry Reid blocked Senator Mitch McConnell's Coal Country Protection Act, the \u2018Coal Makes Us Sick\u2019 Senator is ironically hosting a fundraiser to celebrate Alison Lundergan Grimes so that she can collect as many liberal campaign checks as she can get her hands on. The big dollar fundraiser undercuts Grimes\u2019 claims of independence and standing up for Kentucky coal, and reinforces the notion that she's on a different team than most Kentucky voters.\u201d PETERS PRAISES FIRM AFTER DONATION AND STOCK BUYPolitico: \u201cMichigan Senate candidate [Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich.] heaped praise on the Dow Chemical corporation\u2019s work days after buying stock in the company, which has also donated to his campaign\u2026 Responding to an audience question on cap-and-trade legislation last week, the three-term Democratic congressman used the opportunity to single out the Michigan-based firm\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy solutions\u2026 His remarks came less than two weeks after Peters purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 in Dow Chemical stock, according to a financial disclosure filed with the House of Representatives. In addition, Peters owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in Dow assets as of 2012 \u2014 the last year his full financial disclosure report is available. That same year, he reported receiving as much as $1,000\u2026 Dow also has given generously to Peters\u2019 campaign, according to federal campaign finance data.

Perhaps a free haircut would change your mind. Thailand\u2019s recently installed military regime wants its subjects to know that it\u2019s about more than just the brutal repression of peaceful protests; it\u2019s about fun, too!

(REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui) People know it is you calling when your caller ID pops up on their phone, but it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. There are two ways to keep your identity secret while making a call: one is permanent; the other is temporary on a call-by-call basis. Blocking your number temporarily only works while calling businesses and individuals. Your phone number cannot be blocked while calling toll-free numbers or emergency services. The temporary way of keeping your mobile number invisible from caller ID is as easy as 1, 2, 3. Actually, it\u2019s more like *67 and it\u2019s free. Dial that code before the phone number, and it will temporarily deactivate caller ID. On the receiving end, caller ID will usually display \u201cprivate number\u201d because it has been blocked. The process is a little more in depth if you want to permanently disable the feature. Just call your cellphone carrier and ask for a line block. Once it\u2019s done, your phone number will never appear, no matter who you call. But don\u2019t choose this option lightly because it is permanent and irreversible. The code to call your mobile carrier can vary, but customer service in the United States can usually be reached by calling 611. If you temporarily want your mobile number to appear, you can dial *82 before the number. Knowing this might be important because some people automatically decline calls from phones that block caller ID. Hide your number on an Android device 1. Open Dialer 2. Press the menu button 3. Press additional settings 4. Enter Caller ID settings 5. Choose \u201cHide number\u201d and your number will be hidden 6.

Mary Landrieu, D-La., will offer her own bill that will allow Americans to keep their existing plans. When news broke this week that the president for years led voters to believe they could keep their coverage under his insurance overhaul despite knowing otherwise, Republicans pounced offering legislation to block the Obama rules banning low-post, bare-bones coverage.\u00a0 Landrieu, facing a tough re-election fight in a Republican state, is jumping the line with a bill of her own.\u00a0 \u201cThe promise was made and it should be kept,\u201d Landrieu told the New Orleans Times-Picayune. \u201cAnd it was our understanding when we voted for that, that people when they have insurance, could keep what they had. So, I\u2019m going to be working on that fix.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is also preparing his own legislation that would delay by a full year the imposition of ObamaCare fines for those who don\u2019t buy insurance. [Daily Caller - Report: White House exerting 'massive pressure' on insurance companies to keep quiet] Crash drives Obama to new low - President Obama went to Boston to rally his supporters on behalf of his embattled law, but a new WSJ/NBC News poll shows that the failed launch of his signature law is proving a major drag with the public at large. His job approval rating skidded to 42 percent, the lowest-ever rating in the poll. That\u2019s an 11-point drop from his job approval rating following his re-election and 5 points since last month.Disapproval for the health law shot up to 47 percent, 10 points ahead of approval, double the gap from earlier this month. Scary stuff - It was a dire WSJ/NBC News poll that drove Republicans to the exits on the partial federal shutdown three weeks ago. Now it\u2019s the Democrats turn for a fright. The president\u2019s tanking poll numbers and the surge in concern over the beleaguered ObamaCare rollout will push more moderate Democrats to conclude that their best path is away from the president and his law. Shutdowns are temporary. ObamaCare is forever. DEADLINE FOR DEMS ON OBAMACARE EXEMPTIONS -Will top Democrats in Congress choose to exempt their staffs from ObamaCare? Today is the deadline for lawmakers to decide whether to grant a hugely valuable exemption to the staffs of congressional committees. House Republicans have all opted to submit themselves and their staffs to the costly provisions of the law. But as today\u2019s deadline approached, Senate Democrats appeared split on the issue. The choice could become a big issue in next year\u2019s elections. With Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and some Republicans pushing a constitutional amendment forbidding Congress from exempting itself from any laws it passes, the stakes are high. As Washington Examiner reports, an embarrassing moment in the testimony of Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, in which she repeatedly and wrongly claimed it would be \u201cillegal\u201d for her to enroll, exemptions are proving to be a hot topic.

YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL - On Wednesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel, Bing Pulse saw Republicans, Democrats, independents and women all agree with Charles Krauthammer\u2019s assertion that the ability for consumers to keep their existing\u00a0 insurance is an \u201cextremely important element\u201d of ObamaCare and that it was key to its passage. Krauthammer\u2019s remark also drew the highest viewer response, with 43,000 votes per minute. Viewers across the political spectrum disagreed with Juan Williams when he called the 5 percent of Americans losing their insurance under ObamaCare a small amount of people. Viewer interaction was high during discussion of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Congressional testimony.\u00a0 Williams drew strong and intense disagreement when he called the hearing \u201cpure theater\u201d and dismissed security concerns raised by Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., with Democrats disagreeing more than Republicans. Bing Pulse measured 260,000 viewer votes during the discussion.

CLUNKER FOR CLUNKERS - It turns out the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d program was a clunker as a job creator, energy saver and emissions reducer according to a study by the liberal Brookings Institute.\u00a0The 2009 $3 billion government sponsored car-buying voucher program cost $1.4 million for each job created, \u00a0dropped gas consumption by only \u201cabout 2 to 8 days worth of current usage,\u201d and resulted in minimal \u201cemissions reduction.\u201d DIGGING DEEP: A COAL MINER\u2019S PLEA - The impassioned plea of West Virginia coal miner David Green of Alpha Natural Resources for lawmakers to spare his industry from crippling new regulations is winning the Internet this week. Green, who is also the captain of the Coal River Mine Rescue Team, spoke before a pro-coal rally in Washington, talking of the pride he takes in his work underground: \u201cIt\u2019s not a curse. It\u2019s not a prison. It\u2019s an honor.\u201d ALL THE EGGS AND TOILET PAPER IN FARGO\u2026A mother in Fargo, N.D., has decided to strike a blow against childhood obesity by giving children she deems too fat a letter of reproach to give to their parents. WDAF provides the text of the unidentified woman\u2019s Halloween nastygram: \u201c[Your child] is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season. My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits.\u201d AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cI would say that what\u2019s really at stake here, is that if this thing really goes south, if ObamaCare truly self-destructs, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s certain but I would say right now it is more than likely, it would really set back American liberalism for a decade at least\u2026That\u2019s why I think the liberals are running scared\u2026It\u2019s not just one election, it\u2019s the whole ideology that the government knows best.\u201d --Charles Krauthammer on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch Here.

Mary Landrieu, D-La, in which Marine veteran Christopher Schiff blames her for the disruption of his family\u2019s health insurance. The ad will hit airwaves in Louisiana this afternoon, and features only Schiff speaking to the camera from what appears to be his home. The script - \u201cI did two tours in Iraq. Because of my service I was able to get a health care plan that worked for me. So I get a letter from my insurance company that said my insurance costs were going way up because of ObamaCare. And oh, by the way, you should be happy about it.\u00a0Mary Landrieu said that ObamaCare is going to make things better. Better? Not for people like me.

The centerpiece will be my leadership and ability to deliver for the people of my state, no matter who the president is.\u201d] The Boonstra affect? - The ad is similar to a spot that premiered in February and helped upend the Michigan Senate race. That ad, featuring cancer patient Julie Boonstra attacking Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., for his support of the law, set off a firestorm. While Democrats attacked Boonstra and worked to make the Koch brothers into central figures, the spots seemed to have helped likely Republican Senate nominee Terri Lynn Land get into contention and maybe even pull into the lead. Americans for Prosperity is planning an even larger ad barrage against Landrieu, an entrenched incumbent who still leads Republican frontrunner Rep. Bill Cassidy in Pelican State polls. The background on Schiff\u2019s claim from AFP - \u201cChristopher had a plan from Assurant Health/Time Insurance Company backed by the USAA. Because of Obamacare, he lost the plan that he chose and liked. That plan was cancelled because of the affordable care act, and his monthly insurance premiums for a similar Obamacare compliant plan increased.\u201d IRS COMPLAINS OF TIGHT BUDGETS, PAYS BIG BONUSES TO PROBLEM EMPLOYEESFox News: \u201cIRS employees who had been disciplined for tax and conduct issues were nonetheless rewarded with monetary awards or time off, according to a watchdog report released Tuesday. The report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that while for the most part the reward program for IRS workers complied with federal regulations, employees who had themselves failed to pay their federal taxes and had discipline problems were also rewarded\u2026 The watchdog found that in the period from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012 over 2,800 employees who had been disciplined for conduct problems, including issues with federal tax compliance, had received over $2.8 million in monetary awards and over 27,000 hours in time-off awards. Heckuva job on that launch - Washington Examiner: \u201cDespite controversial delays in Obamacare and costly problems with its healthcare.gov website, most officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were paid more last year than the year before, newly released data show. \u2026The total cost of the CMS payroll data released to the Examiner increased to more than $76 million, compared to $69 million in 2012.\u201d WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Like a good bottle of wine, research shows personalities get mellower with age.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., answered calls from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and others on the left for increased gun control in the wake of an Easter Weekend outbreak of violence in the city that left eight dead and 44 wounded. Paul, in Chicago to promote his call for school choice for children in blighted neighborhoods, told Megyn Kelly that gun control efforts were misguided, citing a \u201csickness of spirit\u201d as the cause. \u201cThere is also just a thuggishness that\u2019s out of control that no longer knows right from wrong,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s something maybe beyond government. It's spiritual. People need to be taught right and wrong, there needs to be an influence in their lives and a police presence. It's not as simple as banning guns.

Along the way, he\u2019s again voicing criticism of the current condition of the Republican Party and chiding its potential 2016 field. Though he praised former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Dole told the Wichita Eagle \u201cA number of the younger members, first-termers like Rand Paul, (Marco) Rubio and that extreme-right-wing guy - Ted Cruz? All running for president now. I don't think they've got enough experience yet.\u201d Paul told reporters: \u201cI absolutely disagree with that because I think in some ways, when you have people who are career politicians, they\u2019ve been beaten down by the system and are so part of the system that they can't see all the problems of the system.\u201dROMNEY COMES TO MCDONNELL\u2019S DEFENSEWaPo: \u201cMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has made a personal donation of $10,000 to former Virginia governor Robert F.

Kay Hagan. Brannon and Tillis jousted over immigration, ObamaCare and gun rights. In the exchange, Brannon tried to paint the state House speaker as weak, while Tillis sought to keep the focus on defeating Hagan. \u00a0Charlotte Observer reports, \u201cBrannon cited the Constitution at least 15 times in the first dozen questions, while Tillis advocated a \u2018practical conservatism\u2019 that encouraged bipartisan cooperation.\u201d The two will face off in the second debate tonight in Raleigh.

Don't be fooled,\" the remarkable ad opens with one of Bevin's nine children. The McConnell campaign shot back with a message on Twitter saying, \u2018I was waiting for \u2018My dad went to MIT!\u2019\u2019\u00a0 It\u2019s a reference to McConnell's allegation that Bevin lied on a LinkedIn page in which he claimed his education to be from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Those who resist their efforts to curb carbon emissions? Well, they\u2019re like the defenders of slavery. \u201cThe leaders of slave power were fighting a movement of dispossession.

Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the man who perhaps most aggressively represents Wall Street\u2019s interests in the Senate, was advertising a speech in which he would urge the Democratic Party to \u201cembrace government.\u201d The two entities would pretty well have to get naked to get any closer, but there\u2019s always appeal among ideologues for the belief that more ideological purity is the answer to political problems. Schumer, however, seemed a strange messenger. While there is a strong Carneysian relationship between Schumer\u2019s financial-sector constituents and a beefy federal government, Schumer is far closer to his fellow former New York Senator and Goldman-Sachs enthusiast Hillary Clinton than any of the self-styled \u201cpopulist progressives\u201d of his party. So what gives? It turns out that Schumer was making not an argument for government but for governing, a strong echo of the already emerged themes of Clinton\u2019s campaign. Schumer most notably attacked ObamaCare, not for its goals or provisions, but for the way it was introduced, passed and implemented saying that Democrats \u201cblew the opportunity the American people gave them.\u201d [Okay, so he was wrong that time - \u201cI predict \u2026 by November those who voted for healthcare will find it an asset, those who voted against it will find it a liability,\u201d --Sen.

The coming months will see more assaults on Reid, as he makes ready for a daunting re-election bid and loses his remaining clout with members who are making ready for their own races and the restoration of the House of Clinton. With Democrats feeling very certain of a Senate return to power in two years, Schumer is setting himself up as the man to be the next majority leader. In the meantime, he will look to play the part of front man for the Clintonite caucus in the Senate, weighing options of when to join Republicans in passing bills antagonistic to Obama.Power Play: The threats to Hillary\u2019s coronation in 60 seconds - The latest polls put 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton far, far ahead of her potential rival Democrats.

In just 60 seconds, Chris Stirewalt provides a rapid rundown of the challenges facing Clinton. \u00a0Watch today\u2019s Power Play here. PRESIDENT\u2019S ASTERISK STRIKES AGAINAmid heckling from immigration activists at a Chicago campaign event to celebrate his granting temporary amnesty to an estimated 5 million people in the United States illegally, a perturbed President Obama explained: \u201cBut what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law.\u201d Oops. Remember that Obama\u2019s claim for authority to grant the temporary pardon to illegal immigrants is based on an argument that he is not changing the law, but simply prioritizing the enforcement of it Perhaps sensing that he had given away too much, Obama quickly qualified his boast: \u201cThe way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally.\" Gotcha. This pretty well encapsulates the problem for a president who wants immigration activists to be grateful for a legacy-making move, but doesn\u2019t want to spook the rest of the country with worries that he is birthing new laws by caesarian section.Temporary amnesty recipients get benefits, exempt from ObamaCare - WaPo: \u201cUnder President Obama's new program to protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, many of those affected will be eligible to receive Social Security, Medicare and a wide array of other federal benefits, a White House official confirmed\u2026 \u2018If they pay in, they can draw,\u2019 White House spokesman Shawn Turner said by email. He noted, however, that the estimated 5 million immigrants granted protection from deportation will not be eligible for other federal benefits,\u00a0such as student\u00a0financial aid, food stamps\u00a0and\u00a0housing subsidies. Nor are they eligible to purchase health insurance through the federal health care exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d \u00a0House GOP floats plan to battle Obama on amnesty - Roll Call: \u201cHouse GOP leaders are likely to float a proposal in their conference next week to fund most government agencies through September 2015, while providing a shorter-term stopgap component for immigration-related programs and initiatives. The current framework, according to a few Republican aides close to the discussions, is being pushed in particular by\u00a0Tom Price, R-Ga., the incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, who has close ties to leadership and strong conservative credentials but no official affiliation with the appropriations process\u2026\u201dIN WAKE OF RIOTING, OBAMA CALLS FOR MORE MEETINGSNPR: \u201cIn a speech in which he said he understands the frustrations of people who feel they're not treated fairly under the law, President Obama also stated, \u2018I have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities.\u2019 The president had been scheduled to speak about immigration policy during his appearance at Chicago's Copernicus Community Center. But he began his remarks by calling for calm in Ferguson, Mo., responding to the fiery unrest that has followed a grand jury's decision not to charge police officer Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown. \u2026Obama also said, \u2018Nothing of benefit results from destructive acts. I've never seen a civil rights law, or a health care bill, or an immigration bill result because a car got burned.\u2019\u2026President Obama has ordered Attorney General Eric Holder to organize a series of meetings between police, community leaders and clergy.OBAMA THREATENS VETO OF BIPARTISAN TAX DEALNYT: \u201cWith negotiators nearing an accord on permanent tax breaks for businesses worth $440 billion over 10 years, President Obama rallied Democratic opposition on Tuesday and promised a veto. \u201cThe president would veto the proposed deal because it would provide permanent tax breaks to help well-connected corporations while neglecting working families,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman. The deal, negotiated by House Republicans and aides to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the outgoing majority leader, showed how much power has shifted since the Republican election victories this month\u2026The standoff has set up a high-stakes game of chicken. Some 55 tax breaks for businesses and individuals expired last year, and if they are not revived retroactively by Dec. 31, taxpayers will not be able to claim them for the current tax year. Republicans say Congress might pass a one-year retroactive measure that would simply start the fight all over again in January, when they control the Senate and their numbers are fortified in the House.\u201dReport suggests IRS may have shared data with White House - WashEx:\u201c[T]he Treasury Inspector General has identified some 2,500 documents that \u2018potentially\u2019 show taxpayer information held by the Internal Revenue Service being shared with President Obama\u2019s White House. The discovery was revealed to the group Cause of Action, which has sued for access to any of the documents.\u201dEPA DISHES OUT COSTLY EMISSIONS RULE FOR THE HOLIDAYSWSJ: \u201cThe Environmental Protection Agency is planning to announce Wednesday a sweeping federal air-pollution standard limiting ground-level ozone, or smog, in the atmosphere, according to people familiar with the plan. The proposal will likely reanimate a battle between businesses and environmental groups that has been dormant for three years. In 2011, the EPA estimated that the proposed standard\u2014set then at the toughest level the agency had yet considered\u2014could cost utilities and other businesses as much as $90 billion a year.\u201d [What will it cost you? \u2013 Bloomberg looks at what has been called the costliest EPA rule yet]Enviros push Obama to clamp down on pesticides - WashEx: \u201cOver 100 scientists worldwide, citing 800 studies, are demanding that the Obama administration follow Europe's lead and put a moratorium on the use of a new-style pesticide blamed for the deaths of 30 percent of American honeybees every year\u2026neonicotinoids are to blame for the substantial declines in honeybees, bumblebees and butterflies, all pollinators needed to help farmers produce billions of dollars worth of food every year.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick celebrates the character and life of Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel and how Havel, a former playwright and prisoner, led Czechoslovakia to freedom from Soviet rule, possessed a grace much needed in our time. \u201cHavel was a child of the Czech bourgeoisie, a lab assistant, a soldier, a stagehand, a dramatist, a moral philosopher, a dissident, a political prisoner for four years, and, finally, a President for fourteen\u2026He preferred to seize opportunities rather than to nurse grievances\u2026.In his first New Year\u2019s address to the Czech people, Havel admitted that the years of oppression had led them to live in a \u2018contaminated moral environment.\u2019 Occupation, resentment, terror, and religious hatred have done the same in a place where despair is a constant shadow. Moral leadership, a moral generosity in politics, will not resolve every question\u2014to suppose that it will is a form of sentimentality\u2014but it is an essential part of what is required in Jerusalem and beyond.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Now that two of the three initial prospective Hagel replacements floated by the White House have removed themselves, the administration appears to be moving toward, not surprisingly, core Obama insiders. Among those being considered, Fox News has learned, is Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Johnson, once General Counsel at the Pentagon, was a key player in quietly developing President Obama\u2019s go-it-alone and around Congress immigration plan. Given the unhappy run Obama has had with independent Defense chiefs, it would seem to be the logical next step for a president busy battening down the hatches. Also rumored to be in the running: Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who has been in the administration since Day One.Extension of Iran nuke talks irks former hostages - The U.S. agreement to extend nuclear negotiations with\u00a0Iran\u00a0for another seven months, has not only raised the ire of lawmakers, it has also raised alarms with the Americans held captive in the United States Embassy in Tehran for 444 days, from 1979 to 1981. NYT: \u201cAs part of the extension, Iran will continue to receive $700 million a month in funds that were frozen under Western sanctions. That is money the surviving hostages, and their families, believe could be used as a financial settlement for their captivity \u2014 a period in which they were interrogated, beaten and subjected to mock executions\u2026[T]he prospect of sending back another $4.9 billion in Iranian funds over the next seven months troubles them, particularly since they are an aging group, with a dwindling chance to be compensated for an ordeal more than three decades ago.\u201d MITT PULLS AHEAD IN NEW Q POLLA Quinnipiac poll released today shows that Republican voters want 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney back in the race, with Mitt leading all other contenders with 19 percent. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., sits in second place at 11 percent, with Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J. and Dr. Ben Carson tied at 8 percent. With Romney out of the race, Bush moves solidly into the lead, again followed by Christie and Carson. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues her dominance in the Democratic field beating out Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by a stunning 44 points, 57 percent to 13 percent. In a head to head race between Democrats and Republicans, Romney would edge out Clinton 45 to 44 percent, while Clinton beats out every other Republican challenger.Cruz puts Jeb, Christie and Mitt into the same bucket - National Review: \u201cSenator Ted Cruz [R-Texas] won\u2019t be surprised if Mitt Romney runs for president against Chris Christie, the New Jersey Republican who angered conservatives with his embrace of President Obama when Hurricane Sandy struck just days before the 2012 election. \u2018There\u2019s one bucket that, for lack of a better word, I\u2019ll call the \u2018moderate establishment\u2019 bucket. It\u2019ll be some combination of Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney,\u2019 Cruz told a group of potential donors, according to the\u00a0New York Observer.\u00a0\u2018My guess is two of the three will run. And my view is whoever\u2019s in that bucket will raise tons of money. A lot of donors will rush to write them checks. And yet if the nominee comes from that bucket, the same voters who stayed home in 2008 and 2012 will stay home again and Hillary\u2019s the winner.\u2019\u201dPortman gets snarky profile from USA Today - USA Today interviewed Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and delivered a long askance look at his \u201cpresidential dithering,\u201d e.g.: \u201cThe last election was \u2018momentous,\u2019 Portman said, and he wants the new GOP majority in Congress to \u2018really dig into some of these issues.\u2019 Fascinating, senator. So when will you be making a decision about 2016? \u2018I will be taking time to think about it now and talking to my family and talking to advisers,\u2019 Portman obliged. \u2018But I\u2019m in no rush to make a decision.\u201dAye, Carly - WaPo: \u201cOn a Republican presidential debate stage expected to be\u00a0filled with more than a dozen current and former politicians,\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0envisions herself standing out \u2014 as the only woman and the only CEO. \u2026In February, Fiorina will address the\u00a0Conservative Political Action Conference\u00a0in Washington. Helping Fiorina chart her political future are consultants\u00a0Frank Sadler, who once worked for Koch Industries, and Stephen DeMaura, a strategist who heads\u00a0Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group in Virginia.\u201dCOURT DATE FOR DISPUTED ARIZONA HOUSE RACEArizona Daily Star: \u201cAttorneys for\u00a0Ron Barber\u00a0and\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0will head into federal district court today, fighting over whether 133 rejected ballots in Congressional District 2 should be counted. The McSally campaign is asking a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by her Democratic rival on Monday, arguing Barber\u2019s campaign does not standing in the case. In filings with the federal district court here in Tucson, McSally attorney Brett W. Johnson argues the 133 rejected ballots in Congressional District 2 the Barber campaign wants counted are not enough to help Barber overcome the 161 vote lead McSally currently has in the tight race\u2026Barber attorney Kevin J. Hamilton said on Monday the campaign has so far identified 133 voters whom he said have been disenfranchised, but left the door open to supplementing the legal challenge with additional names if and when they have are identified.\u201dGROAN AND WISHBONEThe history of presidential turkey pardoning pardon is remarkably complicated, thanks stories of Tad Lincoln begging his father to spare the federal fowl, but the tradition certainly is one of the oldest at the White House. The formal process began with President George H.W. Bush in 1989 pardoning the bird and sent him to live out remaining days at the unfortunately named Frying Pan Park in Virginia. The tradition lives on, however the turkeys have since moved on to a more fowl-friendly home at Morven Park in Northern Virginia. President Obama continues the ritual this afternoon with two yet to be named birds, the pardon winner and its runner up. WaPo picks the 27 worst headline puns about presidential turkey pardons. Among the high crimes and misdemeanors against readers: \u201cFor two lucky birds, it\u2019s gravy,\u201d \u201cLame duck pardons a top turkey\u201d and \u201cThe stuffing of scandal.\u201d [Ed. note: One of my favorite Thanksgiving traditions has for decades been the annual republishing in my hometown newspaper of the same perfect column about the holiday by the late Adam Kelly, known to his readers as \u201cthe country editor.\u201d That tradition took on new meaning for me when I was privileged to have his son, Bob, a great newsman himself, as my mentor. Bob, before he died too young, taught many of us the wisdom of letting our stories and subjects do the talking and keeping ourselves out of it. And though his dad\u2019s column was very personal, it ultimately was not about him. While we might not each be able to enjoy the every blessing its author did, the sentiment and its wisdom in the column endure beyond temporary travails. Fox News First is pressing pause for the holiday and will return on Monday. In the meantime, I wish you and your families bounty and blessings, but most of all, the gift of gratitude, even in the face of challenges.]AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cHe is the attorney general of the United States and he uses the word condoned.

While Obama in Estonia yesterday expressed a desire to reduce ISIS to a \u201cmanageable\u201d problem, Vice President Joe Biden had harsher words for the group, saying, \u201cThey should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel reiterated Wednesday the threat from the Islamic State is \u201csomething we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d The cycle has persisted since the White House initiated bombing raids and troop deployments in Iraq: milky language from the White house begets pushback from the Pentagon and hawkish Dems, which in turn begets tougher lines and increased intervention from Obama. [Who started it? - Remember who started the public split on strategy? Mmhmm.] Pushed by the polls - Democrats like Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) are joining the chorus of Congressional members calling for the president to act, writing in a statement, \u201cI urge the administration to come to Congress with a clear strategy and political and military options for eliminating the ISIL threat.\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) chimed in, tweeting: \u201cDo not believe ISIL is \u2018manageable,\u2019 agree these terrorists must be chased to the \u2018gates of hell.\u2019\u201d Why\u2019s that? The latest George Washington University Battleground poll gives President Obama 51 percent disapproval overall with 58 percent disapproving of his handling of foreign policy. Gallup\u2019s latest poll shows 54 percent disapprove of Obama\u2019s foreign policy performance. Baier Tracks: A view from the ground in Iraq\u2026 - \u201cLargely overlooked in the back and forth about what is being said and done (and not done) on the strategy for dealing with ISIS are the thoughts of the U.S. troops being deployed to Iraq.\u00a0Rarely do we get a glimpse into their thoughts, but I received an email from a friend \u2013 a special operator who is in contact with his fellow soldiers who have been deployed to Iraq \u2013 that provides some insight. My friend said it would be okay to pass along what he\u2019s hearing anonymously: \u00a0\u2018I'm getting notes from the guys over in these operations centers in Iraq.\u00a0Frustration and confusion reign.\u00a0 Their commander in chief has deployed them back into harm\u2019s way with a defensive mission to only defend US facilities against ISIS, that it's not a US problem to solve, and the Iraqis must get their act together politically. \u00a0\u00a0Now today he says we are going to destroy and degrade ISIS, and in the same sentence that we are going to only manage them. \u00a0Then we have our Vice President in a Howard Dean moment.\u00a0\u00a0 My favorite quote of the day from an operator downrange \u2018Chase them to the Gates of Hell?\u00a0\u00a0 How the F$@k are we going to do that when we can't even leave the front gate of our base!?\u2019\u201d Interesting perspective from someone redeployed to Iraq.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier The Judge\u2019s ruling: A long, hot summer - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst JudgeAndrew Napolitano has returned from his August recess and recaps an arduous summer for advocates of liberty: \u201cTransparency is a disinfectant for political corruption, and a people cannot be free when the government gets away with law breaking and lying about it.\u201d WAPO: MCCASKILL BEHIND KANSAS CANDIDATE SWITCHWaPo: \u201cDemocratic nominee Chad Taylor dropped out of the race for U.S. Senate in Kansas on Wednesday, an 11th hour move that could clear the way for his party to rally behind an independent candidate and potentially change the math in the battle for the Senate majority. \u2026 The move, which came on the last day for ballot changes, could clear the way for Democrats to rally behind Greg Orman, an independent candidate who has left the door open to caucusing with both parties if elected. Orman, who used to be a Democrat and a Republican, has been viewed as a more viable opponent against Sen. Pat Roberts (R), who polls show is vulnerable. Orman has been a far more productive fundraiser than Taylor.\u201d [No exit? - The Hill: \u201cDespite filing papers with the Kansas secretary of State withdrawing from the Senate race late Wednesday, Democrat Chad Taylor may be stuck on the ballot this fall. Two election law statutes have raised questions about whether Taylor gave sufficient cause to remove himself from the ballot, and, if so, whether Democrats must ultimately choose a candidate to replace him.] Howdy, neighbor - WaPo: \u201cTaylor, the Shawnee County district attorney, was in touch with at least one prominent Democrat in the days leading up to his decision. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) spoke with Taylor about dropping out of the race in order to consolidate support behind Orman in hopes of unseating Roberts, according to Democrats familiar with the talks. \u2026 In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Orman would not say which party he would caucus with if elected. He suggested that he would side with whichever party is in the majority and would consider joining both sides if he ends up being the deciding vote.\u201d [Gross violation - Wichita [Kan.] Eagle : \u201cAn actor who appeared in a campaign ad for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paul Davis was arrested on suspicion of soliciting a prostitute and was once suspended from a position at a Topeka high school for inappropriate behavior with a student, according to documents released by the Kansas Republican Party.\u201d] OBAMACARE NUMBER CRUNCHERS SEE SPIKE IN HEALTH SPENDINGDaily Caller: \u201cAccording to a report published in the journal Health Affairs by actuaries from federal Obamacare administrator the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the health-care law is contributing to a renewed boost in health care spending. The findings contradict the White House\u2019s own line on health spending, after officials attempted to claim a recent slowdown in health spending growth as a triumph of Obamacare\u2026 CMS actuaries expect health spending to climb even higher, projecting 5.6 percent growth in 2014, 4.9 percent growth in 2015 and 6.1 percent every year afterward through 2023.

DEM CHAIRWOMAN NOT BACKING DOWN ON LIKENING WALKER TO DOMESTIC ABUSERWisconsin Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mary Burke is distancing herself from Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz\u2019s attack on Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis. as being like a domestic abuser.\u00a0 Wasserman-Schultz went off on Walker in a Wisconsin campaign visit, saying \u201cScott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality.\u201d Wasserman-Schultz went on to say, \u201cWhat Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch.\" Burke spokeswoman Stephanie Wilson told Fox News, \u201cThat's not the type of language that Mary Burke would use, or has used\u2026\u201d A spokesperson for Wasserman-Schultz was unapologetic about comparing Walker to a spousal abuser and doubled down on the analogy, saying that \u201cdomestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience.\u201d THE FATHER OF THE PREPPY RIGHTS MOVEMENT The perennial prepster look of going sockless in loafers may soon have its first prisoner of conscience.

The Indianapolis Star tells the story of the lawyer who may become a prisoner of fashion: \u201c\u2018Attorney Glickfield advised the court,\u2019 the judge wrote in his order, \u2018that \u2018I hate socks\u2019 and that he's had 'this conversation with other judges in other courts.\u2019 Unless the judge could show him applicable \u2018orders or other legal authority,\u2019 the judge noted, Glickfield said \u2018he would continue his habit of appearing sockless in court.\u2019\u201d No word on how his clients feel about Glickfield\u2019s decision to fight the power of the pro-sock establishment\u2026 AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201c[President Obama] persists in calling them extremists, as if they are extremists for what reason: they're just very upset about a lot of stuff.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Rubio makes case for ObamaCare bailout blockade \u2022 Cee-Bee-Oh-No \u2022 IRS boss will get more than a smidgen of heat \u2022 Pryor goes ugly early with Medi-scare ads \u2022 Livin\u2019 la vida Putin RUBIO MAKES HIS CASE FOR OBAMACARE BAILOUT BLOCKDo Republicans have the appetite for another debt-ceiling showdown? President Obama and his fellow Democrats are betting that the red team doesn\u2019t and that House Republicans will eventually yield to an unconditional hike in the federal borrowing limit. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will make the case today that House Republicans can use the looming borrowing breach as leverage to start to unwind ObamaCare. Rubio, the lead proponent of a move to block insurance industry bailouts built into the law, will testify this morning before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee about his plan. House Speaker John Boehner has said he is open to the idea of making the debt lift contingent on blocking potentially billions of dollars in handouts to insurance firms grappling with the fallout from ObamaCare. But Boehner won\u2019t go ahead unless Republicans are united behind the plan. That\u2019s why Rubio\u2019s sales pitch today is a pretty big deal. The alternate House plan would be to leverage the debt hike for a largely symbolic move to demand what is now considered the inevitable approval of an oil pipeline from Canada. \u2013 Watch Fox: Correspondent Peter Doocy is following the hearing and considers what the provisions mean for consumers. [Gallup\u2019s latest survey finds 51 percent oppose ObamaCare and only 24 percent feel it will personally benefit them.] High stakes - Ending the bailouts could be the end of ObamaCare since insurance companies would be unlikely to remain in the program without the taxpayer subsidies to offset their guaranteed losses under the law. If they bolt, the law collapses, meaning Obama would be highly unlikely to ever sign such a bill. But if Rubio can get the House to act, he might at least be able to force a painful vote in the Senate on a provision of the law that is unpopular across the political spectrum. David Drucker explains: \u201cThe Republican leadership is informally whipping the proposal with rank-and-file members to gauge interest and determine if it\u2019s possible to corral 218 GOP votes for such a package\u2026 the strategy now, if House Republicans can agree on a plan to increase the debt ceiling, would be to act first to prevent Senate Democrats from jamming them at the last minute with a proposal that they oppose.\u201d CEE-BEE-OH-NOTeam Obama has a doozy of a hangover today from a Congressional Budget Office report that found ObamaCare will reduce the number of hours Americans work by a number equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs and add $10 trillion to federal deficits by 2024. It was always known that the entitlement program would cause some workers to quit full-time jobs in order to get health insurance subsidies, but the number in the new report is triple the original estimate. And none of that even touches on the workers who will be forced into part-time status or be laid off as companies face compliance costs. The White House tried to spin the damning report as a positive, with White House Press Secretary Jay Carney saying that American workers who give up income in order to get ObamaCare benefits \u201cwill be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods.\u201d Quite so. Carney brought in chief White House economist Jason Furman to take beanballs, but he didn\u2019t get on base either. Furman said having subsidies creating economic incentives for not working \u201ccreates a situation where you can be more dynamic.\u201d Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will tackle the findings during a House Budget Committee hearing today. More. [\u201cThat was a sad briefing \u2026 that performance by Jason Furman was one of the most unconvincing performances I\u2019ve seen.

Newly appointed IRS Commissioner John Koskinen won\u2019t be having many laughs today when he appears before the House Ways and Means Committee. House Republicans are demanding a special counsel be appointed to investigate the targeting of conservative groups because of Obama\u2019s pre-judgment of the outcome of the existing case and because one of the lead attorneys, Barbara Bosserman, is an Obama political donor. Koskinen will also face heat for reinstating employee bonuses that had been cancelled during the height of the scandal. \u2013 Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest on the hearing from Capitol Hill.

Obama\u2019s tone, which was briefly contrite following his admission that he had misled voters about being able to keep their insurance policies, turned combative during his West Coast campaign swing. He blamed Republicans for problems with his faltering health law, promising that \u201canybody who is going to keep on pushing against that, they will meet my resistance.\u201d Obama is very much reverting to his 2012 playbook: firing up the base with sharp attacks on Republicans and personalizing policy differences. That\u2019s one thing in an election when he could pin it on an individual opponent, but quite another when the issue is a law passed with only Democratic votes and enacted by his own administration. While liberals may be feeling less bilious as signups for free and subsidized health insurance pick up, the problem is all about the people who are losing coverage and jobs because of the law. [Calls to delay the next round of penalties under the health law are growing louder. WSJ has more] Gather together - Liberals armed with Twitter-fed talking points are ready to bring the battle of ObamaCare to the Thanksgiving dinner table, but the problems will far outlast the holiday or any of the shifting deadlines for enactment and enforcement of the law. The president\u2019s hope to revive and drive his campaign supporters in defense of ObamaCare sounds okay for an administration deep in panic mode, but what about when the cancellation notices keep rolling out and premium spikes continue to torment so many of the 85 percent of Americans who already have coverage? Convincing folks that the uninsured should be covered is one thing, but telling them that they have to give up coverage or pay more for what they have in order to finance it is quite another. OBAMA APPROVAL CRATERS IN OHIO - President Obama won Ohio by 3 points in 2012 and by 4 points in 2008, but the key swing state has turned sharply against the president.

Fifty-seven percent of respondents did not feel Obama was trustworthy, with 59 percent disapproving of ObamaCare. Forty-five percent of respondents said they expected the quality of their health care to be worse a year from now. [Kasich lead slips - The same poll showed Gov. John Kasich\u2019s, R-Ohio, advantage over likely Democratic nominee Ed FitzGerald cut in half from 14 points to 7 points.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \u2018This is much more serious than I hear some Democrats saying publicly. This is not a temporary drop.\u2019 Adds John Geer, an expert on public opinion at Vanderbilt University, \u2018In a sense, the public was collectively willing to be patient. That reservoir of support among independents and moderates has evaporated.\u2019\u201d PAPERWORK NIGHTMARE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES - Unlike big businesses, which the Obama administration granted a delay in ObamaCare penalties, small businesses are facing a deadline to comply with the law. Unfortunately, that part of the Web site isn\u2019t fully functional yet. So companies with up to 50 employees have to mail in applications. Businessweek explains: \u201cEmployers must set up an online account, then download a PDF application. After filling out the application (possibly with the help of a broker), business owners must print it out and mail it to London, Ky., where the paperwork is being processed manually. After that, the Health and Human Services Department is supposed to contact employers and confirm that they\u2019re eligible. Then the company can select plans and offer employees coverage. After workers decide whether or not to enroll, companies can finally submit their application online and pay for the first month of their policies. Got it?\u201d Can I get that on paper? - \u00a0Wisconsin officials are resorting to mailing out paper versions of ObamaCare enrollment forms. The Wisconsin Free has the story of health officials sending the 26-page form, apparently unsolicited, to residents: \u201c\u2018And it is such a joke,\u2019 [an unnamed recipient] laughed. \u2018At the bottom of each page it says, \u2018Need Help With Your Application? Visit Healthcare.gov.\u2019 If the website worked in the first place I wouldn\u2019t need a paper application!\u2019\u201d White House tells backers to NOT visit ObamaCare site - Worried about another crash, Obama officials told top allies, including the Service Employees International Union, to steer clear of the site during the upcoming re-launch.

Krugman added, \u201cThey [administration officials] could be deluded or spinning; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly.\u201d He further contends the facts are getting better by the day and ObamaCare will turn into a \u201cBenghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about.\u201d [Rep.Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., told Megyn Kelly that none of the security officers sent to the Benghazi consulate ahead of the Islamist militant raid that killed four, including the U.S. ambassador, were armed.

The court will consider two cases challenging the provision forcing employers to pay for contraception even if their religious beliefs forbid the practice.\u00a0 A White House statement claims the mandate is \u201clawful and essential to women\u2019s health.\u201d\u00a0 While White House Press Secretary Jay Carney says the administration has \u201calready acted to ensure no church or similar religious institution will be forced to provide contraception coverage,\u201d the case has the potential to strike a significant blow at the already unpopular health law.

The new rules would be enforced by the scandal-plagued IRS.\u00a0 Reaction from Republicans was swift. \u201cThis is a crass political effort by the administration to get what political advantage they can, when they can,\u201d said Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif.

How bad is it? Mississippi State maniac Eddie Hammond, says his disdain of Ole Miss nearly cost him his bride. Eddie was engaged to Rebels fan, Gay. They were regular attendees, but always sat apart. But after the heartbreaker for Mississippi State in 1981, Eddie launched a tirade after the game that led his betrothed to throw her engagement ring away and call it off. But love and a common-sense solution prevailed. \u201cLater that night I came to my senses and realized I was way too caught up in a game.\u201d Eddie said. \u201cWe worked things out and we stopped going to the Egg Bowl. We started watching it on television in separate rooms and never spoke a word about it afterward.\u201d This week, though, both of the Hammonds will be rooting for the same team because of star Ole Miss Safety Chief Brown, a standout young man whom the Hammonds mentored after Eddie served as his little league baseball coach.

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cObama runs the presidency as if his main job, his only job, is rhetorical and political, shore up the base, make speeches. It's all rhetoric. He's got a crisis of management. He has got a system that doesn't work. It's his signature legislation. It's sort of the heart, the symbol of the embodiment of his idea of a caring, progressive central government. It's a mess\u2026It's amazing to me he became president on the basis of rhetoric.

They\u2019re divided over the ongoing military intervention in Iraq, a dispute made more difficult by the fact that Americans increasingly see the U.S. as obliged to subdue the Islamist militants there. And on the home front, the party is tearing at itself over the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. where local and state Democratic leaders are dropping the hammer on increasingly violent protests to the outrage of liberal activists. And what does the Democratic president say about all of this? Well, it\u2019s complicated. President Obama, in Washington for a two-day vacation from his vacation, took essentially the same attitude to both current crises, saying that the individuals involved needed to work things out on their own and that the federal government would be judicious in its involvement. Got it. That equivocal attitude got Obama a broadside today in the NYT for being disengaged and aloof from his own party. That\u2019s nothing new, especially coming from moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But what about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid? [The cabinet, ranked in scatological magnetism - According to Politico, President Obama refers to his confidante and point man on the Missouri unrest, Attorney General Eric Holder, as his administration\u2019s designated \u201cs***t magnet.\u201d]\u2018Reid seethed quietly\u2019 - From NYT: \u201cThe meeting in the Oval Office in late June was called to give President Obama and the four top members of Congress a chance to discuss the unraveling situation in Iraq. But Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, wanted to press another point. With Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, sitting a few feet away, Mr. Reid complained that Senate Republicans were spitefully blocking the confirmation of dozens of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominees to serve as ambassadors. He expected that the president would back him up and urge Mr. McConnell to relent. Mr. Obama quickly dismissed the matter. \u201cYou and Mitch work it out,\u201d Mr. Obama said coolly, cutting off any discussion. Mr. Reid seethed quietly for the rest of the meeting, according to four separate accounts provided by people who spoke with him about it. After his return to the Capitol that afternoon, Mr. Reid told other senators and his staff members that he was astonished by how disengaged the president seemed. [Not almost heaven - \u201cAsked to characterize his relationship with the president, Mr. Manchin, a centrist Democrat who has often been a bridge builder in the Senate, said: \u2018It\u2019s fairly nonexistent. There\u2019s not much of a relationship.\u2019\u201d]BAIER TRACKS: THE WORLD IS WATCHING\u2026\u201cThe media is focused like a laser on the unrest in Ferguson, Mo. And as is often the case, the news frenzy feeds itself once ratings surge or the number of clicks increase. That\u2019s certainly not to say that the story doesn\u2019t merit full and extensive reporting, but the wall-to-wall coverage given to such stories encourages Americans to see individual stories as passing events rather than part of a larger narrative about our world and our lives. The media tendency is to focus on one chapter of our American story and then turn the page, moving on and forgetting about the passions of the previous moment. We see the chapters, but we don\u2019t always read the book. It\u2019s also been interesting to note the extensive, sometimes gleeful, foreign press coverage. Russian and Chinese outlets are hammering the U.S. for civil rights abuses and Reuters reports that Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry is warning against harsh treatment of protesters, even echoing the language used in U.S. statements to the government in Cairo urging \u201csecurity forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution\u201d during the 2013 crackdown on protestors backing Egypt\u2019s deposed Islamist government. My how things have changed from the Arab Spring to the Ferguson Summer.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier WHITE HOUSE: NO DOCS ON OBAMACARE WEB SECURITYFox News: \u201cThe White House has rejected a request to publicly disclose documents relating to the kinds of security software and computer systems behind the federal health care exchange website on the grounds that the information could \"potentially\" be used by hackers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied a Freedom of Information Act request made late last year by the Associated Press amid concerns that Republicans raised about the security of the website, which had technical glitches that prevented millions of people from signing up for insurance under ObamaCare. In denying access to the documents, including what's known as a site security plan, Medicare told the AP that disclosing them could violate health-privacy laws because it might give hackers enough information to break into the service. \u2018We concluded that releasing this information would potentially cause an unwarranted risk to consumers' private information,\u2019 CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said in a statement.\u201dObamaCare batters businesses - Daily Caller: \u201cObamacare is increasing the cost of providing health insurance to workers, according to a report released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Republican primary frontrunner Dan Sullivan and campaign staffer, retired Air Force Col. Otto Feather, did just that on Monday. The two were among the first on the scene of an accident after a semi-truck rear-ended a Princess Tours bus on a remote stretch of the George Parks Highway, near Hurricane Gulch, Alaska. According to Sullivan\u2019s campaign, the candidate and the colonel \u201cassessed the scene, notified Mat-Su Valley Emergency Services, and assisted in removing passengers from the tour bus. In addition, Colonel Feather directed the landing of the first responders\u2019 helicopter on the Highway.\u201d State troopers reported only minor injuries in the accident according to Anchorage Dispatch News.

Bad numbers could doom ObamaCare \u2022 Fudge factor \u2022 Warren warming up? \u2022 Dem donors reap green grant windfall \u2022 Snoozers are losers HOW LOW CAN HE GO? BAD NUMBERS COULD DOOM OBAMACARE - Experts said the White House was lowballing when it set its initial threshold for ObamaCare success: A half-million enrollees in October, the launch month for the troubled entitlement program. How about a tenth of that? That\u2019s what we expect to see this week when the administration coughs up its official numbers. Fox News Chief National Correspondent Jim Angle reports that only about 50,000 Americans will have signed up for the partially subsidized insurance program. With the administration setting a minimum threshold of 7 million partially paying customers by the end of March to keep the new entitlement afloat (and prevent a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d for private insurance) numbers this bad mean substantial changes are ahead for President Obama\u2019s signature achievement\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 and he may not have the political clout to stave them off. Obama job approval: worst gap yet - The gap between President Obama\u2019s approval and disapproval \u2013 the most reliable indicator of public dissatisfaction with the chief executive \u2013 has hit its worst point ever. The latest RCP average shows the largest spread of his presidency, 11.2 points. The largest previous gap, 10.2 points, came in August 2011 amid a souring economy and a debt-ceiling debacle. [Watch Fox: Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, reacts to reports of ObamaCare\u2019s enrollment numbers in the 9 a.m. ET hour] Fudge factor - An administration official told WaPo that the White House plans to count people who have not purchased ObamaCare but have placed policies in their online shopping carts. Details. Degrees of difficulty - Democrats are now expecting, at a minimum, a further extension of the ObamaCare enrollment period and some delay in the penalties for not signing up. But a number so measly as 50,000 would increase the chances that Congress would act to delay the entire law for another year. An extension won\u2019t work if insurance companies are forced to cover those high-risk, formerly uninsured customers who skew risk pools. The White House might spin a number above 50,000 as an unexpected success, but if the Web site is still on the fritz, spin won\u2019t matter. Remember, with millions tossed off their plans because of ObamaCare, no one doubts that there is huge demand for insurance these days. Desperate measures - As problems continue to mount for ObamaCare\u2019s Web site, administration officials may be considering pleas from insurers to bypass the site and enroll customers directly. With just a month to go before millions who got cancellation notices because of the law face deadlines to gain coverage for next year, desperation is growing. The president\u2019s decision to mislead voters on his \u201cif you like it\u201d pledge could go from a major embarrassment for him to a national catastrophe, so the White House is no doubt listening. But insurers don\u2019t have access to the IRS data needed to verify federal subsidy levels. The industry proposal has insurers estimating subsidies and taxpayers making good later on. NYT has the details. Costly subsidies goof - Nearly 8,000 Washington state residents will soon find out they will be paying more for ObamaCare. The Seattle Times reports the state\u2019s ObamaCare Web site miscalculated subsidies.

WHITE HOUSE WON\u2019T LET OBAMACARE TECH BOSS TESTIFY - The White House has refused to allow Chief Technology Officer Todd Park to appear at a Wednesday hearing on systemic problems with the online home of ObamaCare, including crashes, data insecurity and corrupted information. The stated reason from Team Obama is that Park is too busy fixing the crash to explain how it happened. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said in a letter to the White House tech boss that it was unacceptable for Park to find time for press interviews but not for the hearing. Oversight\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and a group of three technical experts are denouncing Issa\u2019s call for Park to explain himself to Congress. HuffPo has details.

THE OBAMACARE CRASH: REAL PEOPLE, REAL STORIES - Some military families are finding surprise restrictions under ObamaCare. Eddie Grooms told Megyn Kelly that he served in the military for 20 years and is still on military insurance. His daughter turns 21 next year, but cannot stay on his plan because her employer also offers coverage. This is despite President Obama\u2019s oft-touted claim that those under 26 can remain on their parents\u2019 plans. Grooms told Kelly, \u201cIt would be nice if [the administration] leveled with everybody and let them know so people can make plans.\u201d Grooms added, \u201cThis will hit thousands of retirees over time.\u201d According to healthcare.gov, no restrictions are listed for adult children until they are 26.

But it\u2019s time to start considering the worst-case scenarios: that the exchanges continue to malfunction, that plan cancellations go into effect, that insurers see the political winds shifting and stop playing nice with the administration, and that significant numbers of people are left stranded without coverage as a result.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

So did Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., saying, \u201cThank God for France and thank God for pushback.\u201d Republicans and independents agreed with Hayes conclusion that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu feels the Jewish nation is on its own. The Hill\u2019s A.B. Stoddard saw agreement across the spectrum when she said the administration\u2019s forcing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks while seeking a nuclear deal with Iran is a mistake. Discussion of ObamaCare\u2019s flaws and proposed fixes drew the highest levels of viewer engagement. Intensity spiked to 32,000 votes per minute when Rep.

Sure enough, officers found the photos of the giant order on the Instagram account. That\u2019s when police learned the suspected burglars would return to Rockland Sunday evening. KTXL has the story. SNOOZERS ARE LOSERS - It\u2019s not news that morning people prosper. As Ben Franklin recorded in \u201cPoor Richard\u2019s Almanac\u201d in 1757, \u201cEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\u201d (Also, a bit more tartly: \u201cPlough deep while sluggards sleep.\u201d) But science is backing Ben up. Via The Atlantic\u2019s Julie Beck: \u201cNatural morning people definitely have an edge there over those disposed to staying up late\u2014but there might be more advantages to forcing yourself to go to sleep early than just feeling refreshed.\u201d She cites a study on the emotional health and well-being of teens over a seven year span, tacking their performances and senses of well-being. The amount of sleep mattered, but so did bedtimes. [Ed. note: Wouldn\u2019t early, orderly bedtimes suggest the presence of loving, attentive parenting in those homes? Wouldn\u2019t that be far more determinative than the bedtimes themselves? You know what? Never mind. Anything to make me feel better about getting up in the pitch dark.] AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThe one thing [President Obama] did in the interview last week that I think was not picked up on is the fact he compounded it when he said, \u2018Well, you know, we\u2019re really sorry about all those people who lost their insurance. It\u2019s because we didn\u2019t craft the law appropriately.\u2019 That\u2019s precisely the opposite of the truth\u2026The crafting was done precisely to throw people off insurance and the president said exactly the opposite.

Doesn\u2019t sound like those 11 of Vlad\u2019s Russian and Ukrainian \u201ccronies\u201d that President Obama slapped with sanctions on Monday are putting much pressure on Putin to de-escalate the growing tensions over Crimea\u2019s breakaway vote to separate from Ukraine and join Mother Russia. In fact, just hours after Obama announced the sanctions freezing the U.S. assets of his confidants, Putin signed a decree recognizing Crimea as a \u201csovereign and independent state.\u201d Railing against the \u2018chosen ones\u2019 - That move set the stage for the Russian president to formally propose the Ukrainian province\u2019s annexation before Russia\u2019s parliament. While Putin claimed Russia would never seek to start a confrontation with the West, his ramped up rhetoric suggests he holds his American counterpart and U.S. allies in contempt over the Ukraine crisis. \u201cOur Western partners headed by the United States prefer not to be guided by international law in their practical policies, but by the rule of the gun,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey have come to believe in their exceptionalism and their sense of being the chosen ones. That they can decide the destinies of the world, that it is only them who can be right.\u201d Weak-handed? - As tensions over Crimea and eastern Ukraine simmer, Obama\u2019s sanctions and those of his European counterparts were met with derision and mockery among officials in Moscow, and with concern by Republican lawmakers who see the moves as inadequate.\u00a0 \u201cThe crisis in Ukraine calls for a far more significant response from the United States\u2026sanctioning only seven Russian officials is wholly inadequate at this stage,\u201d Sen.

Although the talks have no direct connection to Ukraine, their success hinges on solidarity among the so-called P5-plus-one countries \u2014 the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which include Russia, plus Germany \u2014 in favor of a tough agreement with Iran to drastically scale back its nuclear program. If Russia signals that its cooperation with the West has weakened, that will reduce pressure on Iran to make concessions, said experts knowledgeable about the talks, which began last month with three days of meetings involving senior diplomats from each of the governments involved.\u201d STILL MISSING: DEVILISH DETAILS OVERSHADOW OBAMACARE ENROLLMENTAn ObamaCare update once again left out data critical to how viable and costly the president\u2019s entitlement program is as open enrollment nears an end. In a blog post Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service director Marilyn Tavenner boasted sign ups have risen to 5 million. The post featured stories of those so thrilled to be enrolled in ObamaCare that they wept, but team Obama is still not disclosing who has actually paid for coverage or how many young people, critical to making insurance risk pools workable and keeping premiums from spiking further have enrolled. As the Daily Caller reports studies of insurance industry data shows only 77 to 80 percent of those the White House claims are enrolled will actually follow through and purchase insurance. By those estimates, current enrollment is just below 4 million. What was the point? - While the 5 million enrollment figure may be seen as good news coming from the White House, the devilish details in Monday\u2019s post were also lacking on the main object of the president\u2019s overhaul of health care system: insuring the uninsured. A new survey from the financial Web site bankrate.com finds 1/3 of those who lack health insurance do not plan to enroll in ObamaCare because they feel it is too expensive. Couple that with the relatively low young invincible sign ups and you have a costly health law, causing multiple cancellations, that isn\u2019t achieving its primary goal. New ObamaCare rule gives Dems cover - To provide cover for vulnerable Democrats, Team Obama is seeking to stave off further cancellations ahead of November\u2019s midterms with its latest rule allowing insurers to modify plans that are not compliant with ObamaCare without actually canceling them. Washington Examiner has the deets. Dems dilemma - Former speech writer for George W. Bush, Marc Theissen, considers The Democrats\u2019 Obama Trap: \u201cThe problem is Democrats can\u2019t run from Obama or Obamacare. Yes, the president is electoral kryptonite in 2014. But Democrats are caught in the Obama trap \u2014 unable to either embrace or repudiate their unpopular president and his unpopular health law. This is precisely the position vulnerable Republicans were in during the 2006 midterm elections, when Democrats retook control of Congress thanks to George W. Bush\u2019s sinking poll numbers. Like vulnerable Democrats today, many vulnerable Republicans wanted to run from Bush in 2006. But they couldn\u2019t, because no matter how low the president dropped in the polls, a solid 25 percent of the electorate stayed intensely loyal to him. Republicans needed that pro-Bush base to turn out in big numbers to avert disaster in the fall.\u201d ObamaCare\u2019s bracket booster fouls out -\u00a0Another faulty Web site is plaguing the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to attract young people to sign up for the president\u2019s signature entitlement program.

From \u201cHanding Over the Keys to the Internet\u201d: \u201cFor its operation, sustenance, and energy, the Web could rely wholly on private enterprise, deregulated markets, and civil society; for its essential freedom and the integrity of its operation, it was beholden to a small amount of governance. Without it, there would be anarchy... Yesterday, the United States found itself in an advantageous and virtuous position: the benign steward of an astonishing network that it developed, refined, and then gave to the world without caveat. Today, provoked and shamed into action by actors who have neither the moral nor legal claim to its work, it is on the cusp of giving up control. An unforced error.

Polling indicates Republican venture capitalist Bruce Rauner is favored in a primary field that includes state Treasurer Dan Rutherford, and state senators Bill Brady and Kirk Dillard. Gov. Pat Quinn, D-Ill., who was elected in 2010, a year after he took over from former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., was removed from office for soliciting bribes, faces a lesser known primary challenger. In head-to-head matchups, Rauner leads Quinn, who is reeling from the president\u2019s continually falling approval in the Land of Lincoln.

TEAM OBAMA \u2018RECALIBRATES\u2019 AFTER NOMINEE SHOT DOWNWashington Examiner: \u201cWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said administration officials are \u2018recalibrating\u2019 their approach to President Obama\u2019s nominee for surgeon general after the National Rifle Association's strong opposition siphoned off key Democratic support. Carney predicted Dr. Vivek Hallegere Murthy, a Harvard and Yale-educated former emergency room doctor, would eventually be confirmed as surgeon general but said the White House is reassessing its approach to the nomination after several pro-gun Democrats indicated they would oppose it\u201d\u2014Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream considers how some Democrats rejected President Obama\u2019s controversial Justice Department nominee and why other vulnerable Democrats are rejecting his Surgeon General pick. BELATED HONORS President Obama is presenting two dozen veterans with the Medal of Honor today. The White House ceremony will honor soldiers who were previously overlooked for recognition or received lesser awards because they were members of minority groups. Recipients include Jewish, Hispanic and African-American Army veterans from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Among those being awarded is the late Demensio Rivera of Portsmouth, Va.\u00a0 The Puerto Rico born Rivera joined the army in 1950, and is receiving the distinction for heroic actions during a firefight in the Korean War.\u00a0From the U.S. Army citation: \u201cWhen the outpost area occupied by his platoon was assaulted during the night, Rivera, an automatic rifleman, held his forward position tenaciously, although exposed to very heavy fire. When his rifle became inoperative, Rivera employed his pistol and grenades, and eventually fought the enemy hand-to-hand and forced them back.\u201d\u00a0 Rivera\u2019s granddaughter, Sgt. Ashley Randall, back from deployment in Afghanistan, will accept the medal in his honor. AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201c[President Obama] is being ridiculed, by Russians especially, because the statement and the policy are ridiculous. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of cards, but he has some cards. If he thinks that sanctioning seven Russians of a population of about 150 million is a sanction, he\u2019s living in a different world\u2026if you are going to do something, do it, otherwise, say nothing.

That\u2019s one of the repairs that administration officials are selling today ahead of a speech by President Obama addressing growing frustrations with the online home of his new health-insurance entitlement program, ObamaCare. The official position from Obamaland, laid out in a background briefing, is that the president will address \u201ctroubles that he and his team find unacceptable.\u201d No doubt. The crash-prone Web site has become a huge embarrassment for Democrats who were hoping the rollout of taxpayer-subsidized insurance would soften resistance to the law.

            "article_content": "Former anti-Trump PAC supporter weighs in on 'Justice with Judge Jeanine' Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to nudge his fiscal policies -- including those on taxes and the minimum wage -- closer to the center ahead of the general election, while downplaying a lack of party support for his candidacy. Trump suggested on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that his tax plan, which now includes a tax break for the country\u2019s top wage-earners, would likely be different if he becomes president, considering it would likely need support from Democrats as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill. \"By the time it gets negotiated, it's going to be a different plan,\" the billionaire businessman said in a pre-taped interview that aired Sunday. \"On my plan, (tax rates) are going down. But by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up.\" However, Trump also argued that his top priority will be to lower taxes for the middle class, championed by Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, and U.S. businesses, which Trump suggested are among the highest taxed in the world. Whether Trump would even get solid GOP support from Congress remains unclear, considering House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan is so far withholding his backing, a decision that Trump said this weekend \u201cblindsided\u201d him. Trump also continued to suggest he\u2019s now open to increasing the minimum wage, after indicating early in the election cycle that such a move would slow the economy. \"I am looking at it,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\" Sanders, a Vermont senator, and front-running Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton each are calling for the federal minimum wage to be increased to $15 an hour -- in their battle to win over the middle-class vote amid similar promises to narrow the country's economic inequality divide. \u201cI'm allowed to change,\u201d Trump told ABC, before returning to his long-standing campaign promise to bring U.S. companies back to the country, which he says will result in American workers making \u201ca lot more than the $15\u201d hourly. Trump told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday in a pre-taped interview that he had a \u201cvery encouraging\u201d phone call with Ryan, R-Wis., several weeks ago, perhaps after his commanding New York primary victory. So Ryan announcing his lack of support Wednesday, a day after Trump became the presumptive nominee, was unexpected, Trump suggested. \"Yeah, I was blindsided a little bit,\u201d he told NBC. With Ryan and other prominent Republicans -- including George H.W. Bush and son George W. Bush, the only former Republican presidents still living -- refusing to fall in line, Trump is still standing firm on his assertion that the party doesn\u2019t have to be unified because he will gain Democratic votes to win in the fall. \u201cI think it would be better if it were unified,\u201d he said in the ABC interview. \u201cI think there would be something good about it. But I don\u2019t think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

GRIMES ESCALATES OBAMA BASHING AHEAD OF HILLARY VISITIf one race reveals the depth of the divisions between Democrats this cycle it is in Kentucky, where the party\u2019s Senate nominee still refuses to say whether she voted in 2012 for President Obama, whom she endorsed and served as a convention delegate. But on Monday, Alison Lundergan Grimes took the next step forward into the chasm when a debate moderator asked her the difference between her, a self-styled \u201cClinton Democrat\u201d and an \u201cObama Democrat.\u201d Grimes was quick to respond: \u201cIt\u2019s growing the middle class in the right way.\u201d Whoa. And this is a woman who is hosting Obama\u2019s longtime intra-party rival Hillary Clinton at a rally on Wednesday \u2013 an appearance that was announced the same day last week that the story of Grimes\u2019 Obama denials blew up. It is no wonder that liberal outlets are among the most exercised about Grimes\u2019 treatment of the president. As a segment on Rachel Maddow\u2019s MSNBC televisions show Monday said: \u201cDemocrats at a crossroads.\u201d[Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron has the latest on the Kentucky race from the Bluegrass State]Grimes apparently a very recent convert to vote secrecy - In the first and only Kentucky Senate debate, Grimes offered a new defense for her decision to continue to refuse to say whether she voted for Obama: Ethics. The commonwealth\u2019s secretary of state said she was defending the \u201cright for privacy at the ballot box,\u201d and that her deflection was not made out of reluctance. \u201cI am not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or other side or for members of the media,\u201d said Grimes in her acrid faceoff with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But her zeal for ballot secrecy is apparently that of a new convert. Sam Youngman of the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that in a soon-to-air television interview that was taped before the debate, Grimes disclosed her 2008 primary vote for Hillary Clinton. [Flashback - In 2006, Sen. Lincoln Chaffee, R-R.I., claimed amid a punishing re-election campaign that he had not voted for then-President George W. Bush two years before, having instead written in the name of Bush\u2019s father. Chaffee lost by 7 points.]Clintons get itchy trigger fingers - NYT: \u201cUntil recently,\u00a0 [2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton] was expected to announce around Feb. 15, 2015, which would give her campaign plenty of time to staff up and raise money. But that timing is now being reconsidered as Democrats contemplate a scenario in which they suffer significant losses. Mrs. Clinton could feel pressure to at least file the requisite paperwork to start an exploratory committee before the end of this year. The committee would allow her to start to raise money, and she could still delay an official announcement until early next year.\u201d [Wait.

After this year\u2019s midterms, Crossroads will engage in a \u2018fresh assessment of how we fulfill our goals and targets,\u2019 chief executive Steven Law said in an interview last week.

The spot features a clip of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifying on the effects of budget caps imposed in 2011. But Fauci told Megyn Kelly that the ad is misleading. \u201cI think what others have said is that certainly the NIH funding\u00a0has been flat, which means\u00a0functionally, because of\u00a0inflation, it has gone down,\u201d said Fauci. \u201cI don't think you could point and say it's because of that\u00a0that we're having a problem with Ebola.\u201d Watch [A new Gallup poll finds Republicans have the advantage on five of the six top issues among voters.

            "article_content": "In shifting immigration remarks Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is planning to drop up to $10 million on its biggest ad buy to date, hammering Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on her economic proposals in a slew of battleground states. The Republican nominee is trying to make up for lost time in the ad wars, after being significantly outspent by Clinton on that front over the summer. But he\u2019s also kept an active campaign schedule over the past week as his Democratic opponent mostly has stayed off the trail. With its latest ad buy, the Trump campaign plans to cover nine battleground states. They are: Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, where the campaign has already been on the air, along with New Hampshire, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. His campaign\u2019s second general election ad, unveiled Monday, hits Clinton on economic issues, claiming the middle-class would be \u201ccrushed\u201d under a Clinton presidency amid tax increases and more spending. \u201cIt\u2019s more of the same, but worse,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cIn Donald Trump\u2019s America, working families get tax relief. Millions of new jobs created. Wages go up. \u2026 Change that makes America great again.\u201d Trump has so far been badly outspent by Clinton and groups supporting her. Since clinching her party's nomination in early June, Clinton has spent more than $77 million on television and radio advertising, largely targeting voters in battleground states, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. Trump finally hit the airwaves earlier this month with his first ad, focused on immigration, and so far has only spent about $5 million. Amid conflicting signals over his latest immigration platform, Trump now says he\u2019ll deliver a detailed speech Wednesday on his proposal to crack down on illegal immigration. The announcement came late Sunday in a tweet by the Republican presidential nominee after days of wavering -- and at least one canceled speech -- on a question central to his campaign: Whether he would, as he said in November, use a \"deportation force\" to eject the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally. Trump's immigration speech in Arizona will come after he and Clinton spent last week trading accusations on racial issues. Trump called Clinton \"a bigot;\" Clinton accused Trump of allowing hate groups to take over the Republican Party. Clinton is starting this week by announcing her proposals for dealing with mental health issues. She is stressing the need to fully integrate mental health services into the U.S. health care system. Her plan stresses early diagnosis and intervention and calls for a national initiative for suicide prevention. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s reckless approach to business has devastated working families and communities. He will do and say whatever is in his interest, even if it means swindling working families to make millions for himself,\" Campaign Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds said in a statement. \"Now Trump is promising the same reckless, self-centered approach to running the country\u2019s economy \u2013 with large tax breaks for the wealthy, and a plan that independent experts say would cost millions of jobs.\" Late Sunday, America's only African-American owned and operated national Christian television network also announced that its president and CEO, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, would interview the Republican nominee Saturday in Detroit. This comes as the Republican\u2019s campaign vows the candidate, who has been appealing lately to minority voters for support, plans to go into African-American communities to seek their vote. The new investment in advertising comes amid signs that Trump's lagging poll numbers may be improving against Clinton's following a campaign reboot. Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement that the billionaire businessman's \"positive message of economic opportunity is working and we see the national and battleground state polls all moving in the right direction.\" \"With Hillary Clinton off the campaign trail yet again this week and continuing to take many communities' votes for granted, we see this as the right time to show voters the benefits of an American economy under the leadership of Mr. Trump,\" he added. Clinton will be spending much of the week in private fundraisers in the Hamptons, the wealthy enclaves of eastern Long Island, New York.

            "article_content": "Chuck Rocha and Ashley Pratte weigh in Repeating his \"I'm allowed to change\" message used during the Republican presidential debates, Donald Trump opened his first full week as the presumptive nominee by treading close to the edge of flipping on some of the campaign points that got him there \u2014 specifically, that he\u2019s now open to an increase in the minimum wage and that his steep tax-cut plan is open to negotiation. Trump acknowledged that his tax plan,\u00a0which includes a tax break for the country\u2019s top wage-earners, would probably look different once it\u2019s \u201cnegotiated.\u201d He said in interviews Sunday that those rates would probably \u201cgo up.\u201d He clarified Monday on Fox Business Network that he\u2019s still pursuing tax cuts. He said the rates might ultimately be higher than in his campaign tax plan -- but not higher than current levels. \u201cI am not talking \u2018raised\u2019 from where they are now, I\u2019m talking about raised from my low proposal,\u201d\u00a0Trump told FBN\u2019s Maria Bartiromo. He said claims over the weekend that he was looking at a tax hike were \u201cmisreported.\u201d Still, the billionaire businessman is showing more flexibility on his campaign agenda now that he\u2019s got the nomination practically wrapped up. Trump also suggested he\u2019s now open to increasing the minimum wage, after indicating early in the election cycle that such a move would slow the economy. \"I am looking at it,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton both are calling for the federal minimum wage to be increased to $15 an hour -- in their battle to win over the middle-class vote amid similar promises to narrow the country's economic divide. \u201cI'm allowed to change,\u201d Trump told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week, before returning to his long-standing campaign promise to bring U.S. companies back to the country, which he says will result in American workers making \u201ca lot more than the $15\u201d hourly. The Trump campaign has also opened the door to fundraising going into November, though to date Trump has largely used his own money. Trump strategist Paul Manafort argued Sunday that Trump hasn\u2019t misled supporters by making the move after saying during the primaries he was self-funded. Manafort told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Trump made the announcement to fundraise last week because he now leads the party and needs to match the millions of dollars that Democrats will raise to elect their candidates in November. \u201cHe is the head of the party and will be electing not just the president, but will be electing senators, congressmen, governors and local council people,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cThe Democrats have said they're going to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try and spread lies about Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Trump has said to compete against them he will support the party and the party's efforts.\u201d Meanwhile, as Trump looks to patch up the rifts with fellow Republicans following a bruising and protracted primary battle, he has maintained his barbed tone on the campaign trail \u2013 only now turning it toward Clinton. Over the weekend, he lashed out at the Democratic front-runner and struck directly at Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelity. Trump said Saturday at a rally in Spokane, Wash., that the former president \u201cwas the worst abuser of women in the history of politics.\" And he called Hillary Clinton an \u201cenabler\u201d because \u201cshe treated these women horribly. \u2026 And some of these women were destroyed, not by him, but by the way that Hillary Clinton treated them after everything went down.\" Trump's attacks Saturday appeared to be in response to reports that Priorities USA, the lead super PAC backing Clinton, has reserved $91 million in TV advertising, which will start next month and in part focus on Trump\u2019s statements and actions regarding women. Clinton told CNN last week that she felt certain that Americans won\u2019t take a chance on electing a \"loose cannon\" like him. And she appeared to warn Trump that others have tried and failed to defeat her politically with similar personal attacks. \"If he wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s, if he wants to follow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I'm more than happy to have him do that,\" she said.

            "article_content": "Medical doctor and Congressman Phil Roe (R-TN) on why health premiums under Obamacare are on the rise in some states. WASHINGTON  \u2013 Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday. That's sure to stoke another \"Obamacare\" controversy days before a presidential election. Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. \"Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,\" said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Republicans pounced on the numbers as a warning that insurance markets created by the 2010 health overhaul are teetering toward a \"death spiral.\" Sign-up season starts Nov. 1, about a week before national elections in which the GOP remains committed to a full repeal. \"It's over for\u00a0Obamacare,\" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said at a campaign rally Monday evening in Tampa, Florida. Trump said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, \"wants to double down and make it more expensive and it's not gonna work. ... Our country can't afford it, you can't afford it.\" He promised his own plan would deliver \"great health care at a fraction of the cost.\" The new numbers aren't too surprising, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs a committee that oversees the law. It \"does little to dispel the notion we are seeing the law implode at the expense of middle-class families.\" HHS essentially confirmed state-by-state reports that have been coming in for months. Window shopping for plans and premiums is already available through HealthCare.gov. Administration officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. They add that consumers who are willing to switch to cheaper plans will still be able to find bargains. \"Headline rates are generally rising faster than in previous years,\" acknowledged HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis. But he added that for most consumers, \"headline rates are not what they pay.\" The vast majority of the more than 10 million customers who purchase through HealthCare.gov and its state-run counterparts do receive generous financial assistance. \"Enrollment is concentrated among very low-income individuals who receive significant government subsidies to reduce premiums and cost-sharing,\" said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health But an estimated 5 million to 7 million people are either not eligible for the income-based assistance, or they buy individual policies outside of the health law's markets, where the subsidies are not available. The administration is urging the latter group to check out HealthCare.gov. The spike in premiums generally does not affect the employer-provided plans that cover most workers and their families. In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \"second-lowest cost silver plan\" will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. Dwindling choice is another issue. The total number of HealthCare.gov insurers will drop from 232 this year to 167 in 2017, a loss of 28 percent. (Insurers are counted multiple times if they offer coverage in more than one state. So Aetna, for example, would count once in each state that it participated in.) Switching insurers may not be simple for patients with chronic conditions. While many carriers are offering a choice of plan designs, most use a single prescription formulary and physician network across all their products, explained Pearson. \"So, enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,\" she said. Overall, it's shaping up to be the most difficult sign-up season since HealthCare.gov launched in 2013 and the computer system froze up. Enrollment has been lower than initially projected, and insurers say patients turned out to be sicker than expected. Moreover, a complex internal system to help stabilize premiums has not worked as hoped for. Nonetheless Obama says the underlying structure of the law is sound, and current problems are only \"growing pains.\" The president has called for a government-sponsored \"public option\" insurance plan to compete with private companies. Republicans are united in calling for complete repeal, but they have not spelled out how they would address the problems of the uninsured. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed an array of fixes, including sweetening the law's subsidies and allowing more people to qualify for financial assistance. The law makes carrying health insurance a legal obligation for most people, and prohibits insurers for turning away the sick. It offers subsidized private plans to people who don't have coverage through their jobs, along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Largely as a result, the nation's uninsured rate has dropped below 9 percent, a historically low level. More than 21 million people have gained coverage since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.",

Will the next president seize the moment?\u00a0 Only by first turning the economy around with a pro-growth program to cut personal and corporate taxes, streamline regulations, and embrace the American energy revolution. If so, he or she will unleash an economic renaissance that is poised at the starting gate, ready to take off. There are a dozen new technologies and products that were invented in America, ready to be mass produced in America and sold not only here at home to all over the world.\u00a0 Things like 3D printing, driverless cars, wearable medical devices, robotics, DNA-based medicines, nanotechnology, bioengineering, and the internet of things.\u00a0 But this burst of new manufactures will only happen if the next president gets government out of the way of the free market. THE FORGOTTEN WOMEN WHO ARE SUPPORTING TRUMP If the next president fails to do it, our economy will continue to languish under the triple weight of big government, crippling regulations and confiscatory taxes.\u00a0 We will miss the once in a lifetime moment to return to prosperity.\u00a0 As for improving our foreign policy?\u00a0 It will become much collateral damage. We simply won\u2019t have the resources necessary to rebuild the military, shore up our alliances, push back against our enemies, and deal with the cyber and terrorist threats that are already upon us. We will be stuck with the failed policies of the past. Nobody thinks American foreign policy in the last fifteen years has been a success.\u00a0 Our adversaries, and even some of our allies, think we\u2019re a spent power, mired in decadence, self-indulgence and smug self-satisfaction.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve had two wars \u2013 three if you count Libya \u2013 that we\u2019ve lost every one, some twice.\u00a0 Instead of destroying and defeating radical Islamic movements, we\u2019ve seen them expand to more places and in greater strength than before. They have spread throughout western civilization, and now even to our homeland. Russia has restarted the Cold War and is pushing up against us and our allies in Northern Europe, Central Europe and the Middle East. Reagan turned everything around \u2013 he fixed the economy, repaired our foreign policy and set us on the path to the greatest period of peace and prosperity in our history. The next president can do the same. We gave Iran everything it wanted and more in the nuclear deal, hoping it would buy us a new and friendly Iran. Instead their chants for \u201cDeath to America\u201d have grown louder, even while they continue their sprint to have a nuclear weapons arsenal within the decade. China is expanding into the South China Sea and will soon claim one of the world\u2019s major trade routes as an internal Chinese lake. Right now, things look grim for American leadership and the American dream. But we\u2019ve been in scrapes like this before and recovered. That\u2019s exactly what we thought in 1980. But we elected a new leader who threw out the Washington Establishment and their stale old policies.\u00a0 \u00a0Reagan turned everything around \u2013 he fixed the economy, repaired our foreign policy and set us on the path to the greatest period of peace and prosperity in our history.\u00a0\u00a0 The next president can do the same. If the next president chooses, like Reagan before him, to reject the status quo for a pro-growth economic plan, we will soon have the opportunity and leverage necessary to rethink our relations with adversaries and allies. As much as our enemies have been on the ascendancy of late, they are all headed for tough times ahead.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s future is bleak: they have built their entire economy and society on oil and natural gas prices remaining high, and those prices have fallen sharply and suddenly and will never rise again.\u00a0 Within the next year or two Russia will be forced to dramatically reduce government spending, cut back on social programs, military modernization and clip its global ambitions -- or face bankruptcy.\u00a0 China\u2019s mighty economic engine of growth is slowing down, too. That, coupled with their demographic time bomb, could spell political instability and civil unrest for the world most populous nation. The Middle East will be wracked by ethno-tribal religious wars for the next thirty years.\u00a0 Even our allies in Europe are headed for social unrest under the economic and security burdens of the mass Muslim migration.\u00a0 We are entering an era that cries out for American leadership. Seizing this unique historic opportunity won\u2019t happen if we elect \u00a0a status quo president on Tuesday.\u00a0 And Hillary Clinton is the status quo candidate -- supersized. She won\u2019t take us in a new direction, or usher in new ideas.\u00a0 She will be President Obama\u2019s third term, but lack his eloquence. She will be the Clinton Restoration, but without Bill Clinton\u2019s charm. \u00a0She will plod along the same route she has followed before. Her joyless presidency will be driven by focus groups and pollsters, by the folks whose main job is to keep the Establishment in power \u2013 the donor class, the media mandarins, the inside-the-beltway crowd. These are the folks whose lives are just fine, whose houses are worth more than they paid for them, whose kids go to good schools, who have generous health care and retirement plans. They are the folks who believe in globalism, big government, and high taxes \u00a0-- for the other guy. She will lock in their grip on power.\u00a0 And, as we have seen in recent days, a Hillary Clinton administration is likely to be haunted by investigations, corruption, indictments and even a constitutional crisis. I worked in the West Wing during Watergate and saw firsthand what how such a crisis can destroy a president, the administration and test the mettle of the country. I think the choice is simple.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same question Ronald Reagan asked the American people in 1980.\u00a0 If you think everything is just fine, and you\u2019re better off than you were eight years ago, if you think the world is a safer place, then you should vote for the status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton, who will continue things just as they are. But if you, like me, think we need to throw the bums out, drain the swamp, revitalize our economy and reclaim the mantle of global leadership, then by all means vote for the one candidate who has shown time and again that he\u2019s not afraid of challenging the conventional wisdom and rejecting the status quo. Only one of the candidates can seize this unique historic moment to Make America Great Again. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be pulling the lever for Donald Trump on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "In this photo taken Monday, May 2, 2016, Jupiter High powderpuff football players Caitlin Walsh, Megan Mendoza, Haley Osborne and Savannah Tardonia, in front with ball, pose for a group photo in Jupiter, Fla. (AP) JUPITER, Fla. \u2013 What boosters describe as the nation's last tackle powder-puff football game is no more, at least for now. After 50 years of spirited competition between seniors and juniors, Jupiter High's principal has canceled the annual event, saying he doesn't believe helmets and shoulder pads borrowed from boys' teams adequately protect the girls who get crunched in the game. The cancellation blindsided Jupiter, a middle-class suburb on the Palm Beach coast. The game packs the stands \u2014 something the Jupiter boys' team rarely does \u2014 and raised $7,000 last year, parents say. While boys dress like female cheerleaders in tight shorts, crop tops and wigs, the girls get to experience the thrill of competing before a roaring crowd instead of playing softball or soccer in front of a few dozen parents and friends. \"The game makes our town special. It is a once in a lifetime or maybe twice in a lifetime opportunity. You can't come back when you are 30 and play,\" said Haley Osborne, a 17-year-old senior who is disappointed that she's missing her final chance. \"It is almost like a Friday night in Texas. Everyone comes out to watch the game. That is why you see the uproar. That's what this game means to this town,\" said Marcy Murphy, a special needs job coach. Her son, Brandon, plays running back on the boys' team and helped coach the girls last year. But Principal Dan Frank, who has led the 2,800-student school for three years, is firm: This month's game is off. A girl broke her leg a few years ago, each year players get bruises and sprains, and there is always a chance of more serious injuries. \"Student safety is my first priority,\" Frank said in a statement. \"The narrow window of time for student preparation and practice, and the limited availability of properly fitting safety equipment would put our students at risk.\" A Hail Mary attempt to enlist Jupiter as the game's sponsor failed when Town Manager Andrew Lukasik rejected the idea, also citing safety concerns. Some girls and their parents said Frank told them tackle powder-puff might be brought back under certain conditions: Instead of two weeks practice, there could be two months so the girls are better trained. Instead of using pads and helmets from the boys' team and a local youth league, football uniforms designed for girls could be purchased, along with specific insurance for the game. Frank would only confirm that he has asked the district to help determine whether the game could be resumed at some point. As for this year, Frank suggested the girls adopt flag football, but the girls wouldn't consider it. Thousands of other American high schools host flag powder-puff, a no-contact version in which girls stop their opponents by pulling flags off their belts, rather than wrestling them to the ground. But Florida schools already offer girls' flag football as an interscholastic sport, and they said the equivalent of a class vs. class scrimmage would feel boring after 50 years of tackle. Sitting down for a group interview, Osborne and her friends, Caitlin Walsh, Megan Mendoza and Sophie Garcia, said their principal also made another suggestion that they found demeaning: That they play a modified kickball game, and have the runner bob for apples at second base, or spin around at third. \"We are not in elementary school,\" Mendoza said. Frank acknowledges suggesting several alternative events, but would not be specific. These members of the Class of 2016 were filled with glee recalling last year's 50th anniversary game, which they lost 17-12 to the Class of 2015. Donning pads. Strapping on helmets. Hearing the roar as they sprinted into the stadium. The hits. The fumbles and bumbles. \"Remember there were three of us saying 'Let's all just get on Amanda,' but no one could take her down,\" one girl says. Another chimes in, \"One girl got hit so hard her helmet flew off.\" A third adds, \"It is sooo fun.\" For these young women and their moms, the risk of injury is overblown. \"The car ride to the game is more dangerous,\" said Lori Walsh, Caitlin's mother. Girls get hurt cheerleading and playing soccer and basketball, they say, so why not ban those sports, too? They also note that Florida allows girls to play on boys' high school football teams, including several female kickers and a girl who substituted at quarterback in the neighboring county. \"That's much riskier,\" Marcy Murphy said. For now, at least, the game is over. Jupiter alum Julie Wright, a local preschool director who played in the 1988 and 1989 games, said this year's juniors and seniors are being deprived of some of their most vivid high school memories. \"It is nothing you can experience anywhere else. I don't remember the pep rallies or the shows we had at school. I couldn't tell who did what. But powder-puff, I remember,\" Wright said. \"It is an enjoyable tradition that doesn't cause anyone any harm.\"",

            "article_content": "Presidential candidates always promise economic improvements that are beyond their power to deliver. Any measures that actually could create more jobs, raise wages or lower tax burdens require the cooperation of Congress or business cycles or both. Even if a president could lead us to the promised land of rising incomes and wealth, we wouldn't get there overnight. America's middle class has been wandering the economic desert for decades, and it will take years of better fortunes to restore what's been taken away. \"Our economy is so large that both good and bad impacts are not seen until years or even a decade later,\" said Michael Kitces, director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Maryland. That doesn't mean you have to wait. It does mean you should do what you can to improve your own personal fortunes rather than wait for some politician to bail you out. NO SUDDEN MOVES, NO MATTER WHO WINS \"Bottom line, no one person has that much power to control your finances,\" says Carolyn McClanahan, director of financial planning at Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. A Democratic sweep could mean higher taxes on the wealthy, she says, but \"if you are in the bottom 99 percent, the election is unlikely to affect you very much.\" The limited economic power of presidents also means you shouldn't sabotage your finances by making big financial moves if the \"wrong\" candidate wins, financial planners say. Jeff Rose, CEO and founder of Alliance Wealth Management in Carbondale, Illinois, says his clients who are worried about the election tend to be pessimistic in general, constantly looking for reasons why the economy and their portfolios could plunge. \"In the short term, even if their 'wrong candidate' is elected, it's doubtful they'll see any significant impact to their investments barring another terrorist attack or overseas conflict,\" says Rose, author of the book \"Soldier of Finance.\" Instead, do what you can to set yourself up to prosper when the economy surges and protect yourself if it stalls. Here's what you might do instead of waiting or panicking: \u2014 Get a raise. Median incomes finally increased in 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau says, after eight years of falling or stagnating. The jump of 5.2 percent was the biggest since the bureau began keeping records in 1967. If your income hasn't increased, it might be time to ask for a raise or look for a better job. With unemployment at 5 percent, your prospects are likely better than when joblessness peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. \u2014 Contribute to a retirement plan. A comfortable retirement requires investing year in and year out, regardless of who's president. If you don't have a workplace plan, you can make deductible contributions to an individual retirement account. Several providers, including Ameritrade, Betterment, ETrade, Fidelity, Merrill Edge and Vanguard, allow you to open IRAs with no minimum investment. \u2014 Ditch toxic debt. It's a myth that most Americans carry credit card debt. If you're among the 42.1 percent of U.S. adults who don't always pay off your balance, it's time to start. If you have good credit scores, you can qualify for low-rate balance transfer offers that can help you pay off your debt faster. Another good option could be a personal loan that offers a fixed rate and fixed payments to pay off your debt in three or four years. If you're struggling, consult both a bankruptcy attorney and a nonprofit agency affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling to understand your options. \u2014 Build some equity. More than 3 million homes are still underwater, worth less than their mortgage, and home prices are still below their peak in about 60 percent of metro areas, according to research by CoreLogic. Another troubling trend is the number of people entering retirement age who still owe money on their homes: 30 percent in 2013, compared with 22 percent in 2001, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis of Census Bureau data. A paid-off home not only reduces your expenses in retirement, but also serves as an asset you can tap for income if needed. So once you've paid off toxic debt and are on track for retirement, consider making extra principal payments to get your mortgage paid off faster. Taking positive action can help you deal with uncertainty by focusing on what you can control, rather than what you can't, says consumer expert and radio host Clark Howard. \"You are excusing or minimizing your own role in your financial picture if your focus is mostly on the person elected to office,\" Howard said. _______ This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

            "article_content": "Democrats cap off a busy week in Philadelphia With the general election campaign just hours old, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump began focusing their attention this weekend on America\u2019s Rust Belt -- hoping their separate plans to restore prosperity to the all-important region will sway enough voters there to help them win in November. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, started a three-day Pennsylvania-to-Ohio bus tour Friday with vice presidential nominee Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create jobs in Pennsylvania and across America, especially in places that have been left behind,\u201d Clinton said at a rally Saturday at a factory in Johnstown, part of Pennsylvania\u2019s western, industrial region, home to a large conservative voting bloc that Trump needs. \u201cI believe with all of my heart that the economy should work for everyone, not just the top 1 percent. \u2026 We\u2019re going to support steel workers,\u201d continued Clinton, who also touted her campaign promise to, in her first 100 days in the White House, make the largest investment in jobs since World War II. Clinton won the Democratic labor and blue-collar vote in her failed 2008 presidential primary bid. But those voters have been more difficult for her to reach in this election cycle. Primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 populist message repeatedly tried to portray Clinton as less receptive to middle class needs. The Vermont senator in fact scored a major suprise win over Clinton in the Michigan primay. Meanwhile, Trump, the Republican nominee, and running mate Mike Pence continued to argue that electing Clinton would continue the Obama administration's failed economic policies -- marked by stagnant wages and bad international trade deals that are sending manufacturing jobs oversea. \u201cThe second-quarter numbers came out -- 1.2 percent growth in the American economy,\u201d Pence, Indiana's governor, said Friday night at a rally in Lima, Ohio.\u00a0\u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expect a different result \u2026 People are restless for change.\u201d Most political analysts predict that the general election will again be decided by four so-called battleground states, among them Ohio and Pennsylvania. Clinton and Trump are deadlocked in those states, according to two recent Quinnipiac University polls, though an NBC survey released July 13 shows Trump trailing by 9 percentage points. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if Clinton can hold off Trump in the Rust Belt by going back to the blue-collar vote,\u201d Caleb Burns, a Republican strategist and partner in the Washington law firm Wiley Rein, said earlier this week. \u201cIf she can, it will be extremely difficult for Trump to find a path to victory.\u201d To be sure, Trump already has a narrow path toward getting the requisite 270 electoral votes to take the White House. Beyond winning the 13 states that GOP nominees have taken in the past six presidential races, Trump must also win some combination of battleground states -- including Colorado, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. No Republican has won Pennsylvania since 1988, and no Republican nominee has won the White House without winning Ohio. \u201cAnd this election will be no different,\u201d Fox News contributor and senior Bush administration policy adviser Karl Rove recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal editorial pages. \u201cIf Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to blue-collar, white swing voters is real, he could paint Pennsylvania red. If so, he is likely to win the White House with 273 electoral votes.\u201d However, a loss in Pennsylvania would mean Trump would have to find wins in such Midwestern industrial states as Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, all Democratic strongholds. Clinton and Kaine continued their \u201cStronger Together\u201d tour Saturday with a late-afternoon rally in Pittsburgh and an evening event in Youngstown, Ohio. Their tour concludes Sunday in Columbus. At a rally in Colorado on Friday, the day after Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia, Trump went after Clinton and Kaine on economic issues. \u201cWe have to go over some numbers,\u201d he said at a rally in Denver, a liberal stronghold. \u201cHillary was talking last night about how wonderful everything was. She didn\u2019t talk about all of the unbelievable long-term unemployment, the fact house ownership is the lowest in 51 years.\u201d He also argued that Kaine is \u201cnot popular\u201d in his home state of Virginia, considering that unemployment nearly doubled in his one term as governor and that his first move after getting elected to the post in 2005 was to increase taxes by $4 billion. Trump plans to visit\u00a0Columbus and Cleveland on Monday.",

            "article_content": "On 'Hannity,' former NYC mayor sounds off about the string of attacks Rudy Giuliani, one of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisers, said Sunday that he cannot defend the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s crude remarks on a recently released audiotape, but was steadfast in saying Trump remains the country\u2019s best choice for president and that he will stay in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not here to defend his comments,\u201d Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHis comments were wrong. They were reprehensible.\u201d The comments were recorded in a 2005 audiotape, and in an accompanying video tape, that was released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC. They included Trump describing his failed attempt to have sex with a married woman. Trump also brags in the tapes about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. Giuliani said he thinks Trump will remain in the race, despite a long list of Republicans -- from party leaders to senators in tough re-election bids -- denouncing the comments and, in some cases, calling for him to quit the race. \u201cI believe he\u2019s going to remain in the race,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News, from Trump Tower. He also argued that Trump -- a first-time candidate, wealthy New York businessman and former reality TV star -- is a better choice than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to move the country forward. He suggested that Trump can best create more jobs for the middle-class, including returning manufacturing jobs in America\u2019s heartland, and that he remains the \u201coutsider\u201d best suited to take the country back from \u201cinsiders.\u201d Though Giuliani declined to defend Trump\u2019s comments on the 11-year-old tape, he defended the nominee\u2019s character and argued the past 14 months, including hearing voters\u2019 struggles, has changed Trump for the better. \u201cI\u2019ve known Donald Trump for more than 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful father. He\u2019s been a gentleman.\u201d Giuliani also attempted to explain why he replaced Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who cancelled her planned appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" saying he thinks the issue was \"scheduling.\" \"Kellyanne is still a very strong supporter of Donald Trump,\" he also said.",

            "article_content": "Hillary's camp continues to try to protect the unity of the Democratic Party; Jennifer Griffin reports for 'Special Report' Presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday in the Washington, D.C., Democratic primary -- marking the end of the presidential primary season and bringing the two candidates together for a face-to-face meeting to discuss what\u2019s next for the party in the general election. The Associated Press said with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Clinton has 74,566 votes, compared to 19,990 for Sanders. Neither candidate spoke to reporters Tuesday night after their roughly 90-minute meeting in a Washington hotel. However, the campaigns released separate, but nearly identical statements saying that Clinton and Sanders had a \u201cpositive discussion\u201d about their primary race, unifying the party and their mutual desire to stop presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump from winning in November. The campaigns also said the candidates discussed issues in which they share common goals, including increasing wages for working families, eliminating undisclosed money in politics and reducing the cost of college. The meeting, which included the candidates' campaign managers, concluded with the sides agreeing to continue to work on a shared agenda that includes developing a platform for the upcoming Democratic National Convention, each campaign said. Sanders said he\u2019ll tell supporters his next steps Thursday via a live, online video. \u201cAfter today, the voting is done, but our political revolution continues,\u201d Sanders said in an email Tuesday to supporters. Clinton clinched the nomination last week by getting the requisite 2,383 delegates -- a combination of superdelegates and pledged delegates awarded to her in 56 primary and caucus wins, including those in Puerto Rico and six U.S. territories. Sanders has so far refused to end his campaign despite pressure to do so, suggesting he will keep trying to persuade Clinton superdelegates to instead vote for him at the Democratic convention in July, in a long-shot bid to take the nomination. However, the Sanders campaign has occasionally suggested that the candidate could end his bid if Clinton, and the entire Democratic Party, embrace key parts of his agenda including better universal health care, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and free tuition at state colleges and universities. Clinton said earlier Tuesday in an interview with Telemundo that she was very much \"looking forward to having (Sanders') support in this campaign, because Donald Trump poses a serious threat to our nation.\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the D.C. primary, \"Democrats are ready to unify and take on both Trump and the Republican Party that he represents. At our convention in July, we\u2019re going to nominate a qualified, capable candidate who will build on the hard-won progress of the last seven years.\" \u201cI think the time is now. In fact, the time is overdue, for a fundamental transformation of the Democratic party,\u201d Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, said Tuesday on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe need a party which is prepared to stand up for the disappearing middle class.\u201d Before Tuesday, Clinton had 2,784 delegates, compared to 1,877 for Sanders. On Sunday, Sanders told ABC News that the meeting with Clinton will be about \u201cwhat kind of platform we have and \u2026 what kind of administration she will have.\u201d Sanders also told ABC that he wants Clinton to also specifically commit to a progressive tax system that makes big banks and corporations pay \u201ctheir fair share of taxes.\u201d That Sanders, 74, even challenged the better-known and better-funded Clinton this far is a remarkable political feat. The former first lady and secretary of state was expected to breeze through the primary. But Sanders, appearing to tap into voters\u2019 frustrations with established candidates and money-driven politics, took the race until the second-to-last week of the Democratic primary season. Along the way, Sanders won 21 primaries or caucuses, backed by legions of young voters and others excited by his promises of higher wages, free college and limiting the influence of \u201cbig money\u201d in elections. Sanders\u2019 long-shot bid began with a key win in New Hampshire, an early primary that Clinton had won in her failed 2008 White House bid. He showed his campaign was for real in March by managing seven straight victories, putting the Clinton campaign on its heels until late April, when Clinton won her home-state of New York. Clinton nearly put the race out of reach with a series of early wins, including first-in-the-nation Iowa, and in delegate-rich states such as South Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas and Virginia. But Sanders scored a big comeback victory March 8 in Michigan that stopped Clinton\u2019s decisive run across the South. However, he failed to sustain momentum, with Clinton winning the next seven state contests. Fox News' Mike Emanuel and Lauren Blanchard and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Erica Hall via WALA-TV) MOBILE, Ala. \u2013 An Alabama teacher is on leave after giving middle school students a test with math questions about prostitutes, drugs and guns, a school official said Wednesday. Rena Philips, a spokeswoman for Mobile County's public schools, said the educator from Burns Middle School was placed on administrative leave after a parent complained. The teacher's name isn't being made public, Phillips said. WALA-TV quoted parent Erica Hall as saying the test was given to her son's eighth-grade language arts class on Friday. \"My son, he took a picture of it in class and he texted it to me.

            "article_content": "FILE - In this Dec. 6, 1973 file photo, political activist Tom Hayden, husband of Jane Fonda, tells newsmen in Los Angeles that he believes public support was partially responsible for the decision not to send him and others of the Chicago 7 to jail for contempt. (AP) SANTA MONICA, Calif.  \u2013 Famed '60s anti-war activist Tom Hayden, whose name became forever linked with the celebrated Chicago 7 trial, Vietnam War protests and his ex-wife actress Jane Fonda, has died. He was 76. He died on Sunday after a long illness, said his wife, Barbara Williams, noting that he suffered a stroke in 2015. Hayden, once denounced as a traitor by his detractors, overcame his past and won election to the California Assembly and Senate where he served for almost two decades as a progressive force on such issues as the environment and education. He was the only one of the radical Chicago 7 defendants to win such distinction in the mainstream political world. He remained an enduring voice against war and spent his later years as a prolific writer and lecturer advocating for reform of America's political institutions. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti praised Hayden. \"A political giant and dear friend has passed. Tom Hayden fought harder for what he believed than just about anyone I have known. RIP, Tom,\" Garcetti said Sunday night on his Twitter account. Hayden wrote or edited 19 books, including \"Reunion,\" a memoir of his path to protest and a rumination on the political upheavals of the '60s. \"Rarely, if ever, in American history has a generation begun with higher ideals and experienced greater trauma than those who lived fully the short time from 1960 to 1968,\" he wrote. Hayden was there at the start. In 1960, while a student at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, he was involved in the formation of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), then dedicated to desegregating the South. By 1962, when he began drafting the landmark Port Huron Statement, SDS and Hayden were dedicated to changing the world. Hayden was fond of comparing the student movement that followed to the American Revolution and the Civil War. In 1968, he helped organize anti-war demonstrations during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that turned violent and resulted in the notorious Chicago 7 trial. It began as the Chicago 8 trial, but one defendant, Bobby Seale, was denied the lawyer of his choice, was bound and gagged by the judge and ultimately received a separate trial. After a circus-like trial, Hayden and three others were convicted of crossing state lines to incite riot. The convictions were later overturned, and an official report deemed the violence \"a police riot.\" Thomas Emmet Hayden was born Dec. 11, 1939, in Royal Oak, Michigan, to middle-class parents. At Michigan, he took up political causes including the civil rights movement. He wrote fiery editorials for the campus newspaper and contemplated a career in journalism. But upon graduation, he turned down a newspaper job. As he wrote in his memoir, \"I didn't want to report on the world; I wanted to change it.\" He joined the fledgling Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, went freedom-riding during civil rights protests in the South and was beaten and briefly jailed in Mississippi and Georgia. He married a fellow activist, Sandra \"Casey\" Cason. Yearning for a more influential role, Hayden returned to Ann Arbor, where he was enlisted by the SDS to draft the Port Huron Statement, a call to action he hoped would spread to the rest of the country. In 1965, Hayden made his first visit to North Vietnam with an unauthorized delegation. In 1967, he returned to Hanoi with another group and was asked by North Vietnamese leaders to bring three prisoners of war back to the United States. Firmly committed to the anti-war movement, Hayden participated in sit-ins at Columbia University, then began traveling the country to promote a rally in Chicago for the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In the interim, a single event galvanized him \u2014 the 1968 assassination of his friend, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in Los Angeles. \"I went from Robert Kennedy's coffin into a very bleak and bitter political view,\" Hayden told the Associated Press in 1988. In 1971, Hayden met Jane Fonda, a latecomer to the protest movement. After he heard her give an eloquent anti-war speech in 1972, Hayden said they connected and became a couple. He was divorced from Cason. Fonda was divorced from director Roger Vadim and had a daughter, Vanessa Vadim. Hayden and Fonda were married for 17 years and had a son, Troy. With heavy financial support from Fonda, Hayden plunged into California politics in the late 1970s. He formed the Campaign for Economic Democracy and was elected to the Assembly in 1982. In 1992, Hayden won election to the state Senate advocating for environmental and educational issues. By then, he and Fonda were divorced. Hayden went on to marry actress Barbara Williams, and they had a son, Liam. In 1994, Hayden was defeated in a run for the state governorship, and he lost a bid to become mayor of Los Angeles. After leaving public office, Hayden wrote and traveled extensively, lecturing, teaching and speaking out against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was also an advocate for animals, and in 2012 he lobbied Gov. Jerry Brown to preserve a piece of legislation known as Hayden's Law, which he had authored to protect shelter animals from premature euthanasia.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday that American voters, superdelegates and others must \u201ctake a hard look\u201d at the recent federal report that found primary rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s email setup while running the State Department broke agency rules. \u201cIt was not a good report for Secretary Clinton. That is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at,\" Sanders told CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" during one of two TV network interviews Sunday. The inspector general\u2019s report last week concluded Clinton broke agency rules by using a private email server and that she would have been denied permission to have one had she first sought permission. On Sunday, Sanders, desperately trailing the front-running Clinton in the delegate count, continued to not comment directly on the controversy. But he repeated the notion that superdelegates, of which he needs more in a longshot bid to take the nomination, should indeed scrutinize the report. \u201cI mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind, and certainly the superdelegates are,\" Sanders said. The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that the report shows \"just how consistent (Clinton's) email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email.\" The campaign also said the report notes that Clinton's use of personal email was known to officials within the department and that there is no evidence to show any successful breach of the former secretary of state's server. In a separate interview Sunday with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sanders said he is focused on \u201cthe future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems they are facing.\u201d He also declined to comment on the FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal, including what impact the findings might have on a Clinton general election bid. However, Sanders appeared to perhaps take his concerns about the emails a step further, suggesting Americans are \u201ctired of those kinds of politics.\u201d And he made clear presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has and will continue to make an issue of them if and when he faces Clinton directly in the November election. \u201cDonald Trump and other Republicans will seize on it,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubting that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "(Volvo) Volvo has always had an alternative image in the United States market, catering to a certain segment of the upper middle class and above that is attracted to its once-quirky, always safety-minded cars. But alternative fuels have never been a big part of the appeal. Sure, there\u2019s been the odd diesel sold here over the years, but the strangest things found under the hoods of most Volvos are five-cylinder engines. This isn\u2019t the case overseas, where oil-burning Volvos are aplenty, as are ones that run on ethanol and even compressed natural gas. Even so, internal combustion of some sort has always been the primary motivator of its cars. That changes soon. Starting in 2012 the Swedish automaker will begin selling a plug-in hybrid version of the V60 - a wagon version of the S60 sedan that is not offered in the United States. Not only will the car be the company\u2019s first hybrid, but also the world\u2019s first hybrid to use a diesel engine. Like the V60 itself, there are currently no plans to sell the car in the U.S., but Volvo has something else in mind for us. The C30 Electric is a battery-powered version of the smallest car that Volvo currently makes. To create it, the sporty three-door hatchback was stripped of its engine and transmission and had an advanced electric powertrain installed that consists of a 110 horsepower motor driving the front wheels and a T-shaped lithium-ion battery pack tucked into the central tunnel of the car and the space vacated by the no-longer-necessary fuel tank. Volvo\u2019s head of special vehicles, Lennert Stegland tells FoxNews.com that the decision to convert an existing car to electric drive, rather than build a unique vehicle as Nissan did with its Leaf, was partly about cost, but intended to streamline the process of electrification by taking as many variables out of the equation as possible. This allowed his team to focus its efforts on all of the new technologies involved. In keeping with the company\u2019s reputation as a safetynik, much effort was put toward protecting the reinforced 600-pound battery pack in the event of an accident. Its position in the middle of the car isolates it from any likely crumple zones, and eight separate crash tests have demonstrated the near invulnerability of the installation. The battery pack itself is built by Ener1, an Indianapolis-based company that is also a supplier for Think, a Norwegian automaker that is currently building a small, two-seat electric car in Indiana. Comprised of 384 individual cells, each about the size of a sheet of paper and as thick as a stack of 20 or so, the 24 kilowatt-hour pack takes about 8 hours to be recharged from a 220-volt outlet and provides the C30 Electric with a maximum range of up to 100 miles. Volvo concedes that most drivers can expect a more realistic range of 75 and 95 miles, dependent on driving style and environment, but adds that statistics show that is enough to satisfy the daily driving needs of 90% of the world\u2019s population. On a short test drive in Manhattan the Volvo exhibited the holy grail of electric cars: complete normalcy. The response of the accelerator and brake pedals \u2013 often a bugaboo of battery-powered vehicles \u2013 felt nearly perfect. And, with hardly any changes to the interior of the conventioal C30, there really isn\u2019t much to tip you off that anything odd is afoot. That is, aside from a energy flow meter where the tachometer usually is and the soft whine of the electric motor as it seamlessly \u2013 there is only one gear \u2013 propels you on your way. Most impressive is the near invisible integration of the battery pack and its electronic controls within the C30\u2019s existing structure. Even the purpose-built Leaf has a large intrusion in its cargo area for its charger, and the upcoming Ford Focus Electric features a box the size of a piece of checked baggage behind its rear seats. Volvo developed the C30 Electric in just over two years, and all indications are that it did its homework along the way. Compared to the Leaf \u2013 the product of a much longer and likely more costly project \u2013 the C30 Electric has little to be embarrassed about. Except, perhaps, for the fact that it\u2019s not entirely an electric car. One of the main drawbacks of electric vehicles is that the performance of their batteries varies greatly with the weather. Extreme temperatures, particularly the cold, can greatly reduce their ability to hold a full charge, which, combined with the use of heat and air conditioning in the cabin, leads to a significantly shorter driving range. Some electrified vehicles, like the Chevy Volt and Tesla Roadster, use actively climate-controlled battery packs to help mitigate this affect, as does the C30 Electric. The difference is that while the systems in the other cars run off the batteries themselves, also cutting into range to some extent, the Volvo has a separate generator on board that burns E85. It\u2019s an interesting, if less environmentally pure solution to a vexing problem, but one that makes sense for a car from a country that extends into the Arctic Circle. However, Stegland says that even when used in extreme conditions, the C30 Electric will use less than 4 gallons of E85 every three weeks. If the tank runs dry, the climate control system merely reverts to battery power and you\u2019re all electric again. Sales of the Volvo C30 Electric aren\u2019t expected to begin before 2013, but later this year the company will put a test fleet of approximately 250 cars on the road in several cities around the globe \u2013 including New York and Los Angeles \u2013 in order to collect real world data from the vehicles and feedback from their drivers. Pricing for a production version hasn\u2019t been set, but Stegland estimates that it could be as much as $50,000, or twice what a conventional C30 goes for. With looming CO2 emissions caps in Europe, increasing fuel economy standards in the United States and China\u2019s drive to cut its dependence on imported oil by electrifying its fast-growing population of automobiles, Volvo is ready to embrace this alternative fuel, which is itself quickly becoming mainstream.

The Vermont senator and Democratic presidential hopeful also brought along statistics to support his cause. \"It is a moral outrage that the top one-tenth of 1 percent today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent; that 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent,\" he said. To that, as with nearly everything he said, the audience cheered. Sanders, who is currently a strong rival to Hillary Rodham Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, said it's time Americans demand that \"government start working for all of us, not just the few.\" But Colbert asked him how he expected to go all the way to the White House without forming a Super PAC and soliciting campaign contributions from big donors. \"You don't bring a spoon to a knife fight,\" Colbert said. Sanders countered he was getting small donations from hundreds of thousands of individual contributors instead. \"I don't support the agenda of corporate America or the billionaire class,\" he said. \"I don't want their money.\" \"You are a liberal and you are a socialist, and people call you a liberal and a socialist,\" said Colbert impishly. \"Why will you not accept those two terms as the insults they are meant to be?\" Sanders laughed. \"I prefer the term 'progressive,'\" he declared.",

            "article_content": "The 2016 Ram 1500 Rebel is ready to go...off-road. \u201cIt\u2019s bold \u2026 aggressive \u2026 and designed for individuals who live their lives that way.\u201d That\u2019s how Ram CEO Bob Hegbloom described the Ram 1500 Rebel to me when he introduced it earlier this year, and it\u2019s still the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever heard an auto executive say. The brief for the Rebel was to take the spirit of a modified off-road pickup and turn it into a factory option covered by a warranty. In other words: build an off-the-rack brodozer. (Ram) So Bob had his folks at Ram take a look around and curate a mix tape of essential features. These include powder-coated metal bumpers and skid plates, tow hooks, wheel arch extensions and big, puffy 33-inch Toyo off-road tires on a set of unique 17-inch wheels. (Ram) To clear those big meats, Ram lifted the Rebel\u2019s standard adjustable air suspension by an inch, giving it a max of 10.3 inches between the axles, and recalibrated all of the computer bits to roll with the changes. (Ram) The bulging hood is borrowed from the Ram 1500 Sport \u2013 fake intakes intact \u2013 and the grille is \u2026 unique? Instead of a traditional Ram crosshair, it\u2019s more of a snout. There\u2019s a big silver RAM badge in the middle of it and an even larger black one on the tailgate, just to put an exclamation point on the whole \u201cbold\u201d thing. (Ram) The cabin gets a black, silver and red motif, and a set of sport seats with synthetic upholstery that\u2019s embossed with the exact same tread pattern as the tires, which really makes no sense but my kids thought was cool. (Ram) There\u2019s plenty of room for them, since the Rebel is available only in a crew-cab, short-bed configuration. Surprisingly, a two-wheel-drive version is offered, and it misses the point by a country mile. Four-by-fours come with either a 305 hp V6 for $45,915 or a 395 hp Hemi V8 for $1,650 more. The Rebel has a legit 4x4 system with a low-range transfer case and no AWD setting, but also just a locking center differential. A limited slip diff is optional for the rear, but if you want this kind of style with three real lockers for serious mucking about, you\u2019ll have to step up to its big brother, the heavy duty Power Wagon. Test Drive: 2014 Ram Power Wagon The changes don\u2019t hurt the 1500\u2019s best-in-class ride quality much, while the added traction and ride height definitely make it the best Ram 1500 to drive directly from the dealer to the nearest gravel pit \u2013 especially with the thunderous Hemi. That said, the wheel travel and articulation aren\u2019t extreme, and the front suspension is too stiff for high-speed running over ruts and humps, so take it slow. The last time I talked to Bob a few weeks ago, he said he couldn't build enough of these to keep up with demand, so it looks like it worked out for him. Still, half the fun of a modified truck is putting your own mark on it, so I\u2019m not sure buying one off the lot is really all that rebellious. But if it looks like this one, it is a bold move. ---------- 2016 Ram 1500 Rebel 4x4 Hemi Base price: $47,565 Type: 4-door, 5-passenger pickup Engine: 5.7-liter V8 Power: 395 hp, 410 lb-ft torque Transmission: 8-speed automatic MPG: 15 city/21 hwy",

            "article_content": "Reporter for The Hill Katie Bo Williams provides insight More hacked emails released Saturday from WikiLeaks appear to show more about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private, high-priced Wall Street speeches including her argument that Washington lawmakers would pass the Dodd-Frank banking reform law merely for \u201cpolitical reasons.\u201d \u201cWith political people \u2026 there was a lot of complaining about Dodd-Frank, but there was also a need to do something for political reasons,\u201d Clinton said at a 2013 Goldman Sachs investment symposium. \u201cIf you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it's all the fault of Wall Street, you can't sit idly by and do nothing,\u201d Clinton also said in the speech. The speech was just one of several for Wall Street audiences and for which Clinton was paid more than $200,000, according to an analysis of her financial disclosure forms released this spring. The Democratic presidential nominee purportedly earned roughly $1.8 million for eight speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs. The hacked emails, from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and others associated with Clinton, are emerging months after Clinton\u2019s primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, called for her to release transcripts of the speeches -- in an attempt to prove her believed ties to big banks. Other documents in the trove released Saturday, including a transcript of the Goldman Sachs speech, appear to suggest Clinton wanted the United States to intervene in civil war-torn Syria in a more covert manner. \u201cMy view was you intervene as covertly as is possible,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cWe used to be much better at this than we are now.\u00a0Now, you know, everybody can't help themselves.\u00a0They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else:\u00a0Look what we're doing and I want credit for it, and all the rest of it.\u201d Also on Saturday, WikiLeaks release a 2015 email exchange from Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill and long-time Clinton aide Heather Samuelson about the State Department\u2019s apparent plans to place a favorable story with Associated Press reporters Matt Lee and Bradley Klapper about the release of emails from Clinton confidant Sydney Blumenthal as the missives are turned over to a Republican-led congressional committee. (Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.) Merrill also says in the exchange that he would like the story to run during the release of a Supreme Court decision because it will distract the \u201cnews hyenas.\u201d The emails are thought to have been hacked by Russians and released in an attempt to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 General Election between Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Podesta on Friday fired back at Julian Assange as his WikiLeaks group released another set of hacked emails, which have been an embarrassing distraction for the Clinton campaign. \u201cI bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy,\u201d Podesta tweeted, while Assange starts his fifth year at the Ecuador Embassy in the United Kingdom, amid a 2005 rape allegation in Sweden. The tweet also included a picture of Podesta and celebrity chef Daniel Boulud recently preparing the dish at a private Clinton fundraiser. Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin on Saturday compared the Podesta email hack to the Watergate break in. \"Four decades later, we\u2019re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly this time, instead of filing cabinets, it\u2019s people\u2019s emails they\u2019re breaking into \u2026 and a foreign government is behind it.\" Earlier this month, WikiLeaks posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of Podesta\u2019s personal email account. Among those was an internal review of Clinton\u2019s Wall Street speeches to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public. In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, Clinton reflected on the necessity of \"unsavory\" political dealing, telling real estate investors that \"you need both a public and private position.\" To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she's \"kind of far removed\" from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. Podesta suggested last weekend on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that his emails from the WikiLeaks posting were not authentic. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee vows to bring jobs back to America, renegotiate NAFTA and reform tax laws, regulations and energy rules Hillary Clinton and the Democrats should be worried. Why? Because Donald Trump delivered Thursday night and did what he needed to do. No, he didn\u2019t deliver a speech with great oratorical flourish. No, he didn\u2019t broaden the base of the party significantly though he did speak about minorities and the LGBTQ community in ways that he hadn\u2019t done before. What Trump did, and he did it very well, was to raise the stakes of the election and define it in his own terms. Law and order, crime in the streets, and terror. He managed to make the argument, compellingly, that these challenges were the central ones America faced and that given the failures of President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his way of change was the only way to go. It was a long speech, it ran well over an hour and it was repetitive in parts. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Trump was ultimately speaking to a fairly discrete and arguably specific constituency of Americans. Concentrated, though not exclusively, in the swing states of the industrial Midwest. What Trump did, and he did it very well, was to raise the stakes of the election and define it in his own terms. Trump\u2019s remarks were directed at the 70-odd percent of Americans who feel the country is on the wrong track and his remarks were designed to amplify those feelings and offer \u2013 in general terms \u2013 a different way forward. I don\u2019t believe that the pundits necessarily will give this speech high marks and in my own terms, Trump did not do anything that he has not done before on the campaign trail. But what he did do is present a vision of America, a path forward, and a vision of leadership that is very, very different than what the country has had for the last eight years. It was necessarily more non-partisan than traditional Republican speeches. Trump did not harp on Republicanism or conservatism, and indeed his own daughter Ivanka specifically underscored that her generation of millennials were not partisan in the way that older Americans were. Trump was speaking to commonsense, American concerns about safety and security, primarily, though not exclusively, of the working and middle class white Americans -- the people he called forgotten Americans, reminiscent of Richard Nixon\u2019s silent majority. Do I think this is enough to catapult Trump well into the lead? No I don\u2019t. Do I think this will solidify his position and perhaps bring him even or put him into a slight advantage going into the Democratic Convention? I think that\u2019s plausible but unlikely. I think, also, that in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, these remarks will help him significantly with precisely the voters and constituents he needs if he\u2019s going to win the election. It will be interesting to see how Secretary Clinton responds, not only to the substance of the speech, but to the atmospherics of the convention. It was a white convention; it was a convention that was not really able to broaden the demographic base of the Republican party. Secretary Clinton will almost certainly highlight substantial numbers of blacks, Latinos, and Asians in the four days to come in Philadelphia starting on Monday. But she\u2019s got another challenge, and one that is perhaps larger than what she expected. She needs to address the issues of law and order, safety, and security, as well as terrorism, in the way that Trump presented them given the challenges that we are all facing as Americans. The other challenge Secretary Clinton will have is to make the case for globalism and for our role in the world. Trump explicitly and clearly ruled it out. He said that we need to put America first and put America before our role in the world. This goes against the credo and the values of American culture and foreign policy. But at a time when wages are stagnated, jobs are disappearing, and people are increasingly at risk and facing threats both at home and abroad, it may well be enough to turn an election that was beginning to appear issueless into the most profound, prominent, and I dare say, nation determinative contest in recent memory.",

            "article_content": "Former speaker of the House weighs in on 'Hannity' We have now finished two weeks of two conventions by two parties. For Americans who watched both presentations, the contrast was jarring. They weren't just offering two different political visions. In many ways, they were offering two radically different versions of reality. In that sense, the gap between the two conventions was an accurate reflection of where we are as a country. There really are two very different visions of reality competing in the political campaigns underway this year--with their own value systems, sets of ideas, and interpretations of the facts. The version of reality that many Republicans, Independents, and even some Democrats are experiencing was the basis for the Republican convention in Cleveland. In the Republican understanding of reality, the country is on the wrong track, the government isn\u2019t working, and the problems are getting worse. The election this November is certainly a contest between two candidates, but it is also a contest between these two versions of reality. Republicans see a country in which the threat from terrorism is increasing here at home and around the world. They see a country in which crime is getting worse, murders are up 70 percent in Chicago, and police officers are being assassinated at the highest rate in decades. They see a country in which the border is not secure and the political class has done nothing about it. They see health care costs going up, with a new law that makes it more complicated and gives people less choice about what doctors they can see. They see a country in which the economy has left ordinary middle class Americans behind and fewer people are working. That\u2019s the Cleveland version of reality. The Philadelphia view is very different. Democrats see a president who is relatively popular and who has achieved a great deal of his agenda. They see a first lady who is a good role model and who is even more popular than the President. In this version of reality, eight years of their administration have worked pretty well. They and their highly educated friends have good jobs and more influence. They see a historically high stock market and weak but still positive economic growth. They see their health care law as a statistical success, even if it remains unpopular. They see major victories on social issues--although they would like to push the boundaries even further. They see terrorism as a persistent but manageable problem in which the intolerant and Islamophobic West occasionally provokes clinically insane people to violence. They see crime as low by historic standards and not a major national priority, except for the special case of gun control. They see police abuses and police killings of innocent people as widespread and the product of racism. These are two very different versions of reality in America. Both are based on real facts and feelings, assessed using very different value systems. The election this November is certainly a contest between two candidates, but it is also a contest between these two versions of reality. If you accept the Cleveland version of reality, you are far more likely to understand the appeal of Donald Trump, who wants to keep Americans safe and would drastically change the bureaucratic systems you see as failing. On the other hand, if you accept the Philadelphia version of reality, you are comfortable with a candidate like Hillary Clinton who wants to make minor changes to the status quo. The Bernie supporters are a special case. They are a little of each. This faction of the Democratic Party is not happy with the status quo, and it makes a critique that is surprisingly similar to that of Trump\u2019s populist rebellion within the GOP: the system is rigged, the wealthy and the well connected are exploiting the rest of us, and our foreign policies have failed. Where the Sanders wing of the Democrats departs from Trump\u2019s populism is in their solutions. They think more government and more bureaucratic systems can solve the problems. Trump\u2019s populism, on the other hand, views government and bureaucratic systems as the problem. These versions of reality in America are about to collide at the ballot box. When the American people vote in November, in part they will be deciding which version of reality is more real than the other.",

            "article_content": "Radio talk show host Garland Nixon and GOP strategist Rina Shah join the debate Ivanka Trump has shown her strength as a surrogate for her father in the boardroom and on the campaign trail. But as Election Day draws closer, the Donald Trump team faces a decision on how to balance the 34-year-old\u2019s weighty responsibilities \u2013\u00a0as executive vice president of The Trump Organization, and top campaign adviser and advocate. If the response to her recent convention address is any gauge of her impact, pollsters suggest the Trump campaign may want to do whatever it can to get Ivanka on the trail. \u201cShe [was] off the charts,\u201d Lee Carter, a pollster with Maslansky\u00a0+ Partners, told Fox News in reviewing the focus-group reaction to Ivanka right after her speech. \u201cThe bottom line is she is an amazing spokeswoman for him.\u201d Ivanka is seen as someone who could make a powerful case for her dad, potentially softening his image among female voters and others with whom the Republican\u2019s numbers have lagged. Asked for comment on what's next for the influential Trump daughter \u2013 and mother of three \u2013 the campaign did not elaborate but suggested she'll play an important role. \u201cShe will be an incredible asset to the campaign and we are grateful for her support,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told FoxNews.com. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Ivanka Trump's convention address in Cleveland was a clear message to independents and especially female voters as she touted her father\u2019s record on hiring women, favoring quality over quotas and embracing talent. \u201cMy father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period,\u201d she told the audience at Quicken Loans Arena. For many voters, it was their first chance to really hear from Ivanka. But she's been an integral part of her father's business empire for years, and now the inner political circle \u2013\u00a0dual roles that could complicate efforts to deploy her on the trail. Inside the Trump Organization, Ivanka primarily manages the real-estate components and is seen by many as the emerging face of the Trump brand. She is considered one of the few individuals Trump trusts to make deals on his behalf. \u201cI think her father really listens to her, and when I say listens to her I mean I think her father respects her a great deal, and not just because she\u2019s his daughter,\u201d businessman Carl Icahn told The New York Times. Ivanka has publicly defended her father from claims of sexism and racism, while privately her influence over major campaign decisions is virtually unrivaled, a source with intimate knowledge of campaign operations told FoxNews.com. The source confirmed she played an influential role in the dismissal of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. \u201cShe is less concerned about the politics of the campaign and more focused on protecting the Trump brand,\u201d the source said. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner also played a critical role in his selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as Trump\u2019s running mate, according to Time magazine. Sarah Lenti, a Denver-based Republican consultant, suggested the Trump daughter proved an asset in Cleveland and should be deployed to whatever extent possible. \u201cI think [Trump] needs to play the woman\u2019s card as much as possible. She was highly relatable and is extremely well-liked among working- and middle-class women,\u201d Lenti said. During a recent focus group of women, Lenti found a majority of them disliked both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- but related to Ivanka. \u201cThey wanted to hear more from her on the issues. They were really impressed with her grace and what she has accomplished in life,\u201d Lenti told FoxNews.com. \u201cOlder and middle-aged women don\u2019t want to hear about abortion. They want to hear about how to balance work and life. [Ivanka] is a mom of three, she works a full-time job and she has her own business. She gets it.\u201d A clearer picture will emerge in coming weeks, but a\u00a0CNN/ORC post-convention poll found Donald Trump made gains both in terms of his personal image and his ability to manage foreign policy. He still has ground to make up with women. A post-convention CBS News poll showed Clinton expanding her lead among women (though trailing among men). The Trumps may have a chance, however, to shift those numbers. A\u00a0pre-convention, six-week Morning Consult poll\u00a0found while Clinton led Trump 44-36 percent among women, as many as 21 percent were undecided. Ivanka Trump's presence on the campaign trail inevitably creates a rivalry of sorts with the famous daughter on the other side of the aisle, Chelsea Clinton, who introduced her mother for the Democrats' closing convention night in Philadelphia last Thursday. Two days earlier, Chelsea Clinton was asked during a Facebook Live event what she would like to ask Ivanka. Clinton said it would be how her father would pay for his proposals. \u201cHow would your father do that given it\u2019s not something he\u2019s spoken about. There are no policies on any of those fronts on his website. Not last week. Not this week. The how question is super important,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look at those issues that certainly affect our generation so strongly, I think my mom has stronger plans and a stronger record for actually delivering for women and families,\u201d Clinton added. In a recent\u00a0interview with Politico, Ivanka acknowledged voters may view her as a product of heritage, not hard work: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem if somebody who has never met me wants to say that I wouldn\u2019t be where I was today without my family because you know what? They may be right. They probably are right. Who the hell knows? It\u2019s an impossible argument.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former presidential candidate reacts to the FBI's findings, Afghan troop announcement Washington Democrats\u2019 strong bid to take control of the Senate by defeating several Republican incumbents is showing signs of struggling in the final weeks of the election cycle. In Florida, Democrats targeted first-term GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, considering his failed effort to fix the country\u2019s problematic immigration system and him frequently abandoning Capitol Hill responsibilities to run for president made him unpopular among voters. But with less than six weeks before Election Day, Rubio is maintaining a roughly 6-percentage-point lead. And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is cutting back a planned advertising blitz in Florida, which includes canceling ads into early October. The group, whose primary goal is to keep and win Senate seats, says it stands behind candidate Patrick Murphy. However, such a move late in the election cycle usually means a change in strategy in which such groups reallocate remaining money to states where TV advertising costs far less and they have better chances in November. Democrats must win at net total of four or five seats to retake control of the Senate. At the start of start of the cycle, Democrats targeted the seat occupied by Rubio as well as those of GOP incumbents Sens. Rob Portman, Ohio; Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire; Ron Johnson, Wisconsin; and Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania -- all battleground states where they had hoped, at the very least, Republican president nominee Donald Trump\u2019s sometimes divisive campaign would help their cause. However, Ohio, a so-called \u201crust belt\u201d state with a large number of older, white middle-class voters seems poised to swing Republican on November 8, with Trump doing well against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and Portman now pulling away. Portman leads Democratic challenger, former House member and Gov. Ted Strickland, by 13 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics\u2019 polls average. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of the robust organization we\u2019ve built over the past two years across all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties,\" Portman campaign manager Corry Bliss recently told The Wall Street Journal, while also highlighting outreach efforts to Hispanic and black voters, challenging voting blocs for Republican candidates. In New Hampshire, Ayotte, a first-term senator, is clinging to a 2.5 percentage point lead over Democratic challenger Gov. Maggie Hassan. And in Pennsylvania, which has voted for the Democratic nominee in the past six presidential elections, Toomey is in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Katie McGinty. In Indiana, former Democratic senator and Gov. Evan Bayh is having a harder-than-anticipated time trying to win the open Senate seat held by Republican Dan Coats, amid reports about recent years working as a consultant at a Washington lobbying firm, as reported earlier this week by The New York Times. The popular Bayh purportedly also entered the race with $10 million to spend, but attack ads by outside conservative groups have in recent weeks essentially cut in half his double-digit lead over GOP Rep. Todd Young. \u201cDifferent states, same bad headlines,\u201d the Natioanl Republican Senatorial Committee, the DSCC\u2019s counterpart, said after several stories earlier this year on the race. Still, in Wisconsin, former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold is nearly 10 percentage points ahead in his bid to unseat GOP incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson. The RCP average now has Democrats winning a net total of four seats. Bayh isn\u2019t the only Democratic candidate getting hammered by ads from outside conservative groups, including several that have clearly stated their intentions of trying to save the Senate for Republicans instead of backing Trump. In Florida, Rubio and outside Republican groups have recently outspent the lesser-known Murphy and Washington Democrats more than 3-to-1 with ads blasting Murphy for embellishing his resume, calling him \"untrustworthy.\" Murphy said he's not worried, confident of overcoming the ad onslaught though he trails in polls and many Florida voters have barely heard of him. Republicans for Rubio are hitting Murphy for overstating claims on his resume to be a certified public accountant, small business owner and a college graduate with two degrees. Murphy was a licensed CPA in Colorado but not Florida, where he worked for an accounting firm. He was part-owner of a business established by his wealthy father, and though a double major at the University of Miami, he earned just one degree. Murphy has received help from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Senate Majority PAC, but those advertising buys have been dwarfed by outside Republican groups.

            "article_content": "This 2011 photo released by Proteste, a consumer defense group, shows a crash test on a Chevrolet Celta vehicle in Brazil. The Celta is Brazil's No. 5 car in terms of sales, with 137,615 sold in 2012. It received one star after its door unhinged and the passenger cabin roof bent into an inverted V shape during its crash test. (AP Photo/Proteste) (AP) The cars roll endlessly off the local assembly lines of the industry's biggest automakers, more than 10,000 a day, into the eager hands of Brazil's new middle class. The shiny new Fords, Fiats, and Chevrolets tell the tale of an economy in full bloom that now boasts the fourth largest auto market in the world. What happens once those vehicles hit the streets, however, is shaping up as a national tragedy, experts say, with thousands of Brazilians dying every year in auto accidents that in many cases shouldn't have proven fatal. The culprits are the cars themselves, produced with weaker welds, scant safety features and inferior materials compared to similar models manufactured for U.S. and European consumers, say experts and engineers inside the industry. Four of Brazil's five bestselling cars failed their independent crash tests. Unsafe cars, coupled with the South American nation's often dangerous driving conditions, have resulted in a Brazilian death rate from passenger car accidents that is nearly four times that of the United States, according to an Associated Press analysis of Brazilian Health Ministry data on deaths compared to the size of each country's car fleet. In fact, the two countries are moving in opposite directions on survival rates \u2014 the U.S. recorded 40 percent fewer fatalities from car wrecks in 2010 compared with a decade before. In Brazil, the number killed rose 72 percent, according to the latest available data. Dr. Dirceu Alves, of Abramet, a Brazilian association of doctors that specializes in treating traffic accident victims, said poorly built cars take an unnecessary toll. \"The gravity of the injuries arriving at the hospitals is just ugly,\" he said, \"injuries that should not be occurring.\" Automakers in Brazil point out that their cars meet the nation's safety laws. Some said they build even tougher cars for the country because of its poorly maintained roadways and rejected any notion that cost-cutting in production leads to fatalities. But the country's few safety activists perceive a deadly double standard, with automakers earning more money from selling cars that offer drivers fewer safeguards \u2014 a worrisome gap for new middle-class households, whose surging spending power has outpaced consumer protections taken for granted in more developed countries. The problem extends beyond Brazil, with economic forecasts showing the majority of global growth in auto sales taking place in emerging-market nations as the world's auto fleet doubles to 1.5 billion by 2020. \"Entry-level cars in Brazil are incredibly dangerous, it can't be denied. The death rate from accidents is far too high,\" said Maria Ines Dolci, coordinator of the Rio de Janeiro-based consumer defense group Proteste. \"The manufacturers do this because the cars are a little cheaper to make and the demands of the Brazilian consumers are less; their knowledge of safety issues is lower than in Europe or the U.S.\" Manufacturers earn a 10 percent profit on Brazilian-made cars, compared with 3 percent in the U.S. and a global average of 5 percent, according to IHS Automotive, an industry consulting firm. Only next year will laws require frontal air bags and antilock braking systems on all cars, safety features that have been standard in industrial countries for years. The country will also have new impact regulations on paper, at least; Brazilian regulators don't have their own crash-test facility to verify automakers' claims about vehicle performance, nor are there independent labs in the country. Experts say those requirements alone are not sufficient to meet basic safety standards. Some models sold in Brazil, like the Chinese-made JAC J3, scored only one star in a recent crash test despite having air bags and antilock brakes. An independent pilot effort known as the Latin New Car Assessment Program has run initial tests of Brazil's most popular car models, and the results are bleak. The cheapest models of four of the five top-selling cars, made by General Motors, Volkswagen and Fiat, received a one-star rating, out of five stars, while other top sellers also scored poorly. Such a rating means cars provide little protection in serious head-on wrecks, compared to four- or five-star rated cars, which are virtually the minimum that consumers in the U.S. and Europe buy. \"The difference is you're talking about somebody dead in the vehicle or dying very quickly, or somebody being able to get out of the vehicle themselves,\" said David Ward, director general of the London-based FIA Foundation for auto safety, which supports the Euro and Latin NCAP programs. \"It's definitely a difference between life and death.\" The squat Ford Ka hatchback sold in Europe scored four stars when it was tested by Euro NCAP in 2008; its Latin American version scored one star. Ford acknowledged that particular Ka is built on an outdated platform, and said it cannot be compared with the European version of the same name \u2014 it's that different. The company said it aims to have all its cars produced in Brazil built on updated, global platforms by 2015. The Mexico-produced Nissan March compact sold in Latin America received a two-star rating from Latin NCAP, while the version sold for about the same price in Europe, called the Micra, scored four stars. The crash tests found the Latin American model had a weak, unstable body structure that offered occupants little protection in even non-serious wrecks. In an emailed statement, Nissan said the March sold in Brazil is \"practically the same model\" offered in Europe. \"The difference in the results achieved in Europe and Latin America is due to variations in the NCAP tests applied in different parts of the world.\" Not so, said Alejandro Furas, technical director for the Global NCAP crash test programs. \"We perform the frontal crash test exactly in the same way as the Euro NCAP,\" he said. \"The March and Micra were tested in the same lab, with the same type of crash test dummies, under the same conditions with the same people running the laboratory.\" The Euro NCAP tests are more complete. They include side-impact and other tests, while the Latin American version only records front-impacts. Each type of impact test is individually scored on a 16-point scale. The March sold in Brazil obtained a 7.62 rating in its frontal-impact test. The Micra fared much better, 12.7 points. Italian automaker Fiat said in an emailed statement that \"in general, Brazilian projects receive more reinforcements\" within the cars' bodies to fortify them against the nation's \"harsher roads and terrain.\" However, NCAP tests found that Fiat's best-selling car in Brazil, called the Novo Uno, had an unstable body structure and scored it just one star. Crash-test footage shows the front of the car folding up like an accordion, giving it a 2.0 point rating, the second lowest of the 28 cars NCAP has examined. Consumers purchased nearly 256,000 Novo Uno's last year \u2014 the second-most popular car in the country. Renault's safety standards also vary. The French company builds its Sandero in Brazil, selling 98,400 cars last year. That car scored one star on the Latin NCAP test, but the model sold in Europe, made by Renault's Romanian subsidiary Dacia, scored three stars. Renault said the safety record of the Sandero and its other cars were on par with autos of the same class in Brazil. One of those is the VW Gol, Brazil's best-selling car for the last decade. Volkswagen said it strives to maintain a global standard for body strength, putting the same number of welds on the same models regardless of where they're produced, and using high-strength steel in Brazilian cars. It added that since 1998 it's given Brazilian consumers the option of buying a car with air bags \u2014 its Gol Trend model with two frontal air bags scored three stars, while the same model without air bags scored one star. The company didn't respond to requests for figures on how many consumers requested air bags. \"Structural integrity during a crash is a global standard for Volkswagen,\" the company said in an emailed statement. \"The passenger compartment for the Gol remained stable and thus guarantees survival space for occupants.\" Latin NCAP has tested three VW models. The Gol and the Polo had stable bodies. The Bora sedan, however, was rated as unstable, though other factors helped it score three stars. And then there are the cars the companies do not market outside Latin America, such as the Celta by GM. Celta is Brazil's No. 5 car in terms of sales, with 137,615 sold last year. It received one star after its door unhinged and the passenger cabin roof bent into an inverted V shape during its crash test. General Motors had no comment other than to say that its cars in Brazil are legal. An engineer for a major U.S. automaker, speaking only on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, said he has watched for years as his company failed to implement more advanced safety features in Brazil, simply because the law did not require them. \"''The automakers are pleased to make more profitable cars for countries where the demands, whatever they may be, are less rigorous,\" he said. \"It happens everywhere \u2014 India, China and Russia, for example.\" ___ About 40 million Brazilians moved into the middle class during the past decade with more income than ever to buy their first car. The growth potential is enormous: One out of every seven Brazilians owns a car, while the U.S. vehicle fleet covers nearly every American. But as auto sales boom in Brazil, so have the number of accidents and deaths. An analysis of Health Ministry data shows that 9,059 car occupants died in vehicle crashes in Brazil in 2010, according to the most recent statistics available. That same year, 12,435 people in the U.S. were killed in car crashes, though the U.S. passenger car fleet is five times larger than Brazil's. The result: Brazilian automobile crash victims died at four times the rate as those in the U.S. The dangers come down to basics, engineers said: the lack of body reinforcements, lower-quality steel in car bodies, weaker or fewer weld spots to hold the vehicles together and car platforms designed decades before modern safety advances. \"The electricity used in building a car is about 20 percent of the cost of the structure,\" said Marcilio Alves, an engineering professor at Brazil's premier University of Sao Paulo and one of the few independent researchers in the nation looking at car safety. \"If you save on electricity, you save on cost. One way to save electricity is either reducing the number of spot welds or using less energy for each spot weld made. This affects structural performance in the event of a crash.\" In a car with no air bags and an unstable body structure, a driver's biggest danger is the steering wheel. A weak body structure and fragile steering column make it easier for the wheel to slam into the driver's chest and abdomen in frontal crashes, the deadliest and most common, causing serious damage to vital organs. Ward talks of steering wheels that break off and \"float\" during wrecks in poorly made cars \u2014 moving around the cabin in the driver's area. That means that even if an air bag is deployed, the steering wheel may go around or under it and directly hit the driver. Many Brazilian car bodies also don't contain crumple zones, areas that absorb energy during wrecks. The omission endangers occupants' lower limbs, as foot wells rip off and expose feet and legs to car parts slamming into them from the front. \"If a car's body cannot absorb the energy of a crash, it will logically result in more damage, more injuries to passengers,\" said Alves, the doctor who specializes in traffic accident victims. One auto engineer described the situation by sketching two car body designs with identical perimeters, but one depicted internal gaps \u2014 missing body reinforcements. He worked three decades for Volkswagen and spent the last 10 years as an independent engineering consultant for big automakers. He asked that his name not be published for fear of losing contracts and benefits. \"The secret of a car's body being able to withstand the crash test are the weld spots,\" he said. \"Let's say this is a German car,\" he pointed to the gapless sketch. \"It's really sophisticated. Nothing is missing.\" Then he pointed at the car made in Brazil, full of incomplete ink strokes. \"The Brazilian version looks the same from the outside, but it's missing pieces,\" he said. \"In one version they include the reinforcement, in the other they don't. What's of interest is the final shape. What's inside, nobody can see.\" ___ In 2008, Carlos Alberto Lopes, then a 23-year-old waiter, was riding in a one-star car traveling about 50 mph on a rainy highway in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais when the road curved smoothly left. The car hydroplaned, skidded into an embankment and rolled several times down a long incline. Of the four occupants, Lopes was the only one with serious injuries, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Lopes says the three-point seatbelt he was wearing didn't lock his body in place, allowing him to repeatedly hit the collapsing roof as the car rolled. He suffered a crushed vertebra. \"If the seatbelt had locked when the car rolled I wouldn't have hit my back. None of this would have happened,\" Lopes said. A study by a chain of Brazilian rehabilitation centers where Lopes is being treated found that in 2011, 40 percent of the patients it worked with in Sao Paulo with serious spinal injuries were hurt in traffic accidents. Lopes never considered a lawsuit. In fact, in more than a dozen interviews with accident victims left paralyzed after crashes, not one considered taking legal action against vehicle manufacturers. That's in part a reflection of the lack of police investigations into car accidents, the majority of which, like Lopes', only result in simple \"occurrence bulletins\" that include minimal information. But it's also indicative of the deference Brazil's new middle class consumers show to automakers and most other industries. \"We're 20 years behind the U.S. and Europe in terms of consumer awareness,\" said Dolci, coordinator of the Proteste consumer defense group. \"The new, emerging middle class entering the market has little information on car safety. They think little of automobile security. It's this very class of consumer the automakers are targeting and to whom they're selling a mountain of cars.\" Accidents like Lopes' involve more than a poorly built car. Drivers fail to obey traffic laws, which many of the region's governments notoriously don't enforce. Cars must navigate crumbling roads and poorly designed highway systems that all but make gridlock and accidents unavoidable. And many drivers simply value perks such as alloy wheels and sound systems over unseen crumple zones. In 1965, there were 47,089 motor vehicle fatalities in the U.S. That same year, consumer activist Ralph Nader's famous indictment of the auto industry was published, Unsafe at Any Speed. The book ignited a national discussion on auto safety and ultimately led to reforms that dramatically refashioned the industry's standards, helping lead to a 32 percent drop in deaths by 2011. Nader said halting the growing number of auto deaths in Brazil would take \"a public uproar, product liability lawsuits, selective boycotts by motorists or by mandatory Brazilian law equalizing safety standards with the safest engineering required in other countries.\" \"These responses in the past have worked in other countries confronted by auto industry double standards for protecting lives on the highway. Such actions are long overdue but now Brazilians know the truth in more detail,\" he said. The Brazilian government says its new laws mandating frontal air bags and anti-lock brakes will dramatically improve safety, as will new impact standards. But because there are no independent crash-test centers in Brazil, companies will not face the same scrutiny as elsewhere. They will run the impact tests themselves and present the results to the government for approval. Because there is no \"conformity of production\" clause in the Brazilian legislation, cars won't be spot-checked to ensure they meet safety laws. Alexandre Cordeiro, the top government minister overseeing auto safety laws, acknowledged that the government doesn't have its own crash-test center \u2014 but said Brazil will monitor crash tests conducted outside the country. \"Regarding front- and rear-end crash tests, our cars are as secure as European or American cars,\" Cordeiro said. However, when asked about the stark differences in performance that the NCAP tests document between Brazilian and European cars, Cordeiro acknowledged improvements need to be made, saying \"we need to evolve and we're working on it.\" Over the years Ward said he has watched the same battles play out over auto safety \u2014 the only thing that changes is the location. \"The sad thing is, this has been the experience in the 1960s in the U.S., in the 1990s in Europe and now in Latin America,\" Ward said. \"The industry does the least it can get away with until they're forced to do something different. It's maddening.\"",

            "article_content": "WikiLeaks dropped its long-promised \u201cOctober surprise\u201d \u2013 a trove of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Is it the bombshell Trump\u2019s campaign hoped for? Our panel weighs in. Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta is firing back at Julian Assange as his WikiLeaks group releases hacked emails from Podesta and others close to Clinton -- including a new batch Saturday -- that have been an embarrassing distraction for the Clinton campaign. \u201cI bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy,\u201d Podesta tweeted Friday, while Assange starts his fifth year at the Ecuador Embassy in the United Kingdom, amid a 2005 rape allegation in Sweden. The tweet also included a picture of Podesta and celebrity chef Daniel Boulud recently preparing the dish at a private Clinton fundraiser. On Saturday, WikiLeaks release an 2015 email exchange from Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill and long-time Clinton aide Heather Samuelson about the State Department\u2019s apparent plans to place a favorable story with Associated Press reporters Matt Lee and Bradley Klapper about the release of emails from Clinton confidant Sydney Blumenthal as the missives are turned over to a Republican-led congressional committee. (Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.) 3. I bet the lobster risotto is better than the food at the Ecuadorian Embassy. pic.twitter.com/zyViu1R4UL Merrill also says in the exchange that he would like the story to run during the release of a Supreme Court decision because it will distract the \u201cnews hyenas.\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin on Saturday compared the Podesta email hack to the Watergate break in. \"Four decades later, we\u2019re witnessing another effort to steal private campaign documents in order to influence an election,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly this time, instead of filing cabinets, it\u2019s people\u2019s emails they\u2019re breaking into \u2026 and a foreign government is behind it.\" Earlier this month, WikiLeaks posted what it said were thousands of emails obtained in a hack of Podesta\u2019s personal email account. Among the documents posted online was an internal review of Clinton\u2019s private Wall Street speeches to survey the political damage her remarks could cause if they ever became public. In what aides calculated were the most damaging passages, Clinton reflected on the necessity of \"unsavory\" political dealing, telling real estate investors that \"you need both a public and private position.\" To investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Clinton admits that she's \"kind of far removed\" from the middle-class upbringing that she frequently touts on the campaign trail. Podesta suggested last weekend on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that his emails from the WikiLeaks posting were not authentic and argued they were acquired by \u201cRussians\u201d hacking into the Democratic Party computer files to try to influence the November election.

            "article_content": "In this May 27, 2015 photo, teacher Omar Currie reads a copy of a complaint a parent filed about him reading the book \"King & King to his third-graders in Efland, N.C. (Mark Schultz/The News & Observer via AP) RALEIGH, N.C. \u2013 After a third-grader tearfully recounted how another boy had called him \"gay\" during gym class, teacher Omar Currie chose to raise the issue during story time by reading his students a fable about a prince who falls in love with another prince, ending with a happily-ever-after royal wedding. That decision in April ignited a public outcry from some parents in the rural hamlet of Efland, North Carolina, resulting in Currie's resignation this week from a job he loved. The assistant principal who loaned Currie her copy of \"King & King\" has also resigned, and outraged parents are pressuring administrators at the Orange County Schools to ban the book. \"When I read the story, the reaction of parents didn't come into my mind,\" Currie, 25, said Tuesday. \"In that moment, it just seemed natural to me to read the book and have a conversation about treating people with respect. My focus then was on the child, and helping the child.\" Currie knows firsthand what it is like to be bullied. Growing up gay and black in a small town in the eastern part of the state, his memories of middle school are of being a frequent target for teasing and slurs. As a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Currie entered a teaching fellows program with the intent of helping young people. He was first introduced to \"King & King\" during an education course that included strategies for introducing topics involving diversity in the classroom. After graduation, Currie became a teacher at nearby Efland-Cheeks Elementary School. Though only about 15 miles west of Chapel Hill, a college town considered among the most liberal enclaves in the state, Efland is a socially conservative community of about 750 people where churches line the highway through town. Within hours after reading the book to his students, Currie said he got a call from the school's principal requesting a meeting in her office for the following morning. The parents of three children soon filed written complaints to a school review committee, which twice upheld the use of the book after heated public meetings. But the school's principal also issued a new directive that teachers must submit an advance list of all books they intend to read with students to their parents. \"King & King\" has been a subject of controversy before. In 2006, the parents of a Massachusetts second-grader sued after the book was read in their child's class. A federal judge later ruled against them, saying the rights of parents to exercise their religious and moral beliefs are not violated when children are exposed to differing ideas in public school. In his two years at Efland elementary, Currie said his sexual orientation had never been an issue. His co-workers, and some parents, knew he lives with his male partner. But at the committee meetings to discuss Currie's use of the book, some parents whose children were not in his class made their attacks personal, telling him he would die young and spend eternity in hell. He also began receiving hate-filled letters and emails, including one copied to other teachers at the school, described homosexuality as a \"birth defect\" while accusing Currie of trying to \"indoctrinate\" children through \"psycho-emotional rape.\" Though he says administrators never formally disciplined him for his decision to read the book, Currie said he was made to feel that he had done something wrong and felt pressured to leave the school. He is currently looking for another teaching job. A spokesman for the Orange County Schools said Tuesday that Interim Superintendent Pam Jones was not available for an interview. Meg Goodhand, the assistant principal who resigned after loaning Currie the book, also declined to comment. The decision to allow \"King & King\" in the classroom has now been appealed to the district level, and a public meeting to discuss the issue is set for Thursday. Currie plans to attend and says he will speak out. \"I'm resigning because when me and my partner sat down and talked about it we felt I wasn't going to have the support I needed to move forward at Efland,\" he said. \"It's very disappointing.\"",

            "article_content": "(Bugatti) April 15th. Tax day. No matter how much money you have, it is the one day that you don\u2019t feel like you have enough. Even when you get a refund it comes with the knowledge that those fat cats in Washington have been living it up off of the interest at your expense. So, the irony was abundant that day this year when I took my middle-class-at-best self to one of the most hoity-toity towns in the world, Greenwich, Connecticut, to drive the most hoity-toity car ever made, the multi-million dollar Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. This isn\u2019t just a Veyron we\u2019re talking about here - a car that has been with us now for over half a decade - the Super Sport is the ne plus ultra of Veyrons. The ultimate version of the ultimate supercar car ever made. It should\u2019ve been named the Omega. To refresh your memory: the Veyron sped on to the scene in 2005 powered by quad-turbocharged W16-cylinder engine fed by two fuel pumps that produced 1,001 hp. The Super Sport has 1,200 hp, courtesy of larger turbos providing higher boost pressure and four fuel pumps to keep up with it. That\u2019s the same amount of power found in two 200 mph Bentley Continental GT Speeds, or 10 Ford Fiestas, depending on which economic strata you are coming at this from. All-wheel-drive remains, as does the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The most visible changes are a front fascia with larger intakes to feed air into some of the 10 radiators that keep the mechanical parts of this beast cool and the replacement of the Veyron\u2019s signature aluminum roof scoops with flush, aircraft-style NACA ducts that reduce aerodynamic drag while helping the engine breathe. A nearly full cowling over the formerly exposed engine compartment completes the exercise in streamlining. The result? A top speed of 268 mph, which restores the title of World\u2019s Fastest Production Car to the Veyron nameplate. The original\u2019s maximum velocity of 253 mph was surpassed in 2007 by the little-known SSC Aero as it reached 256 mph on a closed public road in its hometown of West Richland, Washington. Record runs in the Veyron take place at a high-speed test track in Ehra-Lessien, Germany owned by Bugatti\u2019s parent company, Volkswagen. I was reminded of this fact when I buckled into the Super Sport in Greenwich, a town which may hold the world record for 25 mph speed limit signs per capita. Being handed the keys there is kind of like having a supermodel chat you up at an abstinence meeting. You can complain, but you probably won\u2019t. I\u2019d like to think that it was fitting, however, as many people who buy this car will never achieve the climax of its top speed, either. Rather, they will appreciate it as a priceless possession crafted from the carbon fiber peeking through its clearcoat lacquer\u2013 a last seconds of twilight dark blue in this case \u2013 that carries with it an air of supremacy unmatched since the invention of the automobile. The same feeling is inspired by the interior, where minimalist lines wrap two passengers in restrained elegance \u2013 as long as the owner has the good sense not to choose Carmine red over Tangerine as the color combination (try out the configurator to see what I mean.) Controls are simplified to the point that a navigation system isn\u2019t even available anymore. Bugatti\u2019s North American head of sales and marketing, John Hill, says that customers simply don\u2019t want it. I imagine they have a good idea where they are going when they take the Veyron out for a spin. Turn the key, press the console mounted start button and you\u2019re met with a sound that is literally like no other, because there has never been an engine like this before. Over-engineering never sounded so good. Tap the gear selector into Drive, however, and a funny thing happens: not much. Don\u2019t go out of your way to make it angry, and the Super Sport is as docile as a VW Golf. Unlike supercars of old that need to be tamed every second they are in motion, this one is more like a championship thoroughbred that\u2019s already been broken by your private trainer. But put the spurs to it, and prepare to clench your buttocks. Find a straight stretch of road to mash the accelerator on and you initiate a war between the drivetrain and the $30,000 set of custom Michelin tires with armistice terms negotiated by an traction control system that makes the Treaty of Versaille look like a bro hug. Each full-throttle shift sends a shockwave through the Veyron that\u2019s punctuated by a pop from the quartet of turbos letting off steam and a split second of blurred vision. This isn't just the world's fastest production car, it's also the quickest. Fight the urge to keep your right foot planted and you\u2019ll nevertheless find that you are going faster than is advisable, and much faster than you thought that you were. Relative to its top speed, a Super Sport traveling at 100 mph might as well be parked. It\u2019s the same through turns, where double-digit mph have little or no effect on the reworked suspension. New springs, dampers and stabilizer bars are aimed at increasing the Super Sport\u2019s handling capabilities, but also manage to soak up bumps better than the previous model. Something I\u2019m lucky enough to know, first hand. Fox Car Report is on Twitter. Follow us @foxcarreport Fuel economy? I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear that. Let\u2019s just put it this way: at top speed the 26 gallon gas tank will empty in about 12 minutes, but the tires will likely self-destruct in half that time, so, as a reminder that even billionaires are subjects of the nanny state, all but five special edition Super Sports come with a 258 mph limiter. That\u2019s faster than any other car, but just short of the golden ring. (Don\u2019t worry, I know a guy that can take care of that for you.) Bugatti has limited total production of the Veyron to just 300 units, the last 30 of which were set to be Super Sports sold at a price of around $2.8 million, but I\u2019m told the run will likely be extended to the final 40 cars. Unknown to my clueless self, the deadline to file taxes was also extended this year to April 18th. Doesn\u2019t really matter, I still can\u2019t afford either of them.

            "article_content": "Ambassador cars, both taxis, in yellow and one private, are parked near a workshop for repairs in Kolkata, india, Monday, May 26, 2014. India's oldest car factory has abruptly suspended production of the hulking Ambassador sedan that has a nearly seven-decade history as the car of the Indian elite. (AP Photo/ Bikas Das) It's been in production longer than any car on sale today, but the Hindustan Ambassador may have finally reached the end of the road. India's oldest car factory has abruptly suspended production of the hulking Ambassador sedan that has a nearly seven-decade history as the car of the Indian elite. It was unclear how long manufacturing will be on hold, but Kolkata-based\u00a0Hindustan\u00a0Motors said Monday it hopes to resume making the so-called \"Amby\" after a period of restructuring and clearing of its debts. Slideshow: Cars that won't die The heavy car's large size and poor gas mileage have driven customers to cheaper competitors from abroad. About 80 percent of cars sold in India today are small cars that can maneuver in crowded cities and that cater to a rising middle class eager for wheels without costs. The company began making the Ambassador in 1948, modeling it after the British Morris Oxford III. Last year only 2,214 of the vehicles were sold, reflecting a steep decline from production levels in the 1980s around 24,000 vehicles a year. Also known as the grand old lady of India's pot-holed and pitted roads, the Ambassador has remained largely unchanged for more than five decades in ferrying the elite including prime ministers and high-society celebrities. It recalls an era when India's policy of economic self-sufficiency meant domestically produced cars were the norm. Its bulbous chassis and bouncy back seats delight tourists and other passengers nostalgic for earlier times, while many in rural India still view white Ambassadors as the de-facto vehicle of officialdom. Though most Ambassador sales go to taxi services and government departments, \"there has been a reduction in demand for the Ambassador,\" the company said. \"Sturdiness is its hallmark,\" the company said. \"The robust build, it was always seen as a positive point for customers who wanted durability and safety.\" Hindustan\u00a0Motors, which as of September had accumulated losses greater than its assets, said the company's Uttarpara plant, just outside Kolkata in the eastern state of West Bengal, was suffering from problems including very low productivity, growing indiscipline, a critical shortage of funds and lack of demand for the Ambassador. It announced the indefinite production suspension, including a halt in the payment of salaries to nearly 2,500 employees, in a notice pasted on the factory gates Saturday night. Hindustan\u00a0Motors said it plans to reopen the Uttarpara factory after settling debts and restructuring. The plant also makes a 1-ton mini-truck called the Winner as well as car parts. \"If they want to maintain the vehicle, if they want the brand to survive, they will have to think through some changes in pricing, fuel efficiency,\" said auto analyst Abdul Majeed at PriceWaterhouseCoopers in India. \"The middle class, those folks don't worry about comfort and luxury at this point in time. They are only looking at necessity.\" Hindustan\u00a0Motors has been unsuccessful in a long search for new investors. Earlier this year it transferred another car plant based in the south-coast city of Chennai to its financial arm,\u00a0Hindustan\u00a0Motor Finance Corporation Ltd. That plant produces Mitsubishi and Isuzu brand vehicles for the Japanese companies. Shares of\u00a0Hindustan\u00a0Motors sank 10 percent Monday. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gestures as she appears on stage with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Not since George and Martha in the play \u201cWhose Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d or for older readers Don Ameche and Frances Langford in the radio comedy \u201cThe Bickersons,\u201d have we seen the kind of verbal pugilism practiced in Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. If the business of Trump\u2019s lewd language about women caught on tape 11 years ago and Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual history with Hillary enabling him in the trashing of his conquests could be set aside, only the issues would remain, and wouldn\u2019t that be good? Sunday night, Clinton recycled the familiar Democrat playbook that the wealthy aren\u2019t paying their \u201cfair share\u201d in taxes, when the real issue is that government already receives record amounts in tax money, but misspends much of it and never seems to have enough. Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) has closely followed Clinton\u2019s shifting tax positions. In the debate, Clinton said she \u201conly\u201d wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, not the middle class. ATR notes she has said just the opposite on many occasions. It calculates that if all of her tax proposals are enacted, it would cost taxpayers $1 trillion over 10 years and gives the following examples: She has said she would not veto a payroll tax hike on all Americans should such a bill reach her desk and would set aside her pledge not to boost taxes on middle-income earners. She wants a tax on sodas that ATR estimates would add $2.16 per 12-pack. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) charged this would violate her pledge to protect the middle class from tax hikes: \u201cFrankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal violates her pledge.\u201d Other tax increases include a national gun tax of 25 percent, a 65 percent \u201cdeath tax,\u201d which ATR notes she wouldn\u2019t have to pay because of the way she has arranged her finances. She wants to raise the current capital gains tax from 23.8 percent to 43.4 percent, which would harm investments and stifle capital creation. She would not lower the corporate tax rate, which Trump has pledged to do, even though the U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, which has driven many businesses overseas. And, like President Obama, she is an enemy of the coal industry, despite her claims to be friendly toward it in Sunday\u2019s debate. Her campaign chief, John Podesta, has left the door open to a carbon tax, saying if Congress passes such a measure \u201cwe\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d Trump purports to favor school choice, which is an essential tool for escaping poverty and would do more than any federal anti-poverty program to help poor children obtain a good education. Hillary Clinton claims to favor school choice, but only as far as publicly funded charter schools. Since she and many Democrats receive political contributions from teachers unions, it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll let poor children escape failing schools. In the latest debate she tried to claim credit for all she has done for children, but what she has not done by refusing to support school vouchers, which allow parents to use public funds to pay for some or all of their child\u2019s private school tuition, overcomes whatever good she may have accomplished. Rumors are swirling about opposition researchers offering to pay employees of Trump\u2019s NBC program \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for recordings of other lewd things he might have said to further distract from the issues. The hypocrisy meter is in hyper drive when you consider that some of the same Democrats condemning Trump said of Bill Clinton\u2019s numerous affairs \u201cit\u2019s just about sex\u201d and had nothing to do with his performance as president. These are people who still hold John F. Kennedy in high regard, despite his long list of women with whom he had sex, including secreting some into the White House. This won\u2019t be the end of the revelations about Trump, anything to divert attention from Hillary\u2019s real positions on the real issues that matter most to Americans. If we must have bickering, how about bickering over something important?",

The imaginings included Israel blessing a nuclear deal with Iran and the eventual establishment of a full Palestinian state. Netanyahu\u2019s defeat was considered a done deal and counted as a double blessing because not only would his defeat put the liberal party in control in Israel, but also be an embarrassment for the Likud-loving Republicans at home who had just hosted the prime minister for a joint meeting of Congress. But today, a hard reality has fallen as Netanyahu not only won re-election, but did so handily. He faces a newly unified opposition and the rising clout of Arab groups, but Bibi is back and he\u2019s been vindicated. And as they consider the comeback, American liberals would do well to consider the part President Obama played. While the question of U.S. taxpayer funds going to defeat Netanyahu and Likud remains in question, it is no secret that Obama has disdain for Netanyahu and was working publicly to undermine his position ahead of the election. And it turned out to be very helpful\u2026 for Netanyahu. Obama is not popular in Israel and foreign interference in elections is even less popular. Obama\u2019s overt and covert actions to damage Netanyahu and install the liberal party gave Netanyahu and his party the perfect opportunity to warn of foreign meddling and tell his base voters to rally in order to defy Obama. As polls showed Netanyahu trailing, he moved right and fired up his base by agreeing with more hawkish factions to drop the pursuit of a \u201ctwo-state solution.\u201d So for Obama\u2019s effort to undercut Netanyahu, Obama got Netanyahu not only returned to power, but with a rightward shift.Rubio \u2018absolutely\u2019 willing to undo Iran nuke deal - AP: \u201cEying the Republican presidential nomination, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Tuesday he would \u2018absolutely\u2019 defy stalwart European allies if necessary to revoke any Iranian nuclear deal he might inherit from President Barack Obama. In an interview with The Associated Press, Rubio said the next U.S. president \u2018should not be bound\u2019 by a potential Obama administration agreement, even if European negotiating partners stand behind the deal. \u2018The United States, although it's less than ideal, could unilaterally re-impose more crushing and additional sanctions,\u2019 Rubio said. He said he would also \u2018use the standing of the United States on the global stage to try to encourage other nations to do so.\u2019\u2026Rubio said the only possible deal he could accept is one that would fully disband Iran's enrichment capacity. The agreement taking shape would limit Iran's uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity for at least a decade, but slowly lift the restrictions over several years.\u201dBOEHNER: HAND OVER THE SERVER, HILLARYHouse Speaker John Boehner added his voice to a chorus of Republicans pressing Hillary Clinton to turn over her private email server to an independent arbiter, saying the \u201cAmerican people deserve the facts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the fairest way to make sure that we have all the documents that belong to the public,\u201d Boehner told reporters in his first public remarks since Clinton revealed that as secretary of state she kept her emails on a separate \u201chome\u201d server.

It is home to an astonishing private collection that includes amazing pieces from the Northern Renaissance and impressionists. But the museum is more famous for being the scene of an audacious art heist in 1990 that was worthy of \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair\u201d and remains unsolved to this day. Why would someone steal paintings so famous they couldn\u2019t ever be displayed after the theft? Boston Globe reporter Stephen Kurkjian has spent decades on the question and has just produced a new book on the subject. The reporter believes that the story of the robbery is more akin to \u201cThe Departed,\u201d and was the work of Boston\u2019s Irish gangsters ignorant of the art world. Kurkjian spoke with NPR about his theory of the case and his interview with the self-described \u201chippie\u201d night watchman who was more worried about missing a Grateful Dead show than protecting the collection. Was it goons who didn\u2019t know what they were stealing or were they paid by a mystery figure to pull off the job? The investigation remains open. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

To win, Jeb needs the backing of evangelical Christians to prevent social and economic conservatives from teaming up to block the establishment favorite\u2019s path to the Republican nomination. While both brothers are devout, George is an evangelical Protestant while Jeb is an adult convert to an orthodox form of Roman Catholicism. But the Protestant base of the GOP is warming to Catholics and Catholics are warming to the GOP, so the chances that America\u2019s second Catholic president will be a Republican grow stronger all the time.

Veteran Republican strategist Liz Mair told The Associated Press that she was leaving Walker's team just a day after she had been tapped to lead his online communication efforts, citing the distraction created by a series of recent Twitter posts about Iowa\u2019s presidential caucuses. \u2018The tone of some of my tweets concerning Iowa was at odds with that which Gov. Walker has always encouraged in political discourse,\u2019 Mair said in a statement announcing her immediate resignation. \u2018I wish Gov.

Aaron Schock is vacating is to be held no later than July, according to state law. Schock\u2019s resignation is effective March 31. Within five days after that, Gov. Bruce Rauner is to set a date for the special election, according to Steve Sandvoss, executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections. The election is to be held within 115 days of the date Rauner\u2019s office issues its notice to the clerks of the 19 counties in the 18th District, Sandvoss said. That notice is to include a date for a primary election. Nothing in state law mandates a date for the primary, nor does the election have to be on a Tuesday, Sandvoss said.\u201dSchock-waves of interest - Champaign-Urbana (Ill.) News-Gazette: \u201cState Sen. Jason Barickman, R-Bloomington, said he is interested in succeeding U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Peoria, who abruptly resigned Tuesday from his 18th Congressional District seat. State Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, also said this afternoon that he\u2019s \u2018looking at\u2019 the seat. And a spokesman for state Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington, said the former Republican gubernatorial candidate also is considering running for the west central Illinois congressional seat. Also mentioned as potential Republican candidates in the overwhelmingly Republican district are state Sen. Darin LaHood of Dunlap and former state Rep. Jil Tracy of Quincy.\u201dPOLITICS AT PLAY IN SENATE BUDGET PLANBloomberg: \u201cSenate Republicans will unveil their version of a U.S. government spending plan Wednesday that will diverge from their House counterparts\u2019 proposal. The House put forth a plan Tuesday that would curtail government spending and balance the budget in nine years by partially privatizing Medicare and by making deep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. The proposal would cut $5.5 trillion in spending over that period. The Senate will avoid the House\u2019s plan on Medicare, according to a Senate aide familiar with the plan. With the federal deficit easing and entitlement cuts unpopular with voters, Republicans worry that such an approach would damage them politically in 2016. In the Senate, where 24 of the 54 Republican seats are up for re-election, party leaders want to spare members from casting difficult votes on proposals that have no chance of becoming law while President Barack Obama is in office.\u201d [President Obama is expected to renew his criticism of the Republican budget plan in an appearance in Cleveland today]DEMOCRATS BLOCK HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILLWashEx: \u201cSenate Democrats blocked a once-bipartisan human trafficking bill over abortion language they said they failed to notice when they sponsored the legislation. The vote was 55-43, falling seven votes shy of the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. The vote creates uncertainty not only for the legislation but for the Senate calendar. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said a planned vote this week on the confirmation of Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch is now uncertain because of the gridlock on the human trafficking bill. The bill would provide $30 million in restitution fees to help victims of human trafficking. Republicans included language preventing the money from being used for abortions. Democrats who both co-sponsored the bill and cleared it unanimously in committee on March 2 now want that language removed.\u201dREID\u2019S TOP AIDE TOLD WHITE HOUSE TO \u2018BACK OFF\u2019 ON INTERNET REGSNational Journal: \u201cThe top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid was quietly lobbying the White House last year against tough net-neutrality rules, according to internal documents released Tuesday.\u00a0The emails, made public by the House Oversight Committee, contradict the ultimate position publicly taken by President Obama-and Reid himself.\u00a0 In an email to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on May 15, 2014, David Krone, Reid's chief of staff at the time, wrote that he \u2018spoke with the WH [White House] again last night and told them to back off Title II [of the Communications Act].\u2019 The section of the 1934 law would give the FCC broad powers and allow it to treat Internet providers more like heavily-regulated phone companies. \u2018Went through once again the problems it creates for us,\u2019 Krone wrote.\u00a0 Wheeler also initially favored a more-lenient approach.\u201dDIRTY WORD YARD BIRDWTOP: \u201cTo passersby who don\u2019t speak Spanish, signs for a new restaurant called \u2018Chingon Pollo\u2019 on N. Glebe Road in [Arlington, Va.] wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow. Anyone who speaks the language, however, sees a name that could be construed, at best, as cheeky and, at worst, as profane. \u201cChingon\u201d is a Spanish slang term that is often used as a compliment, but it\u2019s a conjugation of the verb \u201cchingar,\u201d which in Mexico roughly translates to the English profanity that begins with \u201cF.\u201d ARLnow.com asked a Spanish speaker how she would interpret the name \u2018Chingon Pollo.\u2019 \u2018Chingar is to f-ck and -on means real big \u2018ol, so literally \u2018real big ol f-cker\u2019 but figuratively like \u2018big f-cking\u2019 something,\u2019 she said, declining to be identified. \u2026 \u2018That is crazy, I can\u2019t believe they can name it that,\u2019 she added.

            "article_content": "2015 Ram 1500 Rebel (Ram) The full-size SUV segment is steadily shrinking, but body-on-frame behemoths aren't dead yet. Fiat-Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne has announced that the next generation of the Ram pickup truck could spawn a full-size family hauler aimed squarely at the Chevrolet Suburban, the GMC Yukon XL, and the Ford Expedition EL. Machionne warns that the yet-unnamed SUV isn't even at the embryonic stage of development; at this point, it's little more than a vague idea that periodically gets discussed during meetings. However, the executive explains that Ram has enough room on its production lines to add more models to its lineup, and the next 1500 will be capable of spawning additional variants and body styles because it will feature a much more modular design. Sister company Jeep is also developing its own full-size SUV, but Marchionne isn't worried about the two models overlapping. If approved for production, Ram's SUV will be aimed largely at middle class buyers with a big family or a lot of gear to haul. Jeep's three-row truck is being designed as a more upscale offering that will carry a much higher base price. \"I don't think anybody who buys a large SUV is confusing it with a Range Rover,\" pointed out Marchionne during a conference call. If everything goes according to plan, adding a large SUV to the Ram lineup will help parent company Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) post higher profit margins. The segment is relatively small, but large SUVs are highly lucrative models because they are relatively affordable to design and build. Ram has plenty of time to decide on whether launching a large SUV is the right move. The 1500 pickup isn't scheduled to be replaced until 2019 at the very earliest, meaning it will land in showrooms as a 2020 model. With that time frame in mind, the SUV might not arrive until the 2021 model year.",

            "article_content": "The 2015 Chevrolet SS is a unique car that Gary Gastelu says could soon be extinct. We\u2019ve been here before. The end of the road, that is. Along with the bathwater that was Pontiac, General Motors threw out one of the most exciting vehicles it ever made: the G8 GXP. Not only did the full-size, four-door muscle car come with a 415 hp 6.2-liter V8, but also a six-speed manual transmission. It was a family-friendly, tire-blistering bliss, but in the heyday of expensive gas and hybrid cars that was 2009, also a dinosaur that should\u2019ve went extinct. But it didn\u2019t. We all know the story. Oil prices dropped, people started buying trucks again, and a horsepower war began that probably hasn\u2019t yet culminated with the 707 hp Dodge Hellcat V8. Miraculously, the G8 GXP is back, too. Only this time it\u2019s called the Chevrolet SS. GM had been keeping it warm for us all these years in Australia, where it\u2019s built and sold under the Holden brand as the Commodore. It returned to the USA last year with a substantial cosmetic makeover, but basically the same underpinnings as the G8 GXP, and was as great as ever. That is, except for one thing. It didn\u2019t have a manual. But now it does. For 2015 the SS is available with a stick, completing the G8 GXP\u2019s resurrection. And it gets better. GM\u2019s Magnetic Ride Control active and adjustable suspension is now standard on the SS, regardless if you choose the automatic or DIY transmission. It also comes with a head-up display, navigation, collision alerts, lane-departure and blind spot warning systems, and some killer sport seats. The starting price is $46,740 for the no-cost-option manual, which still manages to be $1,300 cheaper than the automatic because it ducks the gas guzzler tax. Just. While both versions have the same, very old-school 17 mpg combined fuel economy rating, the manual does one better in the city category at 15 mpg. That\u2019s on paper. In the real world, having a clutch offers more opportunities to rev the engine and burn some guzzoline just for the fun of it. Despite its ancient lineage, the SS still one heck of a ride. The engine, shared with the current Camaro SS is a thriller that hits all the right, deep, burbling NASCAR notes. The rest of it is unbelievably light on its feet for something in the leviathan class. Incredibly, the SS weighs about the same as the Camaro, and is better than the coupe anywhere off a track. Arguably on one, too. Those shocks give it a great ride and handling in Tour mode; a firm and jarring ride, but even better handling in Performance mode; and Sport splits the difference. In any setting, they are worth their weight in the iron particles suspended in fluid that allow them to constantly fine-tune their stiffness. But that magic wand is the main attraction. The SS is the only sedan from an American brand that you can buy with a V8 and a manual transmission. In fact, the only others on sale in the USA are the BMW M5 and M6, and they cost twice as much. Look, I\u2019m not anti-automatic by any means. Sticks are terrible in traffic, and it\u2019s hard to eat a Double-Double behind the wheel when you need your right hand to make the car go. I get it, and don\u2019t hold it against anyone who goes that route. But the manual enhances the character of the SS in such a way that I just can\u2019t imagine buying one without it. Yea, the clutch needs a firm press like the Camaro\u2019s, and the gas and brake pedal are too far apart to easily blip the throttle on downshifts, but these are trifles that can be mitigated by wearing boots. 2016 Chevrolet SS It\u2019s not much of an attention-getter, but it looks muscular in person, and a fair amount of chrome jewelry adds a little dazzle. For 2016, new hood vents and an updated front end promise to dial the visual impact up another notch, but it still won\u2019t turn your average head. No, the SS is not for everyone, and Chevy knows that all too well. It only imports a couple of thousand a year from Down Under for its very specific target audience, and this tight supply leads many dealers mark them up accordingly. Good luck finding one for the price mentioned above. However, consider it an investment if you do. The SS is could be the closest thing you can get to a treasury bond on four wheels. Even six years later, and with the brand new and superior SS on sale, used G8 GXP manuals often list for at or near their original price on the rare occasions that they surface online. That\u2019s unheard of for practically any car not sporting a Prancing Horse. Granted, they didn\u2019t make that many, but the SS is destined to be a limited edition, as well. Holden is scheduled to stop producing cars in Australia in 2017, and the SS will die with the factory that makes it. Plans are already afoot to replace it there with a V6-powered front-wheel-drive sedan. Unless Chevy decides to reboot one of its rear-wheel-drive Cadillac platforms as a new SS, the end of the road is, sadly, nigh. Then again, we\u2019ve been there before. ---------- 2015 Chevrolet SS Base price: $46,740 Type: 5-passenger, 4-door sedan Engine: 6.2-liter V8 Power: 415 hp, 415 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed manual MPG: 15 city/21 hwy",

            "article_content": "Remark about Clinton drew flak Was Donald Trump inciting violence against Hillary Clinton when he spoke last Friday about disarming her bodyguards?\u00a0 Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, says so. The media was hysterical.\u00a0 According to Martha Raddatz, host of ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d: \u201cThe message sounds a lot like a threat or encouraging violence.\u201d\u00a0 On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Chuck Todd claimed: \u201cTrump again raised the specter of violence against Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u00a0 Over the weekend, news show after news show made similar claims. So what was Donald Trump\u2019s supposedly threatening statement? \"She's [Clinton's] very much against the 2nd Amendment... I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm, right?... Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Take their \u2014 and let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away. OK? It would be very dangerous.\u201d Trump\u2019s point is simple: It's the height of hypocrisy for elites to employ armed guards (or live in super-safe neighborhoods / gated communities / doorman buildings) and then demand the disarmament of law-abiding people living in much more dangerous areas. Trump\u2019s comment was obviously rhetorical.\u00a0 He was not actually advocating that her bodyguards be disarmed.\u00a0 He was pointing out that doing so would be absurd and \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d By making Americans consider Clinton\u2019s need for security, he is making the point that Americans should by extension have a right to their own (personal) armed security. Clinton, who would never want to give up her bodyguards, obviously understands that guns make her safer.\u00a0 Wealthy gun control advocates such as Michael Bloomberg also want guns for their own protection.\u00a0 Bloomberg even provides armed bodyguards for the executives at Everytown for Guns Safety and Mom\u2019s Demand Action, two of his organizations. Even Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the strongest gun control advocates on the Supreme Court, relies on guns for protection. In 2012, after being robbed in Washington, DC for the second time in three months, he demanded that armed police protection be provided for him at taxpayer expense.\u00a0 Yet, he has argued that there is not an individual right to self-defense, let alone a right to use a gun for defense. Trump\u2019s point is simple: It's the height of hypocrisy for elites to employ armed guards (or live in super-safe neighborhoods / gated communities / doorman buildings) and then demand the disarmament of law-abiding people living in much more dangerous areas. It is about time that someone stood up for the everyday citizens who fear for themselves and their families. Unlike armed guards, the police simply can\u2019t be relied on for protection. Gun control advocates such as Clinton claim that they care for poor minorities. But it is poor minorities who are particularly disarmed by the gun control regulations that Clinton pushes. Clinton keeps pushing for background checks on private transfers of guns.\u00a0 She never mentions that virtually all of the 2.4 million \u201cinitial denials\u201d have been mistakes \u2014 cases of law-abiding citizens having similar names to prohibited individuals.\u00a0 Nor does she mention that blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by these mistakes. Instead of fixing this broken system, the Obama administration has instead pulled everyone off of checking for mistakes.\u00a0 It is difficult to appeal denials without the help of a lawyer, and few poor minorities can afford to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. Gun buyers and sellers are also stuck with all of the fees for background checks. In New York City and D.C., the fee for privately transferring a gun is at least $125.\u00a0 In Washington state and Oregon, the costs of transferring a gun are about $60 and $55, respectively. Bloomberg and Clinton will still have world-class security, but these costs may make the difference for a poor black who wants to defend his family. Trump is also right that Clinton is opposed to the Second Amendment.\u00a0 Hillary Clinton has vowed to appoint Supreme Court Justices who would overturn the Heller and MacDonald decisions. This clearly means that government would again have the power to ban guns. Until 2008, a handgun ban was in effect in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 It was also a felony to put a bullet in the chamber of a gun.\u00a0 In effect, these laws constituted a complete ban on guns. The Supreme Court struck down these laws in\u00a0District of Columbia v. Heller. In June, Clinton told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos: \u201cI think that for most of our history, there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment until the decision by the late Justice Scalia and there was no argument until then that localities and states and the federal government had a right, as we do with every amendment, to impose reasonable regulation.\u201d Hillary Clinton keeps pushing regulations that will primarily disarm the most vulnerable people in our society -- poor minorities who live in high crime areas.\u00a0 Even the media must understand the obvious: self-protection isn\u2019t just for the rich and powerful.",

            "article_content": "U.S. employers added a healthy 255,000 jobs in July, a sign of confidence amid sluggish economic growth that points to a resilient economy. At the same time,\u00a0 the unemployment rate remained a low 4.9 percent, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly jobs report. More Americans launched job searches, and nearly all were hired. But the influx of job seekers meant that the number of unemployed fell only slightly. The figures suggest that U.S. employers shook off concerns about Britain's late-June vote to quit the European Union. Nor were they apparently discouraged by the economy's tepid growth in the first half of the year: Just 1 percent at an annual rate. The solid hiring could fuel a rebound by the economy in the second half of this year, with more paychecks and higher pay fueling more spending and growth. Stock index futures rose after the jobs report was released, a signal that investors may feel more encouraged by prospects for corporate earnings. \"Even as economic growth has been lackluster, the job market has remained sparkling bright,\" said James Marple, a senior economist at TD Bank. Average hourly pay picked up in July and is 2.6 percent higher than it was a year ago, matching the fastest pace since the recession. With the unemployment rate low, that suggests that employers are being forced to compete with one another for new hires by offering higher pay. Solid hiring occurred last month across a range of industries, including middle- and high-wage jobs, one factor that likely boosted average pay. Professional and business services, which includes architects, engineers and managers, added 70,000 jobs, the most since October. Financial services added 18,000 and construction 14,000. Government positions rose 38,000, the most in more than a year. Health care, which includes jobs at all pay levels, gained nearly 49,000 new jobs. Hotels and restaurants added 27,000. July's robust job gain may be enough to reassure investors -- and perhaps Federal Reserve policymakers -- that the economy will pick up. Its growth has been weak since last fall. The economy has been driven by consumers, who ramped up spending in the April-June quarter at the second-fastest pace since the recession. Many analysts expect the economy to rebound in the second half of the year, with one of the most optimistic estimates coming from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta: It predicts that annualized growth will reach 3.7 percent in the current July-September quarter. Public perceptions of the economy have been largely negative during this election season despite low unemployment. A top adviser to Donald Trump said last week that the annual economic growth rate of just 1.2 percent in the April-June quarter was \"catastrophic.\" Hillary Clinton has tended to credit the Obama administration for rescuing the economy from the Great Recession but has also said \"none of us can be satisfied with the status quo.\" Other recent economic data have been mixed. Americans are confident enough to step up home purchases, aided by near-record-low mortgage rates. Sales of existing homes reached a nine-year high in June, and sales of new homes accelerated to an eight-year high. Services companies, which range from retailers to banks to shipping firms, expanded at a healthy pace in July, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. Their expansion slowed a bit from the previous month. But new orders picked up, a sign that growth could remain healthy. But manufacturing continues to struggle and is weighing on hiring. Factories received fewer orders in June for a third straight month. Weak growth overseas and a stronger dollar have cut into many companies' overseas businesses. And auto sales have leveled off, according to data released this week. The slowdown in manufacturing has cost jobs: Factory employment has fallen about 30,000 in the past year, depriving the economy of key middle-income positions. Job growth has been stronger in higher-income occupations, such as managers, engineers and accountants. Lower-wage jobs at hotels, restaurants and retail stores have also grown at a healthy pace. Both trends add to a long-running dynamic that has caused hiring for middle-income jobs to lag behind hiring for high- and low-paying positions.",

(Credit: Royster Middle School) A Kansas public school has removed a picture of Jesus that hung in a hallway for decades after a complaint from a national church-state separation group, The Wichita Eagle reported. Royster Middle School removed the print of Warner Sallman\u2019s \u201cHead of Christ\u201d last Thursday, following a complaint from the national Freedom From Religion Foundation, Richard Profitt, the school superintendent, said Friday. Proffitt, who is in his first year as Chanute superintendent, said the picture was taken down after the district\u2019s lawyer advised that the school could not legally display it. \u201cOh man, it\u2019s getting bad.\u201d \u201cOh man, it\u2019s getting bad,\u201d said Erika Semey, who attended Royster 10 years ago. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with this world.

It is the second time that Jayne has worked with Proffitt to resolve an issue of religion at a school. According to the Eagle, the foundation filed a complaint last year with another Kansas district \u2013 where Proffitt was then-superintendent \u2013 after a teacher allowed a member of Gideons International to speak in his class and hand out Bibles to students. Proffitt put a stop to the Bible distribution. Proffitt, who expects to take some heat over removal of the Jesus picture, told the paper he thinks the Freedom From Religion Foundation was alerted to the picture after a recent school visitor took a snapshot of it and sent it to the foundation, which then made its complaint.",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this Monday, April 4, 2016 file photo, people flee their homes during clashes between Iraqi security forces and Islamic State group in Hit, 85 miles (140 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Iraq. Families, many with small children and elderly relatives say they walked for hours Monday through desert littered with roadside bombs to escape airstrikes and clashes. (AP Photo/Khalid Mohammed, File) (The Associated Press) One in six childhood injuries in Iraq were caused by violence, compared with only one in 50 childhood injuries worldwide, according to a recent study. Iraqi children injured by violence, including by gunshots, shrapnel and explosives, were also more than 10 times more likely than those hurt by other means to be killed or disabled, the authors found. Very little research has looked at injuries among children in conflict zones, including in the aftermath of the 2003 coalition invasion of Iraq, the researchers write in the journal Surgery. While aid groups tend to focus on explosives and other violent causes of injury, they should also provide rebuilding efforts like fixing roads and providing education about potential sources of accidental injury, said senior author Dr. Adam Kushner of The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. In times of conflict, there also may be less adult supervision due to parents having been killed or disabled by war, Kushner added by email. The study team conducted a community-based survey in Baghdad in 2014, asking about injuries among children under 18 years old as well as any healthcare they sought out or received between 2003 and 2014. Among 900 households containing 5,148 people, participants reported 152 childhood injuries, making up 28 percent of all the described injuries. The average age of injured children was 8 years and three of four victims were boys. Most injuries took place in the home. The most common cause of injury was falling down, which made up 34 percent of all injuries. The second most common was road traffic crashes, which made up 22 percent of injuries. Of all children injured, 15 percent of incidents were directly caused by the conflict, including wounds from gunshots, shrapnel and explosives. The researchers note that worldwide, only 2 percent of child injuries are caused by violence. One in four injured children were hospitalized and more than half had some type of surgery, including stitches. Two thirds of injured children became disabled and 10 children died from their injuries. Five of the children who died had injuries resulting directly from the conflict. The others were hurt by traffic accidents, poisoning or electrical accident. Of the direct conflict-related deaths, one was a 2-year-old girl who died after an explosion; two others were a 6-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl who were shot; and another was a 13-year-old boy who was injured by a shell explosion, the study team notes. The 7 percent rate of death among injured Iraqi children was much higher than in other low-to-middle-income countries without a conflict going on, the authors add. For example, they cite rates of pediatric death following injury of 0.1 percent in South Africa, 0.3 percent in Turkey, 2.3 percent in Iran and 5.5 percent in Ghana. Dr. Patrick Shanovich, associate director of the emergency department at California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, highlighted the issues families might face in getting treatment if their children get hurt. For example, if a child was hurt by an explosive or even a car crash, the family might need to have a phone to call for help, for roads to be open and safe to drive to a clinic, and for the clinic to be open and have the proper staff and supplies. All of these factors can be compromised during violent conflict, and governments and other groups may need to focus on strengthening health systems before the conflicts occur, said Shanovich, who was not involved in the study. \u201cHumanitarian organizations must consider injury prevention strategies and education. Safe roads and houses must be rebuilt. Training for first aid and rehabilitation are essential,\u201d Kushner said.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Reacting to\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s speech Monday to the Detroit Economic Club,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0said her Republican opponent tried to \u201cmake his old, tired ideas sound new.\u201d As opposed to her old, tired ideas of higher taxes on the wealthy with government as redistributor. Let\u2019s consider some important quotes from the economic club speech. \u201cThe most direct and significant kind of federal action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private consumption and investment demand \u2014 to cut the fetters which hold back private spending.\u201d Increasing federal spending, as Clinton\u00a0has proposed, would, said the economic club speaker, \u201csoon demoralize both the government and our economy. If government is to retain the confidence of the people, it must not spend more than can be justified on grounds of national need . .\u00a0 .\u201d The federal government, he said, \u201csiphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; [and] reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment and risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the federal government\u2019s most useful role is not to rush into a program of excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives and opportunities for private expenditures.\u201d There are more of these \u201cold, tired ideas\u201d: \u201cCorporate tax rates must also be cut to increase incentives and the availability of investment capital. \u2026 For all these reasons, next year\u2019s tax bill should reduce personal as well as corporate income taxes for those in the lower brackets, who are certain to spend their additional take-home pay, and for those in the middle and upper brackets, who can thereby be encouraged to undertake additional efforts and enabled to invest more capital.\u201d If you haven\u2019t yet guessed, the quotes you have just read are from a speech President John F. Kennedy delivered to the New York Economic Club on Dec. 14, 1962. In attacking\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0for wanting to cut personal and corporate taxes, and reduce federal spending and federal control over our lives,\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0is effectively attacking the martyred JFK. Kennedy\u2019s proposals were followed by Ronald Reagan\u2019s major tax cuts and a reduction in tax rates, which had reached 70 percent on regular income for the highest earners under Jimmy Carter. Under Reagan, the government took in more tax revenue because lower tax rates gave people and businesses the incentive to work harder and earn more. In his Detroit speech,\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0noted how liberal economic policies have failed that once-prosperous city. That\u2019s because Democrats have controlled the political machine there for more than five decades. \u201cDetroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0said. \u201cEvery policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by\u00a0Hillary Clinton. She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies that have made you less safe. And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries. And she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future.\u201d This is the way to go after Clinton. If Trump\u00a0sticks to policies and not his personality, he could close the gap in opinion polls. Liberal policies have failed. Economic growth is the answer, but you never hear Clinton\u00a0talk about it. She promotes class envy instead of prosperity and opportunity for all. Clinton\u00a0is the anti-JFK candidate. Hers are the failed policies not only of the past, but the present. If she is elected president, they will continue to fail into the future.",

One can see why. Obama\u2019s about face on Iraq and Syria doesn\u2019t seem to have changed voter attitudes about his foreign policy and that of his party. A new CBS News/NYT poll says that the president\u2019s approval rating for foreign policy is essentially unchanged since last month when he announced an escalation of air strikes in the two countries, the return of U.S. ground forces to Iraq and increased arms shipments to rival rebel groups. Last month, 39 percent approved. This month, it is 40 percent. Worse for Democrats, Republicans hold a huge advantage on the issue of terrorism, leading by 21 points in the poll. Only 32 percent said the president did a good job assessing the threat from Islamist militants and a plurality said his policies had made the country less safe. [Fox News: \u201cFormer Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly Tuesday there is no question that the Obama administration\u2019s decision to not maintain a presence in Iraq was a mistake, and President Obama needs to \u2018develop the will to get into the ring and fight\u2019 against the Islamic State.\u201d] You sure you want to talk about the economy, Mr. President? - CNBC: \u201c[A]ccording to the latest CNBC All-America Economic survey\u2026 Just 24 percent of Americans say they are extremely or quite confident in Obama's economic policies and goals, down from 33 percent when the question was last asked in June 2013, the previous low-point of the Obama presidency.

The group is putting $2.1 million towards an attack against Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., over her support of ObamaCare. In Arkansas, Crossroads has launched an ad tying Sen. Mark Pryor\u2019s, D-Ark., support of the administration\u2019s policies that are deeply unpopular in the state as part of $2.5 million ad buy that began after Labor Day. It is also making it ad debut in Kentucky, putting $1.2 million towards a spot assailing Democrat Allison Lundergan Grimes backing of President Obama, despite his energy agenda which is threatening jobs in the state. GOP PUMMELS ORMAN\u2019S BUSINESS PAST David Drucker in Washington Examiner: \u201cKansas Republicans are going after independent Senate candidate Greg Orman on one of his most-cited strengths: his business record. In particular, they\u2019re highlighting Orman\u2019s role as a director and major shareholder in a company that defaulted on $250 million worth of loans\u2026 members of the Kansas GOP are arguing that Orman\u2019s record is not what it seems. Exhibit A is his position with the Bracknell Corp., a Minnesota telecommunication company. The company, which has since shut down, was sued by the Royal Bank of Canada for defaulting on part of a loan. The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2006, and allegations of wrongdoings against Bracknell\u2019s directors were withdrawn.\u201d SULLIVAN BLASTS BEGICH OVER ENERGY Alaska Republican Senate contender Dan Sullivan is out with a new ad blasting Sen.

UNIONS SHIFT FOCUS TO STATE RACESWaPo: \u201cLabor has a fresh focus on state legislative races this midterm election year -- and a new emphasis on reaching non-union households, AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka told reporters Tuesday. Union spending this election cycle is likely to be in the range it was for the last midterm election in 2010: about $250 to 300 million, by some estimates. Trumka said that this year's midterm fight is more local than it has been in the past in part because of gridlock in Washington. In battleground states, labor has focused its efforts on legislative candidates in tight races. \u2018We are playing in state legislative races at a level we haven't before,\u2019 he said at a morning roundtable at AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington. \u2018Partly that's because we can get things done -- like increases in the minimum wage -- there that we can't at the federal level.\u2019\u2019\u2019 A first date for Julia - Washington Examiner: \u201cFirst lady Michelle Obama, wooing college students, on Wednesday said that voting was a good excuse for a first date.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Human rights groups on Monday urged the U.S. to offer emergency sanctuary to Bangladeshi writers targeted by Islamic extremists for their secular beliefs following a wave of killings that have fueled concern over rising radicalism in the South Asian nation. A coalition of rights organizations, led by the PEN American Center, made the appeal in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. They warned that a group of writers, bloggers and publishers are in \"urgent danger.\" Four bloggers and a publisher have been killed this year and dozens more have been publicly threatened. Bangladesh is a Muslim country with traditions of secularism and tolerance. But a Dec. 8 report on violent extremism prepared for the U.S. Agency for International Development and obtained by The Associated Press says that since 2013 \"there seems to be greater acceptance of the militant groups\" within Bangladesh. The report by Management Systems International, a U.S.-based international development firm, says conservative and less tolerant interpretations of Islam appear to be gaining ground. The report is also critical of the Bangladeshi government's approach to counter-terrorism in a politically charged atmosphere. The letter from the rights groups says that the Bangladeshi government has not provided adequate protection for bloggers, and in some cases has urged them to self-censor or leave the country. Some secular bloggers have been arrested on charges of insulting religious sentiments. The letter called the situation \"extremely dangerous\" and urged \"humanitarian parole\" for the bloggers to prevent their deaths. Seven organizations signed the letter, including Human Rights Watch and Freedom House. Humanitarian parole is used sparingly to bring a person into the United States for a temporary period of time due to a compelling emergency, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services. The five individuals killed between February and October were among those named on \"hit lists\" published by Islamist groups that have claimed responsibility for the attacks, the letter said. Other individuals on the lists have contacted the rights organizations or have received death threats by mobile phone or social media, it says. The first of the five fatalities this year was Bangladeshi-American writer Avijit Roy, a prominent critic of religious extremism, who was attacked in a crowded street in the capital Dhaka on Feb. 26 by men wielding machetes as he and his wife were leaving a book fair. His wife survived with serious injuries. The report warns that a new generation of Bangladeshi militants is \"well-educated, tech-savvy\" and comes from upper middle class families. It says it is unclear if the militants act on their own or as part of a centralized initiative originating with the Islamic State group or al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent. Between Sept. 4 and Nov. 30, 2015, there were 14 attacks allegedly carried out by individuals or groups that claim to be followers of the Islamic State group, including the murder of two foreigners and unprecedented attacks on minority Shiite Muslims, according to the report. Most Bangladeshis are Sunni Muslims. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina denies that IS has a presence in Bangladesh. It accuses domestic Islamist groups along with the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its main ally, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, of carrying out the attacks to destabilize the nation for political gains. Bangladesh has been in political ferment since the run-up to January 2014 elections that were boycotted by opposition parties, and over war crimes prosecutions brought against Jamaat-e-Islami leaders over alleged involvement in atrocities during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. The report says that the marginalization of political parties, including religion-based ones, may have contributed to the growth of violent extremism. \"It is important to note that the ruling party's position has shifted from openly embracing 'atheist bloggers' to maintaining a safe distance from them, to being critical of them, to warning them of consequences,\" the report says.",

            "article_content": "Sheriff David Clarke sounds off about the controversy on 'The Kelly File' McKINNEY, Texas  \u2013 A former suburban Dallas police officer who resigned after video showed him forcing a bikini-clad black 15-year-old girl to the ground will not be charged in the matter, police said Thursday. A Collin County grand jury decided not to indict former McKinney officer Eric Casebolt, who pushed the girl to the ground following a June 2015 party at a community pool that drew a crowd of predominantly black teenagers. McKinney police released a statement confirming the jury's decision Thursday. It was not clear just what charge against Casebolt the jury was considering. Officials said in the statement that the investigation into the police response was turned over to the Texas Rangers, who then forwarded their report to the Collin County district attorney's office for review by the jury. Police commanders plan to hold a community meeting Monday to discuss the investigation with residents. Cellphone videos taken by people at the pool showed Casebolt, who is white, running after black teens and ordering them to the ground, then forcing the teen girl, Dajerria Becton, onto her stomach and placing his knees on her back. At one point, he drew his firearm after two young black men charged forward in apparent protest of the girl's treatment but holstered the weapon when two other officers intervened. Police said officers were responding to reports that teens unauthorized to use the pool were jumping a fence to gain entry. Residents of the middle-class neighborhood had said teens attending an end-of-school party at the pool and adjacent park were acting unruly. Local and national civil rights groups days later held a protest in front of the McKinney Police Department, asking that prosecutors charge the former police corporal for his actions. Police Chief Greg Conley had called his actions \"indefensible,\" and Casebolt subsequently resigned. Casebolt's attorney, Tom Mills, told The Dallas Morning News on Thursday that, \"We're glad that the system worked in his favor in this case.\" Mills did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment. Another lawyer for Casebolt, Jane Bishkin, said in the days after the pool party that Casebolt was not targeting minorities when he wrestled Becton to the ground. She said Casebolt at the time was fraught with emotion after responding earlier to two suicide calls. An attorney for Becton's family did not respond to a call for comment. The family said at the time that stress was not an adequate defense for Casebolt's actions.",

            "article_content": "(Hyundai) (Hyundai) New York City has more than its fair share of storied tourist attractions. There\u2019s the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, The Naked Cowboy\u2026and the list goes on. But one of its most popular isn\u2019t in town at all. Situated about an hour north of the George Washington Bridge is a wondrous place with the magical name of Woodbury Common\u2026Premium Outlets. The outdoor shopping center is such a draw for foreign visitors looking to take advantage of a weak dollar that special buses run there from midtown Manhattan, helicopter service is available, and PA announcements on the faux-village\u2019s faux-cobbled walkways are made in several languages, ranging from Portuguese to Japanese. No mere collection of Gap and Carter\u2019s stores, it veritably teems with high-end brands like Chanel, Versace and Vilebrequin. In other words: luxury for less. It\u2019s very fitting, then, that the driving route laid out for the press preview of the Hyundai Equus took us up the Hudson River Valley and back from this center of savings. For those of you who missed the debut of the Genesis sedan a couple of years ago, the Equus is Hyundai\u2019s second step up the luxury car ladder, and it\u2019s a big one. The $58,900 full-size bargain barge is nearly double the price of its successful-enough-to-try-it-again forebear. It may sound like a heady amount to pay for a vehicle from the company that also makes the cheapest car in America \u2013 the $10,705 Accent \u2013 but is literally tens of thousands of dollars less than its intended competition. That bunch includes the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Audi A8 and BMW 7-Series. But the Equus\u2019 main target is the Lexus LS460L \u2013 which way back when filled the sensible shoes that Hyundai is currently trying on, and they fit pretty well. As it stands, the Equus is almost exactly the same size as the Lexus at nearly 17 feet long and over 6 feet wide. Its design is much more reserved than Hyundai\u2019s recent models, such as the Sonata, but exudes a classy presence that would look right at home \u2013 if not stand out - in the parking lot outside of a board of directors meeting. The Equus is powered by the same 4.6-liter V8 available in the Genesis \u2013 a Ward\u2019s 10 Best Engine award winner, two years running. A 385 horsepower rating places it in the middle of its class, but that\u2019s when it\u2019s running on premium fuel. If you don\u2019t mind slumming it a bit, you can trade 1.8 percent of that power for a tank of regular. Most high-output engines these days don\u2019t give you the choice. Then again, most high-output engines aren\u2019t made by value brands. Keeping in line with the simple pricing strategy of the rest of the Hyundai lineup, there are only two Equus models to choose from, and virtually no options. The entry-level Signature comes with a boatload of high-tech and luxury features including navigation, 17-speaker Lexicon stereo, adaptive cruise control, snazzy illuminated scuff plates and even premium floor mats \u2013 at no extra charge! Not having to haggle with a salesman over those may be enough of a reason to consider buying this car. Step up to the $65,400 Ultimate and you give up one coach seat \u2013 the hump \u2013 to gain an exclusive First Class section. This comes in the form of a reclining bucket with footrest on the rear passenger side, complete with a button that slides the front seat forward and folds it to offer you maximum space. Doing so effectively turns the car into a three-place sedan and gives you a dastardly new way to eliminate underperforming employees. The seat also has a multi-mode massage function, and is heated and cooled. Unfortunately, you have to share the refrigerator in the center armrest and single-screen rear entertainment system with any traveling companions seated in the erstwhile business class behind the driver. But since they don\u2019t get the footrest or massage you still have plenty to lord over them. Good stuff if you live in South Korea, where the Equus is the finest domestic car available and a common choice among chauffeured executives, but here the typical owner is likely to be found behind the wheel. Luckily, they\u2019re well taken-care of, too, with 12-way adjustable seats that are unique to U.S. models, and \u2013 as if to drive the point home that the driver takes a back seat to no one in this mobile \u201cchaebol\u201d \u2013 also fitted with massage. Rich-looking wood and top-flight leather dress up a neat, but unadventurous cockpit that\u2019s let down a bit by low budget buttons, while the headliner is made from real Alcantara. From this vantage point, though, it\u2019s what you don\u2019t see that matters most. You are not likely to experience a car that\u2019s quieter than the Equus unless you try wearing earmuffs in one that\u2019s parked in a garage in the middle of the desert while your wife is on vacation. (An unlikely situation, to be sure, but feel free to give it a shot before commenting.) Road and wind roar have been dialed down to new lows without the use of any electronic noise canceling trickery, and the engine is buttery-smooth. It\u2019s powerful enough, too. It doesn\u2019t have the tire-squealing torque of the turbocharged BMW V8 in a 750Li, but neither does the six-cylinder found in the 740Li that still costs $15G more than an Equus, so you can deal. In fact, for non-Autobahn duty, this highfalutin Hyundai is more than up for just about any task that one can expect to be thrown at it, turns included. Despite the presence of a Sport button, the standard active air suspension doesn\u2019t exactly turn the Equus into a sports sedan, but it does an excellent job of keeping unwanted body movements at bay. Canyon roads are dealt with as easily as cavernous potholes. The only thing missing is all-wheel-drive for particularly snowy climes, but the electronic stability control deals with wet, leaf-strewn surfaces just fine. The Equus is Hyundai\u2019s first vehicle fitted with a lane-departure warning system, and its an advanced one that features haptic feedback. This is an increasingly common technology that gives vehicles the ability to physically communicate with their drivers. In this case, if you don\u2019t react to any of the audible and visual warnings that you are drifting out of your lane, the seatbelt aggressively tugs at you to get your attention. It\u2019s hard to ignore it. In a price is no object comparison, the Equus isn\u2019t at the head of this class, but the price is exactly the object of this car. All told, Hyundai figures that an LS460L similarly equipped to match an Ultimate will cost $89,200, and the Europeans can be optioned up much higher than that. Aside from the lack of rings, roundels and three-pointed stars on the hood, it\u2019s hard to determine how it is $25,000 less of a car, though for some buyers image is enough. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Volkswagen tried to enter this segment with the excellent Phaeton only to be met with disastrous results. To this end, while Hyundai isn\u2019t creating a separate luxury division for the Equus, it is limiting the number of dealers who will sell them to 250. Each will each set up a section of their showroom dedicated to the car, and salesmen will make house calls for test drives, if requested. Instead of an owner\u2019s manual, buyers will get an iPad with one loaded on to it along with an application that will allow them to schedule maintenance visits. \u201cVisits\u201d is actually the wrong word, because for the first 5 years or 60,000 miles their cars will be picked up and delivered to them wherever they please. Wear items like brake pads, rotors, wiper blades and batteries are included in the service, as is the use of an Equus or Genesis loaner while the car is in the shop. Hyundai is aiming for sales of less than 3,000 in 2011, so even with the low sticker price, the Equus offers exclusivity \u2013 unless, or until it catches on. As someone who knows the map of Woodbury Common as well as the $35 Banana Republic Outlet jacket he wore to work today, I\u2019d say the latter is the more likely outcome. ---------- 2011 Hyundai Equus Base Price: $58,900 Type: 4 or 5-passenger, rear-wheel-drive, four-door sedan Engine: 4.6L V8 Power: 385 hp, 333 lb-ft torque Transmission: 6-speed automatic MPG: 16 city/24 hwy",

            "article_content": "Mike Tobin reports from Chicago An Illinois state lawmaker filed legislation Wednesday outlining a lengthy process for a special election to oust Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. La Shawn Ford's proposal would allow a recall election to be initiated by a petition with signatures totaling at least 15 percent of the total votes cast in the previous mayoral election, with at least 50 signatures from each of Chicago's 50 wards, according to Fox 32 Chicago. Potential challengers would need 12,500 signatures to get on the prospective ballot. Ford, a Democrat like Emanuel, faces a tough road to get his plan to pan out. He would need approval from both chambers of the Illinois legislature, which are controlled by Democrats. Ford told WBBM-TV that people have lost confidence in Emanuel. Protesters called for Emanuel to resign Wednesday night after he apologized for the shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald at the hands of a white Chicago police officer and vowed several reforms. \"I take responsibility for what happened because it happened on my watch. And if we're going to fix it, I want you to understand it's my responsibility with you,\" Emanuel said. \"But if we're also going to begin the healing process, the first step in that journey is my step. \"And I'm sorry.\" Protesters formed a circle in the middle of Michigan Avenue and appeared to be headed for a bridge near the Magnificent Mile, which was the site of a Black Friday protest last month. Some in the crowd shoved officers before police let them through. Activists chanted \u201c16 shots and a cover-up\u201d in reference to the video showing Officer James Van Dyke shooting McDonald, who appeared to be walking away from officers. Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder. Emanuel spoke of black residents' mistrust of Chicago police, saying it's unacceptable that some officers treat black people -- particularly young men -- differently than they do whites, and that there are parents in Chicago who feel they must warn their children to be wary of officers. \"It is not something I would ever tell my children. That's unacceptable,\" Emanuel said, later adding that \"no citizen is a second-class citizen in the city of Chicago.\" Alderman Leslie Hairston, who is black, gave an impassioned speech in support of Emanuel's comments about people being treated differently because of their skin color. She said she was \"denied access\" to the council's chamber Wednesday until she produced ID -- \"even though my picture was on the wall.\" Her white colleagues walked in without having to show ID, said Hairston, whose ward encompasses parts of the South Side, including the University of Chicago. \"Your speech touched me because of what happened to me trying to come to work today to do my job,\" she told the mayor. McDonald\u2019s death and the subsequent release of more police-involved shootings has forced Emanuel to backtrack on comments he made earlier this week about a federal investigation into the Chicago Police Department. Emanuel initially called the probe \u201cmisguided\u201d because the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office was already examining the McDonald shooting. Emanuel later said he welcomed such an investigation, which was announced by the Justice Department Monday and will look to determine whether there are patterns of racial disparity in the police department's use of force. Another video showed an inmate being dragged out of his cell by his handcuffed wrists. While a police review board previously found the officers' actions justified, Emanuel said he did not see how the treatment of the man -- who later died following a reaction to an antipsychotic drug -- could \"possibly be acceptable\" and said he did not consider the investigation closed.

            "article_content": "Gary Gastelu gets taken for a ride in the self-steering 2017 Mercedes-Benz E300. You still have to keep your eyes on the road. But keeping your hands on the wheel? That\u2019s becoming optional. The all-new 2017 Mercedes-Benz E300 is available with a feature called Drive Pilot, which should not be confused with Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, even though they do pretty much the same things. Drive Pilot is actually a collection of features enabled by cameras and radar that combine to allow the E300 to steer itself between the lines on the road, manage its speed and autonomously brake for things that get in front of it. (Mercedes-Benz) What\u2019s that? Your car already does all that? Yeah, there are quite a few out there with lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking systems. But, believe me, aside from maybe the Teslas, they don\u2019t do it as well as this one \u2013 including your year-old Benz. If there are relatively clear lane markers to keep a camera eye on, Drive Pilot locks the car in the middle of them. There\u2019s no bouncing side to side like a poorly thrown bowling ball between gutter bumpers, and it traces curves likely as well as you. It\u2019ll do it on the highway and also in stop-and-go city traffic, where the experience is more creepy than thrilling. Like the looks of the lane next to you? Just hit the directional and prepare to be transported into it. The car checks its blind spot on its own, waits if there\u2019s anything there, and then changes lanes when there\u2019s room. I dare you not to laugh out loud the first time you try this. Or the hundredth. You can\u2019t sit back, relax and enjoy the ride for too long, though. Mercedes would prefer that you treat Drive Pilot as a safety net, rather than a chauffeur. Every minute or so it asks you to touch the wheel to prove you haven\u2019t gone AWOL. If you don\u2019t, it turns on the hazard lights and gently brings itself to a halt to save itself ... I mean you. It also checks in more frequently if the road starts getting twisty, even though it can handle typical interstate-grade curves on its own just fine. Most of the time. Over about 200 miles of driving, there were two or three occasions when the E300 I was testing started drifting out of the lane and urged me to take control as its road departure prevention system alerts kicked in. I chose not to see what happened if I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019m told that if the car was about to hit anything it would use the inflatable side bolster in the seat to push me a couple of inches further away from the door and the speakers to emit a noise to brace my inner ear muscles for any damaging louder ones that might ensue in a crash. So, while Drive Pilot is impressively effective, it\u2019s not flawless, and you\u2019re still very much on the hook. It\u2019s also lacking the navigational ability to guide it from point A to point B, changing roads along the way. Although the E300 can read speed limit signs and adjust itself accordingly, the car can go only in the direction you point it. Obeying red lights and stop signs is up to you. The package Drive Pilot comes bundled in adds $11,250 to the E300\u2019s $53,075 base price, but it also includes a few distracting luxuries that might make the extra layer of safety worth it. These include heated massaging seats, a 14-speaker Burmester audio system and a cabin air fragrance system, all of which can send you off to dreamland. (Mercedes-Benz) Even stripped of all of these, the E300 is once again the belle of the midsize luxury sedan ball. It looks like a shrunken version of an S-Class on the outside, and all of that flagship\u2019s goodness is concentrated within. The accent light-equipped interior design is fabulous, especially at night, with flowing lines and a panorama of dueling 12.3-inch displays for the gauges and infotainment system. The ride comfort is so good that I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s a reason to shell out for the optional adaptive dampers or air springs, though I\u2019d like to be proven wrong. A new 241 hp 2.0-liter turbocharged engine isn\u2019t overly powerful, but it is smooth and efficient. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s as quiet as a car can be, but there\u2019s a $1,100 Acoustic Comfort package available that stuffs in extra insulation and laminates the windows to muffle it even more. My only real gripe is that, as has often been the case with the E-Class, its rear seat legroom is fair to middling among its peers. But that\u2019s OK this time around, because the driver\u2019s seat is the best one in the house. Especially when you\u2019re not driving. ---------- 2017 Mercedes-Benz E300 Base price: $53,075 As tested: Type: 5-passenger, 4-door sedan Engine: Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder Power: 241 hp, 273 lb-ft torque Transmission: 9-speed automatic MPG: 24 city/31 hwy",

(AP) **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Boehner makes opening move in shutdown chess match \u2022 Rand starts tricky tango on Senate, presidential runs \u2022 Landrieu runs separate, unequal campaigns \u2022 Baier Tracks: A contrast in coverage \u2022 Make sure it\u2019s not occupied BOEHNER MAKES OPENING MOVE IN SHUTDOWN CHESS MATCHHouse Republicans huddle today to hear the plan from Speaker John Boehner and his team for how to block President Obama\u2019s move to grant temporary amnesty and work permits to an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants. The only tool at hand for the GOP is the budget process, which is chugging its way toward the next fiscal cliff on Dec. 11, when the current emergency funding measure expires. So how do Republicans block or blunt Obama\u2019s executive power play but not shut down most of the government? The plan, as leaked, is to have the House pass a 10-month extension of current spending levels for everything but the Department of Homeland Security, which would get a short-term extension, setting up a fight on that topic alone early next year. But there are lots of questions, one thorny one in particular: Why would the Senate, still in Democratic hands for the rest of the year, or President Obama go along with that? [\u201cThis has got to be one of the largest unconstitutional power grabs by any president ever. And leaving aside the immigration policy, which I think is horrific, the actual assault on the Article 1 powers of the Congress under the Constitution can't go unchallenged.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Watch here.]What\u2019s next? - When it comes to shutdowns, the Democrats\u2019 view is \u201cthe worse the better.\u201d Limiting the scope of the fiscal freakout to just one portion of the government.is entirely counter to that doctrine, and Democrats clearly continue to see shutdowns as working to their political advantage. An administration that hurried to repel veterans from war memorials in the 2013 shutdown seems unlikely to embrace the idea of limited budget warfare, especially now that the president has staked so much on his executive action on immigration. But that\u2019s if the spending bill ever got to his desk. More likely, outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid & Co. would simply slam the door on the House-passed measure. Sure the GOP could just let the final 19 days of the year tick off and wait for Mitch McConnell to take the reins in the Senate, but that doesn\u2019t sound like a very merry Christmas for party leaders who have promised to keep the government open. Because of all that, what Boehner really will be offering today is an opening move in a nine-day chess match. His caucus\u2019 support for the plan will therefore depend on what his proposed counter measures would be. [Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee today.]For auld lang syne: Reid offers a final Christmas threat - The Hill: \u201cSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned senators that they might have to stay in session through the week of Dec. 15.\u00a0 In comments on the floor, Reid said he hoped the Senate could avoid staying at work the week before Christmas, but warned an additional week of work was possible. \u2018We have a lot to do and not a lot of time to accomplish it,\u2019 Reid said. \u2018We might have to be here the week before Christmas, however Mr. President, not into the Christmas holiday.\u2019\u201dSTOPGAP TAX DEAL EMERGES AFTER OBAMA VETO THREATThe Hill: \u201cThe House moved on Monday toward a vote to restore a slew of expired tax breaks, though only through the end of this year. The vote on a short-term extension, expected as soon as this week, would come after a veto threat from President Obama derailed a developing $400 billion deal between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp [R-Mich.] that would have extended some expired tax breaks indefinitely, as well as others for two years. Republicans on both side of the Capitol suggested the move showed that a one-year deal was the only proposal with a chance of becoming law. The House posted its one-year deal to restore the expired provisions on Monday, setting up a vote on the measure as soon as Wednesday\u2026House Republicans have warned for weeks that a one-year deal on the tax \u201cextenders\u201d would be the best they could do if lawmakers fell short on a broader deal, even though tax writers from both parties have said that such an agreement would make it difficult for companies and families to plan for 2015.\u201d [Study: $17b tax hike from Obama Web rules - The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s call for the federal government to regulate broadband Internet service like a public utility would lead to a $17 billion tax hit for people in the United States, according to a new analysis [from a liberal think tank].\u201dWatchdogs, lapdogs or attack dogs? - WashEx is rolling out a series this week on the efficacy of federal inspectors general, the 1978 system imposed to defeat waste, fraud and abuse.

But the Dublin-born mother of five found herself thrust into war when the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777. British Gen. William Howe made his headquarters near Lydia\u2019s family, but with a growing need to make their plans for attack, Howe and his troops took over rooms in the Darragh family home as well. Little did they know this gave Lydia all the information she needed to warn George Washington and his troops of the impending attacks at Whitemarsh, a location approximately 8 miles away. Lydia said she needed flour as cover to get out of the British controlled Philadelphia. After reporting her secret information to the colonists, she purchased her flour and returned home. The British suspected a member of the Darragh family for leaking the information, but Lydia never revealed anything. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

But the real action was in Atlanta, where Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at Martin Luther King\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church to announce new restrictions on law enforcement agencies, rules he called \u201crobust safeguards to help end racial profiling, once and for all.\u201d Holder invoked the Missouri shooting, saying the situation, \u201cpresents this nation a really unique opportunity\u201d to address \u201cissues that have for too long been ignored.\u201d But it is unclear how the new restrictions, which expand on rules first imposed during the Bush administration, would have prevented the shooting which involved an officer trying to detain a specific suspect from a convenience store robbery.But what will we call Theodore Roosevelt Island and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge? - Local news site Bethesda Now reports that a group of residents of the tony Chevy Chase neighborhood of the District of Columbia are seeking to strip Francis Griffith Newlands\u2019 name from the fountain in the traffic circle at the border between the district and Chevy Chase, Md. Newlands, a Democratic senator from Nevada from 1903 until his death in 1917, was the original developer of the neighborhood. He and his partners included racially restrictive land covenants that were common for the new \u201cstreetcar\u201d suburbs of a century ago.

President Obama offered a full-throated endorsement of embattled Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., in her Saturday runoff election with challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La. The reason you probably haven\u2019t heard is that Landrieu, who got in big trouble for blaming her unpopularity on racist and sexist voters, is running two separate campaigns: one for white voters and another one for black voters. James Hohmann offers his take: \u201cDepending on whose vote she\u2019s after, Mary Landrieu either stands with Barack Obama \u2014 or hardly knows the guy The Louisiana Democrat, who is trailing in the polls ahead of Saturday\u2019s Senate runoff, has been quietly running ads on urban radio stations that criticize the GOP\u2019s treatment of the country\u2019s first black president, while her aides and surrogates have boasted to predominantly black audiences of how often she\u2019s supported him. Meanwhile, when addressing mostly white audiences, Landrieu has been adamant that the election has nothing to do with Obama, and that she can think for herself. \u2018He\u2019s not for Keystone; I am,\u2019 she said during a televised debate Monday night. \u2018He shut down oil and gas drilling; we all are for it.\u2019\u201d [Ducking the polls? - Quin Hillyer points out a scheduling conflict for Saturday\u2019s vote: \u201cThis is a real concern: Sportsmen are seen as a largely Republican constituency, and the runoff takes place on Louisiana\u2019s last duck-hunting weekend and the first day of deer hunting. Cassidy\u2019s campaign must keep hunters from assuming they don\u2019t need to vote because his victory is in the bag.\u2019\u201d]All the auguries are bad for Landrieu - National Journal: \u201cWhite early voting turnout dropped 3% compared to the early vote in the Nov. 3 primary, but the number of early votes cast by African-Americans -- Landrieu's base voters -- has plummeted by 24%. Women's early votes have fallen off more than men's. And while about 18% fewer Democrats have cast early ballots ahead of the runoff, over 3% more Republicans have cast early votes than before Nov. 3.\u201dBAIER TRACKS: A CONTRAST IN COVERAGE\u2026\u201cSometimes there are stories that shine a bright spotlight on where the mainstream media would rather focus their attention.\u00a0 Case in point: Elizabeth Lauten, a staffer for a Republican Congressman who resigned Monday after comments she posted about the first daughters. She mocked Sasha and Malia on Facebook for their demeanor and attire at the annual turkey pardon, typing that they should \u2018try showing a little class\u2019 referring to their appearance. While it\u2019s general practice in Washington that any personal criticism of the president\u2019s children is off limits, two things are notable: 1) the speed of the outrage and then her resignation and 2) how much coverage this staffer and her Facebook post received in the media.\u00a0 A segment on broadcast network news shows (30-minute programs that these days seem to have precious little time for Washington stories), front page treatment in the Washington Post, \u00a0A16 in the New York Times and multiple segments on cable news yesterday and today. Contrast that to the coverage of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber\u2019s unearthed video comments about how the law was formed thanks to the \"stupidity of the American voter\" and other clips. Some news organizations have yet to do a full story on Gruber, even ahead of his testimony on Capitol Hill. Again, some stories tell us more than just what\u2019s written inside them.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.MAKE SURE IT\u2019S NOT OCCUPIEDAt best porta potties are an eyesore for most people, but the Detroit Free Press reports on a group of Michigan rocketry hobbyists who see things a little differently. After some modifications, the group, Thrusting the Throne, plans to launch the porta potty rocket into the sky. The \u201cthrone\u201d is aiming to fly between 2,500 and 3,000 feet, an altitude so high, the group has gotten a permit from the Federal Aviation Administration. Larry Kingman and his fellow rocket scientists have retrofitted the lavatory to become more aerodynamic for the flight, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s actually a very substantial aluminum airframe that we\u2019ve built that has motor mounts in the center of it, so we\u2019ll have a cluster of seven motors in the middle.
