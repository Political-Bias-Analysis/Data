            "article_content": "Complaint accuses Democrat of 'inciting violence.' Judicial Watch president, Tom Fitton, says the House must hold Waters accountable. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, one of the most outspoken members of the anti-Trump \u2018resistance\u2019 in Congress, is facing fresh questions about a longstanding controversy regarding how her campaign raises money and how those funds have flowed to her daughter. The California congresswoman has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle from some of her state\u2019s biggest politicians paying to be listed on her slate mailers\u2014sample ballots traditionally mailed out to about 200,000 voters in Los Angeles highlighting whom she supports. Since 2004, the campaign in turn reportedly has paid $750,000\u00a0to the congresswoman\u2019s daughter, Karen Waters, or her public relations firm Progressive Connections for help producing them. A government watchdog in July filed the first of two complaints with the Federal Election Commission asking for a full audit of the Citizens for Waters campaign. 'Maxine Waters found an old provision and turned it into a cottage industry.' The\u00a0first complaint\u00a0alleges Waters broke federal campaign finance law, and also names the California Democratic State Central Committee and Sen. Kamala Harris, a likely 2020 Democratic presidential contender. The conservative National Legal and Policy Center\u00a0is still drafting a second broader complaint focusing on the sources of money going to the Waters campaign and flowing to her daughter\u2014and the accuracy of campaign finance reports, said Tom Anderson, director of the group\u2019s government integrity project. Rep. Waters, first elected in 1990, has been in the headlines lately for her calls to impeach President Trump and statements urging public confrontations with his Cabinet officials. Well before her current political fame, though, she mastered this somewhat-rare form of fundraising in slate mailers. California\u2019s top politicians as well as local office-seekers have given far in excess of legal contribution limits to her campaign to be on her slate of endorsed candidates. The campaign then pays Karen Waters and other firms to produce, print and mail the sample ballots. The FEC approved the practice by Waters in 2004. \u201cMaxine Waters found an old provision and turned it into a cottage industry,\u201d Anderson told Fox News. However, the FEC complaint filed on July 25 states that the California Democratic party paid $35,000 to the Waters campaign in 2016 to include the endorsement of Harris\u2019 Senate candidacy on the mailer. The FEC complaint, which cited an October campaign finance report, contends a third party is not legally allowed to pay for the mailer of a candidate without a reimbursement under the\u00a02004 FEC advisory opinion. A separate report shows that the Harris campaign paid $30,000 to the Waters campaign earlier in 2016 for a primary slate mailer, but no subsequent payments. \u201cThe Democratic State Central Committee of California's $35,000 contribution to Citizens for Waters violated campaign finance limits,\u201d the complaint states. WATCHDOG SAYS WATERS INCITING 'MOB VIOLENCE' Neither Waters\u2019 congressional office nor her 2018 campaign responded to phone and email inquiries. Karen Waters also did not respond to phone messages. A California Democratic Party spokesman and Harris\u2019 Senate office did not respond to phone and email inquiries. The mailers continue to be a lucrative source of funds. For the\u00a02018 election cycle, FEC data shows, as of July 28, that Democrat Gavin Newsom\u2019s gubernatorial campaign paid $27,000 to Waters\u2019 re-election campaign to be in the mailers. The state Democratic Party snubbed Sen. Dianne Feinstein this year, but she paid $27,000 and has the Waters endorsement. Candidates for state assembly, sheriff and judges paid between $2,000 and $12,000 to Citizens for Waters to be included on the mailers. FEC data also shows as of July 28, Citizens for Waters\u00a0paid\u00a0Karen Waters $54,000 so far for the 2018 election cycle, mostly for slate mailers but also for other campaign work. The congressional campaign paid her $72,000 in the 2016 cycle, according to the\u00a0Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. In November, Waters is facing Republican\u00a0Omar Navarro, 29, a small business owner. The 79-year-old incumbent beat Navarro in 2016 with 76 percent of the vote, and outpaced him again in the June \u201cjungle primary\u201d (in which both parties can run) with 72 percent of the vote. \u201cShe is going to be re-elected no matter what,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cShe comes knocking and other politicians in California to say, \u2018do you want my endorsement,\u2019 because she knows they don\u2019t want her opposing them.\u201d Her rising profile in opposing Trump likely gives her more clout, Anderson said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay to be on her slate, then maybe you\u2019re one of Trump\u2019s people,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cA local politician, like a judge, does not want to be on her bad side.\u201d Legally, candidates are paying a reimbursement for the slate mailer, rather than buying an endorsement. But it\u2019s difficult to prove whether the Waters endorsement comes as a result of the payment or if already endorsed candidates are paying for their share, said Adav Noti, a former FEC assistant general counsel. \u201cThose payments are legitimate if it\u2019s approximate to the cost for the entity producing, printing and sending the mailers,\u201d Noti, now a senior director at the Campaign Legal Center, told Fox News. \u201cWithout seeing the information on the cost of the mailers, it\u2019s difficult to say if there is anything inherently wrong with the math.\u201d Federal\u00a0law technically limits\u00a0individual campaign contributions to $2,700 to a candidate\u2019s committee and $5,000 to a political action committee. \u201cThis certainly violates the spirit of campaign finance laws, but the FEC doesn\u2019t seem to think it violates the letter of the law,\u201d\u00a0said John Wonderlich,\u00a0executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group that first reported on the practice by the Waters campaign in 2010 and the connection with her daughter. \u201cIn this case, is it a question of enrichment for a family member?\u201d Wonderlich added. \u201cHow much of the money passes through to cover postage and printing? It may be unsavory but not corrupt. Much of it hinges on the extent to which the money passes through.\u201d The 2004 FEC advisory opinion, signed by Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, described the slate mailers as follows: \u201cThe brochure will feature a prominent picture or likeness of Representative Waters on the front page. It will be promoted as Representative Waters' \u2018official sample ballot\u2019 and will contain brief quotes, which convey her opinions and endorsements of the federal and non-federal candidates listed.\u201d The 2004 FEC opinion states that the payments from other candidates \u201cwould not constitute support of, or in-kind contributions to, any federal candidate appearing in the brochure, so long as the authorized committee of that federal candidate reimburses the Waters Committee.\u201d Fred Lucas is the White House correspondent for The Daily Signal.

            "article_content": "Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano reflects on his friend Senator John McCain and reacts to Meghan McCain's criticism of President Trump during her eulogy in front of establishment Republicans. Last week, I was intrigued by all the fanfare attendant upon the national farewell to the late Sen. John McCain. I have written in this space that McCain and I were friends who spoke many times, but generally only about the issues upon which we agreed -- abortion, immigration and torture. On those issues, he often stood at odds with most of his Republican colleagues in the Senate. They are opposed to abortion in name only (they will not lift a finger to stop or slow it), prefer judging the moral worth of individuals on the basis of where they were born, and think that torture is wrong unless the victim is a bad guy or a foreigner or has information the government wants. Moral relativism is the coin of their realm. On those issues, McCain stood steadfast, no matter the political or personal consequences. For that steadfastness, and with respect to those issues, his behavior was heroic. A hero does not lack fear. He or she proceeds into its face nevertheless, heedless of the consequences to self. For reasons he has never adequately explained, President Donald Trump rejected McCain's heroism and mocked McCain's time of torment in a North Vietnamese prison. That mockery was brought to full measure at McCain's funeral by the senator's daughter, my friend and former Fox News colleague Meghan McCain. She told the members of the Washington establishment who had gathered, sans the president, at her father's funeral at the Washington National Cathedral -- why the federal government founded a cathedral is another question for another time -- that her father manifested greatness and that Trump manifests cheapness. Then the two men who each in his own way personally stopped McCain's efforts to become president -- George W. Bush in the Republican primaries in 2000 and Barack Obama in the general election in 2008 -- delivered similar accolades of McCain, complete with veiled rebukes of Trump. On its face, the audience in that government-founded church, establishment to the core, was adoring McCain's memory and mourning his loss. But the establishment is filled with hypocrites. This is the same establishment that gave us the unguarded borders and airways of 9/11 and blamed its failures on foreigners. It gave us the useless, fruitless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the human and monumental destruction they wrought. It gave us the secret torture of foreign captives and their indefinite incarceration without trial. It gave us warrantless spying on innocent Americans -- at first in secret and then openly and under color of law -- in direct defiance of the Fourth Amendment. It gave us the 2008 financial crisis, which it cured by borrowing billions of dollars and giving the money to those who had caused it. And -- as if all that were not enough -- it gave us a $13.5 trillion collective increase in government debt during the Bush and Obama years and the secret but repetitive use of drones to assassinate foreigners and Americans overseas. Has any of this enhanced your life, liberty or property? As much as I appreciated the kind words about my late friend and the polite reception those words received, it made me think about how dangerous to life, liberty and property the government has become, how unfaithful to the Constitution have been those in whose hands we have reposed it for safekeeping and how unashamed of their misdeeds are those who have caused all this. Nearly all of the present assaults to liberty can be laid at the feet of the Republicans and Democrats who were sitting in that government-founded church in the nation's capital and listening to the praise of John McCain. But that establishment crowd also gave us another event it would rather forget and for which it will never accept blame or claim credit -- the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. He ran as the anti-establishment candidate, and he ran against the collective mindset of those proud of themselves in that \"national\" church. He condemned the wars they caused. He mocked their borrowing and spending. He attacked the secretive mindset of their intelligence and law enforcement communities. And the voters rewarded him. Yet he, too, uses drones and missiles to kill and does so in foreign lands without any declarations of war. He, too, has borrowed money and spent it at nearly a wartime rate. And he, too, has continued the spying on innocent Americans. In those respects, he has become what he condemned -- the government establishment proud of itself sitting in a government-founded church. Add to this, he has mocked the rule of law, praised those charged with and convicted of violating it, tormented those charged with enforcing it, distorted tales about his personal behavior, and wreaked havoc on innocent farmers by making the sale of their goods too expensive for foreign consumers. His presence was in that church as powerfully as if he had physically been there. The bitterness about Trump was silently expressed by those who brought him to power and now cooperate with his behavior or pretend that they don't. The mindset of the establishment continues to be that the government can right any wrong, regulate any behavior, borrow and spend any amount of money, and build a church in utter defiance of the First Amendment, the Constitution -- which is supposed to limit the government, not unleash it -- be damned. So, who caused more harm to the republic, McCain and his admirers or Trump and his enablers? Republicans or Democrats? Is there a difference? Ultimately, we are responsible for the folks we have elected and the things they have done, whether secretive, hypocritical or in our faces. Ultimately, we have the government we deserve. Will we change this before it is too late?",

            "article_content": "President Trump nominates Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. President Trump nominated appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Monday night to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, ending a days-long guessing game that began the moment Kennedy announced his retirement and setting the stage for a grueling confirmation fight. In televised remarks from the East Room of the White House, the president praised what he called Kavanaugh's \"impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law.\" \"There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving,\" Trump said. Kavanaugh had been considered a front-runner ever since Kennedy's June 27 retirement announcement. Trump conducted a swift and decisive vetting process, eager to push for confirmation of his second Supreme Court pick in less than two years. Though the president said Monday his nominee deserves \"robust bipartisan support,\" many Democratic lawmakers had vowed even before the announcement to oppose Trump's choice. In his own remarks, Kavanaugh looked ahead to what's expected to be a bruising confirmation fight: \"I will tell each senator that I revere the Constitution. I believe that an independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic. \"If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case, and I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.\" He said a judge \"must interpret the law, not make the law.\" The four finalists \u2013 Kavanaugh and fellow appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett, Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge \u2013 were drawn from a list of 25 names vetted by conservative groups. A clue to Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination emerged hours before the announcement when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a written opinion in which the judge sided with the majority. The D.C. court does not typically issue opinions on Mondays except in response to emergency petitions, suggesting the case had to be disposed of before Kavanaugh was nominated for the high court. In the hours leading up to Trump's announcement, crowds of pro-choice and pro-life protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court building. Some chanted \"Kavanaugh has got to go\" as news of the nomination spread through the crowd. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., spoke to the crowd and led an anti-Kavanaugh chant, though her own words were drowned out by protesters. The protests were a snapshot of the intense battle to come, on Capitol Hill and in midterm races across the country where the nomination will factor heavily. Kavanaugh has a deep judicial record, having written about 300 opinions. A former law clerk to Kennedy in 1993, he was elevated to the powerful federal appeals court in the District of Columbia by President George W. Bush, under whom he had served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary. Kavanaugh, 53, also won the confidence of key players in the Bush circle such as strategist Karl Rove. Kavanaugh was nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals by his former boss, George W. Bush, in 2006. (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) This, however, had risked being something of a double-edged sword for Kavanaugh in the Trump era, raising concerns among some Trump supporters that he was too much of a D.C. insider and too closely associated with the Bush circle. The Bush connections also harmed him with Democrats at the time of his initial nomination, who delayed his confirmation. But despite the criticism, he wore his support for Bush on his sleeve. It remains to be seen if those ties will complicate his confirmation process now -- both with Democrats and Trump\u2019s base. In a statement, Bush said Trump had made an \"outstanding decision\" in nominating Kavanaugh. \"Brett is a brilliant jurist who has faithfully applied the Constitution and laws throughout his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit. He is a fine husband, father, and friend \u2013 and a man of the highest integrity. He will make a superb Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Trump may have been swayed in part because of Kavanaugh\u2019s record of being a reliable conservative on the court \u2013 and reining in dozens of administrative decisions of the Obama White House. There are some question marks for conservatives, particularly an ObamaCare ruling years ago. In a 2011 case, Kavanaugh acknowledged in his dissent that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate provision\u201d could fit \u201ccomfortably within Congress\u2019 Taxing Clause power.\u201d His detractors say that language helped provide the road map for the Supreme Court to uphold the mandate a year later. However, supporters of Kavanaugh have pushed back against that argument. Justin Walker, a former Kavanaugh clerk, argued that the judge\u2019s \u201chypothetical discussion\u201d about the Taxing Clause has been misinterpreted and is actually \u201ca road map to the conclusion reached by the dissenters\u2014that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under the Taxing Clause.\u201d It\u2019s also unclear how Kavanaugh would rule on abortion, as he has never directly confronted the issue as a judge. Last year, Kavanaugh dissented from a decision allowing an illegal immigrant to receive an abortion, but pro-life conservatives have criticized him for not going far enough. Specifically, they have expressed concern about language where Kavanaugh wrote \u201cthe unlawful immigrant minor is assumed to have a right under precedent to an abortion.\u201d Protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court in Washington before and after Trump's pick was announced. The administration announced earlier Monday that former Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona would guide the nominee through the Senate confirmation process. Before retiring in 2013, Kyl was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be the first to consider the nomination. The White House hopes Kyl's close ties to Senate Republicans will help smooth the path for Kavanaugh. In addition, the conservative group Judicial Crisis Network will launch a $1.4 million ad buy in support of Kavanaugh, running advertisements in Alabama, Indiana, North Dakota, and West Virginia \u2013 states with Democratic senators on the fence about supporting Trump\u2019s nominee. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer vowed Monday to oppose Kavanaugh's nomination \"with everything I have,\" saying that Trump had \"has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block.\" \"If Americans believe in a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, and that health insurance companies shouldn't be able to charge people more based on pre-existing conditions, now is the time to fight,\" Schumer said. \"Im calling on Americans from all walks of life to make their voices heard from now until the end of this battle.\" A senior White House source told Fox News that five Democratic senators \u2013 Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Doug Jones of Alabama, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 were invited to attend the nomination announcement. All five declined. Of the five, Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin voted to confirm Gorsuch last year -- and are up for re-election. Jones, who was elected to the Senate in a December 2017 special election after Gorsuch was confirmed, is not up for re-election until 2020. He told CNN on Sunday that he was \u201cnot an automatic, knee-jerk no\u201d on any of the potential nominees. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, seen as most likely among Republicans to consider voting against a Trump nomination, also declined invitations to attend.

            "article_content": "North Dakota Republican Senate candidate Kevin Cramer supports President Trump's trade policies. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer has defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Fox News projects. The GOP was able to flip the seat after Heitkamp voted against confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and came under fire for releasing an ad\u00a0revealing the names of sexual assault victims without their permission. Cramer\u00a0won the race by hitting her on both those issues, and on a\u00a0standard Republican platform\u00a0of supporting tough immigration laws, lower taxes, gun rights, pro-life policies, and deregulation. Polling indicated a close race for some time, but Heitkamp fell behind amid the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process, when she ultimately voted against him. She also came under fire due to a campaign ad that released names of alleged sexual assault victims without their permission. Polling indicated the Kavanaugh controversy made a difference in deep red North Dakota, a state that President Trump won by 35 points.\u00a0A Fox News poll\u00a0taken days before Kavanaugh's confirmation vote found 34 percent of North Dakotans said they would be less likely to vote for Heitkamp if she voted against Kavanaugh, with just 17 percent saying it would make them more likely to vote for her. The Kavanaugh situation was followed by a scandal\u00a0in which Heitkamp's campaign released an ad listing the names of alleged sexual assault victims, some of whom said they had not given permission to release their names. Others said they had never been assaulted.\u00a0Heitkamp's campaign apologized, saying the release of names was a \"mistake\". Heitkamp also came under fire recently for endorsing an ad that claimed that North Dakotans with out-of-state hunting licenses could lose those licenses if they vote. Heitkamp claimed it was true, but Politifact called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota\u2019s neighboring states, and found it to be false. Politifact rated the claim as \u201cpants on fire\u201d and concluded that \u201cit\u2019s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting.\u201d By Election Day, the result was\u00a0not\u00a0a surprise. Both the latest Fox News poll and the RealClearPolitics average of polls showed\u00a0Cramer leading\u00a0Heitkamp by\u00a0nine points going into the election. Heitkamp was known in the Senate as someone who was sometimes willing to cross the aisle. She voted for a banking deregulation bill, along with 16 other Democrats and 50 Republicans, that aimed to reduce regulations on community banks. While\u00a0Heitkamp voted against Kavanaugh, she voted to confirm Trump's other Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, telling CNBC, \"would he be the judge I'd pick? No, never... But he is the judge that the duly elected president picked.\" But on big issues like tax cuts and repealing ObamaCare, Heitkamp stood with her party. She voted for bills that included funding President Trump's proposed border wall, but she also went against defunding sanctuary cities. President Trump campaigned for Kevin Cramer in June, holding a rally in Fargo, North Dakota. In October, the President also chimed in on Twitter:\u00a0\"Watched North Dakota\u2019s Rep. Kevin Cramer easily win debate with Senator Heidi Heitkamp.

            "article_content": "Judge Napolitano's Chambers: Judge Andrew Napolitano explains how a rush to judgement and a rush to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh is unfair to all parties involved, including the accusers, accused, Senate and United States Constitution. Until two weeks ago, President Donald Trump's nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court seemed a sure thing. He ably handled more than 1,200 questions put to him by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He demonstrated even to his adversaries a masterful command of constitutional jurisprudence. The FBI had completed six background investigations of Kavanaugh throughout his career in government, and it found no blemishes. Trump promised that he would appoint federal judges and justices who generally share his views on life, guns and administrative regulations and who have a minimalistic view of federal power. When he announced the Kavanaugh nomination, it appeared he had found his man. The nomination requires Senate confirmation by a majority vote. The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. A few Republican senators do not share the president's stated views on the judiciary, and a few Democrats do. The inside consensus was that enough Democratic senators running for re-election in states that Trump carried in 2016 would vote to confirm Kavanaugh and those Democrats would handily offset the few Republicans who might oppose him. During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dutifully followed the pattern of all current sitting justices at their confirmation hearings by declining to answer hypothetical questions which sought answers as to how he might vote on certain issues likely to come before the court. He survived the grueling cross-examination by Committee Democrats and even won begrudging praise from a few. Then, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, dropped a bombshell. She revealed that a constituent who wished to remain anonymous had written a letter to a member of the House of Representatives, who had turned the letter over to Feinstein. The letter contained allegations by the writer, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, that Kavanaugh had drunkenly attempted sexual assault against her 36 years ago. Feinstein had the letter for two months before she revealed its existence\u00a0\u2013 a week after the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings had ended. This is reminiscent of allegations leveled by Professor Anita Hill against then-Judge Clarence Thomas, though those allegations were of inappropriate words in the workplace and the Ford allegations are of force and violence in a bedroom. When Hill\u2019s allegations were published, President George H.W. Bush dispatched the FBI to resume its background investigation of Thomas, and it did so. Trump has declined to dispatch the FBI to investigate Ford\u2019s allegations, and other allegations that have now followed hers, because he and Senate Republicans are determined to seat Kavanaugh by next week. In the absence of an FBI investigation, Ford gave an interview to The Washington Post in which she aired her complaints in graphic detail, despite missing facts and fuzzy recollections. Democrats demanded that the Judiciary Committee hear from her and again from Kavanaugh. They appear to be assuming that Kavanaugh should not enjoy the American presumption of innocence and \u2013without hearing a word from Ford or seeing any corroborating evidence \u2013 have concluded that Kavanaugh must be guilty of this alleged offense and thus cannot be confirmed. Then the folks in the White House who are managing the Kavanaugh nomination advised him to violate Criminal Procedure 101: Don't deny publicly an allegation before it has credibly and publicly been made. So, Kavanaugh was interviewed by my Fox News colleague Martha MacCallum. Her questions were far better than his answers. His answers to the allegations contained in a newspaper story were three-fold\u00a0\u2013 he didn't do it, he wants a fair process and \u2013unthinkably\u00a0\u2013 he was a virgin during his high school and college years. I say \"unthinkably\" not because virginity is beyond belief but because this claim was not in response to any of MacCallum's questions and it bore so deeply into Kavanaugh\u2019s personhood as to be none of the public's business. And it is not a defense to the Ford allegations. What's going on here? What's going on is crisis and panic. The pro-choice Democrats are in crisis: They are so fearful of a decisive vote to limit the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence that they are willing to destroy a qualified judge's career to block his advancement. And Kavanaugh's handlers, who, at this writing, probably lack the votes for confirmation, have recklessly put him on the offensive, even if it is debasing and invasive. Now we await a potentially tragic confrontation on national television between Ford and Kavanaugh, which will come down to perception rather than reality. The issue is not whether he did it. Rather, it is whether his denials are more believable than her allegations. At the end of their Judiciary Committee confrontation, will the general public perception be that Ford was more credible or that Kavanaugh was more credible? There are no rules here. Ford has no legal obligation to prove her allegations, and Kavanaugh has no legal obligation to disprove them. A tie\u00a0\u2013 the public perception that Ford and Kavanaugh are equally credible\u00a0\u2013 will be very troublesome for Kavanaugh. No woman would go through what Ford is going through if she lacked a personal commitment to the truth. So Kavanaugh can only win if Dr. Christine Ford is generally disbelieved. The Kavanaugh nomination was supposed to be Trump's gift to his pro-life, conservative, evangelical base. It has become anything but that. If Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, will he ever lose the taint of these allegations? If he is not confirmed, can he return to the second-highest court in the land, on which he now sits? Is this how the framers expected the selection process for the Supreme Court to play out? In a word: No.",

            "article_content": "President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The confirmation hearing was derailed just seconds into the meeting. Here\u2019s a look at some of the fiery exchanges. Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday vowed to be \u201ca neutral and impartial arbiter\u201d if confirmed to the Supreme Court, after a chaotic first day of hearings on Capitol Hill amid political theatrics and protests from Democrats. \u201cIf confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI will do equal right to the poor and to the rich. I will always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.\u201d Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings started Tuesday and are set to continue through the week. Before he spoke, Kavanaugh was introduced by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman and attorney Lisa Blatt \u2013 a liberal Democrat who said she voted for Hillary Clinton for president but supports Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. Democrats, in their opening remarks Tuesday, sounded the alarm about Kavanaugh\u2019s past work in Republican politics, including as a lawyer in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. But Kavanaugh said Tuesday, \u201cI don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, protests from Democratic lawmakers and demonstrators delayed the formal start of proceedings by more than an hour. Within moments of Tuesday's confirmation hearing kickoff, top Democrats tried to sideline the session with a rapid-fire string of objections concerning access to the nominee's records. The spectacle underscored the political nature of the confirmation hearings, coming two months before the midterms and as some senators gear up for a possible 2020 presidential run against President Trump. Several of those senators led the charge Tuesday in objecting to Kavanaugh. When Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley first tried to deliver opening remarks, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris raised objections to the committee just receiving a batch of 42,000 documents relating to the nominee's work with past administrations. \u201cWe cannot possibly move forward,\" Harris, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, said. Grassley told her she was \"out of order,\" but other Democrats chimed in to back up Harris, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who moved to adjourn. This prompted applause from some in the audience, and touched off protests and shouting. Then, after New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker added his voice complaining of a \"rush,\" Grassley countered: \u201cI think you are taking advantage of my decency and my integrity.\u201d The chaos led Republican Sen. John Cornyn to remark, \"This is the first confirmation hearing subject to mob rule.\" The Texas senator suggested Democrats would be \u201cheld in contempt of court\u201d if they behaved that way in a court of law. More than an hour and 15 minutes after the hearing began, Grassley moved past Democratic attempts to delay and finally delivered his opening statement, over the sustained shouts of protesters who were being escorted out of the room. \"Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees \u2013 if not the most qualified nominee \u2013 I have seen,\" Grassley said. The disruptions continued as lawmakers attempted to make opening statements. There were 63 interruptions before the break for lunch. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch struggled to deliver his prepared remarks, as protesters audibly shouted over him. \u201cI think we ought\u00a0to have this loudmouth removed,\" a frustrated Hatch said. \"We shouldn't have to put up\u00a0with this kind of stuff.\" Grassley acknowledged it was one of the most unruly openings of any Supreme Court hearing, saying \"this is something I've never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations.\" The Capitol Police said they arrested 70 people on Tuesday. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin defended the outbursts. \u201cWhat we've heard is the noise of democracy,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThis is what happens in a free country when people can stand up and speak and not be jailed, imprisoned, tortured or killed because of it.\u201d Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. Booker, another possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, acknowledged he already decided to vote against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. But he pleaded to delay the vote until more documents are released. \u201cWe should not vote now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe should wait.\u00a0And if we're not waiting, we\u00a0should object to your\u00a0nomination.\u201d Democrats have seen thousands of those documents, but say they want time to review and seek more. \u201cIf you will trust the American people, they will trust you,\" Durbin told Kavanaugh. \"But if your effort today continues to conceal and hide documents, it raises a suspicion.\u201d Democrats have specifically raised objections over how the Senate received 42,000 pages of Kavanaugh documents the night before the confirmation hearing began. \u201cThis is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,\u201d Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy said. KAVANAUGH HEARINGS LAUNCH AMID PARTISAN FIREWORKS Grassley, in a written statement submitted for the record, on Tuesday accused Democrats of trying to \u201cbury this committee in millions of pages of irrelevant paperwork.\u201d He called out California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s ranking member, for wanting to search the emails of every Bush White House aide for Kavanaugh documents. \u201cThis would have taken months and months to complete,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAs I have repeatedly stated, I am not going to put the American taxpayers on the hook for the Democratic leaders\u2019 fishing expedition.\u201d As the hearing kicked off, Democrats zeroed in on the controversy over the production of documents from Kavanaugh\u2019s past work. But as the hearing went on, the Democrats began emphasizing their concern over how Kavanaugh would rule on cases involving abortion and guns. \u201cYou are being nominated for a\u00a0pivotal seat,\" Feinstein said. \"It would likely be the deciding\u00a0vote on fundamental issues.\u201d Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told Kavanaugh the NRA \u201chas poured millions into\u00a0your confirmation,\u201d saying they \u201cclearly have big\u00a0expectations on how you will\u00a0vote on guns.\u201d He also expressed fear that Kavanaugh would rule to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling regarding abortion. \u201cDespite confirmation etiquette,\u00a0your own words make clear you\u00a0don't really believe Roe vs.\u00a0Wade is settled law, since the\u00a0court, as you said, can always\u00a0overrule its precedent,\u201d Whitehouse said. Republicans, though, argued Kavanaugh is highly qualified, saying Democrats aren\u2019t making a case that he doesn\u2019t have the experience to sit on the high court. \u201cIf it's not about his judicial\u00a0record, what is this fight\u00a0about?\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. \u201cI believe this fight is nothing\u00a0more and nothing less than an\u00a0attempt by our Democratic\u00a0colleagues to relitigate the\u00a02016 presidential election.\u201d Harris, the California Democratic senator, took issue with Kavanaugh\u2019s past work, saying has a history of carrying out \u201cdeeply\u00a0conservative partisan agendas.\u201d \u201cIf we look at his record on the\u00a0D.C. Circuit, and in his recent\u00a0writings and statements, it is\u00a0clear that the nominee has\u00a0brought his political bias to\u00a0the bench,\u201d Harris said. But Republicans argued some records sought by Democrats, from Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the White House, are irrelevant to how he'd serve as a justice. \u201cThe question before us today is\u00a0not what does Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0think 11 years ago on a policy\u00a0matter,\u201d Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said. \u201cThe question is whether\u00a0or not he has the temperament\u00a0and character to take his policy\u00a0views and political preferences\u00a0and put them in a box marked\u00a0irrelevant and set it aside\u00a0every morning when he puts on\u00a0the black robe.\u201d Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch. \u201cMy judicial philosophy is straightforward,\u201d Kavanaugh said Tuesday. \u201cA judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.\u201d The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee. Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is seated. While the hearing was ongoing, former Sen. Jon Kyl was named to that seat. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie. Republicans have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

Facebook on Monday evening said it identified about 30 accounts and 85 Instagram accounts flagged by law enforcement as having possible ties to foreign entities. The social media giant said in a statement that it became aware of accounts that may be \"engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior\" on Sunday evening. The accounts were blocked and a further investigation is underway. \u201cAlmost all the Facebook Pages associated with these accounts appear to be in the French or Russian languages, while the Instagram accounts seem to have mostly been in English \u2014 some were focused on celebrities, others political debate,\u201d the statement read. Facebook said its decision to release its preliminary findings stemmed from the fact that \"we are only one day away from important elections in the US.\" It was not immediately clear if the accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities, according to the statement. Democratic Senators called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week to address the apparent loopholes in the social media\u2019s political ad buying, which reportedly allows anyone to purchase an advertisement under any name \u2013 including prominent Senators like Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, according to reports from New York Times and Vice News. \"It is increasingly clear that major gaps exist in Facebook's efforts, potentially allowing adversaries to exploit your platform with continued disinformation efforts,\" the senators wrote in a letter Zuckerberg, PC Magazine\u00a0reported. The Times also noted authorized political ad buyers can virtually name whoever they want as to who sponsored the advertisement in the \"paid for by\" field. Facebook told PCmag that it is working to stop the potential misuse of its services. \"We're exploring additional checks to help prevent abuse and will respond to requests from law enforcement and election officials now and in the future if new requirements arise,\" director of product management Rob Leathern said in a statement to the outlet.",

            "article_content": "While My Faith Votes leans more conservative in rallying voters, Christian Democrats of America seeing increase since Trump election. PHOENIX \u2013 My Faith Votes, a group that is rallying evangelical voters, is passing out literature to college students, distributing videos in churches and promoting a model of \u201cThink, Pray and Vote\u201d via social media, churches and college campuses. Recently, the group even hosted a Facebook Live chat with Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson to talk about the midterms. It\u2019s all part of a $3.5 million effort to get evangelical voters from the pews to the polls on Election Day. Evangelicals are a key voting bloc but some believe they are becoming disenchanted by the political process and may stay home rather than vote on Tuesday for the midterms. \u201cWe projected that there would be potentially as many as 50 million Christians who\u2026would stay on the sideline,\u201d said Jason Yates, CEO of My Faith Votes, which says it is non-partisan. \u201cThat is an overwhelming number and a huge amount of influence. So, we\u2019re doing a number of things to really motivate and equip Christians to vote in these midterm elections.\u201d Yates said there are about 90 million evangelical Christians eligible to vote and between 25 million to 35 million who regularly don\u2019t. Dr. Donald Critchlow, an American political history professor at Arizona State University with a background in religious studies, said the evangelical vote is critical, particularly for Republicans in the primaries. \u201cEvangelical voters up until about 1980 on the national level, voted Democratic and then it began to swing Republican,\u201d Critchlow said. \u201cSo, the Democrats, as a whole, have lost the evangelical vote but I think it\u2019s critical for them. Republicans need to win the youth vote and they need to win the educated voter. For Democrats, they need to figure out a way of cutting into the white vote and a large part of that white vote is evangelical Christians.\u201d But, Christina Forrester, the founder of Christian Democrats of America, said Republicans have been losing ground with evangelical voters since President Trump was elected. She said at least 50,000 evangelical Republicans have switched to Democrat or independent since 2016. \u201cEvery day, we see someone on Twitter, on Facebook, on e-mail that e-mails me saying, \u2018I\u2019m now switching\u2014either switching parties or just simply becoming independent and voting for Democrats this round\u2019 because they just can\u2019t reconcile Trump and their Christian values any longer,\u201d Forrester said. \u201cSo, I think from the midterms and on, we\u2019re going to see this as a very, very important bloc that\u2019s potentially changing the landscape.\u201d While 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016, a Fox News Poll showed Trump\u2019s approval rating among white evangelicals was 74 percent as of\u00a0October 17. One of Christian Democrats of America's T-shirts reads \"Christians Against Trump\" (Fox News) Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, the honorary national chairman of My Faith Votes, said Republicans fight for social conservative issues for Bible-believing Christians, including pro-life and same-sex marriage. He said without the evangelical vote, there\u2019s \u201cno chance whatsoever\u201d that Republicans will keep the House and Senate. That\u2019s why, he said, it is important they go out and vote. \u201cPresident Trump won largely because of the evangelical vote,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cWithout it, he would not have been president. He understands that. It\u2019s one of the reasons that he's been so responsive to the evangelical community because he recognizes that there was no particular demographic that was more supportive unilaterally for him than were the evangelicals.\u201d Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson called this election \u201cthe most important one I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been on earth.\u201d (My Faith Votes) That is why there is a concerted effort to make sure evangelical voters head out to the polls on Election Day. \u201cRegardless of party\u2026every Christian is coming from a different background, a different experience, so they are not all going to vote the same way,\u201d Yates said, \u201c\u2026but if every Christian is taking that approach (pray, think, vote) I know we can trust God for the outcomes.\u201d",

A Senate-candidate, backed by President Donald Trump, is facing a million-dollar lawsuit, for what his opponent calls \u201cdefamatory statements.\u201d Congressman Jim\u00a0Renacci, R-Ohio,\u00a0is hoping to win the state\u2019s Republican primary on Tuesday and face off against incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown in November. Political analysts say\u00a0Renacci\u00a0is favored to win the primary. If he does, he may also need to fight off a lawsuit \u2013 from one of his Republican opponents,\u00a0investment\u00a0banker and businessman Mike Gibbons. \u201cMr. Gibbons has decided to do something that\u2019s kind of unusual in\u00a0politics, but it is what it is,\u201d\u00a0Renacci\u00a0said. \u201cMy big concern is really the people of Ohio and making sure that we move forward and get the right message out.\u201d When asked if there is any validity to the lawsuit,\u00a0Renacci told\u00a0Fox News: \u201cI\u2019ve\u00a0never been in politics, until seven\u00a0years ago,\u00a0and I learned people can say anything about you. I\u2019ve had that done to me in three elections in the past. In the end,\u00a0you just\u00a0gotta\u00a0have tough skin and move forward. I think he\u2019ll have to learn that\u00a0in the future.\u201d According to court documents, Gibbons filed the lawsuit last Thursday, May 4.

            "article_content": "Democratic Senate candidates Jacky Rosen, left, and Kyrsten Sinema are among those enjoying a windfall of outside donations. Democrats are outraising Republicans in this year's tight Senate races. Their secret: out-of-state donors. The cash flood underscores how key races have become nationalized \u2013 influenced not only by President Trump or Nancy Pelosi, but by big political investments from well-heeled donors in Manhattan and Silicon Valley. In Nevada, the numbers are most stark: While Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller has raised more than twice as much money from Nevadans as Democratic rival Jacky Rosen, she more than made up for it outside the state. More than 85 percent\u00a0of Rosen\u2019s donations come from out-of-staters, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, compared with 59 percent for Heller. Thanks to the outside money, Rosen beats Heller in total fundraising by more than a million\u00a0dollars. The Heller campaign, in turn, has accused Rosen of being funded by liberal-state interests. \u201cJacky Rosen\u2019s campaign is fueled and propped up by millions of dollars from\u00a0California and New\u00a0York,\u201d campaign spokesman Keith Schipper told Fox News. \u201cShe is bought and paid for by the progressive elites who know they can count on her to be a reliable vote.\u201d According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Rosen's top-five donor zip codes are: Heller's top-five donation sources are: That doesn\u2019t include money from outside groups, which also favor the Democrat by $23 million to $15 million, according to The Campaign Finance Institute. Rosen\u2019s campaign did not respond to a call and email for comment. But campaign finance experts suggested the out-of-state donations merely speak to the significance of this year\u2019s midterms. \u201cIt's not about coastal elites. That's a caricature,\u201d Michael Malbin, director of The Campaign Finance Institute, told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s because donors all over country understand that control of the whole Senate chamber is at stake.\u201d Another big reason: The rise of a Democratic fundraising tool called \u201cActBlue,\u201d which facilitated more than $1 billion in donations to Democrats this election cycle. \u201cActBlue has created a vehicle that allows people to give even to candidates they know very little about. The GOP has not been able to create anything like that,\u201d Malbin said. The donations coming through ActBlue are often small-dollar donations. So Rosen gets a greater proportion of her funds from small donors than Heller does. Nevada is hardly the only place getting political money from all over the country. In every state rated a \u201ctoss up\u201d by the Fox News Senate Power Rankings, the Democrat received more donations, including more out-of-state donations. The five toss-up states are Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada. In all but one toss-up \u2013 Missouri \u2013 the Democrat also received more funding from outside groups, according to data from The Campaign Finance Institute. The groups range from the pro-choice Emily\u2019s List to Giffords PAC, a Bloomberg-funded group backing candidates that support gun control, to the NRA. All sources combined, Democrats have a money lead in Arizona, Indiana and Nevada (where the nominees are Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Donnelly and Rosen, respectively), but not in Missouri. In Florida, while Democrats have the edge in fundraising, Republican candidate and Gov. Rick Scott (a former businessman) put up $38 million of his own money to flip the tables. The fundraising trend goes beyond toss-up states. In Montana, more than twice as much money went toward Democratic Sen. Jon Tester than his Republican rival Matt Rosendale. The state is currently ranked as lean Democrat. In Texas, more money went to Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke than Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, even as Cruz leads in the polls. Tennessee is the odd state out, as the money slightly favors Republican Marsha Blackburn. She also leads in the polls. Some who study the political process say out-of-state contributions are understandable. \u201cI'm a big proponent of allowing this money to flow across borders,\u201d Mark Crain, an economics professor at Lafayette College, told Fox News. \u201cThe politician that has the biggest influence on your life is probably not the politician elected in your district.\u201d Asked if local voters might see that as outsiders trying to meddle, Crain said politicians would need to weigh that problem and could even reject the money. Fundraising does not always determine winners. In 2016, the Clinton campaign and outside supporters\u00a0out-raised Trump\u2019s campaign and backers by nearly 2-to-1, yet lost. In Nevada, Heller\u2019s campaign spokesman says he\u2019s confident outside money won\u2019t sway the election. \u201cThe amount of money they are pouring in to buy this U.S. Senate seat is unprecedented,\u201d Schipper said. \u201cBut make no mistake, this is Nevada\u2019s seat and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d The author, Maxim Lott, is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.

            "article_content": "Rep. Nancy Pelosi speaks to activists about the Supreme Court confirmation debate over Brett Kavanaugh. Speaking in front of throngs of spirited far-left protesters at a\u00a0rally at the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans supporting court\u00a0nominee Brett Kavanaugh of being \"cowardly, patriarchal people\" who want to \"undo the 'Me Too' movement.\" The 78-year-old\u00a0California Democrat told demonstrators that women should be believed by \"default,\" and charged that the Senate GOP \"hid\"\u00a0from interviewing Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has made an uncorroborated claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago. Judiciary Committee Republicans made numerous outreach efforts to Ford, who claimed that her fear of flying prevented her from promptly traveling to Washington, D.C., and testified she had not understood investigators' repeated, public offers to fly out to meet her in California.\u00a0(In a letter obtained by Fox News, Ford's ex-boyfriend contradicted Ford's testimony and said she seemingly had no fear of flying when they dated for several years.) Pelosi then appeared to\u00a0compare\u00a0Kavanaugh, who stands accused of uncorroborated sexual misconduct dating back more than three decades,\u00a0to some of the country's biggest geopolitical adversaries. Referencing\u00a0President Trump: Pelosi said, \"I guess there's a similarity that people have with the people that they respect. [Trump] is crazy about\u00a0[Vladimir] Putin, in love with Kim Jong Un, and thinks Kavanaugh is a great, outstanding person. Well, you know what? He\u00a0doesn't even know what he is talking about.\" Protesters, many holding \"Kava-NOPE\" signs, applauded fervently. Pelosi had vowed, even before Kavanaugh's nomination to the high court,\u00a0that she would \"avenge Obama\" in a fiery fundraising email,\u00a0referencing his failed nomination of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland in 2016. In recent days, she has floated the idea of impeaching Kavanaugh if he is ultimately seated on the Supreme Court. That extraordinary measure would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Fox News has confirmed the FBI will\u00a0provide the results of its supplemental background check into Kavanaugh to senators and certain aides on Thursday morning, but top Democrats have preemptively criticized the agency's review, saying it was too hasty and improperly influenced by the White House. Trump has said the FBI could interview \"whoever\" it wants as part of the probe. CHRISTINE FORD'S EX-BOYFRIEND DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS HER TESTIMONY UNDER OATH ON KEY ISSUES \"The default of truth is\u00a0to the woman,\" Pelosi said.\u00a0\"But that doesn't mean we don't believe in due process. We believe in due process. That is our strength.\" Then, she added, \"If Judge Kavanaugh has nothing to hide, he should not fear an FBI investigation.\" Kavanaugh testifed\u00a0he would\u00a0endorse whatever measures the Judiciary Committee decided on, although he voiced concern that further delays in the confirmation process would expose his family to continued threats and spurious allegations. SWETNICK EX-BOYFRIEND SAYS SHE THREATENED TO KILL HIS UNBORN CHILD, WAS 'EXAGGERATING EVERYTHING' \"The default of truth is\u00a0to the woman.\" Pelosi added: \"The only person who doesn't\u00a0\u00a0have to be vetted is the president of the United States, and it's pretty clear he could not withstand a vetting.\" The progressive\u00a0group NARAL Pro-Choice America -- which has offered abortion-themed \"Rocky Roe v. Wade\" ice cream to \"help defend reproductive freedom\" -- organized the event in front of the Supreme Court on Wednesday. In July, NARAL objected to Kavanaugh's first name and previewed the current line of attack that the nominee drank too much in his college and high school years. \u201cWe'll be DAMNED if we're going to let five MEN \u2014 including some frat boy named Brett \u2014 strip us of our hard-won bodily autonomy and reproductive rights,\u201d the organization said in a tweet at the time.",

            "article_content": "The president discusses Justice Kennedy's retirement and the process of finding a replacement during a rally in Fargo, North Dakota. In the wake of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement, announced Wednesday, three big questions loom: Who will President Trump nominate to replace Kennedy? Will the Senate confirm the nominee? How will the confirmation fight affect the November midterm elections? Much is at stake because everyone on President Trump\u2019s longstanding list of potential Supreme Court nominees would likely be a more conservative justice than Kennedy \u2013 that is, more inclined to take an originalist or textualist approach to interpreting the Constitution. The new justice the president appoints could help create the first genuine conservative majority on the Supreme Court since the 1930s, with huge consequences for abortion, LGBT rights, voting rights, religious liberty, racial preferences, the death penalty and other issues. Yet no one should take such a shift to the right in the Supreme Court for granted. For more than 60 years, Republican Supreme Court appointees have often disappointed conservatives once they joined the court. Kennedy, Justice David Souter and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts are the most recent examples. President Trump will need a surgeon's precision in selecting a nominee. GOP presidents understandably seek to pick someone who has not made the sort of controversial decisions or remarks that Democrats typically use to try to block confirmation. However, this approach carries the risk of selecting a nominee who may be overly cautious or too politically correct and will thus wind up disappointing conservatives. More than a dozen years of closely observing the Supreme Court nomination and selection process has taught me that the best way to avoid such disappointment is to choose a nominee with a consistent record of following the law wherever it leads, indicating that the person will decide cases on the Supreme Court without worrying about how his or her New York Times obituary will read. But no matter who President Trump nominates, Senate Democrats and their allies will fight the nominee with a scorched earth policy. History, the importance of Kennedy's seat, and a political atmosphere in which even rank and file Trump supporters are called Nazis or otherwise demonized tells you all you need to know. The best that President Trump's pick can hope for is that Democrats will be unable to resist using the confirmation process to attack the president, leaving less time to go after the nominee. With the demise of the judicial filibuster, the cooperation of Senate Democrats is no longer necessary to confirm a nominee. However, there are only 50 GOP senators after subtracting the ailing John McCain, who is battling brain cancer and absent from the Senate. Consequently, the all-Republican route requires keeping GOP senators completely unified. That won't be easy. Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska may stray if the nominee has a strong pro-life record. \"I view Roe v. Wade as \u2026 precedent and I always look for judges who respect precedent,\" Collins said Wednesday, referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that said women have a constitutional right to abortion. Republican Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake or Arizona could be an even bigger problem when it comes to voting for the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee if their TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) flares up at the wrong time. Both senators have criticized President Trump on a variety of issues and neither is seeking re-election. But don't underestimate the remarkable leadership skills of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., when Supreme Court vacancies arise. McConnell kept GOP senators united around both keeping Justice Antonin Scalia's seat open in 2016 after his death, and changing Senate rules to require only a simple majority to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch and future nominees to the Supreme Court. \u201cOur Republican colleagues in the Senate should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a Supreme Court nominee in an election year,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday. Many of his Democratic colleagues agreed. Good luck, Sen. Schumer. The \"rule\" applies only to presidential election years and it succeeded in 2016 only because Republicans controlled the Senate. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, sized things up correctly Wednesday when he said: \u201cThere are things (Democrats) can do to drag this out, but I think they\u2019re fairly limited.\" That's just as well because Senate Democrats won't benefit from obstructing President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Even Democratic leaders have acknowledged that they need to expand their party's message beyond simply obstructing everything President Trump tries to do if they are to do well in November. Moreover, it makes no sense to prolong the public focus on an issue that traditionally has worked in Republicans' favor. Exit polls show that among voters for whom Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor in the 2016 presidential election, a decisive majority voted for Donald Trump. The issue both unifies the disparate factions of the GOP and drives its base to the voting booth. All the more so this year, when GOP voters were wondering if their votes for a Republican Congress had really mattered, and Republican politicians were worrying about a voter enthusiasm gap. In contrast, Democrats gain little from the passion of a confirmation battle. Their Trump-hating base is already mobilized to oppose President Trump for a long list of reasons. A Supreme Court vacancy won't make much difference. Moreover, a confirmation battle puts Democratic senators in red states \u2013 especially those facing elections this year \u2013 in a difficult position. Voting for President Trump's nominee makes political sense in states that voted for him overwhelmingly \u2013 but a \u201cyes\u201d vote would make the Democratic base extraordinarily angry. Expect Senate Democrats to put on a fierce show for their base this summer, while secretly heaving a sigh of relief when a nominee is confirmed in time for Democrats to avoid explaining an empty seat when the high court's next term rolls around Oct. 1. That won't erase the advantage Republicans gain from this vacancy, but it can limit the damage. You can't blame Democrats for being upset about Justice Kennedy's retirement. It will not only cost them the decisive vote on some of the most important social issues decided by the Supreme Court, but it will likely also cost them any real chance of capturing the House or Senate in November.",

This is a rush transcript from \"Fox News Sunday,\" September 9, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. President Trump calls on the Justice Department to investigate who wrote that essay in the New York Times describing resistance inside his administration. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once. WALLACE: This hour, we'll discuss the 1-2 punch of the anonymous column. Should all top officials take a lie detector test and would you agree to take one? And reports of White House disarray and Bob Woodward's new work. What does it mean for the future of the Trump administration? We'll ask the vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. Then, Judge Brett Kavanaugh faces of grilling by Democrats at his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: There are many concerns about the future of the democracy and the future of democracy. And you are asking for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. WALLACE: We'll ask Democratic Senator Chris Coons of his party can block Kavanaugh. Plus, Barack Obama steps back into the political arena and unloads on President Trump. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years. TRUMP: I watched it but I fell asleep. WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel how the Obama-Trump face-off will shape the midterm election. All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. Any concerns President Trump has had about leaks and disloyalty inside his administration were confirmed this week by that anonymous column in the New York Times and Bob Woodward's new book. Top officials openly admit they work against presidential directives they consider dangerous. And add to that, Barack Obama back in the political spotlight hammering President Trump in the run-up to the midterm elections. On Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence invited us to his residence on Embassy Row in Washington to push back against stories of an administration in disarray. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\" MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: thank you, Chris. WALLACE: Let's start with Barack Obama's return to the campaign trail, accusing President Trump of practicing the politics of fear and resentment. Your reaction? PENCE: Well, it was very disappointing to see President Obama break with the tradition of former presidents and become so political and roll out same tired arguments that he and liberals have made over the last eight years. The truth is the American people in 2016 rejected the policy and direction of Barack Obama when they elected President Donald Trump. Look, we inherited an economy that has grown a little bit more than 1 percent. In the last quarter our economy is growing at 4.2 percent. Four million new jobs. Unemployment at a 50 year low. And to have President Obama come out and tout his policies that resulted in less than 2 percent growth, saw tax increases, Obamacare regulation and doubling the national debt, I think was -- it was very disappointing but frankly I think it just illuminates the choice the American people had in the midterm elections. WALLACE: Let's look, though, at some of President Obama specific charges. He talks about actions like the president calling on the Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate who wrote that anonymous article in the New York Times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: This should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish her political opponents. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: What are the national security grounds to investigate that article? What law did the writer break? PENCE: Well, we'll find out if there was criminal activity involved, if something will be inappropriate -- WALLACE: What criminal activity could there be. There was no classified information. PENCE: Well, we'll see. I think the president's concern is that this individual may have responsibilities in the area of national security. And if they have no published anonymous editorial that says that they are misrepresenting themselves, that they are essentially living a lie within this administration, and trying to frustrate and subvert the agenda of the president was elected to advance, that's an important issue. WALLACE: Political disloyalty, it certainly troubling. It's not illegal. PENCE: Well, but there's another part of it though. You know, every senior official in any administration takes an oath to the Constitution. The Constitution of the United States vests all executive power in the president of the United States. To have an individual who took that oath, literally say that they work every day to frustrate the president advancing the agenda was elected to advance is undemocratic. It's not just deceitful, but it's really an assault on our democracy and that person should do the honorable thing, step forward and resign. WALLACE: I want to get into the question as to whether they are trying to thwart the will of the president in the moment. But I want to look at -- because President Obama mentioned this as well. The president's tweet earlier this week basically chastising, rebuking Attorney General Sessions for bringing the prosecution on charges of corruption against tow GOP House members. The president tweeted: Two very popular Republican congressmen were brought to a well-publicized charge just ahead of the midterms by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job, Jeff. The president is saying, play politics. Protect members of Congress even if they have committed acts of corruption before the election. PENCE: No, I don't think that's what the president was saying at all, Chris. Look, the Department of Justice, as you know, has long-standing guidelines through the success of the administration that says whenever possible, the Justice Department should avoid taking actions that may impact an election. Now, the president was referring to that and the difficulty -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: These are two people, one supposedly committing an insider trading and the other one who was living high off campaign funds. Are you saying that they should be protected because we are close to a midterms? PENCE: They are all very serious allegations and they ought to be pursued, but I think the president was referring to the long-standing tradition in the Justice Department to avoid unnecessarily impacting election outcomes and perhaps preventing other men and women from stepping forward and filling those slots in the future. But, look, I think one of the virtues of this president, one of the reasons why we've been so successful over the last 18 months is because he speaks directly to the American people. You don't have to wonder what President Trump is thinking almost on any given morning because he tells the American people what's on his mind. And it's that energy -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: -- doesn't mean it isn't troubling. PENCE: Well -- WALLACE: When he says -- I mean, again, just forgive me, sir. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time, good job, Jeff. Should the attorney general be worried about that? PENCE: I think -- look, this is a president that was elected by speaking directly to the American people and being candid with the American people in expressing what he's enthusiastic about, what he's frustrated about and the American people understand that. WALLACE: This gets to the theme of both the anonymous article and also Bob Woodward's book, that some officials within this administration, within this White House feel that they have to act in effect as guardrails to protect against some of the president's more impulsive actions. Case in point, first story in Woodward's book, September of 2017, Gary Cohn, the chief economic advisor, walks into the Oval Office and sees a letter on the president's desk that would blow up the South Korean free-trade deal and jeopardize one of our most important alliances and he takes it away so the president won't sign it. Do have any doubt that happened? PENCE: I have every doubt that that happened. I really do. And the president renegotiated the South Korean free trade agreement in a way that put American jobs and American workers first. But, look, I -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: If I may just stay on this point for one minute because Bob Woodward didn't just quote somebody. He has the document here. This is the letter that he took off the president's desk mark September 2017 in which the president if he had signed it would have terminated the South Korean trade deal. This isn't just talk. He's got the goods here. PENCE: This is a president who puts people around the table, around the resolute desk in the oval office that bring him all of the options. They put on the table everything that he could be doing. He invites a vigorous debate around the desk and then he makes a decision. That's how it really does work. And I have to tell you, this entire narrative that I get from what I've read about the book that came out in the narrative in the rhetorical is totally foreign to me. And when the president and I are both in town -- (CROSSTALK) PENCE: Chris, I spend about four hours a day with the president and we are both in Washington, D.C., every day. In and what I see is a tough leader, a demanding leader, someone who gets all the options on the table, but he makes the decisions and that's why we've made the progress. WALLACE: But here's what anonymous sees. He writes in that article in the New York Times: That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office. Woodward describes what he calls our nervous breakdown inside the Trump administration. PENCE: It's absolutely absurd. And I have to tell you, I'd be honest with you, Chris. Sometimes I watch a little bit of TV in the morning and then I go to the White House and I feel like I'm in a parallel universe. I walk into a White House where there is a president behind the desk, he is in command, he is constantly driving forward on delivering on the promises that we made to the American people and then I go home at night and I see cable TV talking about all of this stuff about disarray in the White House and it's just not my experience. I mean -- but I tell people, look at the results. You look at the passage of historic tax cuts for businesses and individuals and the way that jobs are coming back and investment is coming back. The renegotiation of trade deals. Our allies contributing more to our common defense. All of that is happening because we have a president of almost boundless energy who comes in every day, regardless of what's happening in the Washington media culture and says what are we doing today to deliver for the American people and I think that's why I see such enthusiasm as I travel across the country and that's why I believe the American people are going to vote reelect Republican majorities in the house and Senate this fall. WALLACE: Do you think you know who anonymous is? PENCE: I don't. I don't know, but I do know that they should resign and leave this administration. WALLACE: Should all top officials take a lie detector test and would you agree to take when? PENCE: I would agree to take it in a heartbeat and would submit to any review the administration wanted to do. WALLACE: Do you think the administration should do that? PENCE: Well, look, that would be a decision for the president. But, look, I think the honorable thing to do here is for this individual to recognize that they are literally violating an oath. If they are that senior administration official, that they are violating an oath not to the president, but to the Constitution. WALLACE: Treason? PENCE: Look, it's un-American and I think that's why using Republicans and Democrats condemn this. The American people vote for a president. They fully expect the president to be able to surround themselves with men and women who will work with them in advancing their agenda. But to have someone who literally celebrates coming in every day to frustrate the agenda that the president and I were elected to advance, it really is an assault on our democracy and it should be universally condemned. WALLACE: One of the more unusual words in the essay is \"lodestar:, which it turns out, people have looked, is a word that you have used many times. PENCE: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENCE: Must again be our lodestar. With vigilance and resolve as our lodestar. It really was the lodestar. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Do you think someone purposely put that in the essay to try to set you up? PENCE: Yes, I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. And I really do believe whether it's the book, whether it's the anonymous editorial, whether it's President Obama's speech this week, it's all an effort to distract attention from this booming economy and from the president's record of success. And it's all very predictable. We have important midterm elections coming up. I get all of that, but I -- but the American people should know President Trump and I are going to remain absolutely determined to reelect this Republican Congress so we can continue to build on the momentum that's putting Americans back to work. WALLACE: What did you think of the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh? What did you think of some Democrats who decided to break the rules into release what were committee confidential documents, and how confident are you that Kavanaugh will be on the Supreme Court when it resumes in October? PENCE: Judge Brett Kavanaugh distinguished himself. Many Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee embarrassed themselves. That's the truth of it. WALLACE: And? PENCE: What the American people saw in Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a jurist just like President Trump promised to appoint, someone of profound intellect. A judicial philosophy to interpret the laws of this country as written, interpret the constitution as written. But they also saw what was at times a circus in that Judiciary Committee. People shouting behind them and histrionics in Judiciary Committee among Democrat members. You saw a judge with the temperament to make it through this 12-hour hearings with such dignity. And we had every confidence that before the Supreme Court convenes in October, Judge Brett Kavanaugh will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh. WALLACE: Finally, Syria. The U.S. has warned Syria, Russia and Iran not to launch a final assault on Idlib province, home to more than 3 million people. They indicate that they intend to go ahead. Will the U.S. intervene militarily to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe there? PENCE: We are watching it very closely and we have made it very clear to the regime in Syria, to Russia and Iran that the United States and our allies will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against civilians in that province. There will be swift -- WALLACE: Let's say it's not chemical weapons. Let's say it's barrel bombs, let's say it's conventional weapons, are we going to let hundreds of thousands of people die there, sir? PENCE: Well, we all know what happened in Aleppo. We're watching it all very closely. But what's different with President Trump from President Obama is this president drew a redline and enforced it on chemical weapons. President Obama drew a redline and said you can't use chemical weapons and then allowed Assad and Syria to go forward and victimize countless civilians. WALLACE: But, sir, dead is dead. I understand -- I take your point about the chemical weapons. PENCE: I want to make it very, very clear. There's a wider world watching, is that the United States of America and our allies will take swift and decisive action against any use of chemical weapons in Idlib province. Beyond that, I will tell you that we are watching very carefully as resources are being marshaled along the border of the Idlib province. And I'm confident there will be a decision by the president of the United States, but I'm confident that we will be monitoring that very, very carefully to ensure that we don't see another humanitarian catastrophe like we did before. WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, thank you, sir. PENCE: Thank you, Chris. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: But even as the vice president and I were speaking, Syrian and Russian warplanes bombed the southern edge of Idlib province. When we come back, we'll hear from Democratic Senator Chris Coons. What about administration officials working to undercut their own president? Will Barack Obama help or hurt Democrats in November? And do Democrats do anything to slow down Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: This week, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett K, faced two days of grilling by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, but did they do anything to slow down his confirmation to the court before it starts its new session in October? Joining us now, Senator Chris Coons, a leading member of that committee. Senator, I'll get to that in a moment but I want to start, you just heard my interview with Vice President Pence. Your reaction to his defense of President Trump against critics, some of those critics inside his own administration? SEN. CHRIS COONS, D-DELA., SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, what I heard the vice president say was that he was deeply disappointed and that he bought the critic within the administration who wrote the op-ed, the anonymous op-ed in the New York Times should resign. I agree with that position. I think the honorable thing to do is to resign and to go public with the author's concerns about the president's fitness to serve. WALLACE: And what about just the fact that between the anonymous essay and the Woodward book, you have so many top officials saying that they feel they have to act as a kind of guardrail against some of President Trump's impulsive actions? COONS: Well, that does raise a concern that I also made the focus of my questioning of Judge Kavanaugh, Chris. I focused on ways in which Judge Kavanaugh has written, has spoken, issued decisions that suggest he has a very broad view of presidential power. Given our current context, that could lead to a shield for President Trump from accountability by the special counsel's investigation and that's something that I tried to make the real focus of my questioning of Judge Kavanaugh. I think that ought to be a concern for everybody watching, Republican, Democratic, independent, because whether it's this administration or a future one, I think all of us have an interest in the rule of law and in a president who is not above the law. WALLACE: Well, I want to double down on that because I want to ask you about some comments by the president this week and I'm asking you as a moment member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the question of the rule of law. The president, as I pointed out to the Vice President Pence, chastised Attorney General Sessions for the prosecution of two Republican congressmen so close to the midterm election. And then there also was this comment from the president about investigating who wrote the anonymous article. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would think Jeff should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe it's national security. (END AUDIO CLIP) WALLACE: Question, Senator, is there any legal basis on the question of national security for a criminal investigation of who wrote that op-ed in the New York Times? COONS: Not that I'm aware of. I think you asked the vice president exactly the right question. What's the basis in law for investigating who wrote this editorial? Look, the real issue here across all of these concerns is that we have a president who, in his tweets, and in his statements and speeches suggests that he thinks the Department of Justice should act more like the in-house lawyer department or legal department to the Trump Organization rather than what they are, the independent agency charged with defending our Constitution. The independence of the Department of Justice and its prosecutorial decisions from presidential or political interference is one of the bedrocks of our democracy and the ways in which President Trump continues to harass and to tweet against Attorney General Sessions, as you just cited, this last week criticizing him for the investigation and the indictment of two close allies of the president should be very troubling to all of us. And the comments from senators, both the Republican and Democrat, that this is a very troubling, very inappropriate break with traditional norms by President Trump. WALLACE: But, Senator, let's look at the larger picture of this question that we saw this week from the book, from the essay, about resistance to the president inside his own administration. Donald Trump is the duly elected president of the United States. No one voted for Gary Cohn. No one voted for Defense Secretary Mattis and there are stories in the Woodward book of both of them ignoring, or in the case of Cohn, as I pointed out to the vice president, taking a letter that the president could have signed off his desk. Who are they to thwart the will of the duly elected president? COONS: Chris, that's right. This does raise some serious concerns. Every presidential administration has vigorous debates, disagreements on policy priorities, but this is a different sort of thing. This is folks who are alleged to have taken direct action to prevent the president from carrying out some of his worst instincts or worse decisions. And that should raise some concerns, particularly given the anonymous editorial in the New York Times. I will remind you that the writer of that editorial makes it clear that he supports the president's policy agenda, that he supports tax cuts and deregulation and building of the military and he self-describes as not part of the deep state, but the steady state, someone who's trying to keep this president on course and delivering on his policy agenda. But it does, as you say, Chris, raise troubling concerns. If we have a president so mercurial, so unable to stick to a decision within one day that his own senior aides think they are called upon as folks who have sworn to uphold the Constitution to prevent the president from carrying out some of his worse decisions. This really does concern me. WALLACE: I want to move to another development this week, and that is former President Obama returned to the campaign trail and took the opportunity to blister President Trump. Here's just one example. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He is just capitalizing resentments that politicians have been fanning for years. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Senator, is that smart politics for the November election? Yes, there's no question that Barack Obama is popular with and will fire up the Democratic base, but isn't there also a risk that he will fire up the Republican base? COONS: Well, Chris, my hope is that this election is going to be about the real needs and concerns of average Americans in districts and states across the country where there's going to be important elections to determine the future of our country. I do think that President Obama respected long-standing norms and how he handled the transition of power. I think he conducted himself graciously in the inauguration of President Trump and he has stayed completely on the sidelines for 18 months. From what I heard of President Obama, former President Obama's speech, his core message was that we need to do a better job of listening to each other, respecting each other and honoring our institutions and traditions and I think -- not to speak for him but I think former President Obama, because of the ways in which President Trump over the last 18 months has challenged, has broken some of our long-standing traditions about respect for the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the independent media, that he felt compelled to speak out at this point. WALLACE: Let's turn to your day job and to the Kavanaugh hearings. Some of your Democratic colleagues on the judiciary committee released documents that the committee had deemed confidential, and no one was more dramatic about it then your Democratic colleague, Senator Cory Booker. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-NJ, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I did willingly violate the chairs roll on the committee confidential process. I take full responsibility for violating that, sir. This is about the closest I will ever have in my life to an \"I am Spartacus\" moment. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But, Senator, Booker knew and you knew that when he made such a big fuss about releasing those documents, in fact the Judiciary Committee had already cleared those documents for release. So, wasn't this just a pretty blatant stunt? COONS: Chris, I have to be careful what I say here because I'm the vice chairman of the Ethics Committee and in that role I can't comment on anything that may or may not come before the Ethics Committee. Let me just say this about the whole dispute we had on the committee about documents. I do think that this was an unprecedented process in which significant amount, the overwhelming majority of the documents relevant to Judge Kavanaugh's service in the Bush administration as staff secretary were blocked from review by the committee. And there was a strong disagreement between the majority and the minority. WALLACE: But, Senator, that's not up to individual senator -- (CROSSTALK) COONS: Overall, I agree with that concern. WALLACE: But that's not up to individual senators to just unilateral -- I mean, otherwise, it's chaos. If the committee deemed something confidential rightly or wrongly, can individual senators say, no, I'm not going to play by those rules? COONS: I really can't comment to whether or not this was breaking the rules of the committee. WALLACE: I just have to ask you because you brought this up, is this a matter that the Ethics Committee is now considering, Cory Booker's behavior? COONS: I can't comment on that, Chris. WALLACE: Why not? COONS: The rules of the Ethics Committee prohibit any member of the committee on commenting on whether a matter is before the committee or not. WALLACE: So you cannot deny that this issue of what he did in releasing these documents is not before the committee? COONS: I can't comment on that, Chris. WALLACE: OK. I have a final question, and that is a general one about the Kavanaugh nomination. Does the president deserve deference from the Senate when he appoints -- he is elected, he won and he appoints someone to the Supreme Court who is clearly within the judicial mainstream? COONS: Well, Chris, as I said in a hearing, I've known Judge Kavanaugh for 30 years. And I know him to be an intelligent, decent, thoughtful person, good father, husband, neighbor. We heard a lot about what a good high school basketball coach he is and how he volunteers at a homeless shelter with his parish. All of those are admirable qualities. I am concerned, as I said before and as I made the focus of my questioning of Judge Kavanaugh, that he is well outside the judicial mainstream. That in a decision he rendered just this year, he refused to follow settled precedent and he made it clear that his views on executive power would lead to a dangerous rewriting of the core policies -- the core constitutional traditions and decisions of the court around presidential power. I'm going to take advantage of the opportunity today to send some questions for the record to Judge Kavanaugh. I'm going to continue to look over his writings, his speeches. But in the time that I was able to spend over four days with Judge Kavanaugh and with other witnesses in front of the committee, I remain gravely concerned that he's not inside the judicial mainstream on several really important precedents that, Chris, would have a real impact on individual rights and liberties of Americans and on presidential power. And I think Americans of all parties, particularly given our current context, should be concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's decisions on presidential power. WALLACE: Senator Coons, thank you. Thanks for your time. And we'll follow your committee's vote on the Kavanaugh nominations scheduled for 11 days from now. Thank you, sir. COONS: Thank you. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss those shocking stories of Trump appointees working against the president's directives when they think he's acting impulsively. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump pushes back on this week's damaging revelation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The so-called resistance is angry because their horrible ideas have been rejected by the American people and it's driving them crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about any lasting effect on the Trump administration. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once. I think their reporters should go and investigate who it is. Unelected deep state operatives who defy the voters to push their own secret agendas are truly a threat to democracy itself. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: President Trump at a campaign rally criticizing the anonymous senior official who wrote that New York Times op-ed as a danger to the nation's security. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Katie Pavlich from townhall.com. Columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams. Liz Marlantes, politics editor of The Christian Science Monitor. And Josh Holmes, Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and now a GOP strategist. So, Katie, where do you come down on the revelations, both from the anonymous essay and also from Bob Woodward's book, that there is a resistance inside the administration, people acting to thwart the president's directives and, overall, how damaging do you think this week has been to the president? KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, politically I don't think it was damaging at all. I think that people actually have look at this story and said it's more of palace intrigue. We don't know this person is. If they're not willing to put their name on it, then we're not going to necessarily be concerned with what they have to say. Inside the White House it is a huge distraction. However, when it comes to what this New York Times op-ed said, they said that they were trying to thwart the president's worst intentions or instincts. Well, define what that is because based on my conversations with White House officials and off the record conversations with President Trump himself, he actually likes to listen and invites debate from a number of advisors and then tends to make his own decision. So are his worst instincts simply something that these advisors disagree with? Define what that actually means. When it comes to the damage that's been done politically, again, I don't think that it's really going to have an impact. But inside the White House, certainly all of the suspicion, everyone looking over their shoulder, a number of offices and agencies coming out with their own op-ed saying it wasn't me, that certainly creates a hostile working environment that is not contingent to moving the president's agenda forward. WALLACE: Juan, is Bob Woodward right, is this presidency serving -- suffering a nervous breakdown? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: A nervous breakdown? I'm a journalist, like Woodward, and so here's what I see, Chris. I see a White House that cancels meetings in a flailing manner and then convenience to try to find this anonymous source within the White House. I see a president that issues are totally inappropriate call for the Department of Justice to somehow go after finding this anonymous person and I guess prosecuting them on the basis, and this is even stranger, of the national security violation simply for criticizing the president. That's totally inappropriate and wrong. I don't know what's going on in the president said. WALLACE: But what -- what about this -- this larger point, though, that Katie was talking about, that you have, according to Woodward's book, senior administration officials, Gary Cohen, national economic adviser, taking a document off the president's desk. The president tells Defense Secretary Mattis lets assassinate Assad after a chemical weapons attack and as soon as he gets off the call Mattis says, we're not going to do any of that. Is that -- is that insubordinate or is that responsible? WILLIAMS: I think it's responsible if the people inside, and here I would go along with what you heard from the vice president in her interview, as well as Senator Coons, which is that the person feels that they have to do this. Maybe they should come forward. They mention the 25th Amendment. But I must say, Woodward's book fits with what we've heard from Michael Wolff, what we've heard now from the anonymous columnist, what we heard from Omarosa. It all fits of a White House where there is an unstable president and you see a White House that's uncertain and at times easily pushed off target. And so at that point you start to wonder, what is going on in their? WALLACE: Josh? JOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY: Well, you know, I think a lot of this is overblown in terms of the amount of attention that we've -- the American people are far ahead of where the pundit class in D.C. is on evaluating where is president and where this administration is. I think there's not a lot of people sitting around suffering under the delusion that somehow the president is up all hours over his briefing books, right? That's not why they love him. WILLIAMS: No. HOLMES: Why they love him is because he goes with his gut, right? You either love him or you hate him. And the folks that hate President Trump see what Bob Woodward had -- had written and see this New York Times op-ed as more evidence of what they suspect is an administration run amok. For those who love them, you know, this is kind of what you voted for. You voted for somebody who's going to vote out -- or operate outside of the box. Now, we can now have our arguments about whether or not that's appropriate in these context, but, you know, taking a memo off the president's desk, some of us just call that staffing. PAVLICH: Right. WALLACE: Well, quite -- I think that -- as a former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, some of us are going to wonder about this. You may get a call from him. I want to pick up on -- because it wasn't just that. There were new controversies this week, Liz. The president sent out a tweet, I think it was on Monday, basically chastising the attorney general for the prosecution of two Republican congressman saying they -- these guys are running. It's the midterm. These are safe seats. Don't mess around with that. And then, as Juan points out, at the end of the week, say on a national security grounds, he's -- he thinks that Attorney General Sessions should investigate who wrote this. Does that help him or hurt him, those kinds of things? LIZ MARLANTES, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: I mean, again, to Josh's point, I think most voters now have an opinion. And this is going to either reconfirm the opinion they already have or, you know, on either side. In terms of the -- you know, having a Department of Justice investigate the anonymous op-ed, I went back and look at the pool report of Trump's comments and he was asked that by a reporter. He didn't introduce it. A reporter actually said, do you think that Session should investigate? And he said yes. And I -- you know, I am -- I am not one to defend the president in terms of his attacks on the media, but I do think sometimes the media plays a little bit of a roll here. They actually kind of put that idea forward and he said yes, you know, I think Sessions should. So we'll see what happens with that. There is, as far as I can tell right now, no legal basis for it. It was not a leak of classified information. WALLACE: Katie, lost in all of this is the fact that we had more great economic news this week. Two hundred thousand new jobs created, wages up 2.9 percent. But because of all of this noise, all of the statements, all of the tweets, all of the controversies, that gets lost. PAVLICH: It may get lost in conversation. But when it comes to how people are feeling out in middle America, the rest of the country, you don't have to tell them when they see more money in their paychecks. You don't have to tell them what a new job becomes available in their town because regulation has been pulled off that was previously put in during the Obama administration, for example. So while there is a lot of noise politically for the president, as we've seen in the past, as these controversies have popped up, his approval ratings has actually gone up in a lot of cases because people are seeing results while at the same time there is controversy here in Washington, D.C. Now, as we get -- WALLACE: But would the president -- would the president be wiser to focus on the good news? PAVLICH: Sure. WALLACE: You know, accentuate the positive? PAVLICH: Sure. Yes. WALLACE: Eliminate the negative? PAVLICH: Yes. Yes, absolutely. It would be great if he could only focus on the economy. But that is something we've been saying since he started running for president in 2015. That is not going to happen. He's going to focus on all the issues of the day, including being involved in these controversies. WALLACE: Liz. MARLANTES: I just would say, you know, his poll numbers actually have gone down a little bit lately. WILLIAMS: That's what I've noticed. MARLANTES: It's -- it's unclear if this is the start of a new trend or if this is just sort of a bad couple of weeks. But there has been -- actually been -- and his poll numbers have been remarkably stable. PAVLICH: Right. That's my (ph) point. MARLANTES: They haven't been great, but they've been remarkably stable throughout most of his presidency. But there has been a dip just in the last couple weeks that we're starting -- we're watching. WALLACE: Well, the Manafort -- the Manafort-Cohen week was a bad week. MARLANTES: Right. WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, the return of Barack Obama to the political spotlight and what it means for the November midterms. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: This is not normal. These are extraordinary times. And they're dangerous times. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Barack Obama blistering President Trump in an attack by a former president against his successor that is also not normal. And we're back now with the panel. Josh, what do you make a former President Obama's return to the political spotlight? How effective do you think he was in going after his successor, President Trump? And how do you think his involvement will play in terms of the November midterms? HOLMES: Well, you just knew that President Obama wouldn't be able to resist the bright lights in the midterms, right? I mean you watched President Bush go through, after his administration, largely stay dark, start largely outside of the controversy, particularly when it came to campaigns and elections. You just knew President Obama couldn't do that. But I think they have -- Democrats actually have a real problem here in that what we know about the election based on the special elections is that Democratic enthusiasm is at an all-time high. They don't need any more enthusiasm. They are right where they need to be. The problem is, if Republicans are right where they are, you know, in the states that matter, particularly in the Senate, it negates any advantage they might have. And there is nobody, other than perhaps President Trump, who motivates the conservative electric quite like President Obama. So I think there's some danger in here, particularly if he continues this, and that kind of rhetoric out in the Midwest, particularly states like North Dakota, Indiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Montana, all of those states have more Republicans than Democrats and if they show up Democrats have a real problem. WALLACE: Juan, I want to pick up on precisely the point, because I -- Democrats have wanted this to be a referendum on Donald Trump. Do you like Donald Trump or are you troubled by Donald Trump and do you want a check by Democrats taking back the House and/or the Senate? To the degree that Barack Obama becomes the face of the Democratic Party and the opposition this fall, yes, of course, he mobilizes a lot of people, especially minorities, young people, but he also may mobilize a lot of conservative voters who don't want to return to the days of high taxes and regulation that Barack Obama represents. WILLIAMS: Well, I think you have to understand that President Obama is doing this quite strategically. Josh is on target. There are places where, in fact, you could anticipate that he would energize a conservative base that I think never got over the election of the first black president. But, remember, Obama's going to Illinois. He's going to California. He's going -- he's doing a lot of fundraising that is basically private. WALLACE: But he -- but he's also getting national exposure when he helps out. WILLIAMS: Yes, he gets national attention because he's the former president. But I would say this, that, in fact, historically in midterms, it's the Democrats who have a problem with turnout. And I think there's the fear among Democrats that you don't want to count your eggs before they're hatched. Remember what happened with the polls and the 2016 presidential race. And so they want to make sure they are energizing their base and critically reaching out to white suburbanites, mostly women, in critical congressional districts, this is for the House, which is really the goal that the Democrats have this time around, which is to capture the majority of the House. WALLACE: Katie, the fact is, though, if you look at Barack Obama's record, he is a great vote-getter for himself. But when his name is not on the ballot, and you look at the 2010 and 2014 midterms, it doesn't transfer. PAVLICH: And the 2016 presidential election with him campaigning at the last minute for Hillary Clinton (INAUDIBLE) -- WALLACE: well, in fairness, I -- I think you've got to blame that on Hillary, not on -- on Obama. PAVLICH: Correct, but he endorsed her and came in at the very last minute hoping to get her over the finish line with a number of groups and couldn't get the job done. Now, that is a reflection of her, but it's also a reflection of his endorsement falling through. Barack Obama essentially burned the Democratic Party to the ground by losing a thousand seats in the local to the federal level while he was in office. He didn't do enough with the DNC. The Democratic operatives that you talk to are very disappointed in how he really only focused on his operation to get re-elected as president and let these other seats go by the wayside. And the thing about what he said during his speech is he wasn't just attacking President Trump. He was specifically attacking in the Republican Party, trying to talk about, you know, how voters are essentially bigoted and they have all these fears of people who look different than them. Barack Obama got elected twice in America by a majority. And for him to go out now and continue to lecture the country about those issues when we have come so far really rubs people the wrong way. And, finally, when it comes to whether he's going to be able to get back to his community organizing ways and be successful, I'm actually not so sure that Barack Obama is far left enough for this new Democratic Party. He talked about the founding fathers as being people we should have followed who did good things for the country. On the far left wing of the party, they're talking about taking down the Washington Monument, taking down any kind of remembrance of those kinds of principles. And so we'll see how he fits into this new socialism while he's, at the same time, potentially backing Joe Biden for 2020. WALLACE: Liz, Obama help or hurt the Democrats in the midterms? MARLANTES: I think on the whole, he's probably going to be a help. I think they are going to use him strategically, as Juan said. In fact, you know, that one speech was -- was the most sort of political of the speeches that he gave. He gave a -- he went the next day and gave a speech that was way more toned down in terms of, you know, not attacking President Trump by name, that sort of thing. So I think -- I think they'll be careful. They'll use him. They have a lot of first-time candidates. One of the sort of downsides potentially of a lot of enthusiasm is it got a ton of new faces, new first-time candidates. And some of those candidates might benefit from having the gravitas of the former president standing next to them. WALLACE: In a normal week the big news would have been the confirmation hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be a new Supreme Court justice and to swing the court to a solid conservative majority. Here is Kavanaugh this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I'm not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Juan, how do you think Kavanaugh did, and it Democrats do anything to derail his nomination? WILLIAMS: No. So if we're -- if you want the bottom line, the final score, Chris, I think he looks like he's on his way to being confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice and giving conservatives a solid 5-4 majority on that court for as long as we can see. The man's in his early 50s. But in answer to your question to whether or not damage was done, the critical issue for me is the impartiality of the court, trust in the court by the American people. We see that going down. This is not a popular candidate, by the way. So what you have -- and not popular among Democrats or Republicans, I might add. And what you saw the Democrats do was say, you know this guy was a political operative. He worked for Ken Starr. Remember, he was involved in the Florida recount in 2000. He was involved with torture memos in the Bush White House. This is a guy that's been on the court, but he's a political player. And I think that hurts his credibility going forward and hurts the credibility of our Supreme Court. WALLACE: Josh? HOLMES: I think the only thing that was noteworthy this week is how Senate Democrats handled themselves. In particularly Senator Cory Booker, which is just incredibly odd behavior and the I am Spartacus moment, as if he's trying to convince Democratic 2020 primary voters he's some sort of a bad boy. I mean that's kind of bad boy behavior that gets you (INAUDIBLE). WALLACE: Well, and also when he -- also when he said, if you want to try to kick me out of the Senate, bring it. HOLMES: Yes, which is just all contrived and, of course, completely ridiculous. But, you know, at the end of the day, I think Vice President Pence said it best, Kavanaugh acquitted himself quite well, but I think the Senate Democrats honestly set themselves back. They reminded the American people what the dangers of a Democratic majority in the Senate might be. WALLACE: But -- but this gets to the -- to the point that -- that Katie was making, which is that the Democrats have moved so far left, does that kind of behavior actually win some support? And -- and in what's going to be a very crowded field, get him out of the -- of the chorus line? HOLMES: Yes, I mean that's clearly the calculus that Cory Booker took. And I think Kamala Harris, Senator Harris as well. I mean the two of them were sort of climbing all over each other to try to get further to the left and more caustic in their approach to Judge Kavanaugh. In the end, it's going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right? I mean we're going to -- he did everything he needed to do in those hearings to get himself confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice. WALLACE: I got a little over 30 seconds. And let's get to -- to Juan's bottom line. Your work for Mitch McConnell. You're a vote counter. They did raise some issues about where he has on presidential power. They did raise issues about where he is on abortion. WILLIAMS: Gay rights. WALLACE: Thank you. Is there -- do you sense, from what your sources in the Senate, that they did anything to shake the support of Republican moderates, particularly pro-choice moderates like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski? HOLMES: You know, it's a good question. But in particularly I think they set themselves back by mischaracterizing. In one sense, Judge Kavanaugh prevented the views of the plaintiffs while providing the answer to Senate Democrats, totally mischaracterizing what happened. So I think he's actually in a better place now. WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. And we'll be back with a final word. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: For the latest on accounts of resistance inside the Trump White House and the search for that anonymous official, please stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel. And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\" END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

(Facebook) A Democratic state congressional candidate in Oklahoma has challenged his GOP rival to a shooting match to see who is better suited to support Second Amendment rights, The Tulsa World reported. Tom Stites, a Democrat from Sallisaw, said in a video posted last week that Republican Jim Olsen \u201cis (not) a real gun guy.\u201d Both men are running for Oklahoma\u2019s vacant seat in House District 2, which is located in the eastern part of the state. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being told as a conservative Democrat I can\u2019t be pro-life or pro-Second Amendment,\u201d Stites said, according to The World. \u201cI think that if you talk guns, you had better be ready to back it up. So let\u2019s go shoot it out on targets and see who wins.\u201d Stites has used the subject of firearms to chastise Olsen. In a video advertisement posted to Stites\u2019 Facebook page, he said Olsen \u201c(used) the Second Amendment for politics.\u201d \u201cMy opponent was born and raised in New York and moved here eight years ago,\u201d Stites said. \u201cWe need to know if he really knows guns.\u201d Stites, an NRA member, has offered his farm for the potential shooting event. He suggested the event could be a vehicle for a charity fundraiser and organized by off-duty law enforcement officers, gun dealers, and local NRA members, The World reported. Olsen has called the contest unnecessary, saying there that the two candidates were not running \u201cto be the sniper of Sequoyah County, but we are running for state representative.\u201d He has not responded directly to Stites advertisement, according to The World. The general election is Nov. 6.",

            "article_content": "Michael Avenatti looks on as Stormy Daniels speaks to the media outside federal court in Manhattan this past April. (REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid) Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels, set off Independence Day fireworks on Twitter Wednesday when he declared that he would run for president in 2020 if President Trump seeks re-election and if Avenatti believes no other candidate can win. Avenatti tweeted Wednesday morning that \"only a street fighter has a chance at displacing the 'King.' Otherwise, this country and its principles will be in pieces and non-recognizable.\" The tweet accompanied a photograph of the New York Daily News front page featuring Trump in clown makeup and wearing a broken crown. In response, Brian Krassenstein -- a somewhat notorious member of so-called \"#Resistance Twitter\" -- asked Avenatti, \"When are you announcing your 2020 run?\" Avenatti answered: \"IF (big) he seeks re-election, I will run, but only if I think that there is no other candidate in the race that has a REAL chance at beating him. We can't relive 2016. I love this country, our values and our people too much to sit by while they are destroyed.\" Both tweets were accompanied by the hashtags \"#FightClub\" and \"#Basta\", the Italian word meaning enough. In subsequent tweets, Avenatti laid out his political philosophy. He said he was \"pro-choice\" and \"Would never nominate a justice to the [Supreme Court] who did not believe in Roe or who would seek to outlaw same sex marriage. Fully support equality for women & people of all races, & gay rights. We don't separate families at the border. And we don't kiss-up to Putin.\" In an email to Fox News, Avenatti claimed that he had been \"approached by both the Republican and Democratic parties\" about being a 2020 candidate. \"I am not interested in being a career politician, we already have too many of those,\" he added. Daniels, aka Stephanie Clifford, has said she had sex with Trump in 2006 when he was married, which Trump has denied. She's suing Trump and the president's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in a bid to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement that she signed days before the 2016 presidential election. In April, FBI agents raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room as part of a probe into his business dealings and investigators were seeking records surrounding the $130,000 payment that was made to Daniels as part of a confidentiality agreement. On Monday, an attorney for Cohen asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to issue a gag order that would prevent Avenatti from speaking with reporters and releasing information about the case to the public. In a court filing, Brent Blakely accused Avenatti of conducting a \"smear campaign\" against Cohen that is \"aimed at tainting the jury pool.\" Avenatti has argued a gag order isn't necessary and the request is a \"complete joke.\" A hearing is set later this month.

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats outline a strategy to oppose the Supreme Court nominee while Majority Leader McConnell pushes for a quick confirmation. Most Republican governors support Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has met privately with many senators on Capitol Hill, but he has not yet gone through a confirmation hearing. Ahead of the Senate\u2019s decision on the federal appeals judge, more than 30 governors signed a letter in support of Kavanaugh, 53. The governors said Kavanaugh's\u00a0\u201cimpeccable credentials demonstrate he is worthy of this nomination.\u201d However, three Republican governors did not sign the letter. The three are from blue states and all are facing re-election this year. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner\u00a0initially indicated that he would not sign the letter, but eventually did so. Read on for a look at who did not sign the letter. Gov. Charlie Baker, R-Mass., has said abortion rights are important to him when it comes to a Supreme Court nominee. (Executive Office of the Governor) Baker has stressed he believes a Supreme Court nominee should rule in favor of pro-choice issues. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I think that needs to be a fundamental part of the vetting process,\u201d Baker has said. \u201cI hope that is a fundamental part of the vetting process as they move forward here.\u201d Gov. Larry Hogan's gubernatorial opponent has called on him to oppose Brett Kavanaugh. (Executive Office of the Governor) Ben Jealous, the Democratic nominee for governor, has publicly called on Hogan to condemn Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the nation\u2019s highest court. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott was one of three Republicans who did not sign a letter of support for Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. (AP Photo/Cheryl Senter) Scott\u00a0told WCAX-TV he had not yet learned enough about Kavanaugh to sign onto the letter when asked by the Republican Governor's Association. \"I don't want to rubber stamp anyone. I don't know much about the nominee,\" he said. \"If there had been a letter asking for a fair and open hearing on the confirmation, I would have signed it, but to blindly rubber stamp someone that I don't know a lot about -- I didn't think it would do great justice to anyone.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

President Trump had strong words on the subject of religious persecution following Saturday\u2019s deadly shooting in\u00a0a Pittsburgh synagogue, calling the attack an \u201cassault on humanity.\u201d Speaking at a campaign rally for Illinois Rep. Mike Bost, Trump initially addressed the shooting inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania\u2019s predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood. At least\u00a011 people were killed when a gunman entered and opened fire. \u201cThis evil, anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It is an assault on humanity,\u201d the president said, reiterating remarks he'd made about the episode earlier in the day.\u00a0\u201cIt must be confronted and condemned everywhere it rears its ugly head. We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate.\u201d \u201cThose seeking their destruction, we will seek their destruction.\u201d PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE MASSACRE PROVOKES OUTRAGE, ANGER AND CALLS TO ACTION Trump also doubled down on earlier calls to invoke the death penalty. \u201cWe must draw a line in the sand and say very strongly, never again.\u201d Trump said he'd weighed the idea of canceling the rally and an earlier event in Indiana in light of the \u201chorrible\u201d shooting. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow people like this to become important,\u201d he said. Just before taking the stage, Trump again shared his condolences for what he called \u201cthe mass murder of Jewish Americans.\u201d \u201cWe pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries...,\u201d his tweet read. Four officers were among the injured. Trump is on a rally blitz, hoping to bolster\u00a0Republicans in Nov. 6 midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress.",

            "article_content": "Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce Bruce Mehlman talks about strong party unity for President Trump. As the Democrats shift to the left on a number of issues from health care to immigration, they\u2019ve already gone all in on one of the most contentious issues around -- gun control A study by\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0found that of the 63 candidates on the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm\u2019s list of seats to flip in November, 62 support expanded background checks for gun purchases. While Dems have long pushed for gun control, there was a time when some candidates ignored the issue, included gun rights as part of their platform or even allied with the National Rifle Association. But support for gun control among candidates has hardened in recent years after a rash of high-profile mass shootings including at schools -- most recently in Parkland, Florida in February and Santa Fe, Texas in May. That shift is being reflected in activity on the campaign trail, with more Democrats being more vocal on gun control and their advocacy of proposals such as background checks. There has been a spike in spending on ads by Democrats that focus on gun control across gubernatorial, Senate and House races, according to\u00a0USA Today. In 2014, there were 558 pro-gun control spots, mostly from Democrats. In 2018, that number had rocketed to 18,416, in comparison to 8,897 anti-gun control spots by mostly Republicans. In the House races, pro-gun control ads represented about 67 percent of those with explicit messages on guns, compared to just six percent in 2014. DEMOCRATS TEST-DRIVE NEW MIDTERM SLOGAN AFTER FIRST ONE IS MOCKED That has in turn led to some significant about-faces on the issue from long-time lawmakers. The Journal points to Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. In a 2010 ad, she bragged about her \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA, but last month she said she would ban \u201cassault weapons\u201d and was given an \u201cF\u2019 by the pro-gun rights group. She said her position changed after the shooting of former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011. But while the move may rally the Democratic Party base, it may also give the Republican base a boost -- which has repeatedly shown itself more motivated on Second Amendment issues. The National Republican Congressional Committee suggested that the move was the latest example of the Democratic Party catering to its left-wing base rather than everyday Americans. \u201cRepublican members and candidates are focused on the issues that are important to their respective districts and Democrats are more concerned about appealing to the most radical elements of their party,\u201d an NRCC spokesperson told Fox News. Gun control is always risky politically for Democrats, who are wary of the political lesson learned from the 90s. In September 1994 the Democratic-controlled Congress passed an assault weapons ban, which was subsequently signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Less than two months later the Republicans led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., took control of both the House and the Senate in what was dubbed the \u201cRevolution of 94.\u201d But Democrats say that their shift represents the changing mood of the nation after a spate of devastating shootings in recent years. \u201c2018 could be the first year in which intensity on our side of the issue exceeds intensity on the other side,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told\u00a0The Journal. Democrats are likely to be buoyed by the victory of Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., in a March special election -- who won campaigning for background checks in a district Trump won in 2016. Additionally\u00a0a WSJ/NBC\u00a0poll found that Democratic voters rated gun control the second-most important issues after healthcare. For Republicans, guns were fifth. In midterms, where the party which motivates its base can decide who takes control of the chambers in Congress, tapping into those issues could be key. But it also represents a broader trend in the party of allowing less diversity on certain litmus issues. Last year DNC Chair Tom Perez said that being pro-choice on the subject of abortion was \u201cnon-negotiable.\u201d \"Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman\u2019s right to make her own choices about her body and her health. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee launched confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, kicking off what is expected to be a bitterly partisan gauntlet as Democrats vow to scrutinize his lengthy record as an appellate judge and lawyer in the Bush administration. In excerpts of his opening statement released by the White House Tuesday morning, Kavanaugh vowed to be an objective \"pro-law judge.\" \"A good judge must be an umpire\u2014a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\" he plans to say. \"I don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.\u00a0... If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" Kavanaugh's elevation from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court, raising the stakes beyond those of last year's nomination of Neil Gorsuch and leading Democrats to ratchet up their rhetoric. Last month, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused anyone who supports Kavanaugh of being \"complicit in evil.\" After ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea \u2013 which was used by Democrats to push for Kavanaugh delays \u2013 Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, even nixed a one-on-one meeting with the nominee, claiming Trump had picked him \"purposely ... to protect, as we say in Hawaii, his own okole\" from possible criminal charges. Some Democrats, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., had rejected Trump's selection before they even knew who it was, predicting the nomination process would be a \"corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests.\" WATCH: 'OUTNUMBERED' CALLS OUT CORY BOOKER'S DOOMSDAY RHETORIC ON KAVANAUGH But Kavanaugh steadily has gathered support from legal circles, former colleagues and Republican lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called him \"perhaps the most qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.\" The judge's nomination, though, will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators, including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee. Republicans command a narrow 50-49 Senate majority, which would return to 51-49 once a Republican successor to the late Sen. John McCain is appointed. Republicans have little margin for error, though Vice President Pence can break a tie. Who are the senators to watch? Among the key votes on the Democratic side are Indiana's Joe Donnelly, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp. All three voted to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year, and all are up for re-election in November in states that went for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Each has also met with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, and has promised to carefully weigh the upcoming hearings before making a final call. Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who recently won a special election and will be up for election in 2020, is also considered a potential yes vote on the nominee. But he recently said he wanted to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, citing the \"cloud\" of suspicion around Trump and his desire to see more documents from his time in the Bush White House. Jones claimed his view was shared by \u201ceverybody else around here on the Democratic side of the aisle\" -- but some Democrats, including Manchin, dismissed those last-minute concerns, saying there was no basis to delay the hearings. Even before former Trump attorney Cohen pleaded guilty last month to several federal charges, Democrats had already called for Kavanaugh's hearings to be postponed until after the November midterms, in retaliation for Senate Republicans' decision to deny a vote on then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. DEMS CALL COHEN GUILTY PLEA 'GAME CHANGER,' CALL FOR POSTPONING KAVANAUGH HEARINGS Meanwhile, outside groups have been pressuring moderate Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Both have promised to remain independent and carefully consider the results of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, but have given some clues on their leanings. Last month, Murkowski vowed to take a \"similar, if not identical \u2026 approach I took for Justices Gorsuch, Kagan, Sotomayor, Alito and Roberts\" in vetting the nomination. Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh to a seat on the influential D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. And Collins, who also voted to confirm Kavanaugh in 2006, acknowledged shortly after Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court that he has \"impressive credentials and extensive experience, having served more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\" Notably, Collins has rejected calls from Democrats to delay Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, saying there was \"no basis\" for the move. After meeting with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill, Collins said Kavanaugh had reassured her that Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that established a constitutional right to an abortion, was \"settled law.\" NARAL Pro-Choice America and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars targeting Murkowski and Collins specifically, Politico reported, in an effort to sway them against Kavanaugh. Another influential liberal group opposing Kavanaugh, the Alliance for Justice (AFJ), told Fox News that both Collins and Murkowski would jeopardize their reputations by failing to vote down his confirmation. \"For someone like Collins or Murkowski, their legacy is really on the line here,\" AFJ Legal Director Dan Goldberg said. \"Whatever votes they had in the past to protect women, to protect health care, would long be forgotten -- they would have to own every decision Brett Kavanaugh makes.\" Goldberg added that Kavanaugh's national poll numbers are \"consistent with Robert Bork and Harriet Miers\" when they were under consideration for Supreme Court posts they ultimately didn't receive. A Fox News poll last month showed voters evenly divided on Kavanaugh. After his sit-down with Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill last month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also made his case to Murkowski and Collins. SCHUMER SUGGESTS KAVANAUGH LYING ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE: 'THIS IS A BRIGHT MAN' \"He would not give me any reassurance that he believed Roe or [Planned Parenthood v. Casey] were correctly decided or should be left alone,\" Schumer claimed. \"That should send shivers down the spine of any American who believes in reproductive freedom.\" Sen. Booker echoed that line of attack after his own meeting with Kavanaugh, telling reporters, \"A lot of folks were wondering that he might not overturn Roe v. Wade. ... He confirmed with me that that door was still wide open.\" Still, Schumer, who also implied Kavanaugh was lying about the details of his time in the Bush White House, acknowledged that Kavanaugh had told Collins that Roe was settled law. \"I understand that the judge told other members today that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law,\" Schumer said, before adding, \"He did not say that to me.\" Kavanaugh's paper trail -- asset or liability? Kavanaugh has left one of the longest paper trails of any recent Supreme Court nominee, having served for more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and, before that, for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office in the George W. Bush administration. Kavanaugh also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. In looking at Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, Democrats will likely focus on Kavanaugh's decisions in cases like Priests for Life v. HHS, in which Kavanaugh wrote a dissent arguing that ObamaCare's contraceptive coverage requirements put undue burdens on some religious beliefs. Both parties are also likely to grill Kavanaugh on his 2011 dissent in an ObamaCare case, Sevensky v. Holder, which Republican critics have claimed effectively provided the\u00a0Supreme Court with a roadmap to uphold the law's contentious individual mandate provision.\u00a0In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote that only a \"minor tweak\" to the text of ObamaCare -- which required individuals to purchase health coverage or pay a monetary cost -- would bring it within the ambit of Congress' established power under the Constitution's Taxing Clause. Chief Justice John Roberts would later provide the swing vote to uphold to ObamaCare's individual mandate by citing Congress' power under the Taxing Clause, instead of adopting the Obama administration's arguments that the law was justified broadly under the Constitution's expansive authority to generally regulate interstate commerce. But others, including a former Kavanuagh law clerk, called that interpretation \"nonsense\" and argued that Kavanaugh, in fact, was outlining why Congress' Taxing Clause could not save ObamaCare from unconstitutionality. TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EMERGES AS NEXT DEM LITMUS TEST Democrats are also expected to question Kavanaugh about Garza v. Hargan, a recent case in which Kavanaugh dissented from a ruling that the Trump administration should permit an illegal immigrant in federal custody to have an abortion. Kavanaugh's dissent managed to anger both sides of the abortion debate, because while Kavanaugh did not endorse the immigrant's right to an abortion, his dissent also did not specifically deny her that right in all cases. In the wake of several high-profile school shootings, Democrats may further zero in on Kavanaugh's position on gun rights. Kavanaugh dissented in the landmark Heller case when it was before the D.C. Circuit, arguing that a D.C. ordinance unconstitutionally infringed on residents' right to own semi-automatic weapons by requiring them to keep them unloaded and unassembled, or bound by a trigger lock. Additionally, liberal groups have highlighted Kavanaugh's record on the environment, saying that he has overzealously struck down Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In a case last year, Mexichem Flour v. EPA, Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion that struck down a 2015 EPA rule regulating\u00a0hydrofluorocarbons, which analysts say led to substantially increased greenhouse gasses. Kavanaugh reviewed the text of the Clean Air Act and the legislative history before writing that the EPA's rule had exceeded the agency's statutory authority under the Clean Air Act -- although he sounded a note of regret in the process. \"However much we might sympathize or agree with EPA's policy objectives, EPA may act only within the boundaries of its statutory authority,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"Here, EPA exceeded that authority.\" MEDIA'S BIGGEST MISSES: ASPIRING KAVANAUGH HIT PIECES DRAW MOCKERY But Supreme Court nominees are typically unwilling to offer much insight into their legal philosophies during confirmation hearings, which carries a major political risk and could prejudice future cases before the Supreme Court. There was also a greater potential for Democrats to score points by questioning Kavanaugh on his record as a Bush administration lawyer and adviser to Kenneth Starr, especially given that his writings in those capacities were less guarded than a typical judicial opinion. During the Clinton investigation, for example, Kavanaugh unloaded on Clinton, telling Starr that the president should be impeached, citing his \"revolting\" behavior in the Oval Office and \"sheer number of wrongful acts.\" But since his time in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh has argued that presidents should not have to endure lengthy probes during their time in office, saying in 2009 that indicting sitting presidents would \"ill serve the public interest,\" especially in times of financial or national security crisis. He wrote in an article that year: \u201c[T]he nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.\u201d That language has alarmed top Democrats, who have voiced concerns that Kavanaugh would vote to shoot down a subpoena or even indictment of President Trump if one were filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or other federal prosecutors. Meanwhile, Democratic concerns that Kavanaugh may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee during his 2006 confirmation hearings for his D.C. Circuit post have fizzled in recent weeks. A document dump last month from Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House suggested that he had, in fact, offered legal advice on attorney-client privilege issues surrounding terror detainees, even though he said under oath that he had no involvement in \"rules governing the detention of combatants.\" The White House has maintained Kavanaugh's statements were truthful, and the controversy died down. Nevertheless, Goldberg, the AFJ legal director, said he anticipates that Democrats will hammer the issue during this week's hearings. \"There are certainly questions about his candor and veracity in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was first confirmed --- issues that I know Sen. [Patrick] Leahy will press him on in the hearing,\" Goldberg told Fox News, referring to the long-time Vermont Democratic senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee. Leahy has opposed Kavanaugh dating back to his 2003 nomination to the D.C. Circuit, saying he had \"failed to demonstrate his capacity for independence.\" Democrats stalled Kavanaugh's appellate court nomination until 2006. In recent days, Democrats, including Leahy,\u00a0have cried foul that the Kavanaugh paper trail is actually not long enough, saying they have been denied access to all the documents they need to vet his nomination. Schumer has threatened to sue the National Archives, which is handling their requests for documents from Kavanaugh's public service. He has also sharply criticized the procedure for the ongoing document production, saying it's inappropriate that a Republican lawyer is vetting all documents before their release. Despite Kavanaugh's voluminous record -- and the all-out contentious rhetoric surrounding it -- Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, has said Republicans hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October, when the next Supreme Court term begins.

            "article_content": "First-time political candidate, former Marine aims to unseat Menendez in New Jersey Senate bid. Republican candidate says Bob Menendez failed New Jersey morally. New Jersey hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate in 46 years. But this fall, Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is facing an unexpectedly strong and well-funded challenge from a Republican nominee named Bob Hugin, who is spending millions on negative ads reminding voters of Menendez\u2019s past ethics troubles. Menendez went on trial in federal court last year, accused of illegally accepting gifts from a wealthy donor. A mistrial was declared after the jury failed to reach a verdict, but later, the Senate Ethics Committee \u201cseverely admonished\u201d Menendez. \u201cThis guy is an amazing textbook picture of corruption,\u201d Hugin said in a phone interview with Fox News this week, arguing Menendez has \u201cembarrassed the state in so many different ways.\u201d To an extent, New Jersey's race represents the inverse of what is happening in Texas, where\u00a0Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke is mounting a longshot but highly visible challenge to Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. Democrats are dazzled by the possibility of claiming a seat in deep-red Texas, however unlikely. Deep-blue New Jersey hosts a similarly uphill climb for Republicans.\u00a0No polls have shown Hugin in the lead.\u00a0Fox News Power Rankings ranks the race \u201clikely Democrat.\u201d \u201cThe senator has always taken every race seriously, and he\u2019s never taken a single vote for granted,\u201d Menendez campaign spokesman Steven Sandberg said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly fighting for those votes and he expects -- as we all do at the end of the day -- that he\u2019s going to be victorious on Nov. 6.\u201d Still, while the Cruz-O'Rourke\u00a0race has grabbed headlines for months, the threat to Democrats posed by Hugin has captured less attention.\u00a0A GOP upset in New Jersey \u2013 where a Republican was last elected in 1972 \u2013 would not only shock observers\u00a0but likely cripple Democratic hopes of retaking the Senate. The RealClearPolitics polling average has Menendez with a 7-point lead \u2013 substantial, but not necessarily comfortable. Menendez defeated his Republican opponent by 20 points in 2012. Michael W. Klein, interim executive director of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy, said in a statement earlier this month the race is \"up for grabs.\" His center's polling unit released a poll reflecting a dead heat, though it was an outlier in comparison with other recent surveys\u00a0\u2013 for instance, a CBS News poll putting Menendez ahead by 10 points. For the New Jersey senator, the race represents the latest in a series of dramatic fights for his political life. Had he been convicted last November, Menendez could have faced expulsion from the Senate. Having survived the trial, Menendez famously suggested he was out for vengeance. \"To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I won\u2019t forget you,\u201d the Democratic senator said last year. Menendez has adopted an aggressive tone, including recently\u00a0tweeting out video of him calling the FBI\u2019s recent background probe into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a \u201cbulls--- investigation.\u201d Hugin, a retired Marine and biopharmaceutical company executive, has spent $15.5 million through June of his own money to draw attention to Menendez\u2019s corruption trial. In an interview, Hugin said Menendez \u201cabused the power of his office\u201d and \u201cdisgraced the Senate.\u201d But Hugin is also using ads to brand himself a \u201cdifferent kind of Republican.\u201d Hugin told Fox News he believes in a \u201cstrong national defense\u201d and \u201ceconomic liberty,\u201d but he\u2019s also pro-choice, pro-gay marriage and believes in \u201cin equal pay for equal work.\u201d The Menendez campaign accused Hugin of \u201chiding behind\u201d the attacks over the bribery trial, rather than focusing on issues. \u201cHe has not taken definitive positions on issues that New Jerseyans care about,\u201d Sandberg said, calling Hugin a \u201cTrump Republican through and through.\u201d Hugin has never been elected to office before \u2013 but he and Menendez go back: they both grew up in Union City and served on the board of education together as students. Asked about his recollection of Menendez at the time, Hugin, after a lengthy pause, would only say:\u00a0\u201cHe was very interested in politics.\u201d Meanwhile, Hugin said there are no plans to have President Trump campaign on his behalf. But he said he hopes more national Republicans come to his side, referencing the money spent by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on Menendez\u2019s behalf. \u201cIt\u2019s not President Trump,\u201d Hugin said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had any outside people get involved. We think it\u2019s best to keep it focused on New Jersey.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham pays tribute to his friend and colleague Sen. John McCain and looks ahead to the confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's pick to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that he believes Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed if he does well in this week\u2019s upcoming hearings before the Senate. Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Graham, R-S.C., noted that, despite opposition from numerous high-profile Democrats, Kavanaugh should have won the support of the majority of senators by the time his hearings conclude. \u201cIf he does well at the hearings, he\u2019ll get 55 votes or higher,\u201d Graham told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace. \u201cThere are a handful of Democrats that will vote for Justice Kavanaugh if he does well.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee begins confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge, on Tuesday with his introduction and opening statements from lawmakers. Questioning of the nominee will begin the next day and testimony from the American Bar Association, outside legal experts and those who know him best will follow. With liberal advocacy groups adamantly opposed to Kavanaugh and Democrats wanting to fire up their base for the coming election, Senate questioning will be aggressive and opening statements forceful. But Republicans, with their 50-49 majority, have the edge. Trump nominated Kavanaugh to succeed Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered the swing vote on some of the most important issues decided in recent years. Democrats are worried that Kavanaugh's confirmation will cement a right-leaning court for many years to come. They contend his elevation could lead the court to restrict a woman's right to choose an abortion, equal rights for gays and lesbians and environmental protections. The abortion issue has become a flashpoint topic in Kavanaugh's nomination, with many pro-choice lawmakers on both sides of the aisle concerned that his confirmation would be the nail in the coffin for Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision ruling that unduly restrictive state regulations on abortion are unconstitutional. While Kavanaugh is said to have told Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that Roe v. Wade is settled law, many other lawmakers are not so sure. \u201cHe is the most unpopular Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said during an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe president has said he will not put someone on the Supreme Court who wouldn\u2019t overturn Roe v. Wade and ObamaCare.\u201d Graham on Sunday tried to assuage the concerns of his fellow senators by arguing that Kavanaugh would not immediately try to overturn precedent and that he would be a Supreme Court justice willing to hear all sides. \u201cThere is a process for overturning precedent,\u201d Graham noted. \u201c[Kavanaugh] would be disqualified in my mind if he wasn\u2019t willing to hear both sides.\u201d Despite most lawmakers having strong opinions on Kavanaugh, that cannot be said for the American public. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, released last week, found that nearly half of Americans \u2014 46 percent \u2014 don't have a strong opinion on Trump's nominee to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the high court. That ambivalence runs even deeper among independent voters, as fully two-thirds say they've not formed an opinion on whether the federal appeals court judge deserves a promotion. Some people who haven't yet formed an opinion say they need more information. While the parties have clashed over whether Kavanaugh should receive a vote before Election Day, Americans are evenly divided on that question: 51 percent saying vote now and 48 percent preferring lawmakers wait until after voters have cast their ballots. Among all Americans, those who do have an opinion divide about evenly, with 25 percent in favor of Kavanaugh's elevation to Supreme Court justice and 29 percent opposed. Those opinions are divided primarily by partisan lines. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump's son Eric Trump on explosive devices mailed to prominent Democrats, threats his family receives. This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 24, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: We need you to watch the show for the entire hour tonight. Now, tonight, many Americans are on high alert after a series of suspected mail bombs were sent to several prominent Democrats all across the country. At this hour, nobody knows who is responsible. Let me be clear and let me reiterate what I've been saying know for a month on this program -- so many times, violence, threats, intimidation, it has no place in this country. We are the United States of America. We solve our political differences, which are very acute at this moment, at the ballot box. That would be 13 days from now without bloodshed. Now, the disturbed individual responsible must be held accountable. And with that said tonight, sadly, we have so many people on the left and in the mainstream media all day rushing to judgment as usual to score cheap political points. Many are actually blaming the president, Fox News, talk radio, yours truly. It's a disgrace when just the opposite is true and we are going to respond to this slander on this program tonight. We'll also point out how Democrats after weeks of literally calling for incivility and kicking and, you know, getting in people's faces and following them telling them you are not wanted anywhere anymore, all of a sudden, are pretending to be the party of peace. This is hypocrisy at its worst. We'll expose this massive double standard. We'll show you the political environment that many that are complaining today, they themselves fostered into the lead up into these important midterm elections. So, sit tight, buckle up, we need the full hour tonight. A lot of ground to cover. We start with our breaking news opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. Tonight, we have some very disturbing news. Manila envelopes each containing crude looking pipe bombs targeted several high-profile Democrats all over the country. Now, these packages were addressed to former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, George Soros and reportedly even Maxine Waters. The other package intended for CIA Director John Brennan was addressed to CNN's headquarters in New York. All the packages listed Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the return address. Thankfully, none of these devices exploded and no one was injured. And at this hour, a full-scale federal investigation is on to hunt down whatever maniac would be responsible for what is a despicable act. Now, you have heard me say over and over and over on the show, but I will repeat it one more time, violence, threats, intimidation, has no place in politics, no place in this country. And what we saw today was the work of pure evil. This is an act of terror and I feel terrible for anybody who was threatened today. It's wrong, period. Now, I have had many, many threats myself over the years. I've had white powder sent to my office. One of my employees spend, what, nine hours in isolation and things even far worse than that but I'm not going to talk about. My heart goes out to anyone ever threatened, anybody today, anybody tonight. No conservative that I know and would ever support -- would ever support this horrible act. No matter how strongly you disagree with some of these beliefs, everyone in this country deserves safety and security. \u00a0I've said that throughout my career. Earlier today, President Trump immediately condemned this reprehensible act. Here's what he said. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority. The full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. We will spare no resources or expense in this effort. And I just want to tell you that in these times, we have to unify. We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: No place in this country. The president's right. Despite not knowing who was responsible for these mail bombs today, we had so many people rushing to judgment -- the media, the left, Democrats, all trying to score cheap political points and a political victory on this. All day as this story was unfolding, they have no facts, immediately assigning blame to their political rivals, especially President Trump. In a joint statement, even Schumer and Pelosi saying President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence. CNN's fake news president Jeff Zucker, he's blaming Donald Trump. There is a complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media. Even when they lie, you are not allowed to call out lies? Blaming the president for an act of violence from an unknown perpetrator seems beyond shameful that a network that claims to put facts first. And, of course, anti-Trump vitriol continued every minute, every hour, every second of the entire day. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's remember, we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival in Hillary Clinton who has encouraged violence against the media. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The president and his allies, they need to dial down the political rhetoric. They are making people less safe. They are making journalists less safe. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is hard to suspend relief and not see the context of what is occurring today with the president who was repeatedly suggested that the press is the enemy of the people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of the United States. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they are following Donald Trump's Twitter feed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fox News hasn't gotten a bomb yet. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Words are words. The president was not the only target of the blame game by the left-wing media trying to score political points. Fox News, talk radio, yours truly, were actually vilified. One particularly uninformed leftist pretending to be a reporter at NBC tweeting, quote: There will be a rush to pin these mail bombs on extremists. Talking points from fringe websites and communities on Facebook and Reddit it and so on, but George Soros, Obama and the Clintons have been viewed at the root of all the evil on talk radio and Fox News for over a decade. Now, before this abject idiot tries to blame me, Fox News talk radio for the acts of clearly disturbed individual who we don't know who it is yet, maybe they should watch an episode of the show or listen to my radio show because night after night, for a month, I have called for calm. I have condemned these confrontations, these, these mobs, these violent acts on the left and right. I don't assign blame based on political expediency is clearly you and your colleagues are. One of Bernie Sanders supporters -- remember, we all watched tried to assassinate Republican lawmakers on a baseball field, nearly successfully killing someone that I like personally and consider a friend, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, I didn't blame Bernie Sanders, nor should anybody have blamed Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders didn't tell that evil maniac to kill Republicans. You might remember this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders supporters. \u00a0This was one nut. Remember the Bernie Sanders supporter, the one that targeted Republicans at a baseball practice, leaving Congressman Steve Scalise fighting for his life? Well, was the media blaming Democrats for that? No. And, by the way, they shouldn't have and I don't blame Bernie either. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I -- nobody should have blamed Bernie. Political disagreements, even political battle in back-and-forth, they're not supposed to be marching orders for deranged individuals. President Trump, this show, when we rightly call out and expose the left for their hypocrisy, and we will do more of it in a minute, or deep state corruption or the fake news media for reporting fake news almost every night, that's not inciting violence, I'm saying just the opposite. This is about going to the ballot box. That's where we settle our political differences. I didn't love it that Obama won twice, I didn't like it at all, but America goes on and I said many times during his presidency, we've got to protect our president. Now, the same goes for anyone in the mainstream media, including those who trashed Trump supporters and Democrats, or who bashed conservatives day after day, night after night, 24/7. There's hardly a word in the dictionary if it's negative that I haven't been called at some point in my career, or that they haven't used against the president. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The mobs that I see are the people that go to Trump rallies and laugh when Donald Trump mimics the testimony of an alleged victim of sexual assault. The mobs I see are the people who cheer when Donald Trump trots out the word \"I'm a nationalist\" and tells people to ignore the negative connotations, the lessons of history of what that's associated with. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He knows that in America, the work nationalist usually follows the word white -- white nationalist. That's what it meant in the 21st century. Trump voters understand. David Duke understands that Donald Trump has to leave the word white out of his use of the work nationalist. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You hold down the woman while the rapist is rating her and you didn't do it to her, are you a rapist? I mean, let's just really - - let's cut the B.S. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tens of millions of people voted for him after he showed his heart for years. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you suggesting that they are racist? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The people, all the people who voted for Donald Trump are racist? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No longer say Trump's the bad guy. If you vote for Trump, you are the bad guy. If you vote for Trump, you are ripping children from parents' arms. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, while I deplore that kind of rhetoric, the left is not responsible for the sad actions of a lunatic. Now, sadly, there are crazy deranged people from all backgrounds, all political points of view. Recently, Republican senator, remember Susan Collins? She was the target when a suspicious package reportedly containing ricin was sent to her home three weeks ago, packages were sent to President Trump, General Mattis, FBI Director Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel allegedly having ricin in them. \u00a0Another suspicious parcel targeted Donald Trump Jr. and his family. His wife went to the hospital. Today, Don Jr. tweeted, quote, as someone whose family has directly been the victim of these threats, I condemned whoever did this, regardless of party or ideology. This crap has to stop and I hope they end up in jail for a long time. Amen, so do I, because I know from personal first-hand experience it is a horrible thing to go through. What's happening to many people tonight, it has happened sadly many times to me in my career. We have been saying for months that the rhetoric we are seeing, the mobs we are seeing in this country that everybody needs to calm down. Rand Paul said it, I've said it -- before someone gets hurt or worse. I've been saying it nightly. Recently, we reported that Republican Congressman Kevin McCarthy's office, well, they threw a boulder through the window. And night after night, we show you, what, disturbing videos, Republicans stalked, harassed, kicked out of restaurants and worse with kids and children even involved. Take a look. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) HANNITY: Now, while we on this program have been constantly now condemning this unacceptable behavior night after night, Democrats, the liberal media, they are nowhere to be found. They have been silent. They've been missing in action when women are kicked out of restaurants with their kids and at a movie theaters, and Senator Cruz can eat dinner with his wife Heidi and we saw what happened this weekend, Henry Kissinger and Mitch McConnell. And the media and fake news CNN even lectured us you can't call that a mob. \u00a0CNN literally said you can't call it a mob. Meanwhile, the rhetoric from the left constantly is demonizing their political opponents. They need a big fat mirror of themselves tonight to look at how they say things. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELLEN DEGENERES, TV HOST: If you had to be stuck on an elevator with either President Trump, Mike Pence or Jeff Sessions, who would it be? (LAUGHTER) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: Does one of us have to come out alive? (LAUGHTER) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: Please don't just come here today and then go home. Go to the Hill today. Get up and please get up in the face of some Congress people. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Michelle always says that, you know, when they go low, we go high. No. No. When they go low, we kick them. JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: The press always asks me don't I wish I were debating him? No, I wish we were in high school so I could take in behind the gym. That's what I wish. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Remember Madonna? I think an awful lot of blowing up the White House or holding up severed heads of the president of the United States. \u00a0Oh, I didn't see a whole lot of criticism of the left. A little, not a lot. Yesterday, former VP Joe Biden even compared the president to George Wallace. Today, he's singing a much different to them tweeting: This country has got to come together. Oh, OK, crazy Uncle Joe. You can't go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have an Indian accent. You know, really, we got a lecture from Joe Biden, crazy Uncle Joe? And this is true of many Democrats. Remember Hillary Clinton, what did she say? We can't be civil with Republicans, remember this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility can start again. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Oh, today, now she's singing a different tune after actual criminal acts against Democrats, only if it happens against Democrats. I'm beginning to catch on here. Now, she's calling for us all to come together. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: It is a troubling time, isn't it? And it's a time of deep division and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Really? You said we couldn't be civil. Oh, that was last week. \u00a0Oh, I understand how that works. We can't, of course, forget about Congresswoman Maxine Waters repeatedly calling for Republicans could be stalked, harassed, confronted and grocery stores, department stores, gas stations, tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore. That was a couple of weeks ago. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOI CLIP) SEN. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: You have members of your cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants. (CHEERS) Who have protesters taking up at their house who are saying, \"No peace, no sleep.\" And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them that they are not welcome anymore, anywhere. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: They are not welcome anywhere anymore. Oh, that was then. That was a couple of weeks ago. Now, Congresswoman Waters issued a statement today that reads: I unequivocally condemn any and all acts of violence and terror. What happened to get a crowd, followed them into department stores, grocery stores, gas stations, tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore? All these networks all day, selective moral outrage, they have been dead silent in the lead up to today, frankly complicity in giving her and all of these people on the left a pass and many of them themselves using incendiary rhetoric. The greatest hypocrisy of all. Today, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. \u00a0Remember when he said this about conservatives living in New York if they are pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, this is what he says. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-N.Y.: Who are they? Are they these extreme conservative who are right to life? Pro assault weapon, anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that's who they are and if they are the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that's not who New Yorkers are. (END AUDIO CLIP) HANNITY: No place in New York if you're pro-life, pro-Second Amendment. Anyway, he's calling for civility today. Wow. The champion of civility. \u00a0Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CUOMO: -- is overheated rhetoric, extremism that pushes people to violence. And at the end of the day, we may have political differences, but this is one country, we're all Americans, e pluribus unum, out of many one, and keeping the debate and the dialogue civil is very, very important and for elected leaders who in many ways set the tone, it is especially important. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: E pluribus unum, except if you're pro-life and believe in the Second Amendment. What you just saw it as a sad pathetic double standard in the Democratic Party. This is what I call phony selective moral outrage. False play. We see it over and over again. So quick to call for unity when Democrats are targeted, but when Republicans are threatened, as they have been for weeks and weeks, they've been silent. They obsess about Trump, Russia collusion, no evidence, but they ignore Hillary Clinton purchasing dirty Russian lies and disseminating them to the American people to steal an election. Bought and paid for Russian lies. That's ignored by the same media. On the topic of sexual assault, they want a seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh. It's called the Kavanaugh treatment. But they are silent, totally silent, the same people, missing in action with all the allegations against Keith Ellison. They love Bill Clinton, Spartacus Cory Booker and others. The Democrats silence when Sarah Sanders, Pam Bondi, Kirstjen Nielsen are harassed and ran out of restaurants. Ted Cruz ran out of a restaurant with his wife. Mitch McConnell, a guy banging on his table this weekend. Rocks being thrown through Kevin McCarthy's office window. Violence, threats, intimidation, harassment. Let me tell you what it is, it's unacceptable for anybody, but the left has been silent. We've been outspoken. There is pure or outright hypocrisy they only seem to care when it's against members on the other side of the aisle, only when they can use it to attack President Trump and bludgeon him. Now, hopefully today, hopefully people are beginning to realize what I have been saying, what Rand Paul has been saying -- the political climate in this country is getting dangerous. Somebody's going to get killed or worse. We don't want that to happen to anybody. Democrats, fake news CNN, others, they all could have spoken out when something like, you know, today's bomb scare happens. They should, but they should have also been denouncing all the incivility, all the kick \u2018em, all the follow them into stores, they are not wanted here anywhere anymore. And this is what matters: in 13 days, we solve our differences at the ballot box. I'm willing to accept that my side can lose. You have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to settle disagreements there. But even after 2016, they wanted to undo an election. We saw all the corruption and laws broken in the aftermath of the 2016 election. The survival of our constitutional republic depends on law and order, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. We must protect the safety of every American. OK, I'm all for civility. I really don't mind a good verbal debate with people. And I don't care if people call me names. No matter what the differences are. And so -- but we need to watch how bad this is gotten, and before somebody gets seriously hurt or worse. I pray that doesn't happen. Now, when we come back, Eric Trump, his entire family has gone through more than anybody could imagine as it relates to this. We'll talk to him. \u00a0We'll talk to Newt Gingrich, Michelle Malkin. Stay with us. A lot to get you on this busy news night. We are glad you chose FOX. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: And as we've seen all day, the despicable threats against Democratic politicians. This is very dangerous. We've got to make sure the American people are safe and secure. It should have been condemned by all Americans, if the right thing to do. Donald Trump Jr. tweeting today: As someone's family has directly been the victim of these mail threats, I condemn whoever did this regardless of party or ideology. This crap has to stop. I hope they end up in jail for a long time. Joining us now with reaction from the Trump Organization, the son of the president, Eric Trump, is with us. You know, it really does bring into focus Madonna -- I dream an awful lot about blowing up the White House. It really does bring into focus the things that have been said about you, about your entire family, a severed head of your father. Listen, your father is outspoken, iconoclastic and he fights for what he wants and he shakes people up. Very different from what Maxine Waters has been doing or the month-long getting in people's faces and confrontations with women and children, though. ERIC TRUMP, SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: No question about it. It's very different than Eric Holder. I mean, I thought your opening monologue was beautiful. And, Sean, these people should be hunted down and they should be thrown in jail for a very, very long time. It's that simple. It doesn't matter which party it is. Hey, last year, I had white powder sent to my help. Don had white powders into his house. The white powder literally blew up in my wife's face, right, and the FBI and the Secret Service, they caught the guy and they threw him in jail. They need to do the exact same thing to this person. They need to hunt this person down, they need to throw the person in jail, and they need to throw away the key because honestly the lack of civility is unreal. This isn't the country we are, this isn't who we are. There are many Democrats who are -- you know, and Republicans, they are all great people. The vast, vast majority of people are great people. They don't want this nonsense. This isn't right. HANNITY: You know, I've watched the horrible things said about your sister. I've watched what your younger brother Barron has had to go through. I watched the most vile things said about Melania, who was a wonderful woman, I've gotten to know her personally. Forget about the president. We're -- he's in the arena. Like you had white powder sent to me and other threats far worse than that. And I really sympathize with what these people and organizations are going through today because I've been there. But the reality is most of them have been silent with Maxine Waters in the lead up to this and Pam Bondi, Secretary Nielsen, Sarah Sanders, Ted Cruz and his wife. Henry Kissinger, Mitch McConnell, four instances for him. \u00a0And the latest weekend, Kevin McCarthy having a boulder thrown through his office window. They've been virtually silent on his instances. TRUMP: Not to mention pickup trucks that are being torched in parking lots at rallies and so many other things. I mean, how hard is it just to say that this is not right? That everybody condemns this regardless of what political side you're on? Everybody condemns it and these people deserve to be in jail for a very long time and this doesn't represent the political party. I mean, how hard is that to say? You know, you see some of the kind of diatribes the CNN went on today and some of the other news networks went on today and it just further deepens the divide that this has nothing to do with the good people of this country. HANNITY: You know, and it's funny, they are so upset that your dad, I believe rightfully, calls out fake news. We have watched through almost two years, beyond two years if you take the election into account that every second, every minute, every hour of every day. They just trash your father, say anything they want to say. And then when they get called out -- for example they always give Hillary a pass. They gave Obama a pass. They are attacking your father with conspiracy theories and lies about Russian for two years and they are wrong. Your dad calls them out for being fake and they are and somehow they're going to equate that to a call for violence? That is total B.S. and they've got to know that. TRUMP: There's no question about it. I mean, they are all for the First Amendment until you say something that they disagree with and then there are no longer for the First Amendment. It's why Twitter, it's why social, it's why these rallies -- I mean, I was in Houston the other day, my father 22,000 people in the audience, he had 50,000 people outside. It's why it's been such a powerful tool for him, because he can talk to the American people and he can cut through the nonsense. And think about the media, Sean. You know this better than any human being in the world. But it's controlled by a very small group of elitists. They don't like him, they don't like his message. They got it wrong. They never said he could win. They didn't think he could win. They gave him at one point, in terms of the New York Times they give him a 1.9 percent chance of winning on election day and now they're doubling down and they're doubling down again. And so, if that hypocrisy. I mean, they don't want my father to be right, you know. They want to do anything they can to use anything against my father. And, Sean, I say this all the time, they are going to get it wrong again. I mean, they're absolutely going to get it wrong again. HANNITY: What's your take on the midterm? I see Republicans, I believe they'll hold the Senate. It's a harder read in the House. I do believe that everything is in play and it's all going to be about turnout. TRUMP: It is about turnout. And if the army of Trump gets out there we will win. If people are complacent and they stay at home I don't think we will, right? I mean, the army of Trump has to get out and I hear all the time, Sean, well, my guy is Trump, why guy is not on the ballot. I go you can't think that way, you have to get out, you have to vote. If you are not voting Republican, if you are not voting Republican you effectively voting against my father and you have to get out. I mean, the country is doing so well, our economy is doing well. I mean, it's just-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: We know what the Pelosi agenda is. They want to impeach your dad. They want to keep Obamacare, a disaster, they want their crumbs back. TRUMP: Sure. HANNITY: They want open borders. And you know-- (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: And they want to double your taxes, Sean. They want to double your taxes and they want to fight law enforcement, they want to abolish ICE and they want to do so many other things. This country is on fire. It is doing so well and we have to keep Republicans in power. HANNITY: You know, it's a weird position to be in that they almost have to cheer for America to do as bad as we did in the Obama years so they can get their power back and it's just the opposite has happened. We had two years of amazing prosperity. What I'm arguing, Eric, is if you vote for any Democrat in any district in the House, you are voting for Pelosi. You don't show up, that's a half a vote for Pelosi and if you vote for any Democratic senator you might as well vote for Chuck Schumer because that's what you're getting. TRUMP: Yes. That's 100 percent right. I mean, they would rather see America fail than my father succeeds. I've said that for years. They would rather see America fail than my father succeeds. HANNITY: It's sad. TRUMP: Republicans have to get out there, you have to vote and you have to keep on winning for this country. HANNITY: Thirteen days from tonight we will be giving out the results right here on the Fox News Channel. All right. Eric, good to see you. Thank you. When we come back, Ed Henry will have the latest on the investigation into today's mail bomb scare. Also, Newt Gingrich, he will weigh in on all of tonight's breaking news. Also, later, Michelle Malkin. Stay with us, we got a lot of news to get to. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Joining us now with the very latest on the bomb scare from earlier today, Fox News chief national correspondent, Ed Henry is with us. Ed, what's going on? ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Sean, great to see you. In fact, breaking in the last few moments the FBI has confirmed that a second suspicious package was sent to Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters out in California. They caught it actually before it ever reached her office. It's at a mail sorting facility in downtown Los Angeles that at this hour has been evacuated as they try to get to the bottom of it. All of this coming as the president bows tonight the full weight of the federal government will be coming down hard on the suspect or suspects declaring the safety of the American people is his highest priority. The president saying no expense will be spared to get to the bottom of this. Multiple law enforcement agencies on a manhunt tonight to get to the bottom of this. Now the Secret Service is the usual male screening procedures block a suspicious package from being delivered to the New York home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. That kind of started all this off. A nearly identical package had been addressed to the Washington, D.C., home of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. Nobody heard but officials say there appeared to be live explosive devices so the NYPD immediately started taking more proactive steps. Then this morning CNN's New York bureau, all the surrounding residences, offices, restaurants, businesses at Columbus circle in Manhattan evacuated after being targeted with a similar package. A federal law enforcement official telling Fox tonight that there are several similarities to a device recovered Monday at the home of billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. The working theory at this hour is that an individual or group is behind all of the packages. The package that was sent to CNN's mailroom you can see had excessive postage and packaging, all red flags and the fact that the stamps were licked also point to likely DNA that will be corrected. The president jumping on this today. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP: We are extremely angry and upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning and we will get to the bottom of it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Now while officials have not been able to figure out a motive I mentioned Democratic Maxine Waters said today that she was targeted. There was a second package that was sent to her. So with all of the targets being individuals or groups that the president has attacked verbally Democrats are already trying to point the finger of blame at the White House. Rush Limbaugh suggesting today these attacks were actually false flags by the left trying to frame the president essentially while Hillary Clinton called today for the country to come together. Remember, earlier this month she said Democrats should not be civil with a party that she said was trying to tear away which she cares about, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Ed Henry in Washington tonight. Joining us now with reaction, author of the bestseller, \"Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback,\" former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, Newt Gingrich. We are seeing, Mr. Speaker that it seems the left -- if it's about Russia collusion, it doesn't matter, only if a Trump collusion. Not Hillary paying for Russian lies. If it's about sexual assault or harassment it's only if it's Kavanaugh or hurt the Republicans but not if it's Keith Ellison or maybe Cory Booker, an allegation against him. You know, in this particular case all the outrageous rhetoric and conduct we've witnessed over the last month and since Trump has been president, I think a lot about blowing up the White House, et cetera. Severed heads. It seems that they only care if it's against them and not Republicans or the president. Do you see that same pattern? NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, sure the patterns -- I thought Eric Trump was close to perfect in the way he outlined the situation. Look, we believe in the rule of law. We believe in the rule of law at the border, which is where we are concerned about the caravans. We believe in the rule of law in terms of our internal politics. Anyone who engages in an effort to use violence in this kind of a setting should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. We have to send a signal to every crazy person who's out there and every extremist on both sides that this is not tolerable. I don't care who your target, whether it's Steve Scalise home of Republican whip who was shot or whether it's somebody getting a bomb in their home. We have to come together as a country and say we are going to have huge fights of a policy but we are not going to tolerate lawbreakers, starting with people who literally threaten the lives of other people. And I think whoever is doing this, the president is exactly right. We have to track them down, lock them up, and we frankly should make an example of them. They should have maximum penalty under the law-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But we've seen the build up to this-- GINGRICH: -- to send a signal. HANNITY: We've seen the rhetoric, Maxine Waters and so many others. And we've seen all the confrontations. People run out of restaurants. You know, women run out of restaurants. We saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy and Ted Cruz and his wife. Pam Bondi, Secretary Nielsen, Sarah Sanders. You don't see the same intensity if it's a Republican. GINGRICH: No, because the elite media doesn't feel the same affections. But I would make the same argument. I think somebody who trespasses in a restaurant as they did against Mitch McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, they should be prosecuted for trespass to the fullest extent of the local law. I think somebody who -- the people who went after Kevin McCarthy should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We have to reassert that the rule of law is paramount, it's what makes us the most unique country in the world and people can have strong language. They cannot have strong actions. And I think we cannot tolerate the stuff-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But we can't have as people saying if you see them, you follow them into department stores and restaurants and grocery stores and you tell them they are wanted anywhere anymore. That's what we've been hearing. GINGRICH: Look, I think is perfectly appropriate to say to Maxine Waters are you prepared to admit that what you said was wrong, to say to Hillary Clinton about the comment the other day out, are you prepared to admit that that was wrong? To say to the former attorney general who said kick them when they're down. Are you prepared to say that's wrong? I'm all for that. HANNITY: Yes. GINGRICH: But I'm also for establishing a really life and death decision - - and by the way, this is exactly why I feel so strongly about the border. We have to reassert the rule of law in this country. We have to mean it and we have to go after people who violate it. HANNITY: Mr. Speaker, you said this election, 13 days, two weeks from tonight people will be, people will be watching the results come in. I'm sure many in this audience don't want to hear the word speaker-elect Pelosi or Senate majority-elect Schumer. You've been saying it's about Kavanaugh, caravan. I would add to that also about mobs that we've been witnessing and I'd add one other thing, are you better off than you were two years ago? Because by every objective measure we are better off economically and security wise. GINGRICH: Look, I think the theme of jobs not mobs is a good one. I want to give you a surprising idea. We are more likely to have 57 Republican senators than we ought to have Schumer as the majority leader. That's how big the opportunity is. HANNITY: You are confident. I'm less confident about the House 13 days out. Why are you confident? GINGRICH: Well, I'm very confident about the Senate. I think the Senate, basically, Mitch McConnell is going to be the leader. The House is still a fight. I like what Kevin McCarthy has done. I like his proposal to have a vote on strengthening the border. I think that every single day I watch we get better, we get stronger. Barbara Comstock is now stronger in Northern Virginia than she was a week ago. I see this everywhere I turn around the country. We are gaining ground. People are coming home, and frankly, a lot of folks who weren't sure are looking at things like 7,000 people in the caravan coming north to try to attack the United States-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: It's up to 14. GINGRICH: -- and they are deciding that the Democrats are just plain wrong. HANNITY: If we think about this, Mr. Speaker, if we actually had the wall built we wouldn't have this issue. On either side. GINGRICH: Sure. HANNITY: You know, all right. Mr. Speaker-- (CROSSTALK) GINGRICH: Look, a speaker-- HANNITY: Two weeks from tonight we'll be talking about those results. You either going to have a total victory, maybe split decision, or you are not going to be happy. The American people have the power to shock the world again. All right. When we come back, speaking of that migrant caravan, now as it grows to 14,000, making its way through Mexico and towards the U.S., Sara Carter was down and just returned from Guatemala. She will join us with Michelle Malkin. That's next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. TRUMP: When our country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching and they openly say we are going to go into the country, we can't do that. We can't do that. Can't allow that. It's unfair to you, but it's also unfair to thousands and thousands of people that have gone through a legal process, some are waiting in line 10 years. Everything is perfect and they don't get in but other people just march right in. It will not happen, you watch. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. That was the president tonight in Wisconsin continuing to stress our border security. Joining us now with reaction, CRTV host, award-winning show, Michelle Malkin Investigates, Michelle Malkin, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. She just returned from the caravan in Guatemala. You were reporting last night, Sara, that in fact you did see MS-13 gang members infiltrating this caravan in spite of people saying no. How do you know they were MS-13 and what else did you see? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, some of the people within the caravan were actually tattooed with MS-13 markings. They were-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Well, that would pretty much give it away I think, yes. That will do it. CARTER: That would give it away. Yes. It wasn't the majority of people, though, Sean. But what I can tell you was that the majority of people that were in the caravan and the people I interviewed on the ground there were men. There were a few hundred women. This was the tip of the spear as I call it on the border of Honduras and Guatemala when the second big wave came through. So, I was right there as the second big wave crossed into Chiquimulilla, Guatemala and they were making their way through Guatemala, through the migration services as well as the Guatemalan defense personnel that were on the ground and law enforcement. There was little they could do. Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua have basically a system set up like the European Union where people with papers can travel back and forth freely. One of the things the Guatemalan government did do while I was down there was tell a number of the people look, we have buses, the United States is not going to let you in. You are in for a treacherous track to the U.S. It could be extraordinarily dangerous to your children, to the few children that were there. But the men that were there appeared to be well coordinated, organized. HANNITY: Yes. CARTER: According to Guatemalan intelligence this was an organized effort coming out of Honduras to move people through to the U.S. border and now we know it's about 14,000 people that are heading that way. HANNITY: Well, the scary thing is -- Michelle, you wrote a book, I don't remember what the year was but it was called \"Invasion.\" MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, CRTV: Yes. HANNITY: They get to this border. If there is any crisis at our border we have laws, we are a constitutional republic. We have -- we need border security. If we had the wall up we wouldn't have this problem. MALKIN: That's right. HANNITY: I'm praying Mexico does their job. It's their job now to send them back. MALKIN: It is. And I wrote \"Invasion\" in 2002. So, little has changed and the manufactured migratory chaos that we are seeing is a result of many factors and a lot of it is malfeasance on the part of certain governments and it is good to hear that at least Guatemala is making some effort. We will see what Mexico is going to do. The thing is if you read the Mexican Constitution and you know anything about their own immigration policies, in theory at least-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: They put you in jail and then they send you home immediately and then they lecture us that we are not being nice. MALKIN: Exactly. Exactly. And its hypocrisy, isn't it. I think that it does behoove us to remind everybody as President Trumpet did, that this is not just a national security issue. This is not just a matter of rule of law invoking article four section four of the Constitution which says it is the obligation of the federal government to protect each and every one of the states against, what, invasion. That's why I named my book \"Invasion\" 16 years ago. But also, an issue of justice and equity. And I'm so glad that President Trump speaks up for all of the families here and around the world that follow the rule of law in order to honor that country that we all have benefited from. My family is that-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Sara-- MALKIN: -- the American dream. HANNITY: We run out of time. MALKIN: And we want to protect the brothers who follow the law. HANNITY: How long will it take them to walk to the United States? Because I hear Mexico is shutting down all public transportation. CARTER: That's tight. It's going to take them sometime. I'm hearing from weeks to four weeks to get there for the first wave to actually arrive. Remember, Sean, they are actually coming through with drug traffickers, they are putting their people in as well. So, this is swelling in Mexico as well. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: We can't let that happen. CARTER: That's what's happening. HANNITY: Sara, Michelle, thank you both. More \"Hannity\" right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Thirteen days from tonight, you have a choice. In the House, if you don't vote for a Republican, that's a half a vote for Pelosi. If you vote for the Democrat, left a full vote for Pelosi. Thirteen days from now we'll be talking about the results. In all these Senate races a vote for any Democrat is a vote for Schumer. By the way Joe Manchin is down too in West Virginia. Well, all those breaking news tomorrow. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is standing by. She is in the sewer, the swamp, known as D.C.\n\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

            "article_content": "FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok, testifies before a House Judiciary Committee joint hearing on \"oversight of FBI and Department of Justice actions surrounding the 2016 election\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, July 12, 2018. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet?\u00a0Click\u00a0here. Developing now, Friday, July 13,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY - STRZOK\u00a0INTERROGATED -\u00a0FBI official\u00a0Peter Strzok's first public hearing erupted into a heated political fracas on Thursday, as Republicans clashed with Democrats as well as the former investigator over his anti-Trump texts -- and even threatened him with\u00a0contempt for initially refusing to answer questions on the Russia probe ... Throughout it all, Strzok\u00a0remained defiant and maintained that he did not show bias in those infamous messages with former FBI lawyer - and his ex-lover -\u00a0Lisa Page. He said that while he had his own political opinions, they did not impact his official investigative actions in the\u00a0Hillary Clinton and Russian meddling probe. Republicans sharply disputed that assessment, with Rep. Darrell Issa later making Strzok read examples of those texts aloud. Among them, Strzok read one message where he called Trump a \"disaster,\" and another calling him an \"idiot.\"\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the most explosive and personal exchange took place when Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, asked the \"smirking\" Strzok whether he was lying under oath the same way he \"lied\" to his wife while he carried on an affair with\u00a0Page. Democrats immediately erupted into more objections, with one yelling, \"Mr. Chairman, this is intolerable harassment of the witness\" and another calling out, \"You need your medication.\" CLOSED-DOOR DEPOSITION: One day after disgraced agent Peter Strzok's explosive public interrogation, former FBI attorney Lisa Page is expected\u00a0to appear for a private interview before House committees on Friday ...\u00a0Page defied a congressionally issued subpoena to appear Wednesday for a closed-door deposition before the same committees. Late Tuesday night, Page\u2019s legal team\u00a0said she would not testify because she needed more time to prepare.\u00a0House Republicans then\u00a0sent a letter to Page\u2019s attorney on Wednesday, laying out three options for her: Show up at Thursday\u2019s public hearing alongside Strzok, attend a closed-door deposition on Friday or face contempt of Congress proceedings. 'SHE DIDN\u2019T LISTEN TO ME':\u00a0President Trump criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of Brexit on Thursday, telling the Sun newspaper that her plan was \"very unfortunate\" and would \"probably\" kill any possible trade deal between the U.S. and Britain. ... Trump's\u00a0comments could be seen as a body blow to May's government, which is struggling to steady itself. Two key Cabinet members -- including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -- resigned in protest earlier this week over her plan to keep Britain and the European Union in a free market for goods, with a more distant relationship for services.\u00a0When asked about the ongoing negotiations between May's government and the EU over the terms of their divorce, Trump told the Sun: \"I would have done it much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn\u2019t agree, she didn\u2019t listen to me.\" Trump also had harsh words for current London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a fervent critic of the president, saying Khan \"has done a terrible job\" running Europe's third-largest city.\u00a0\"I think he has done a very bad job on terrorism. I think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.\"\u00a0The president also warned that Britain and Europe were \"losing its culture\" due to mass migration. Trump's comments came as widespread protests of Trump's visit were expected in London on Friday.\u00a0Over the weekend, the president\u00a0will\u00a0head to one of his golf resorts in Scotland. Trump will\u00a0meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday in a closely watched summit\u00a0in the finale of his European\u00a0trip. DEMS BLUFFING OVER ICE? -\u00a0Democrats who drafted a bill to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] suddenly announced Thursday night that they would vote against it if the legislation went to the floor, after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News he intended to call their bluff ...\u00a0\"We know Speaker [Paul] Ryan is not serious about passing our 'Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act,' so members of Congress, advocacy groups, and impacted communities will not engage in this political stunt,\" Reps. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Adriano Espaillat of New York told the Hill and other news outlets. \"If Speaker Ryan puts our bill on the floor, we plan to vote no and will instead use the opportunity to force an urgently needed and long-overdue conversation on the House floor.\" Democrats have long pushed back on the administration\u2019s immigration policies but tensions have escalated in the past month over family separations at the border. Calls from some far-left lawmakers to abolish ICE have grown ahead of the November elections.

            "article_content": "Eric Trump compares attacks against his family to criticisms of the press, discusses high-stakes midterm elections on 'Hannity.' This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" August 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Busy news night. So, with zero evidence of cropping up in Russia-Trump collusion, 442 days of stupidity into this Mueller partisan return, well, your mainstream corrupt media is literally in this country desperately searching for a new crisis every second of every day. This time, they are trying to focus their attention on their favorite topic, oh, themselves. They are narcissistic. And one particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake new CNN is so openly concerned the president's rhetoric could endanger members of the media. But we're going to show you how the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, absolutely decimated this person -- we'll tell you about it in a minute -- during today's very tense briefing. Plus, we're going to help remind the anti-Trump fake news CNN network why so many Americans chant at you that you suck. Americans don't trust your abusively biased coverage. And despite the constant stream of negative, negative coverage from the media -- well, the president's poll numbers are growing higher and higher, which, by the way, comes as the administration is now combating, quote, Russia election meddling in a big way, something that Obama failed to actually do! Obama said this couldn't happen in this country. Trump needs to focus on getting voters and stop whining. OK. Moments ago, by the way, the president wrapped up a massive rally in Pennsylvania. We'll show you those best moments. We also have the very latest details, day three of the Paul Manafort trial of the century, a 2005 tax case. Sit tight, buckle up, it's almost Friday. Time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue. We're glad you're with us. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. Those crisis peddlers are at it again. Your mainstream, destroy-Trump-media has constantly tried and constantly failed to sink the Trump presidency. Night after night, they are pushing scandal after scandal. It's day after day, and now, it has come full circle. Now, tonight, the outrage of the day is centered around members of the media talking about themselves and their own little bubble. And how some believe that they president's rhetoric and conservative rhetoric, people chanting at them, any criticism against them actually is putting them in danger. All right. Let's be very clear, get it off the table, as I said last night. Violence against any member of the press, frankly anybody, is reprehensible. No one that I don't know, no real conservative, whatever call for or support any violence against the media. But I also said last night I'd be the first person to jump in and personally defend any journalist who was attacked anywhere in the country. By the way, I trained five days, hard, MMA. Frankly, I think I'd be an asset to them. And I'm pretty confident I could be effective. But let's also be clear. The fact that the people of this country are so fed up with their bias, they are lying, it's not a call for violence at all. As a matter of fact, it's actually freedom of speech, and our duty to call out blatant lies, fake news, for what it is. It's no surprise that you, the American people, no longer trust the so- called mainstream media. Here's just one recent example. Today, the Trump-hating New York Times, the so-called paper of record, they actually defended the hiring of a person who wants to tweeted, quote, #cancelwhitepeople and, quote, are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to leave underground like groveling goblins? And, quote, I was equating Trump to Hitler before it was cool. That's The New York Times. Why would- with the American people trust any organization that proudly hires that person? And today, the president tweeted, quote: They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the fake news, which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people. Now, the press is absolutely a vital part of any democracy. Their rights are guaranteed in our Constitution, but so are the rights of freedom of speech, and the president calling them out for the lies that they tell. And the American people also have a right and when they know a network is feeding them lies, propaganda, misinformation, every single second of every single minute of every single day, week after week, month after month, year after year, they are right to call them out. In fact, once so-called news network is so blinded by this anti-Trump derangement rage that they have, they don't even remember how destructive, how aggressive, how insane, how pathological their own rhetoric was even before day one of the Trump presidency. But we've got the videotape to remind you. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, CNN, MAY 17, 2016: What he's done is create a lot of hatred and hostility between groups in this country after a half-century of us trying to bring people together. BRIAN STELTER, CNN, MAY 29, 2016: Are the talking heads missing something when they put it all on the economy? What about racial anxiety is a factor? The Arizona Republic getting so many death threats over an endorsement is an example of how overheated the rhetoric is. Another example out of North Carolina today, the firebombing of a local GOP office. But that kind of action is unacceptable, and we need to have the temperature come down on all sides right now. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is raising the temperature at this moment in time. VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 11, 2016: I think that if there's one thing that Donald Trump could do now that might calm some people. We are on track for a tragedy. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: No, we are on the track for the best economic recovery we've had in 15 years. So, as you can see, fake news CNN quick to lower the level of discourse in this country. That was the same guy that said this is a white lash. But that didn't CNN's so-called chief White House correspondent, the king of lies, the king of fake news, Jimmy Acosta, from trying to self- righteously seize the moral high ground at today's press briefing. By the way, he didn't win this round. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I think it would be a good thing if you were to say right here at this briefing that the press, the people who are gathered in this room right now, are doing their jobs every day, asking questions of officials like the ones you brought forward earlier, are not the enemy of the people. I think we deserve that. SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the president has made his position known. I also think it's ironic -- I'm trying to answer your question. I politely waited and called on you despite the fact that you interrupted me while I was calling on your colleague. I said it's ironic -- (CROSSTALK) ACOSTA: Which is I interrupted. If you finish, if you would not mind letting me having a follow-up, that would be fine. SANDERS: It's ironic, Jim, that not only you and the media attacked the president for his rhetoric when they frequently lower the level of conversation in this country. Repeatedly, repeatedly the media resorts to personal attacks without any content other than to incite anger. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Boom, checkmate. Sarah Sanders, she then helped remind fake news Jim Acosta about the real enablers of violence during this powerful beat down. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS: The media has attacked me personally on a number of occasions, including your own network, said I should be harassed as a life sentence, that I should be choked. ICE officials are not welcome in their places of worship and personal information that's shared on the Internet. When I was hosted by the correspondents association, of which all of you are members of, you brought a comedian up to attack my appearance and call me a traitor to my own gender. In fact, as I know, as far as I know, I'm the first press secretary in the history of United States that that is required to Secret Service protections. The media continues to ratchet it up, the verbal assaults against the president and everyone in this administration. And certainly, we have a role to play, but the media has a role to play for the discourse in this country as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Checkmate, Sarah Sanders. As you can see, there are real acts of violence, harassment, aggression, it happens every day. There are a lot of nuts out there. I know personally. Like so many in the public eye, I've had numerous death threats over the years, white powder mailed to my office and guess what? None of that is fun. And I'll be the first to stand up and say everybody has a right to freedom of speech. But saying that you're a liar and calling out fake news is only words. Nobody is supporting any violence. So don't make accusations that are untrue. Many in the media -- they're all too happy to play down violence that have been over the years perpetrated against conservatives, for example, just the day, a man arrested after leaving Majority Whip Steve Scalise a threatening voice mail. Remember, 2017, Steve Scalise, Republican, was shot by a deranged Bernie Sanders reporter. Remember, the biased press assigning blame for that violence, nor did I. You can't hold one psycho accountable and attributed some of the person. Now, remember, during the Obama administration, no member of the mainstream media feared for their lives or blamed Obama for random acts of violence against conservatives because he said things like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) THEN-SEN. BARACK OBAMA, AUG. 5, 2008: I might have to put Mr. Burgess on Fox News. You know, I'll put -- I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. He'll tear him up. OBAMA, SEPT. 17, 2008: I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them whether they are independent, or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Sean Hannity goes high. They go low. Tear me up? Oh. Get in their face? Wow. As you can see, although the end moral outrage coming from many in the media is just one more fake crisis that is being concocted and posed by the fake news media, people that are just hell-bent, waking up every day, and maligning the president, every minute, every second, every day, every week. And despite all this, the president -- well, he is pulling better than any before. Rasmussen poll out today, the president's approval rating now stands at a solid 50 percent, which incidentally is five points higher than Obama during the same time frame. This is huge news with the midterms just around the corner. And earlier tonight, during his rally in Pennsylvania, the president, well, and the abusively biased press, he took them on and so much more. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are doing better in all of these estates then we did on election night. Much better. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Despite only negative publicity, only negative stories from the fakers back there. Whatever happened to fair press? Whatever happened to honest reporters? (BOOS) I was asked to have tea with the queen, who was incredible, by the way. So I was about 15 minutes early and I am waiting with my wife and that's fine. Hey, it's the queen, right? We can wait. We then go up and we have tea, and I didn't know this. It was supposed to last for 15 minutes but it lasted for, like, an hour because we got along. We got along. So here was the story by the fake news: the president was 15 minutes late for the queen. Wrong. (BOOS) And then -- here's the rest of the story -- no, here's the rest. Here's the rest of the story. So, they said I was late when I was actually early. Number one. Number two, I guess the meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, and it lasted for almost an hour. The president overstayed. But they can make anything bad because they are the fake, fake, disgusting news. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And the president also addressed immigration. By the way, a shout-out to Rush Limbaugh and yours truly. I was shocked. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: We are fighting a war. We are fighting a war on drugs. They are bringing in drugs. They are bringing in lots of bad people. We are getting the hell -- we're stopping it. So we are going to be taking some very tough actions. I don't know if it's before the election or after the election. You know, a lot of the Republicans essay -- and they are good. We need more Republicans, but they are friends of mine, they say, president, you know -- some of them are really tough guys. They said, sir, we are better off if we wait until after. It's better before, let's do it before. Sir, we're better off -- you know who thinks it should be before? Rush Limbaugh thinks it should be before. (CHEERS) Before the election. You know who else? Sean Hannity. A lot of them. A lot of them. (CHEERS) Great people. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Do it before. We're 96 days away. This is -- and I am, this is not hyperbole -- this is real. The single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Look at your screen. That is their agenda. Take a look. What do they want to do? They want to impeach this president, but don't say it. What else? They want their crumbs back. What else? They want to get rid of ICE and open borders. And what else? Oh, they want to block the Supreme Court nominee and to end the investigations into the corrupt deep state. It's only been 18 months. Obama gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in property, lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, worst recovery since the '40s, 51-year low in homeownership rate. He accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. And he tried to bribe the mullahs in Iran that say \"death to America, death to Israel\" with $150 in cash and other currency. He let us Assad across his phony red line in the sand. And Russia -- well, it was totally unchecked. Oh, nobody can influence our elections, Devin Nunes warned about it in 2014. Oh, and President Trump needs to stop whining. No one can do it, no serious person believes that. And many on the left and the media today are constantly, constantly just obsessing about Russia, Russia, Russia. The Trump administration has been ten times stronger than anything Obama did and after eight years of ignoring the hostile regime of Russia, the bad actor Putin, this president is actually taking potential election meddling seriously. Look at the presser from earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Since January 2017, the president has taken decisive action to defend our election systems from meddling and interference. This includes measures to heighten the security and resilience of election systems and processes, to confront Russian and other foreign maligned influence in the United States. KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: The progress we have made is real and the nation's elections are more resilient today because of the work we are all doing. But we must continue to ensure that our democracy is protected. DAN COATS, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: What we see is the Russians are looking for every opportunity, regardless of party, regardless of whether or not it applies to the election, to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values. CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Any moment is just a moment before, you know, that dial can be turned up one, much as we saw in 2016. Again, not in terms of affecting the vote count but in terms of potential penetration of voter registration databases or something like that. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: The president is countering Russia but your corrupt media is more focused on covering the trial of the century, Paul Manafort, because of a tax issue from 2005. A case not about Russia, not about the 2016 campaign, not about President Trump. He didn't know him then. It's not about collusion. Robert Mueller, what the hell is this? And sadly, like every federal case, chances are high they will try again, they can indict a ham sandwich and get a ham sandwich guilty. But so far, Mueller's legal team is facing pretty stiff pushback from Judge Ellis who's presiding over that trial, after some speculation that the prosecution wouldn't even call their star witness, and that's former Manafort business partner Rick Gates. Ellis reprimanded Team Mueller and saying they can't prove conspiracy without him. And he's also consistently pushed back on the prosecution's criminalizations of the fact that the guy is wealthy. It's not a crime to be rich or spend money. We'll monitor this trial. But remember it was Ellis that said they are putting the screws to Manafort so that he'll sing or compose so they can either -- oh -- prosecute or impeach Donald Trump. Now, this has a zero impact on the president, not about him. Mueller tried and failed to turn the screws on Manafort, and guess what? Nothing. Anyway, joining us now from the Trump Organization, he's the son of the president, Eric Trump. How are you? Good to see you. ERIC TRUMP, SON OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: That was a especially incredible monologue. HANNITY: Thank you. I'm sorry for making you sit through this. TRUMP: It's so well-done. HANNITY: Look, let me -- you dealt with this in my campaign, you deal with this every day, you see they lie about your father. They twist, they turn, but they wake up and feign all this moral outrage. I got -- I would think, as a son, it's hard, but you also know they are lying. TRUMP: The hypocrisy is unlike anything you can imagine, right? You have them attacking Baron. You have them attacking Tiffany. You have them attacking our entire family. You have them out there spewing garbage every single day on CNN and all these other networks about my father, right? Covering nonsense while forgetting about the fact that our economy grew 4.1 percent, that we have the lowest unemployment in history, that jobs are coming back to the country, that the stock market is at a record high. They forget all about that. HANNITY: Defeat ISIS, got out of Iran, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, oh, and little rocket man is not firing rockets. TRUMP: So, they spew nonsense all day and then little Jim Acosta gets belittled at a rally and all of a sudden, you know, I'm holier than -- I mean, it's really incredible. HANNITY: Eric, without -- has your family been threatened? TRUMP: I've been threatened. Our family has been threatened. HANNITY: Don has been threatened. TRUMP: All of us, we've all had white powder show up at our house. HANNITY: By the way, I've insisted that they had to one day just quarantine the poor system for eight hours because of that. TRUMP: And by the way, there is no moral outrage about that, right? When Ben Shapiro goes to Berkeley to try and give a speech, right, and there's protests in the street, there is no moral outrage about that. You know, let the men have freedom of speech. Let him go out there and speak to people who want to listen to him. But when it happens to them, when they are offended by a method, all of a sudden -- HANNITY: Did you see what they said about Melania, a Democratic candidate, this week? What they said about both to your sisters? TRUMP: And you know, how much of this reported, that comment about Melania, which was one of the truly most disgusting thing -- HANNITY: Disgusting, yes. TRUMP: -- you know they said about that? Nothing. The only person who actually really, you know, came to Melania's defense? It was Laura Ingraham. Laura came out and she was punching and she was punching -- HANNITY: Excuse me, hello? TRUMP: And you. HANNITY: OK, hello, I'm here. TRUMP: But you know what? HANNITY: Yes. TRUMP: No one else in the media. HANNITY: By the way, she is the loveliest woman. TRUMP: It's true. HANNITY: Your little brother is a great kid. Why does he have to turn on the television set with a decapitated, blood severed head of your father? TRUMP: Yes. HANNITY: And, by the way, that person was employed by CNN at the time. TRUMP: And no one ever said anything about it. A couple people chanted \"CNN sucks\", right, CNN sucks because of this biased coverage and everything else. All of a sudden, everybody starts crying. It's really incredible, Sean. HANNITY: CNN sucks. TRUMP: Yes, I agree. HANNITY: The problem with them -- and I tried to give them advice. Of course, they're not going to listen -- is I don't even think -- it's sort of like I was watching Peter Strzok that day and he seems like he believes he's a super patriot, he knew better than the American people. We are going to stop them, insurance policy, we need to go to the bottom of that. And, of course, we will come eventually. But it's sort of like the media, they never thought he could win, they mock that he was running, he beat 16 other people, he beat the Hillary Clinton machine, even with the fixed in and an investigation into her, and one against him -- TRUMP: Now they downplay it. Now, they downplay it. You know, it's really amazing. During the campaign, my father said, you know what, my biggest goal, if I could achieve 3 percent GDP growth, I would absolutely love, right? So, now he's at 4.1 percent GDP growth, right? And they're not even touting that. They're not even -- they were mocking him when he said he could achieve three. You'll never achieve three. \"The New York Times\" came out and said he will never achieve 3 percent GDP growth. Economists think he is lying about that. Then he achieves 4.1 percent growth and they don't even complement him on doing it. I mean, they forget about it. HANNITY: I actually think if he cured cancer, they still hate him. TRUMP: No, they wouldn't give him credit. Of course not. HANNITY: OK. So, the question is, it seems likely people are now aware of what the media's agenda is. So, to me, this midterm is about the six items I just mentioned. You were even working on 2020 already. But we got an election in 96 days. What do you say to those people that may be only go out for presidential elections and there is a lower turnout in midterm election years? TRUMP: Well, listen, I think we're going to do very, very well. And I think this country, by every quantifiable measure, is doing better today than it's ever done before. People are seeing that. I think -- listen, you started the opening monologue with the fact that he's above 50 percent in the polls right now, right? HANNITY: I think he polls lower too. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: His highest ever. I think you are right, there's probably extra factors in there. Our economy is doing incredible. Our stock markets are off the charts. He's actually defending this country from NATO, from getting ripped off. HANNITY: Trade deals. TRUMP: Unemployment, trade deals, everything. The deal he struck with the E.U. last week. I mean -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Imagine you are a deposition, things are getting better, and what America does well, the Democrats and the left-wing media, they are mad because they are proven wrong. TRUMP: They should be mad. They should be mad because right now, they have nothing to run on. They have no leadership. They have no message. They don't stand for anything. He is doing well by every quantifiable measures so the only thing they can do is, he's a racist, he's sexist, he's a this, he's a that, right? The same sound bite they've used for three years that hasn't worked at all. HANNITY: They've used it for 30 years. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: What do they stand for? They stand for what, high taxes? Is that what they stand for? They stand for -- HANNITY: Or the crumbs. TRUMP: -- getting rid of -- yes. HANNITY: Open borders, ObamaCare. TRUMP: Open borders, getting rid of ICE, brave men and women who are fighting for the safety of our families, of our children every single day, is that what they are going for? They're going to lose out all day long, Sean. They're going to lose out all day long. HANNITY: Great to see you. Congrats on the baby, too. I saw a picture of your baby. Very cute. TRUMP: Thank you. HANNITY: Looks like your mom. TRUMP: Good. HANNITY: Yes. All right. When we come back, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the great one, Mark Levin, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Republicans just passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. And the Democrats want to lift them way up. Remember that. When you go to vote, they want to end your tax cuts and they want to lift it up so they can waste your money on a lot of nonsense. (BOOS) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. That was President Trump earlier tonight at his Pennsylvania rally. Joining us know, the author of The New York Times best seller, \"Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. You know districts as well, if not better, than anybody I know. I reminded his audience that I was the emcee the night you became speaker. It was the first time that Republicans took the House in 40 years. So, in off year elections, midyear elections, the power -- the party in power of the White House usually loses on average 15 seats. Some years it's more, some years it's even a little less. There are 100 competitive races, 86 are deemed Republicans defend districts. That's a lot of defending. They got a win 61 of those seats, and three of the 14 Democratic seats that are in play. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Look, I think we have two futures this fall. Back in October of 2016 when you and I were among the very few people who thought Donald Trump could win, and all the same experts, everybody right now who is talking about a blue wave, who's convinced Hillary is going to win, just go back and pull up the clips and the quotes. It's embarrassing. Now, what happened? Well, what happened was Trump had the goods to fight it out. He had the guts to go nose to nose with Hillary, had the guts to take on the elite media, he had the guts, no matter what the poll said, to campaign five or six or seven rallies a day. So, where are the House Republicans? This is not complicated. I've done this my whole life. Joe Gaylord and I, and, you know, Joe designed the '94 campaign, writing a brief paper right now to say to House Republicans, you know, suck it up. If you are prepared to go nose to nose with the left and you're prepared to tell the truth, and you're willing to wage a national campaign, you want open borders or do you want to control who comes in the U.S., including MS- 13 gangsters? Do you want really great economy, really great growth? Or do you want to go back to food stamps, dependency, big government, et cetera? Go down the list. We have a chance here for historic election, to give the American people an honest choice between a radical, extremist Democratic Party in which the progressive wing is gradually being destroyed by the radical extremists, or they can try to appease the elites. And I tell you, if they run a district by district campaign, they will lose the House. It is impossible in the modern era. You are proof of it. Rush Limbaugh is proof of it. You are in 435 districts every day. And so Republicans have got to decide they are to win the fight, they are going to the win the argument. They got all of the issues on their side. But the question is, do they have the courage? HANNITY: Let me ask you this. So, the president tweets out about Robert Mueller, he tweets out about Jeff Sessions about the witch hunt. He was very clear in saying that no it's fake news. Most media is not the enemy of the people but the fake news ones are because they don't tell the American people the truth. What does the president do -- how do you -- how should he be dealing with this cloud that has been hovering over his head with no evidence whatsoever? Like for example, Paul Manafort, there is nothing about Russia, nothing about the president, nothing about the campaign, and nothing about collusion. It was a 2005 tax case was Hillary Clinton has never indicted. How does he navigate what he believes and what I also agree with his unfair witch hunt leading into this mid-term? GINGRICH: Look, I think he can do three things to be very decisive and that would change the whole picture. The first is, let me point to everybody in the audience, 98 or 99 percent of what Mueller is doing is not covered by Sessions recusal over the Russian campaign incident. Ninety eight of 99 percent. Sessions if he did his job could intervene tonight or tomorrow and would be totally within his authority. Ad he should. Number two, the president will take every example we are talking about and simply declassify. I mean, I want to see every decision memo about Benghazi where the Obama team consciously decided lie to the American people. I want to see all the decision memos about Hillary Clinton. The president can order them released. I mean, he has to do it by executive orders and say I want them out by next Thursday. Don't give me this baloney about it's going to take 22 years. Get them out. Third, I think we ought to look very carefully at what this case is all about. Mueller has a bunch of very left wing Democrats. They are totally a hunting party. And I think the president should challenge Mueller head on. Mueller, he should say to the president -- or he should say to Mueller, I dare you to hold a press conference. And tell the American people any evidence you have that you think is relevant to why you originally hide? Give us any evidence you have. Because I don't think Mueller has any evidence. And I think it would be embarrassing at how little he knows-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I think this Manafort case. GINGRICH: What he's done is he's gone over there. HANNITY: I think that's embarrassing. A 2005 tax case. The judge even said put the screws to him so he sings or composes to either prosecute or impeach Trump. Let's not kid ourselves. And the judge said that to Mueller's team. All right. Mr. Speaker, good to see you. As always, thanks for being with us. All right. When we come back, the great one. Mark Levin he wants to weigh in on all things Mueller, Manafort and much more, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We are hindered by the Russian hoax. It's a hoax, OK? I will tell you what. Russia is very unhappy that Trump won. That I can tell you. I was the one that let out 60 diplomats. I was the one that complained about the fact that Germany is paying billions of dollars for a ridiculous pipeline coming into Germany. They're paying billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. I was the one that complained about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. That was the president just a short time ago his rally in Pennsylvania ripping the Russia hoax. And just moments ago, President Trump he arrived at Morristown airport in New Jersey. As I believe he is headed for Bedminster. Joining us now with reaction on this and so much more is the host of the number one rated cable show 10 o'clock on Sunday evenings, Life, Liberty, and Levine. Thank me. God bless us, and the host of CR TV -- CR TV Levin TV. (CROSSTALK) MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: Liberty and Levin. Levin TV. HANNITY: Who has an entire network named after them except you? LEVIN: Yes. HANNITY: How are you, my friend? LEVIN: I'm doing great. How are you? By the way, for five seconds I want to join you in celebrating Rush Limbaugh's 30 years who made it possible for all of us to do what we do. The man has taken more spheres and arrows and it's such a great honor to call him my friend and what he's done for this country is really incalculable. Anyway, go right ahead. HANNITY: I got to tell you, and I mean this. Without talk radio for 30 years and him leading that way and forging that path and without Fox. Honestly, let's talk about Acosta and how corrupt this news media is and a bunch of cry babies they're calling us fake news. It's like -- it's not violence. That's called freedom of speech. It's like I guess they have freedom of the press to lie like they do. LEVIN: I would say this. You know, a lot has been said about the president calling fake news the enemy of the people. I have a different take on this. Why do the press hate the American people? Over 65 million people give or take voted for Donald Trump for president of the United States. I wrote this down. Various press outlets and reporters and hosts or their guests called millions and millions of Americans Nazis, racists, deranged, cultists, deplorables and even worse. How do the press in this country justify calling tens of millions of people such outrageous names? And we conservatives have watched this the press have destroyed, they're seeks to destroy Trump, Palin, Bork, Clarence Thomas, Ronald Reagan, the list goes on and on and on. The D.C. press corps today is the least professional press corps in my lifetime. They think that their job is to make it impossible for the president to function, to sabotage him and to advance the cause of the ideologues, to advance the cause of a rogue prosecutor by the name Bob Mueller. And so, the press really needs to be circumspect, to take a look at itself. It won't. As long as they keep putting clowns like Jim Acosta out there who is a drama queen of sorts and who like to report on themselves and talk about themselves. As long as it's impossible to tell a late night comedian from Jake Tapper, and Jake Tapper from the porn star and all the rest of it. This is going to be the reaction of the American people. HANNITY: Well, if it wasn't so important. This is where, you know, thank God the American people have choices. We are part of it. It's an honor. And I feel blessed to be able to do this. As I know you do. Let me ask you this and let you put on your attorney's hat for a minute. For those who don't know you were the chief of staff for I think one of the greatest attorney generals ever and that was Edwin Meese. Why would they ever allow an illegitimate investigation run by Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors to interview President Trump when there is no evidence, collusion is not a crime, no evidence whatsoever. It's been a witch hunt from day one. Look at what they are doing with Manafort. LEVIN: I think Attorney General Meese at this point would have stepped down. I honestly do. And Newt Gingrich was on to something there. Much of the power being exercised by the deputy attorney general or the attorney general has nothing to do with Jeff Sessions' recusal. Jeff Sessions won't be attacked by the media as long as he is quiet. But the minute he speaks up or does something, he will be attacked. Look, the Manafort trial -- here's what I don't get. Most of the issues they're raising if he did all of these things, bank fraud, embezzlement, tax fraud and all the rest, and he did it during the Obama administration. Who was the FBI director? Mueller. Mueller was the FBI director. He did nothing about it apparently when he was the FBI director. Apparently they didn't know anything. So now Manafort is the campaign chairman for Donald Trump and they throw 17 left wing Democrat prosecutors at the guy who worked for the special counsel. That is a matter for the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. That's number one. Now, Mueller is pushing the other case into the Southern District of New York. Then they set up Lieutenant General Mike Flynn. Then they have few lesser lights here where they get for false statements o something like that. What the hell do we have the special counsel for? You want to know why? Because he wants Trump. And he wants to interview Trump. And he wants to get him on obstruction of justice. And now he is threatening here-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: A perjury trap. LEVIN: -- that -- what he is going to do you see he issue a subpoena to pull the president in front of a grand jury. Let me tell you something. Mr. Mueller, you are not the king of universe. And I hope the president's lawyers are listening to me and the president right now. Here's what he should tell Mr. Mueller. Have a meeting with him and tell him, you're unconstitutional under the appointments clause. What you are doing is unconstitutional as far as we are concerned. We are not going to bow to you. This is the Office of the President of the United States. You are a rogue prosecutor. Now get the hell out of my office and make sure the door doesn't hit you in the ass. I will see you in court. That's the beginning and the end of it as far as I'm concerned. HANNITY: Let me ask you, I'm watching this thing on Manafort. I don't know what Paul Manafort did in 2005, I don't think Donald Trump knew who Paul Manafort was in 2005. We know Judge Ellis is right-- (CROSSTALK) LEVIN: Well, apparently Mueller did when he was the FBI director at the time. HANNITY: I don't think the president knew him. I don't think anybody knew him. But they pulled this out of moth balls just to put the screws to him so they could get him to sing or compose as Judge Ellis said, so that they could prosecute or impeach Trump. In this whole tax case from '05, there will be no talk of Russia. There's going to be no talk about the campaign. There will be no talk about his work for Donald Trump. There will be no talk of collusion. This is just a -- this is just a cheap attempt to literally go after a guy they never would have gone after because they are trying at all costs to get the president. LEVIN: And so the question is, Rod Rosenstein who gives a rubber stamp to this and created this in the first place by appointing his dear friend the man he first worked for at the Justice Department, Mr. Mueller who was best friends with Comey. What a colossal disaster. You have Jeff Sessions, the man I've known for 30 years who is sitting this out. He shouldn't be sitting it out. These are constitutional issues. And quite frankly, Mr. Mueller can't keep hiding behind his 17 left wing Democratic donor prosecutors. Where the hell is Congress? I want to know what Mr. Mueller thinks he can do under our Constitution, I want to know Mr. Mueller-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Well, I have to-- LEVIN: -- thinks he can do and under this two Department of Justice memos as well. HANNITY: Mark, you know, when I say tick-tock something big is coming that will blow this all out of the water. Thank you for being with us, the great one, Mark Levin. When we come back, Pastor Darrell Scott he will join us, saying that the president is probably the most pro-African-American president he has seen in his lifetime. They'll be here with Daryl Parks and we've got the numbers, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You heard this but I will say it over and over because I'm really proud of it. Remember I said, what do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? African-Americans, so many others. I said, what do you have to lose? You have high crime rates, you have horrible education. You have this -- I went through a list of 10. That's what happened. African-American, Hispanic, Asian. You have the lowest level of unemployment in the history of our country. How does somebody fight that, right? How does that somebody fight that? (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The president earlier tonight talking about how unemployment numbers for minority to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Asian- Americans are the best on 14 states all record lows. Now and yesterday, a friend of the show, Pastor Darrell Scott who also serves as the CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for the Trump CEO had this to say about the president during a White House meeting with inner city pastors. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DARRELL SCOTT, FOUNDER & PASTOR, NEW SPIRIT RIVAL CHURCH: To be honest, this is probably going to be -- and I'm going to say this as the most pro- black president that we've had in our lifetime. Because and I try to, you know, analyze the people that I encounter. This president actually wants to prove something to our community. Our faith based community and our ethnic community. The last president didn't feel like he had to. He feels like he didn't have to. He got a pass. This president, this administration is probably going to be more proactive. We got urban revitalization and prison reform than any president in your lifetime. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And Pastor Darrell Scott joins us now along attorney Daryl Parks. All right, Daryl. SCOTT: Hi. HANNITY: -- the numbers are in. Simple question, is the African-American community, Hispanic community, women in the workforce, Asian-Americans best are they doing better under President Trump or did they do better under eight years of Obama? SCOTT: We don't know which Darrell you're talking to. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Darrell Scott. All right. I'm sorry! DARYL PARKS, ATTORNEY: Well, Sean, what we want to see the president really address the issue historically black colleges. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: No, no, I asked you a question. No diversion. PARKS: Well, I'm talking to the education issue, though. HANNITY: Is the African-American community and all these minority communities are they doing better under Trump or Obama? PARKS: Sean, historically black colleges are not doing better. HANNITY: OK. PARKS: Still they need base-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: How about-- PARKS: -- and not doing better. HANNITY: -- on employment and the economy? Trump or Obama? PARKS: That's what the president needs to address. But here's the challenge. What do President Trump doing to help unemployment? (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Forget the challenge. You notice, Pastor Scott, you know, Pastor, when you don't want to answer a question that kind of means I put him in a corner called checkmate. I play chess. He can't answer this question. Because he knows the answer is Trump and not Obama. Pastor Scott? SCOTT: Listen, unemployment is at an all-time low. I lived through 12 different presidents. And contemplating that fact. This president is the only one that I am aware of, and I'm aware of the prison initiatives, the urban revitalization initiatives. He is focusing and concentrating on making a concerted effort to improve the quality of living for black Americans. So it's easy for me to say what I said yesterday because, you know, I lived through a lot of different presidents. And I haven't seen any other take a pro-active stance to us black Americans like this president is doing. HANNITY: Darrell Scott? I'm sorry. Daryl Parks? PARKS: Well, let me say. I think on the pro-black issue, for example, this president has not appointed black judges, Sean. And so that point alone show me the numbers as where he's appointed black judges. HANNITY: We got millions -- we have disproportionately in the Obama years when you look at the millions more in poverty, food stamps, out of the labor force. Not buying homes. The black and Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. Now the opposite has happened and you can't even say, good job, President Trump. It's good for everybody. PARKS: Good job, President Trump. But we have other issues. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I wish you voted for President Trump now. PARKS: No. But I want to see President Trump put more blacks in his administration. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Pastor? PARKS: We don't see black faces in his administration. HANNITY: Pastor? SCOTT: But listen, listen. Attorney Parks, listen. When people asked me why aren't more blacks in the administration? I ask them, where were those blacks during the campaign? Us, blacks that were with him during the campaign were vilified, ostracized, called Uncle Tom, cahoots, sellouts, and everything else. Now all of a sudden you got black people that were told to stay away from Trump during the campaign. Now you are saying where are the black people he's supposed to have? Where were they have been? PARKS: But Pastor Scott, he could still appoint black people to his cabinet. There is no reason that blacks should not be appropriately represented in U.S. government. It's only right. HANNITY: All right. We're going to-- (CROSSTALK) SCOTT: He has Ben Carson in the Cabinet and I'm working with him. So what do you want? HANNITY: By the way, Daryl Parks, do you realize-- (CROSSTALK) PARKS: We need more than one. HANNITY: -- do you realize Pastor Scott let me preach from (Inaudible) at his church. It was the worst moment. I did terrible. All right. Thank you both. When we come back, more of the president's speech from his rally in Pennsylvania. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. During tonight's rally, President Trump talked about the new face of the Democratic Party. Let's find out who it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You know who the new star? You know who that new leader is? Maxine Waters. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP: Very low I.Q. Low I.Q. No, no, Maxine Waters is like -- she's like, their new star. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I'm not saying impeach 45. I think they had a meeting and said anyone that's saying that, don't say that but we'll do it anyway. Let's not just be honest with the American people. And they want their crumbs back. And open borders. And ObamaCare. All right. That's all the time we have left. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Ingraham, standing by. Hi. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "It\u2019s all about the race for governor in Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Maine, Nevada and South Carolina. While a couple Senate contests in states voting June 12 are considered\u00a0competitive in November's general elections, the primaries for those seats aren't quite so dramatic. In Nevada, for instance, Republican Sen. Dean Heller's seat is one of Democrats' biggest targets, with the state leaning blue, according\u00a0Fox News\u2019 ratings. But he is expected to have an easy primary battle. And Rep. Jacky Rosen is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to face Heller. In North Dakota, incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is expected to hang onto the Democratic nomination -- though that race is considered a toss-up in the fall. Heitkamp, a one-term senator considered to be her party\u2019s most vulnerable in the 2018 midterms, is likely to face Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer in November. The gubernatorial primary races, meanwhile, are stealing the Tuesday show. Read on for a look at how contentious the battles have become ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections in Maine, Nevada and South Carolina. Republicans Lt. Gov. Kevin Bryant, from left, Catherine Templeton, Gov. Henry McMaster, John Warren and Yancey McGill are all vying for the GOP nomination for governor Tuesday. (Grace Beahm Alford /The Post And Courier via AP) President Trump gave a boost to South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster with a supportive tweet the Saturday before the primary, but the 71-year-old could still be headed for a runoff after Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cHenry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning,\u201d Trump said of one of his earliest backers in the Palmetto State. \u201cHe is strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets. He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy.\u201d McMaster is the incumbent in the race, as he took over as South Carolina\u2019s governor in January 2017 when Nikki Haley was selected to be ambassador to the United Nations. According to The State newspaper, no sitting governor -- from either party -- has ever been forced into a runoff in modern-day politics in South Carolina. But former Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) leader Catherine Templeton and businessman John Warren could just make history. Lt. Gov. Kevin Bryant and former state Sen. Yancey McGill are also vying for the nomination, but it\u2019s either Warren or Templeton who could take McMaster to a runoff election, according to the Charleston Post & Courier. Templeton, an attorney, was offered a position within Trump\u2019s administration that she turned down, she said. She\u2019s faced questions about her leadership at DHEC and the state\u2019s Department of Licensing, Labor and Regulation -- and how she left those jobs -- during the campaign. Warren, a conservative businessman from Upstate South Carolina, doesn\u2019t have any experience in politics. But his service in the Marines after 9/11 and his \u201cfresh face\u201d look on politics could give him an advantage, according to the Post & Courier. The race has had plenty of twists and turns. McMaster has accused Templeton of wanting to be his running mate, a claim she\u2019s denied. And after an 18-year-old Templeton volunteer came home to about 30 McMaster campaign yard signs in her yard, Templeton campaign manager R.J. May III accused the governor\u2019s campaign of being behind the prank and asked him to apologize. McMaster\u2019s campaign has denied any involvement in the sign incident and a spokeswoman said they reached out to the teenager. Democrats aren\u2019t immune to the possibility of a runoff either. Longtime state Rep. James Smith is seen as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination -- but not before heading to a runoff, the Greenville News reported. Smith, 50, was called the \u201cgolden boy of the South Carolina Democratic establishment\u201d by The State last month. He\u2019s gotten the endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Jim Clyburn. He is a combat veteran who earned a Purple Heart for his service in Afghanistan. Smith faces Phil Noble, longtime community activist from Charleston, and Marguerite Willis, an attorney from Florence, in the primary. The race to be Nevada\u2019s first Democratic governor in two decades has made the Democratic gubernatorial primary a nasty one -- with Trump, the National Rifle Association and the Las Vegas concert shooting coming into play. Clark County Commission colleagues Christina Giunchigliani and Steve Sisolak are facing off in a close battle for the Democratic nomination. Sisolak is the chair of the powerful governing body of Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas strip and about two-thirds of Nevada\u2019s residents. The 64-year-old became a prominent figure in the wake of the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert in October. But Giunchigliani -- who goes by \u201cChris G\u201d -- has slammed Sisolak as being too moderate and has knocked him for receiving an \u201cA-\u201d rating from the NRA in 2012. Campaign ads in the race also turned personal after a PAC associated with the Clark County Education Association, which endorsed Sisolak, criticized Giunchigliani for pushing through a 2005 amendment that curtailed a proposed expansion of the state\u2019s sex offender reporting laws that would have included certain people, including teachers, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. The ad accused Giunchigliani, who was the Nevada Assembly Ways and Means Committee vice chair at the time, of having \u201csingle-handedly protected perverts,\u201d the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. In response, Giunchigliani released her own ad, titled \u201cEight Year Old,\u201d in which she said she was sexually abused for more than a year as a child. She had reportedly never spoken publicly about the abuse until this time. \u201cAs governor, I\u2019ll do everything I can to protect our children. I live with these memories. Steve Sisolak has to live with himself,\u201d she said. Giunchigliani, 63, has gotten the support from 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. In a robocall released over the weekend by Giunchigliani\u2019s campaign, Clinton calls the state legislator \u201can extraordinary progressive leader.\u201d Giunchigliani has said she would direct state funds to Planned Parenthood -- which would be a first for Nevada, according to the Review-Journal. She\u2019s also gotten backing from EMILY\u2019s List, a pro-choice women\u2019s group. Sisolak, on the other hand, has gotten the support of former Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Dina Titus, also a Democrat. Republican state Attorney General Adam Laxalt is expected to face off with either Sisolak or Giunchigliani in the fall to replace term-limited Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican. Laxalt is a former U.S. Navy lieutenant who comes from a prominent political family. He is backed by billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson. Trump praised Laxalt on social media on Tuesday, saying he is \"smart, works hard and knows how to win.\" Trump said Laxalt would \"fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime.\" All eyes, too, are on Maine\u2019s new ranked-choice voting system for Tuesday\u2019s primary. With this new voting system, where voters rank candidates in order of preference, don\u2019t expect to find out who won the primary the same night; state officials have warned it could be days before the primary results are finalized. This new system also makes the gubernatorial primaries even more of a toss-up. Republican Gov. Paul LePage is prevented from running for re-election because of term limits. On the Democrats' side, state Attorney General Janet Mills has been largely seen as the favored candidate to win, although attorney Adam Cote shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. Former House Speaker Mark Eves and well-known former Portland police officer Mark Dion are also in the race. EMILY\u2019s List has already poured at least $300,000 into the race as it backs Mills over Cote, according to the Bangor Daily News. Cote, however, has led in fundraising. As the Bangor Daily News reported, Cote and Mills have engaged in a war of campaign ads over recent weeks, each criticizing the other of being aligned with Republicans in some way or fashion. But the Republican gubernatorial candidates, too, have hit each other hard in campaign spots, according to the newspaper. State Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason, state House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, businessman Shawn Moody and former state Health and Human Services commissioner Mary Mayhew are all competing for the GOP nod. According to the Portland Press Herald, all four spent the last televised debate before the primary taking similar stances on key issues and making sure not to attack the governor. Where the candidates have disagreed, however, is over the opioid epidemic. Mason said he would ensure naloxone, used to treat overdoses, is more readily available. And Fredette said he would increase the state\u2019s Drug Enforcement Agency and deploy the National Guard to help stop the flow of drugs into the state, according to the Press Herald. Moody, however, said the solution lies within more education. LePage\u2019s daughter, Lauren LePage, and his longtime political consultant, Brent Littlefield, have joined Moody\u2019s campaign.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the immediate partisan battle over the vacant Supreme Court seat left by Justice Kennedy. The media immediately went to Defcon 1 within moments of Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement. There is no question that the stakes are sky high as President Trump prepares to nominate a conservative to replace the man who has been a swing vote for decades. But it's worth remembering that Kennedy was a Reagan appointee who frequently sided with the conservatives, even as he occasionally provided the key vote for liberals to protect such hot-button causes as abortion rights and gay rights. By the same token, John Roberts is a George W. Bush appointee who wound up delivering gay marriage and saving ObamaCare. So going back to Ike naming Earl Warren, justices sometimes surprise the presidents who pick them. Still, Trump has an opportunity to remake the Supreme Court in a way that will last for decades. It's hardly surprising that liberals would be gearing up for Armageddon. What's striking is the way that some liberal commentators are demanding that the Democrats block any vote on any Trump nominee. They are using the simple logic of payback. Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland, never even allowing him a hearing, on grounds that it was Barack Obama's last year in office. Now some Democrats and their media allies are saying, well, this is also an election year so let\u2019s delay until after November (obviously conflating the midterms with a presidential election to succeed an incumbent). Chris Matthews, acting like he is still working for Tip O'Neill, was riled up throughout the day on MSNBC, loudly declaring it's \"time for vengeance for what happened two years ago\" and that the Democratic leadership will be dumped if they fail. CNN commentator Bakari Sellers said that since Republicans have only a 50-49 edge with John McCain out, retiring GOP senator Jeff Flake should show \"some testicular fortitude\" and join the Democrats in blocking any Trump nominee. (Flake says no way.) One interesting twist is liberal anger at Kennedy for having the temerity to retire shortly before his 82nd birthday after three decades on the court. The New Republic says Kennedy was \"moderate\" only in comparison to the court's right-wing flamethrowers. Slate's liberal legal analyst Dahlia Lithwick, after bashing Kennedy for joining in the latest conservative rulings on the travel ban, abortion and unions, says: \"Many of us predicted that Kennedy would not allow Trump to replace him with someone who would dismantle his legacy. We were wrong. Many of us believed that a lifelong devotee of dignity, civility, and the rule of law would not want his work tarnished by a president who routinely attacks individual judges and the very notion of an independent judiciary. We were wrong.\" Kennedy's appointment is a reminder that past court nomination fights have been bloody. He was Reagan's third choice after liberals like Ted Kennedy attacked and demonized Robert Bork in ways that produced a lasting verb, \"Borking.\" And Clarence Thomas barely made it onto the court after Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations. For many left-wing outfits, there is only one issue. HuffPost ran a picture of a coat hanger with the headline, \"The End of Roe.\" CNN's Jeffrey Toobin declared, \"You are going to see 20 states pass laws banning abortion outright. Just banning abortion. Because they know that there are now going to be five votes on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201d Now the great likelihood is that there will be five pro-life justices on the court. But that doesn't automatically mean they will toss out a ruling that has been the law of the land since 1973. It's equally possible that the new majority will chip away at abortion rights and access to such procedures. Since Trump is so often portrayed as an erratic leader, keep this in mind. A Republican president like Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio easily could have nominated Neil Gorsuch and probably would be comfortable with any other name on Trump's list of 25 names. The president ran openly as a pro-life candidate. This is not Trump acting as some kind of outlier; this is the latest sign that elections have consequences.",

            "article_content": "The president discusses Justice Kennedy's retirement and the process of finding a replacement during a rally in Fargo, North Dakota. For those conservatives who voted for Donald Trump because of the Supreme Court, congratulations: You've been vindicated. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, she would have replaced the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia with a liberal jurist -- giving the Supreme Court a left-wing activist majority for a generation. Because Trump won, Neil M. Gorsuch was confirmed to replace Scalia, securing the court's 5-to-4 conservative majority. This week, the dividends of that appointment for conservatives were apparent in two landmark conservative rulings. In National Institute of Family Life Advocates v. Becerra, the high court ruled that the state of California cannot force crisis pregnancy centers to advertise access to abortion to their clients, in violation of the owners' conscience. And in Janus v. AFSCME, the court ruled that public workers cannot be forced pay union dues to support public policies with which they fundamentally disagree. These were critical 5-to-4 rulings that buttressed the First Amendment freedoms of all Americans. Trump was able to preserve the status quo before Scalia's passing. But now, with the news that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is retiring, Trump has a chance to do something much bigger: He can not only preserve but also expand the court's conservative majority. President Trump thanks 'spectacular' Justice Kennedy for his years of service on the Supreme Court, says his choice to replace the retiring justice will come from published list. If he replaces Kennedy -- a swing vote who often joined the court's liberal bloc on important matters -- with a reliable conservative in the mold of Scalia and Gorsuch, the president may have transformed the court for a generation. To do this, Trump will have to break the mold of his Republican predecessors. Over the past three decades, presidents from his party have picked seven justices, and several have turned out to be disappointments to conservatives. If Trump picks not one, but two reliable conservative justices, he will secure the best record of Supreme Court appointments by any modern Republican president. President Ronald Reagan picked three justices (Sandra Day O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy), but only one, Scalia, was a consistent conservative. President George H.W. Bush picked one solid conservative (Clarence Thomas) and one (David Souter) who was not. George W. Bush did better, appointing two conservatives, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and John G. Roberts Jr. But even Roberts disappointed conservatives when he cast the deciding vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act in a stroke of judicial activism. If Trump picks not one, but two reliable conservative justices, he will secure the best record of Supreme Court appointments by any modern Republican president. Liberals understand exactly what is at stake. That means whomever Trump picks will face a barrage of attacks unprecedented even by the standards of past confirmation brawls. But thanks to the Democrats' imprudent decisions to break precedent and change Senate rules to confirm lifetime appointments to the federal circuit court under President Barack Obama, and then to filibuster Gorsuch, Senate Republicans need only a simple majority to confirm Trump's choice. So long as Republican senators stick together, Trump's nominee will be confirmed. Already some Democrats are protesting that the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court justice during a midterm election year. Sorry, the Senate confirmed Obama appointee Elena Kagan in August 2010, just before the midterm elections -- and did so with a bipartisan 63-to-37 vote. Democrats are grasping at straws because the timing couldn't be worse for them as they seek to gain control of the Senate in November. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has announced that the confirmation vote will take place in the fall, which would put Kennedy's replacement on the bench when the court's new term begins on the first Monday in October. Pity the Democratic senators such as Joe Manchin III, W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, N.D., Jon Tester, Mont., Claire McCaskill, Mo., and Joe Donnelly ,Ind., who are running for reelection in states Trump won by double digits. Their political survival depends on being perceived as centrists, and they will now have to spend months campaigning while caught in the crossfire of a liberal-conservative battle royal over a Trump-nominated Supreme Court justice. Vote yes, and their liberal base will be apoplectic; vote no, and their pro-Trump constituents could revolt. For all these reasons, Trump's appointee is likely to be confirmed. If that happens, Trump will have led one of the most consequential conservative presidencies in modern American history. Not only is Trump expanding the conservative Supreme Court majority, he is also moving at record pace to fill the federal appeals courts with young conservative judges who will preside for decades. Imagine if it were Clinton making all these appointments. The consequences for human life, religious liberty, the Second Amendment and limited government would have been disastrous. Instead, the choice of the next Supreme Court justice is in President Trump's hands. So, to all the conservatives who cast their ballots in 2016 for just this moment -- you did the right thing.",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (The Associated Press) Wondering when the midterm election polls open, or who is running? Just ask Amazon Alexa. In a Wednesday blog post, Amazon detailed how its virtual assistant can help users before, during, and after the Nov. 6 election. The online retail giant has teamed up with the nonprofit digital encyclopedia Ballotpedia to equip Alexa with information voters will be looking for as they head to the polls. Leading up to Election Day, you can ask Alexa when the polls open, what's on your ballot, what it means to vote yes or no for a specific state ballot measure, or who is running for a particular office in your state. On Election Day, Alexa can give you real-time results. Amazon partnered with the Associated Press for this feature. On Nov. 6, you can ask Alexa for an \"election update,\" who is winning in your state, or how a particular candidate is doing. After Nov. 6, Alexa will be able to provide information about the outcome of the election. Just ask the virtual assistant what happened in the midterm elections, how many seats your party gained, or how a particular candidate did. Echo Show owners will be able to both hear and see responses for some midterm elections answers. Graphs will pop up on the screen when you ask who won your state's Governor race or how many seats a party has in the Senate, for instance. Amazon is expecting users to have a lot of questions about the midterms. During the 2016 presidential election, users asked Alexa \"millions of questions,\" Amazon's Bill Barton wrote. Amazon used what it learned from the presidential election to \"evolve and expand\" its experience for this go-around. \"In addition to advanced [artificial intelligence] and algorithm efforts, for every major moment like this, we \u2026 bring together a dedicated 'war room' of writers, engineers, and data scientists who work together to ensure Alexa is providing customers the most accurate information possible in real-time,\" Barton wrote.

The latest line of attack from liberals against Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, is knocking the judge for his \u201cfrat boy\u201d-sounding first name. \u201cWe'll be DAMNED if we're going to let five MEN\u2014including some frat boy named Brett\u2014strip us of our hard-won bodily autonomy and reproductive rights,\u201d the influential pro-choice organization NARAL tweeted Tuesday.

Trump on Monday announced Kavanaugh as his choice to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. During the announcement, Kavanaugh, who attended prep school outside Washington and later went to Yale, was joined by his wife and two daughters and sought to portray himself as a family man. \u201cFor the past seven years, I have coached my daughter\u2019s basketball teams,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cThe girls on the team call me \u2018Coach K.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "American Majority CEO Ned Ryun and Fox News political analyst Jehmu Greene on why West Virginia voters shouldn\u2019t vote for Republican candidate Don Blankenship. The battle for control of the Senate will kick off in earnest Tuesday evening, once voters render their verdict in three closely watched primary battles -- but none more gripping and unpredictable than the brawl in West Virginia. Indiana and Ohio also are holding Senate primaries Tuesday, and all three are states where Republicans hope to knock off a potentially vulnerable Democratic incumbent this fall. But the surge of an ex-convict and former coal baron with a penchant for shock value has made West Virginia the marquee race. Don Blankenship, jailed in connection with a tragic 2010 mining disaster in which 29 died, appears to be in a tight race with Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Whoever wins will go up against West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Republicans see him as a target given the state went for President Trump in 2016 with 68.7 percent of the vote, though the GOP may have a challenge unseating him no matter who wins Tuesday night. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is facing a strong effort by Repubilcans to upend his 2018 reelection bid. Blankenship\u2019s self-funded, outsider bid continues to captivate disaffected voters, even with his racially insensitive remarks. But Trump himself has intervened in a bid to sideline Blankenship\u2019s wrecking-ball campaign. Trump tweeted on Monday that Blankenship can't win in November. On Tuesday, Blankenship dismissed all the attacks against him. \u201cThey are calling me a bigot, a moron, a despicable character and mentally ill,\u201d Blankenship says in a final radio ad.\u00a0\u201cBut even if all of this is true, I will do a better job than they have done.\u201d Republicans looking to increase or at least safeguard their narrow, 51-49 Senate majority have considered West Virginia a key opportunity to swipe a Democrat seat. But they also see strong possibilities in Indiana and Ohio, both of which Trump also won in 2016. That essentially every Republican candidate running for a Senate seat Tuesday has a pro-Trump platform is no surprise, perhaps nowhere moreso than in conservative-leaning Indiana, the home state of Vice President Pence. However, the big concern within the GOP is that their top three candidates in Indiana -- former state lawmaker Mike Braun and Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita\u00a0-- have spent so much energy attacking one other and trying to out-Trump the field that the winner could be too damaged by November to defeat Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. They\u2019ve adopted the president's harsh immigration rhetoric and taken to the president\u2019s tactic of assigning derisive nicknames to one another like \u201cLyin\u2019 \u201d Todd Rokita, Luke \u201cMissing\u201d Messer, and \u201cTax Hike\u201d Mike Braun. Donnelly, a freshman senator, is running unopposed in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary and has $6.1 million in available campaign cash, according to OpenSecrets.org. Braun is considered the favorite, but Messer and Rokita are screaming that he\u2019s a Republican in name only. \"If the listeners get one thing out of this debate, I think it's important that they understand Braun is a lifelong Democrat,\u201d Messer said in a recent campaign forum, backed by such evidence as records indicating Braun voted in Democratic primaries until 2012 and him having been listed in Republican National Committee voter databases as a \u201chard Democrat.\u201d Braun says he is a conservative Republican but has voted in past Democratic primaries to have a say in local races dominated by Democrats. Republicans saw opportunity early in this midterm cycle to win a couple of Senate seats among the 35 up for reelection this year -- considering they have to defend just nine, compared with 26 for Democrats, including two for independents who caucus with their party. But winning in West Virginia and Indiana has become increasingly important for them in recent months, now that Democrats are posing credible challenges to GOP-held Senate seats in Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee. Patrick Morrisey, left, is facing off against Don Blankenship, right, and Rep. Evan Jenkins in West Virginia. In Ohio, the favorite in the GOP Senate primary appears to be Rep. Jim Renacci, whom Trump has endorsed. \"He\u2019ll be fantastic,\u201d the president said of Renacci at a public event they attended Saturday in Cleveland touting the recent GOP tax cuts. \"We need his vote very badly.\" Renacci entered the race earlier this year after state Treasurer Josh Mandel dropped out because of a family health issue. He faces businessman Mike Gibbons. Trump won the swing state in 2016. But the GOP primary winner will likely have a difficult time defeating two-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Fox News' Power Rankings list the race as \"lean Democrat,\" as does\u00a0RealClearPolitics. Gibbons, in a final-days attack, filed a million-dollar lawsuit Friday against Renacci, alleging he has made \u201cdefamatory statements.\u201d \u201cI believe the voters are tired of what's going on and,\u00a0Jim\u00a0Renacci,\u00a0I have hundreds of pages of his lawsuits,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cHe's a bully, he's [a] wealthy guy that bullies people with lawsuits. It's time to give him a little of his own medicine.\u201d Said Renacci: \u201cMr. Gibbons has decided to do something that\u2019s kind of unusual in\u00a0politics, but it is what it is.\u201d In West Virginia, Morrisey has launched a late attack against Blankenship, who served a year in jail in connection with the coal company he led being connected to the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2010. On Saturday, Morrisey started using robocalls to potential voters saying: \u201cConvicted criminal Don Blankenship didn\u2019t vote for President Trump and is a resident of Nevada, where he must report to his parole officer.\u201d On Sunday, he moved to have Blankenship disqualified from the primary for failing to submit a financial disclosure, in violation of election law and perhaps of his probation. Blankenship\u2019s campaign said the candidate has already spoken to his probation officer, who wasn\u2019t concerned about the financial disclosure. Blankenship has also taken direct aim at the Republican establishment by attacking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- calling him \u201cCocaine Mitch.\u201d He is apparently trying to link the Kentucky Republican to a 2014 news report about drugs purportedly being found on a ship owned by his in-laws. Jenkins, speaking to Fox News, also went after Morrisey for his past pharmaceutical lobbying work. \"We don\u2019t need a D.C. lobbyist who made millions of dollars peddling pills in our state,\" he said.

Jordan says the Fusion GPS co-founder is concerned about criminal liability. This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" October 16, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: So, as we say, 21 days to go, and these midterm races could not be more crucial for both sides. There is so much at stake. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story\" tonight. Starting with a showdown as big as Texas, between Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz. Our reporter on the ground got this response from O'Rourke when asked if he might be willing to share some of that $38 million that has been raised by his campaign. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you willing to commit to share some of that to help other Democrats get across the finish line and say Missouri? REP. BETO O'ROURKE, D-SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, TEXAS: No. I'm focused on Texas. But they want to contribute to another campaign, of course, they're welcome to do that. No. We're going to spare no expense. MACCALLUM: They have a big debate tonight. And in Arizona, McSally, and Sinema, slugging it out for Jeff Flake's seat as charges of treason entered their debate. REP. MARTHA MCSALLY, R-SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA: You said it was OK for Americans to join the Taliban to fight against us. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right, we are running out of time but we have to let you respond to that, please. MCSALLY: You said you had no problem of that. Kyrsten, I want to ask right now whether you're going to apologize to the veterans and me for saying it's OK to commit treason. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please, we are running -- REP. KYRSTEN SINEMA, D-SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA: She's engaging in ridiculous attacks and smearing my campaign. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: Oh, so you get the idea. And it is not pretty in New Jersey, either, where Bob Hugin is hoping to upset incumbent Bob Menendez. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For several years, Menendez had been traveling to the Dominican Republic to engage in sexual activity with prostitutes, some of whom were minors. MACCALLUM: So, can the GOP defy the odds and hold the House? Can Democrats buck the momentum and take hold of the Senate? It will be to a certain extent a measure of the president who just told the A.P., \"I don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of impact.\" He also said that it is not his fault if the GOP loses the House. That after an open day on the calendar at the White House left plenty of room for tweeting. The president slamming Stormy Daniels and going after Elizabeth Warren, again. Tonight, Brit Hume, Karl Rove, and Juan Williams, all here. But first, Trace Gallagher, live with a look at what is happening on the ground. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. In the Texas Senate showdown, Democrat Beto O'Rourke appears to be proof positive that you can't have your cake and eat it too because while his campaign coffers are filling fast and furious, his poll numbers are flat. The Real Clear Politics average says O'Rourke shows him running seven points behind Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. Analysts say the extra money will allow the challenger to go on the offensive in his campaign advertising. But they believe during tonight's debate, O'Rourke is in dire need of a knockout punch. So far, Ted Cruz who's been dominating debates since his days at Princeton has successfully painted his opponent as a liberal who is out of touch with deep-red Texas. Meantime, the Arizona Senate race is a dead heat with Republican Martha McSally, running at 45.3 percent, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema at 45 percent. \u00a0Both candidates are currently congresswoman. Sinema is a former Green Party activist. McSally is a former combat fighter pilot who has been going after her opponent's former statements. Including 2003, when Kyrsten Sinema told an Arizona radio host that she did not object to individuals going abroad and fighting for the Taliban. And in 2011, Sinema said her home State of Arizona produced, \"crazy\". And then, she advised liberal activists on how to stop your state from becoming Arizona. For her part, Sinema has accused McSalley of playing Follow the Leader. Watch. SINEMA: Martha has chosen to be an apologist and support anything that her party has leaked -- puts forward. Whereas, I've been ranked the third most independent member of Congress. MCSALLY: This makeover has been pretty impressive. But people deserve to know what her record is, what her past is, and what the facts are -- GALLAGHER: Meantime, New Jersey has an elected a Republican to the Senate in 46 years, this year was supposed to be no different, until former business executive Bob Hugin poured $24 million of his own money to beat Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez. Hugin has blanketed the Garden State airwaves with attack ads and they appear to be working. The RCP average shows Hugin down by just seven points, a far cry from on Monmouth University pulled back in April that had Menendez up by 21. And remember when Taylor Swift's saying, \"You belong with me.\" Well, former Tennessee Governor and current Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen might beg to differ. Last week, Swift endorsed him, now a New York Times survey taken in the days after the endorsement shows Bredesen behind Republican Marsha Blackburn by 14 points. It appears Bredesen summer momentum appears to have stalled a bit. Martha. MACCALLUM: Wow! Trace, thank you so much. So, joining me now, Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst. Karl Rove, former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, and Fox News contributor. And Juan Williams, Fox News political analyst and author of the new book, What The Hell They Have -- What The Hell Do You Have To Lose? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: There you go. MACCALLUM: So, welcome everybody. Gentlemen, good to have you here. \u00a0Brit, with all of that as a backdrop, I mean, these races are tight and they do, there is really so much at stake for both parties. Because when they wake up the morning after Election Day, it's going to be essential to the dynamic that is at playing -- that is in play in Washington. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, the atmosphere I think for the Senate and Republicans has improved some, at least, since the Kavanaugh hearings. There was a dearth of Republican enthusiasm as there's often a dearth of enthusiasm in midterms, and that doesn't apply to Democrats who seem to have plenty of it. But the Kavanaugh case seems to have awakened a lot of Republicans and a lot of those races are looking better. The map -- the map with the only a third of the Senate is up and the overwhelming number, two to three times as many Democratic seats are, are up this time than Republicans a number of them in states that President Trump carried. So, the Republicans have a good map. This may not be the best atmosphere for them, but I think that -- you know, that their chances of holding on to the Senate look pretty decent at this time. A whole other matter, Martha, in the House where all the Democrats need to take control over there is the average number of seats that the out party gets in a president's first midterm. It's hard to believe in the age of Trump, that the Democrats won't get the average. After all, the antipathy toward him among Democrats is extremely intense. And this is Democrats' first crack at a ballot box since the 2016 elections. MACCALLUM: Yes. So, true. Karl, as you look at -- you know, the different races that we took a peek at in the introduction there, where do you see as you, you know, look at your whiteboard and all of your numbers, where do you see potential for some of these slipping in the other direction? KARL ROVE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, I think in the -- in the Senate as the Republicans are defending three seats, Tennessee which I think is correct -- the report was correct. It's tending to tremendously towards the Republicans. Arizona which is going to be a dogfight right to the end. But I think, McSally is going to pull it out because it turns out Kyrsten Sinema is sort of the Todd Akin of 2018 with really extraordinary weird statements like -- you know if you want to go fight with the Taliban, fine with me. I mean, and my state is crazy, and a meth lab of democracy. The tough one for the Republicans on defense is going to be Nevada. It's very close, it's tight. It's going to be probably settled by a handful of votes. But Republicans are playing offense in places like North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Florida. They have shots in Montana and West Virginia. MACCALLUM: Yes. ROVE: And I wouldn't be surprised if the Republicans -- I agree with Brit, the map favors the Republicans, and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't end up with 52 or 53, or maybe on a good night, 54. MACCALLUM: Yes. You know, I think -- I think that the GOP, they started to see the House races look perhaps slightly more positive for them in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh decision. And the president sort of went through this period where he was very measured, and that appeared to be working in some of these House races. A lot of which are in the suburban areas, outside of -- you know, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. But today, he really let it rip, calling Stormy Daniels a horse-faced, and going after Elizabeth Warren. Again, Juan, so, how do you think that's going to play in some of those House districts? WILLIAMS: Well, it's also today that he said that if the GOP loses the House, it's not his fault. MACCALLUM: Yes. WILLIAMS: And I think a lot of those attacks that you just articulated, Martha, really are about how American women view it. And, of course, the critical voter in several of those suburban districts outside of major metropolitan areas are white suburban females. So, I'm not sure what the president's thinking. I think it does excite his core base make no mistake about it in this era of Trump and media and Twitter and the like. But I'm not sure it helps. And just to pick up, I just think that what you heard from Brit and Karl is on target. I would say that I think, a lot of these Senate races that are closed right now. Particularly, states like Arizona, but also going on to Nevada, and Texas which is the debate tonight. I just don't think that they -- I think those are red states. They wouldn't be close in my mind if it wasn't for the fact that we have Donald Trump as president, and this is essentially coming down to a referendum on Trump. MACCALLUM: I mean, you know, three weeks away, Brit. And I know you spent some time talking with the Senate Majority Leader today, Mitch McConnell, about what he thinks -- you know all of this looks like. And what the future potentially looks like if they have a slightly larger majority. HUME: Well, McConnell plays his cards very close to the best. You have to -- you know, read him carefully. I detected that he is somewhat more optimistic than he was. When I talked to him a couple of weeks ago, he simply said to me, this is going to be a bad election. And he was quite -- he was quite worried about losing the Senate. He seemed less so when I spoke to him today. And indeed, we talked a little bit about what -- you know, the Republicans might be able to do if the House is gone and all that's left is the Senate. And he is quite focused on judges as he has been now for some time. They've passed a whole bunch of what 84 judges, have been confirmed. More will be (INAUDIBLE) or about to be confirmed in the -- in the weeks ahead. \u00a0And I think he feels that, that March can continue if they called onto the Senate because the Senate, of course, has the confirmation role. The House is that -- doesn't have to have a say in that. So, that's kind of where he is. And I think he's, at least, Martha, being more optimistic, cautiously optimistic than he was before. MACCALLUM: Karl, another tight race is the Claire McCaskill-Josh Hawley race in Missouri. Here is something that surfaced today, a piece of video from Project Veritas, which specializes in these kinds of videos. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D-SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, MISSOURI: But if we have the kind of year I think we might have -- I think we could actually be in a position that we could get votes on this stuff on the floor. And we'd get 60, McConnell, knows it. He just doesn't want to put it on the floor, because then it goes to the House and then sits awkward because all those House members are total NRA folks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you would be on board with the bump stocks? MCCASKILL: Of course! Of course. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bump stocks? MCCASKILL: I was voting for -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: High capacity mags. MCCASKILL: I've voted more most of those things before. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For a ban? MCCASKILL: Oh, yes! (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Oh, yes! She's talking about banning bump stocks, banning high-capacity magazines. There's a lot of people in America that are in favor of that Karl, but how's that going to play in Missouri? ROVE: Well, look, she's got a problem with the absent -- apart from any particular issue, she has a reputation for saying one thing when she really believes something else, and that's going to be her problem. And you know, we talk about the Kavanaugh effect, and how races like Missouri are opening up after Kavanaugh. But Missouri, like North Dakota and several of these other races, was already moving in the right direction beforehand. And one of the reasons was at Hawley, the Republican was be able to point out that McCaskill was not representing Missouri values and finding areas where they disagreed. And one of the big problems that she has is that, that people believe that she's more liberal than she lets on. And that when election time comes around, she plays like she's a centrist or willing to work with the president or willing to reach across party lines. And then, when the election is comfortably over, she goes back to voting the hardline -- Democrat lied down the way. MACCALLUM: Yes. Juan, these are all pictures of Republican congressman who have now had their money pulled from them by the RNC, because this is the stage in the game when -- you know, money -- the folks who hold the money start looking at these races and say, \"OK, you know what, we're not going to dump our money where we're not going to put good money after bad essentially. How do you see this, and how do you see the president's role? WILLIAMS: Well, this is really interesting to me that I think that they are trying to -- it's essentially like -- you know weeding your garden and saying, you know, we want to get this out and allowed to allow the nutrients -- and the nutrients and the sunlight to get to the flowers we think have a chance to bloom. The other part of this, Martha, though, is the president's travel schedule. \u00a0And if you notice, his travel schedule takes him into red states, into red districts. He is not trying to reach out. And again, I think that's a matter of sort of pulling back from what I thought was possible in the age of Trump. He is again, playing to his base. And I think in like Missouri, I'm not sure exactly how much benefit he has for Josh Hawley. And I think, Claire McCaskill to pick up on what Karl was saying, does effectively play the role of someone who's in the middle as opposed to a part of the extremes that dominate American politics at this moment. MACCALLUM: It can be fascinating. 21 days to go. Gentlemen, thank you so much. WILLIAMS: You're welcome. MACCALLUM: Good to see you all tonight. So, breaking news in the case of the missing journalist believed dead, President Trump just moments ago suggesting the Saudis like Brett Kavanaugh, deserve the presumption of innocence. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Turkey is looking at it very strongly. We are all looking at it together but Turkey and Saudi Arabia are looking at it very strongly and it depends on whether the King and the Crown Prince knew about it in my opinion. Number one, what happened but whether or not they knew about it. If they knew about it, that would be bad. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That would be bad says the President speaking exclusively with Fox Business Network's Trish Regan about the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and promising to find out the truth. Now, Turkish investigators are saying there is evidence that he was killed inside the Saudi Consulate in Turkey where he was last seen. And so there's evidence that things were painted over, things have been cleaned up, we are going to get more details on all of this. Saudi leadership, though, sticking to their storytelling Mike Pompeo today that they had nothing to do it, a denial that is not sitting well with leaders here at home and abroad. Benjamin Hall live in Istanbul, Turkey, with the very latest on this tonight. Good evening, Ben. BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. And as you were saying, the last couple of hours, President Trump has given an interview to the A.P. in which he said this is clearly a case of guilty until proven innocent. His quote exactly was \"here we go again, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. We just went through that with Kavanaugh.\" But evidence against Saudi Arabia is mounting. Turkish was finally be allowed to search the consulate and claimed to have found evidence that Khashoggi was found inside, despite some of the surfaces having been painted over in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence. Turkish officials have also disclosed details of a gruesome operation involving interrogations, torture, and a bone saw they say Saudi agents killed Jamal Khashoggi in seven minutes and hacked him to bits, and there are audio recordings. Today, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Saudi leaders. He spoke with a king, who denied all knowledge of the affair, and to his son the Crown Prince, in effect their day-to-day leader. The Crown Prince told the Secretary, we are strong and old allies. We face our challenges together. The past, the day of tomorrow, but now, even old allies are turning against the young prince. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: This guy is a wrecking ball. He had this guy murdered at a consulate in Turkey. This guy is got to go. \u00a0Saudi Arabia, if you're listening, there are a lot of good people you can choose, but MBS has tainted your country and tainted himself. (END VIDEO CLIP) HALL: There are also reports that Saudi Arabia are considering saying that agents who aren't authorized the murder actually killed Khashoggi during an interrogation gone wrong. This would be a major breakthrough, also though, one which shields the royal family from blame. And next, Secretary Pompeo heads to Ankara to meet with Turkish officials and it is worth pointing out that all the details we have so far, come from the Turkish government. And until we have an investigation from both sides, I think it's fair to say we can't jump to any conclusions ourselves. Martha? MACCALLUM: All right, Ben, thank you very much. Here now Marc Thiessen, AEI Scholar and former Chief Speech Writer for President George W. Bush and Andy McCarthy former Federal Prosecutor, both are Fox News Contributors. \u00a0It's good to have you with us tonight. MARK THEISSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you, Martha. MACCALLUM: Andy, let me start with you. You know, your comments go to what Benjamin Hall reported at the tail end of his report which is that we don't really know the inter-dynamics of what's going on in Saudi Arabia. \u00a0There's a battle for power that is clearly the underpinning of what we are seeing here, and the question of whether or not MBS is the person to lead them into the future. ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, well, there's a struggle within Saudi Arabia and there's also a struggle within the region, and the struggle picks the Turks against the Saudis. You know, a lot of people think the Sunni Shiite divide, Martha, is like the Rosetta Stone for figuring this region out. It's actually a lot more complicated than that. \u00a0But what you're dealing with is the Sharia supremacist governments, you're dealing with Khashoggi who is regarded by some as a dissident but by others as a -- as a Muslim Brotherhood, if not operative at least a sympathizer. \u00a0So this is very complicated. And I think you know, I don't know that I would be going about this the same way President Trump is, but what he's clearly I think trying to do is try to minimize the necessity of the United States having to take action here and get more further involved than we need to. MACCALLUM: Marc, what do you think? MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, comparing him to Brett Kavanaugh is an insult to Brett Kavanaugh. I mean, there is no video of Brett Kavanaugh walking into the house. I mean, this guy walked into the Saudi Consulate and didn't come out. There no video of him coming out. I think we've got pretty clear evidence that something happened inside that consulate. But you know -- MACCALLUM: Not to mention the fact that the Saudi government doesn't necessarily deal in guilty until proven innocent legal matters in general terms. THIESSEN: That's exactly right. But look, people have been willing to turn a blind eye to MBS's repressive behavior because he's been performing the kingdom. But right now, he looks less like a reformer and more like a Saudi Vladimir Putin who is assassinating his critics on foreign soil. At least Putin isn't stupid enough to have it done inside the Russian consulate. He does it at a public park somewhere with poison -- with chemical weapons. This is criminally stupid on the part of the Saudis if it, in fact, was from the top. And also quite frankly, it's a betrayal of Donald Trump. \u00a0Donald Trump put his neck on the line for MBS. When he came into office, his first trip was to Saudi Arabia. He endorsed MBS, he endorse his reforms. He made Saudi Arabia a centerpiece of our policy in the region again, turning away the Obama policy of cording Iran to shoring up our alliances, and this is how he gets repaid? By having the Saudis assassinate, murder, an American permanent resident? A Washington Post Columnist, my fellow communist at The Washington Post and someone who is well known in this town? I mean, that is just an insult -- not just a crime, it's an insult to Donald Trump. MACCALLUM: I agree. And you know, the President is I think taking a step back and sort of looking at all of this and trying to figure out what the next move is. I think that's pretty clear. The Senate is pretty upset about it. You saw Lindsey Graham, and here is Mitch McConnell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We need to find out first what happened before deciding what kind of response is appropriate. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You do think there will be some kind of response if these allegations are true? MCCONNELL: I can't imagine there won't be, but I think we need to find out what happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So talk potentially of the Magnitsky Act, Andy, being put in place against the Saudi leadership. MCCARTHY: Yes, I wouldn't hold my breath on that. I think -- you know, look, we're dealing with a bunch of Sharia supremacists, Anti-American regimes. I think it was a mistake for the President to sort of hop in with both feet with the Saudis. You have to be leery of the Turks. You know, the -- actually, I think the smart thing with this region is to have as little to do with it as possible and to have -- you know, we lead, we obviously have our values, we should champion them, but as far as dealing with them is concerned, I think we should remember that they're anti- American regimes and have as little to do with them as possible. MACCALLUM: I got to go but I want to give Marc ten seconds to close out here. THIESSEN: Yes, we need some sign that MBS understands he made a mistake. \u00a0My colleagues Elliott Abrams has said, this is recorded that someone saying that this is -- it's worst than a crime, it's a mistake. And he's put Saudi Arabia in the company of rogue regimes, and he really needs to show us a sign that he recognizes his mistake and is willing to do what's necessary to bring Saudi Arabia out of what's becoming pariah status. MACCALLUM: Thanks, guys. Good to see you both. Thank you, gentlemen. MCCARTHY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So tonight, where yet another caravan of migrants that is flooding towards the U.S. border after traveling through a couple of under -- other countries on the way, refusing to turn back. The President and what he plans to do. And the movie about the man dubbed America's Biggest Serial Killer that many do not want you to see. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is that smell? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, you got to see this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know. I've never been in an abortion clinic before. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Trump Administration tonight warning Honduras to turn around. \u00a0A caravan of thousands of illegal immigrants that are headed for the United States border will face serious financial consequences. That caravan showing no signs of slowing down setting up a potential showdown at our southern border once again. Kristin Fisher live at the White House tonight with the story. Hi, Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Martha. Well, this White House is not messing around. This is the second time this year that President Trump has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras over one of these caravans. And his latest morning came today on Twitter, he says \"The U.S. has strongly informed the president of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stop and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately.\" And the message was really driven home by Vice President Mike Pence who says that he spoke on the phone with the president of Honduras and told him, quote, \"The U.S. will not tolerate this blatant disregard for our border and sovereignty.\" But despite these warnings from Washington and despite a standoff with Guatemalan police and riot gear, anywhere from about 1500 to 3,000 migrants are continuing to trek north. Now a caravan formed in Honduras on Saturday crossed into Guatemala on Monday, most of these people including children say that they are fleeing violence and poverty, but the U.S. embassy in Honduras is putting out a warning telling them that, you know, many times, the danger of this journey is greater than what they are leaving behind. And tonight, after the president threat, the caravan's organizer was detained in Guatemala and will be deported back to Honduras in the coming hours. But thousands more continue on undeterred. So the big question now is, will authorities detained them before they reach the U.S. border, and if Honduras does not do anything else, will President Trump follow through with his threat to cut off aid? And remember, the last time this happened in April, President Trump deployed the National Guard to the border and now, Martha, the stakes are almost even higher with the midterms just weeks away. Martha? MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Kristin, thank you so much. So you know, they were many doubters that President Trump would win the White House in 2016, so what are those never-Trumpers think now that he has breaking -- he is breaking records and defying a lot of people's expectations. We are going to ask one senator from Nebraska, Ben Sasse who has a new book out coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: From the Robert Mueller investigation to Brett Kavanaugh, to Me Too, to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, we are arguably in the midst of the most divided times in our nation's recent history. Today Victor Davis Hanson put the last origins of the left's agony this way. \"The catastrophic, yet suicidal loss in the 2016 election and the disappointment over the Obama presidency radicalized Democrats,\" he writes, \"A combative Trump himself certainly enrage them and on a variety of political, social, and cultural levels.\" My next guest knows all the drama all too well and he believes he has a solution, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is a Republican and author of the new book, \"Them: Why We Hate Each Other and How to Heal.\" Senator, welcome. good to have you here. SEN. BEN SASSE, R-NEB.: Thanks, Martha. Thanks for the invite. MACCALLUM: I know you are speaking out, you know, about this issue and in this piece, Victor Davis Hanson sort of in some ways says you know what, that all of the ruckus is part of the process. It's a part of understanding people who felt like nobody was listening to them and giving them a voice and that we shouldn't necessarily shy away from that kind of very intense ruckus. SASSE: Yes, so Professor Davis, Victor Davis Hanson is a smart guy and I've benefited a lot from his work. I got to (AUDIO GAP) you're talking about today and I agree with big pieces of it, sort of inside our political tribalism, I think his diagnosis is largely correct. But I think what's going wrong in America, a lot of the stuff people are worried about is much bigger than the last two years. So the challenges that Americans face right now, we are the richest people in all of human history and yet we are some of the most unsatisfied people in the last 100 years of U.S. polling. Why is that? Most of our problems are way upstream from politics. Political tribalism is ramping precisely because the kinds of tribes that give people meaning, their family, do they have deep friendships, do they have shared vocations, coworkers, local worshiping communities? A lot of those things are in collapse and political tribalism is filling that vacuum in people's lives. But political tribalism can't fix this because political tribalism didn't cause it. We've got much bigger challenges that are outside of politics and we should be honest about a lot of those things. We need to recover the habits of rootedness for an age where technology allows us to be largely rootless. MACCALLUM: Yes. SASSE: We need to be rooted. MACCALLUM: Well, I mean, I hear you on that and I think a lot of people would agree with you. And I'm very interested in what you say about communities and how divided even towns are now. SASSE: Yes. MACCALLUM: And so people sort of gravitate, they want to live in a town where everyone thinks like they do and none of us I think grew up that way. But you know, but in terms of the GOP and its ability to recognize and solve people's problems, that's something else that Victor Davis Hanson kind of calls out in this piece. And here's one of the quotes that he has about that. He says \"The Bush, McCain, and Romney approach was to be above the fray and expect Americans to condemn progressive excess, when, in fact, the attitude of exasperated conservative voters was always something more like, if they don't want to do their job and fight back, why in the hell should we support them?\" What do you say to that? SASSE: So again, I think there's a lot that's right about that. Our political moment needed a disruptor. President Trump came in and was the disruptor, and is a disruptor. But we need to know disruption to what end? The left has argued for decades now that politics can solve all of our problems. If only the right people have power, you can bring on heaven on earth. That's B.S. when the left said it, it's also B.C. when the right says it. And increasingly we have a lot of people on the right who are acting like now we believe in politics as the solution to our problem, that's not true. Inside politics, there's a lot that we need to wrestle about hard but we need to make sure that politics is in the right box because the things that make people happy, again, family, friends, local community, neighbors, meaningful work, shared vocation, coworkers and communities, government can't legislate those things. Government is about maintaining a framework for order of liberties so that the communities of love where your viewers live are the places where they can build the stuff that's actually going to make them happy. Don't look to Washington to solve all your problems. That's the left's old life. The left shouldn't buy into it either. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I think that's very true. You know, just one last question before I leave you. One of the things that has improved, I think that everybody agrees with on is the economy. SASSE: Yes. MACCALLUM: In fact, right now the U.S. is the world most competitive economy for the first time in a decade and I think President Trump's feeling is that that has lifted all of those and that is something that perhaps might not have been achieved by a president who wasn't willing to sort of dust-up things and make it cut regulations, cut taxes, all of those things. What do you say to that? SASSE: Yes, I agree. You know, the president I've been a conservative for a long time, long before Trump was and I'm glad that he's embraced a whole bunch of conservative views over the last handful of years and his deregulatory agenda it's a good agenda. It's right, he deserves a lot of credit. There are bunch of things that I'm the second or third most conservative voter in the U.S. Senate, so there's a whole bunch of places where the president and I are aligned and he deserves credit for his deregulatory agenda. In addition, and one of the chapters of the book \"Them\" is about the fact that the coming disruption in the economy means we're not going to have lifelong work anymore. When you are 40, and 45, and 50 and you lose your job because of new technology disintermediate or disrupts the firm you work at, we need to have a long-term plan for that and most of that is not going to come from inside government. So we shouldn't have our whole worldview swallowed up by politics. We need a lot more than that. That's why I wrote \"Them.\" MACCALLUM: Yes. I think seven million jobs available in the latest reading the U.S. economy today that came out. So that's good news as well. Ben Sasses, senator, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. SASSE: Thank for the invite. MACCALLUM: So for the first time tonight, Attorney General Jeff Sessions' response to the many criticisms that have been rolled at him by his boss, President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LESLEY STAHL, REPORTER, CBS NEWS: What about the Attorney General Jeff Sessions? TRUMP: Well, we'll see what happens come midterms but-- (CROSSTALK) STAHL: But everybody thinks-- TRUMP: He, I was disappointed that he recused himself. Many people think I was right on that. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Congressman Jim Jordan, who has been calling on Jeff Sessions to step down reacts next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STAHL: What about the Attorney General Jeff Sessions? TRUMP: Well, we'll see what happens come midterms but-- (CROSSTALK) STAHL: But everybody thinks-- TRUMP: He, I was disappointed that he recused himself. Many people think I was right on that. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: News tonight, Attorney General Jeff Sessions now responding to President Trump's latest dig at him? while fielding questions about the latest round of criticism at a DOJ news conference today. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF SESSIONS, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: He's been frustrated about my recusal and other manners, but we have been so pleased and honored to be given the responsibility to execute his agenda at the Department of Justice. And part of that is just this kind of case. And so I am pleased and honored to have that responsibility, and I will do so as long as it's appropriate for me to do so. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the House judiciary committee. Congressman, good to see you tonight. Thank you for being here. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Good to be with you, Martha. MACCALLUM: Your reaction. You've been very critical of the attorney general. JORDAN: Well-- MACCALLUM: And I think the attorney general feels like people don't spend in a time focusing on the work that they are doing. JORDAN: I mean, it's obvious to me, I think obvious to most people that Rod Rosenstein is in charge of the Justice Department, not Jeff Sessions, and I think it's also obvious that the president is going to be looking for a new attorney general. I think he's made that pretty clear. My guess is that will happen sometime in the not-so-distant future. Jeff Sessions is a good man, he was a good senator, but I think it's the president of the United States wants an attorney general that I think conduct matters different than Jeff Sessions, and I think that will happen sometime in, like I said, in the not-too-distant future. MACCALLUM: And you've been very critical of Rod Rosenstein, as well. And you've been trying to get the DOJ through him to turn over a lot of documents. The president appears at least for now to have he's off the hook. Are you OK with that? JORDAN: No, I'm not OK with that. We've ask for in subpoenaed the McCabe memos, we haven't received those. We asked for the August 2nd memo of 2017 where Rod Rosenstein altered the scope of special counsel Mueller's investigation. He won't let us see that. We've asked for the FISA application, portions of it, he won't let us see that. And we've asked for Bruce Ohr's 302's, and he won't let us see those. And on top of all that, he was a no-show last week when he was asked to come in and give us answers under oath and now today, a key player in this whole affair Glenn Simpson took the fifth. So no, I have as big a beef with Rod Rosenstein as I do with Jeff Sessions because Rod Rosenstein is the one who is making it difficult for us to do our job as a separate and equal branch of government. MACCALLUM: All right. Here's Rod Rosenstein's attorney disagrees with you, which I'm sure doesn't come as a big surprise. (CROSSTALK) JORDAN: Imagine that, yes. Imagine that. MACCALLUM: -- as his job to alleviate talking about you guys. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSHUA LEVY, GLENN SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY: This committee has largely conducted its business through secret, confidential interviews and depositions, binding witnesses and their counsels, to silence, while the members walk outside to all of you, the media, and the public, and selectively leak from those interviews to tell you what they want you to hear. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That's Glenn Simpson's attorney version of this, Jim Jordan. JORDAN: Look, Glenn Simpson took the fifth today. You take the fifth if you believe you have some criminal liability, some concern there. That's the only reason you take the fifth. Glenn Simpson did that. I think that's why he did that, because of he's doing it just to obstruct a congress investigation, that's wrong too. So I think he did it because he's concerned about criminal liability. And to say we're the problem? Remember what happened here, Martha. The Clinton campaign paid Perkins Coie law firm who hired Glenn Simpson who then went out and hired a foreigner Christopher Steele and a wife of a top Justice Department official Nellie Ohr to produce the dossier that they then funneled to Bruce Ohr who gave it to the FBI, who then went to the secret court so they could get a warrant to spy on President Trump's campaign. And they are accusing us of wrongdoing for trying to get answers to how that all -- how that all took place? That is just ridiculous. In fact, he took the fifth because he's concerned about criminal liability he faces. And I think John (Ph) said just a couple days ago and said it well, because he said one thing to one committee, and we have another witness to testify in front of our committee, the judiciary committee, who said exactly the opposite. I think that's what he most likely took the fifth today. MACCALLUM: All right. Nellie Ohr, the wife of Bruce Ohr is up on Friday. So we'll see what she says. Good to see you tonight, congressman. Thank you very much for being here. JORDAN: You bet. MACCALLUM: You bet. JORDAN: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: So man's up America's biggest serial killer will be spending the rest of his life in jail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kermit Gosnell is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It is such an unbelievable horrifying and dramatic story, so why did some people never want you to see it? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: This is a true crime story that is so horrifying that it's almost impossible to believe. Hermit Gosnell, a well-known abortion doctor is now serving right behind bars in part for killing viable children. While many pro-abortion activists want this story to go away and so many reporters wouldn't even cover it, instead the investigation into Gosnell has now been turned into a very powerful film that people on all sides are saying is very meaningful, it's a surprise hit at the box office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking for anything that looks like drugs or paraphernalia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fill up your police department we have a search warrant. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is that smell? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Men, you've got to see this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a (Inaudible). UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I've never been to an abortion clinic before. You're not going to believe what I saw last night. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How may? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So far we saw over 30 of them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do the women goes into a clinic and comes out dead and there is no police report? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vials have been removed recently. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You'll be the prosecutor who went after reproductive rights and you will be a racist to boot. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're going to a lot of folk who'd like to see abortion outlaw. And this is not going to be the case that gives them an excuse. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The prosecution is offered you a plea bargain, Dr. Gosnell. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then I would have to admit I was guilty, I'm not guilty. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The film's producer Phelim McAleer joins me now. Phelim, thank you very much for being here tonight. I think, you know, a lot of people might look at that beginning and as hard as it is to watch, say well abortion is legal in this country, so how is he a serial killer? PHELIM MCALEER, FILMMAKER: I use that the babies were born alive and he murdered them in a rather gruesome way. He also killed several patients as well. And he'd been killing these babies for about 30 years, towards the end -- dozens a night. He is without doubt America's most prolific serial killer. MACCALLUM: And I know you says that you were pro-choice before you started working on this movie, you've done a lot of different topics as a reporter and covering these stories. Let's play one more sound bite from the movie that may be one of the reasons that you changed your mind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There were big babies, they had color to them and they look like they were, they had life. I don't know if I've ever get it that out of my head, being up close and personal is totally different from what you see on TV and what they write about. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: How important was that to you? MCALEER: Well, that's from the documentary that was made before this film. But I mean, it was actually the film is very heavily based on testimony like that, testimony from-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: She's a juror. MCALEER: Yes. And when you see -- yes, the jurors all had to be pro-choice to get on the trial. By the end of the trial, all of the jurors had switched to pro-life. When you see the facts of this case, we showed it to a liberal friend, our movie to a liberal friend, he went out today and started chain-smoking and said I have to rethink everything. This is what the film does. Now the film is PG-13, so we don't show any of the gore it's not a horror show. But it's a factual, you know, law and order film that really raises a lot of questions. MACCALLUM: Yes and that's how the investigation began. Because as you show -- as we show on that trailer it was part of a drug bust, so they stumbled on this murder factory as you point out. But the fascinating thing is, that they were no -- when went into the courtroom to begin the case they were told, the attorneys were told you're going to be mobbed by reporters. This is going to be intense and you have to be ready. MCALEER: Yes. MACCALLUM: No reporter showed up except you guys, right? MCALEER: Yes. I was in the courtroom, I saw them, I've been a journalist for 25 years. I saw them with hocking pictures, all of those terrible stuff -- Gosnell was sitting a feet away from me. Behind me was the most shocking thing. Row after row after row of empty seats. The prosecution hires the biggest courtroom in Philadelphia because they thought they were going to be mobbed. The media didn't turn up. Nobody wants to be -- to do -- to do anything real cast a negative light on abortion. This film has been in the top 10 over the weekend. It had two reviews in the mainstream media. \"Broken Boy\" which is a film no one heard of had 70 reviews, \"Venom\" had 280. This is the film that the mainstream media don't want to cover this topic and, you know, because they don't want to write anything negative about abortion. MACCALLUM: Do you think it will change minds? MCALEER: That's what people are saying on Twitter. People should look at what people are saying on Twitter that this -- it changed my mind actually. I was neutral on abortion before this, when I started studying it I realize Planned Parenthood are geniuses. They didn't -- they had me in the dark about abortion. MACCALLUM: I got to go. Phelim, thank you so much. Important movie. Good to have you here tonight. That is our story for this Tuesday night. We'll be back here tomorrow night at 7.

            "article_content": "In this Aug. 14, 2012 file photo, Dr. Leana Wen stands in the emergency department at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, during her medical residency. On Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018, Wen, an immigrant from China who has been Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner for nearly four years, was named as the new president of Planned Parenthood. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) Dr. Leana Wen, the new Planned Parenthood boss, believes in \u201cpracticing what we preach\u201d. A Chinese immigrant who fled her native country when she was eight, she has campaigned to reveal doctors\u2019 private information including political affiliation, views on abortion and money they received from pharmaceutical companies. But she herself did not disclose her affiliation or that she received money from outside firms, Fox News can disclose. When she succeeds Cecile Richards in November, Dr. Wen will be the first doctor to hold the position in the last five decades. She will also take the reins of the organization\u2019s political wing that will spend $20 million on pro-choice candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. KAMALA HARRIS, PLANNED PARENTHOOD SLAMMED FOR TAKING KAVANAUGH OUT OF CONTEXT ON BIRTH CONTROL REMARKS Wen is perceived as a less political leader compared to Richards, who previously called the Trump administration \u201cthe worst for women that I've seen in my lifetime,\u201d while insisting that the organization is \u201cnon-partisan,\u201d though its political arm never donates to Republican candidates. But Wen isn\u2019t starkly different from Richards. As Baltimore City\u2019s health commissioner, she sued the Trump administration after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) decided to cut funding from teen pregnancy prevention education. She won the suit and the program was kept in place. In 2014, Wen launched a website called \u201cWho\u2019s My Doctor\u201d aimed at revealing personal information about doctors, including their political affiliation, their views on abortion and whether they are receiving any outside funding. \"I want doctors to see this as a positive thing for them and I want patients to be asking for it too. This is the right thing to do.\" \u201cI want doctors to see this as a positive thing for them and I want patients to be asking for it too,\u201d Wen told\u00a0TIME magazine. \u201cThis is the right thing to do.\u201d Wen\u2019s suggestions were criticized by Dr. Joshua Kosowsky, vice chair and clinical director of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital\u2019s emergency department, who also co-authored a book with Wen. \u201cDisclosure about financial conflicts is one thing, but trying to put into words a physician\u2019s philosophy on medical care is more complicated,\u201d he told the\u00a0Boston Globe\u00a0at the time. \u201cFeelings about rational care to curb unnecessary medical costs and end of life issues are important principles that doctors should be discussing with their patients,\u201d he added, though noting that it shouldn\u2019t longer than a few sentenced on the doctor\u2019s website. The American Medical Association (AMA) declined to comment about the new Planned Parenthood president\u2019s proposals. Kosowsky did not reply to Fox News\u2019 request for a comment. Wen also criticized medical professionals who receive outside funding as this changes their behavior and generally interfere with patient care. \u201cDozens of studies have shown that when docs receive money from drug companies\u2014even a free lunch\u2014it does affect prescription behavior,\u201d she said. TRUMP TAKES ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD WITH BAN ON ABORTION COUNSELING AT FEDERALLY FUNDED CLINICS But on her own profile on the \u201cWho\u2019s My Doctor\u201d website that she created, Wen said she believes \u201cin practicing what we preach\u201d and\u00a0listed\u00a0$0 payments or gifts from any pharmaceutical or medical device companies. But according to Dollars For Docs\u00a0database, Wen received over $600 for \u201ctravel and lodging\u201d from E. R. Squibb & Sons, L.L.C., a\u00a0subsidiary\u00a0of pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Company that\u00a0directly\u00a0matches gifts to Planned Parenthood and is a corporate supporter of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a pro-abortion group. Following the publication of this article, Planned Parenthood's press secretary Andrew Taverrite issued a statement on the controversy, denying that Wen received any payment. Leana Wen once idolized communist China\u2019s health care system under notorious leader Mao Zedong and decried reforms that took place in the 1980s that moved the system from inefficient universal health coverage to an insurance-based model. (Facebook) \"Dr. Wen has never accepted money from any drug company, has no knowledge of the reported payment, and we're looking into correcting it,\" he said. The\u00a0Dollars For Docs database still lists Wen receiving a $617 payment from E. R. Squibb & Sons, L.L.C. In response to repeated Fox News' questions about Wen's views on abortion and her political affiliation, Planned Parenthood also released the following statement. \"Dr. Wen supports access to the full range of reproductive health care, which includes safe, legal abortion. As a health care provider, Dr. Wen knows how important it is to ensure that patients have accurate information about all their options. Over 90% of abortions occur in the first trimester. Often, those performed after this point are done for reasons such as danger to the woman's life,\" Taverrite said in an email. \"As policy-makers discuss implementation of the Accountable Care Act, they should learn from China\u2019s experience and decide whether they see medical care as a commodity or social provision.\" \"'Late term abortion' is not a medical term, but a phrase coined by anti-abortion activists who do not believe a woman should be able to make her own decisions about her own pregnancy, with consultation from her health care provider,\" he added, without disclosing Wen's political affiliation. Since 2013, Wen has turned to advocacy and began writing articles on the topic. In one of the posts, she idolized communist China\u2019s health care system under notorious leader Mao Zedong and decried reforms that took place in the 1980s that moved the system from inefficient universal health coverage to an insurance-based model. \u201cToday\u2019s China is one of great disparity. The wealthy minority receives top-notch care, while the poor majority suffers from little access to care and no way to pay for it,\u201d she wrote in an article for\u00a0HuffPost. PARENTS ANGERED AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD PARTNER LEADS 'GRAPHIC' SEX-ED LESSON IN SCIENCE CLASS \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always this way. In the mid-20th century, China had universal health care with a robust primary care system. Millions of \u2018barefoot doctors\u201d provided basic medical services in villages, and attention to prevention ensured significant gains in life expectancy,\u201d she added. \u201c[In 2013], America has a once-in-a-generation chance to fix our broken health care system,\u201d Wen proclaimed. \u201cAs policy-makers discuss implementation of the Accountable Care Act, they should learn from China\u2019s experience and decide whether they see medical care as a commodity or social provision, and what are the responsibilities of the government to ensure the health and well-being of its citizens.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump meets with outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 9, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Nikki Haley has said she will not run for president in 2020. But would she run for vice president in 2020 and then president in 2024? That could be the right path for the U.N. Ambassador, who has announced she will retire at the end of this year and who is definitely presidential material. It\u2019s a long time until 2024. Some speculate that Haley might run for the Senate should fellow South Carolinian Lindsey Graham be appointed to replace Jeff Sessions as Attorney General after the midterm elections. Barring that opportunity, she runs the risk of fading from view and missing her moment, as Chris Christie did in 2012. Whether or not the president is reelected two years from now with Haley as his running mate, she would naturally emerge as the frontrunner in 2024. For Trump, too, putting Haley on the ticket makes all the sense in the world. LIZ PEEK: REPUBLICANS, DON\u2019T REWARD DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR BAD BEHAVIOR -- VOTE IN NOVEMBER! Many think that in 2020, President Trump is once again likely to face off against a female candidate. Whether it is Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand or, God forbid, Hillary Clinton, his opponent (male or female) will surely attack Mr. Trump for his alleged philandering and supposed mistreatment of women. Nobody could better deflect such accusations than a woman who has worked for the president, and who can speak from personal experience of his support for capable and outspoken females. Haley is also a minority, the daughter of immigrants from India. Her mother started quite a successful retail business in the U.S.\u00a0 Haley\u2019s experience working in that enterprise informs her pro-business platform, which she shares with Mr. Trump. Her background also allows her to champion intelligent immigration policies, and the benefits this nation derives from people who enter the country legally. Nikki Haley\u2019s U.N. tenure has received high marks, even from the left-leaning media. The New York Times lamented her resignation in an editorial titled \u201cNikki Haley Will Be Missed,\u201d mainly because they portray her as a bulwark against what they deem \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s worst policies and instincts.\u201d Haley has a formidable resume, more substantial than that of any of the women running on the Democratic side, barring Hillary Clinton whose credentials mainly fall into the voting \u201cpresent\u201d category, since she accomplished almost nothing during her stint as Secretary of State. Haley was the first woman and the first minority to serve as governor of South Carolina. She had previously been elected a state legislator, and served as president of the National Association of Women Business Owners. As governor, Haley was credited with being strong and compassionate as she dealt with a series of crises, including the mass shooting by Dylann Roof at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. She led the citizens of her state in prayer on that occasion, and again in the aftermath of the horrific floods in 2015. The state\u2019s second-largest newspaper said of her response to these crises, \u201ctime after time, Gov. Haley did a superior job.\u201d They also noted that \u201cwhen the nation turned its attention to South Carolina, she presented a smart, calm and confident face...\u201d Nikki Haley has proved that she can be tough; tough with South Carolina\u2019s legislators (to the dismay of some critics), tough with our allies and rivals in the U.N. and, on occasion, tough with President Trump. As governor for six years, she focused on attracting businesses to the state, and employment grew by 400,000 under her watch. She led reforms aimed at rooting out corruption, and she is credited with removing the Confederate Flag from the statehouse, a courageous move in South Carolina. In the middle of her second term, Haley had the 15th-highest approval ratings of any governor in the nation. Nikki Haley has proved that she can be tough; tough with South Carolina\u2019s legislators (to the dismay of some critics), tough with our allies and rivals in the U.N. and, on occasion, tough with President Trump. And yet, she survived her tour of duty under our mercurial president; she apparently really does have diplomatic skills. By now you\u2019re probably wondering; what about Mike Pence? Mike Pence has been a loyal number two in the Trump administration. He has rarely made waves, reliably defended the president in times of turmoil (often, in other words) and has fulfilled the critical role of bolstering the White House\u2019s relationship with the evangelical community. During the 2016 election, the religious right eyed Mr. Trump with understandable skepticism. He had few Republican or conservative credentials, and though he professed to be pro-life was visibly bewildered about what that meant. Moreover, his various scandals and numerous wives caused heartburn amongst evangelicals. During that race, he needed Mike Pence, a Catholic altar boy in his youth and born-again Christian, to woo the evangelical community. This was an easy assignment, since Pence had long been that group\u2019s pick among presidential candidates. As Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary and a Trump faith advisor told The Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins, \u201cMike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician.\u201d With the help of Pence, as Coppins points out, Trump won \u201can astonishing 81 percent of white evangelicals\u2019 votes, more than any Republican presidential candidate on record.\u201d The president\u2019s standing with that community remains high; as Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas tweeted on September 2, \"The primary reason Evangelicals voted for @POTUS by the widest margin of any candidate in history is because of his commitment to a conservative judiciary, and he's fulfilling that promise beyond anyone's wildest imaginations.\" The ascension of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the nation\u2019s highest court, along with other measures like moving our embassy to Jerusalem, has cemented Trump\u2019s standing with conservative Christians. But as the president fought to deflect challenges to the Kavanaugh confirmation, he further alienated the #MeToo movement and injured his standing with women. Approaching 2020, his deficit is with female voters. Knowing that more Supreme Court seats might open up, the Evangelical community is likely to stay on board. Thus, swapping out Mike Pence for Nikki Haley makes all the sense in the world for Trump. Now he just has to find another job for Mike Pence which would allow him to gracefully step down, and encourage Nikki Haley to sign on. Both those steps will require some artful deal-making, to be sure.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve already seen that the president is capable of doing just that. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

John Kasich, having won their parties' respective primaries Tuesday, Fox News projects. With nearly 65 percent of precincts reporting, DeWine, a former two-term senator, had 59.68 percent of the vote and Cordray had 62.51 percent, according to the office of the Ohio Secretary of State.\u00a0Kasich faces a term limit and cannot run again for governor. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d Cordray tweeted after the race was called. The 59-year-old Cordray on Tuesday night has defeated former Ohio congressman and Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich -- in a primary battle seen as a larger fight for the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal base. Cordray was backed by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Wall Street reformer and \u201cprogressive\u201d champion who helped start the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that Cordray ran until last year. CLICK FOR COMPLETE FOX NEWS 2018 MIDTERM COVERAGE Kucinich was backed by Our Revolution, the self-described \u201cnext step in the Bernie Sanders' movement.\u201d \u201cVictory and defeat are a part of life,\u201d Kucinich said in conceding defeat and congratulating Cordray. \u201cThey are opposite sides of the same coin... And so we move forward.\u201d The 71-year-old DeWine defeated Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor. He had a double-digit lead entering the race and was expected to win. DeWine and Taylor, Kasich\u2019s lieutenant governor, supported President Trump\u2019s agenda and spent a combined $10 million since December. DeWine and Cordray are moderates who, respectively, fought off challenges from the Republican right and the Democratic left. While Kucinich had the support from perhaps the party\u2019s most liberal wing, Taylor likened DeWine's record to that of Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and questioned his loyalty to Trump. DeWine and Cordray have already faced each other once in a head-to-head race -- when DeWine narrowly won in their 2010 race for attorney general. And Cordray lost in a 2002 Democratic primary to deny DeWine his second Senate term. Dennis Kucinich lost the Ohio Democratic gubernatorial primary to Richard Cordray. DeWine was endorsed by the Ohio Republican Party and was bolstered by his partnership with Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted, who dropped his own governor bid to become DeWine's running mate. Cordray, who started as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under former President Obama and finished under Trump, featured Obama in his ads and campaigned with Warren. Kucinich, also a two-time presidential candidate, attacked the low-key Cordray as an \"establishment Democrat\" and energized voters with a liberal anti-gun, pro-environment, single-payer health care platform. He won his first political race at 23 when elected to the Cleveland City Council. But Kucinich\u2019s strong challenge was hurt by revelations that he had taken a $20,000 speaking fee from a group sympathetic to Syrian President Bashar Assad, despite saying he\u2019d return the money and arguing, \u201cthe purpose of the conference was to bring peace and reconciliation to Syria, not to support the current regime.\u201d Cordray's victory buoys Democratic hopes of reclaiming control of a battleground state, which Trump won in 2016 by 51.69 percent. With former Rep. Betty Sutton as his running mate, Ohio Democrats have perhaps their strongest statewide ticket in recent memory into the fall. The Cordray-Sutton campaign is expected to focus on the candidates' efforts against consumer fraud, political corruption and voter disenfranchisement. The Democratic primary also feature state Sen. Joe Schiavoni and former state Supreme Court Justice Bill O'Neill. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Associated Press) Two black Christian pastors who were among a group of religious leaders meeting with President Trump at the White House this week are now facing backlash from congregants back home. The Rev. Phillip Goudeaux of Calvary Christian Center in Sacramento, Calif., and the Rev. John Gray, head of Relentless Church in Greenville, S.C., came under fire from critics who say Trump's policies have harmed the black community. But at Wednesday's event, dubbed \u201cMeeting with Inner City Pastors,\u201d many of the pastors who attended expressed sympathetic views toward Trump, with one pastor -- the Rev. Darrell Scott, of Cleveland -- calling Trump \u201cthe most pro-black president we\u2019ve had in our lifetime.\u201d Pastor Phillip Goudeaux of Calvary Christian Center in Sacramento, Calif., has come under fire for attending a meeting with President Trump. (Calvary Christian Center) Scott also slammed former President Barack Obama for not trying to \u201cprove something to our community\u201d because \u201che got a pass.\u201d Goudeaux, a spiritual adviser to the family of Stephon Clark \u2013 \u00a0the unarmed black man who was fatally shot March 18 by two police officers in Sacramento -- praised Trump as well, saying the president restored \u201chope\u201d to his community, but jokingly urged Trump to not give up on the state of California. \u201cPlease don\u2019t give up on California and Sacramento,\u201d Goudeaux quipped, according to the transcript. \u201cI\u2019m right in the capital there, and we\u2019re working in every area to try to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. \"So, I guess the greatest word I can say for you, Mr. President, is that you have given this country expectations, given us a new hope, a new excitement to believe that things are getting better and are going to get better.\" \u201cSo, I guess the greatest word I can say for you, Mr. President, is that you have given this country expectations, given us a new hope, a new excitement to believe that things are getting better and are going to get better,\u201d Goudeaux continued. \u201cAnd we appreciate that leadership, your tenacity to keep pushing in against all the opposition that comes against you. Thank you so much.\u201d Gray, meanwhile, was skeptical about attending the meeting with Trump and initially thought he would decline the invitation. \u201cMy wife told me \u2018If you go, no one will hear what you say. They won\u2019t understand why you\u2019re there. And any good that could come out of it will get lost in translation,\u2019\u201d Gray wrote on Facebook. \u201cI had not one thing to gain by being there. Not. One.\u201d Gray said he eventually decided attending the event and even led the prayer so he could speak out about prison reform. \"That could greatly end up benefiting many people who look just like me.\" \u201cThat could greatly end up benefiting many people who look just like me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pain of so many is too real. The hurt. The isolation. The sense of disenfranchisement. The real hate that has bubbled to the surface of the national discourse. \"I myself have been vocal about my personal disagreements with key policy decisions of this administration,\u201d he added. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with inner city pastors in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2018. (Associated Press) But despite their open-minded approach, the two pastors were still facing condemnation from their communities. Tre Borden, who works in the Sacramento area and attended the Calvary Christian Center when he was young, shared a photo of Goudeaux and called him and other religious leaders \u201cshameless\u201d and \u201ccontemptible\u201d for attending the meeting, the Sacramento Bee reported. \u201cThe majority of people in Phillip Goudeaux\u2019s Del Paso congregation are poor and black,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cFor him or any other black religious leader to align himself with Trump and his policies in this day and age is extremely distressing and hypocritical. How can he possibly think our current president is helping people who are on the margins of society?\u201d Gray is reaching out to many people who are criticizing him on social media. His Facebook posts concerning the meeting drew thousands of comments, many of which were critical. \u201cThe pain of those who have been hurt is real. And I would be a dishonorable man not to acknowledge that,\u201d Gray wrote. \u201cBut I will honor what I believe was the mandate on my life to be there and available to God should He choose to give me voice,\u201d he added, noting that his comments on social media about why he attended didn\u2019t \u201cinvalidate the visceral reaction of those who can\u2019t imagine why I would be in the room.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt says Matt Brown's failed insurgent primary challenge of incumbent Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo is 'very good news for Democrats.' A far-left Democrat who had the backing of groups allied with Bernie Sanders fell decisively in Wednesday's Rhode Island Democratic gubernatorial primary, capping a bitter slugfest and marking the latest in a series of setbacks for fringe progressive groups seeking to take their views into the mainstream. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, 47, easily brushed off an insurgent challenge from former secretary of state\u00a0Matt Brown, 48, who refused to take money from corporate PACs and heavily courted Sanders voters in the state during the campaign. Raimondo was leading Brown by more than 20 percentage points Wednesday night, 56 to 34 percent, with almost all precincts reporting. Raimondo's win sets up a rematch with pro-Trump Republican mayor Allan Fung, who came in just 4.5 points behind Raimondo in a three-way race in 2014. Brown was backed by Justice Democrats, the political action committee started by organizers of Bernie Sanders' failed 2016 presidential campaign, which also had backed come-from-behind candidates including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts. He channeled Sanders' rhetoric often, saying health care, housing, education and childcare cost too much and that he would work to build a different kind of economy that \"works for everyone, not just for the few.\" But Raimondo, who had the endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden, raised $7.6 million for her re-election bid in a state with just 1 million residents and a single media market. She made the case for a second term by highlighting the state's improving economic fortunes, including a falling unemployment rate, as well as new job training programs and free community college tuition started during her tenure. The campaign was nasty, with both sides hammering each other for months. Brown went after Raimondo's corporate ties, while Raimondo compared Brown to Trump, calling him a \"financial disaster\" over how he managed his failed 2006 campaign for U.S. Senate and the nuclear non-proliferation group he co-founded, Global Zero. Brown had a lawyer threaten to sue her for defamation this month. Raimondo refused to debate him. ANALYSIS: SORRY, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS -- YOU'RE PUSHING POISON Pro-Trump candidate Allan Fung won the Republican nomination for Rhode Island governor. (AP) Candidates inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist, and Sanders have been roundly defeated in several races nationally, even in heavily liberal districts that might seem most sympathetic to their ideologies. For example, in August, a fiscally conservative Democrat soundly defeated five other high-profile opponents\u00a0to represent deep-blue Honolulu, opponents including the architect of the state's legal challenge to President Trump's travel ban and a follower of Ocasio-Cortez. Candidates backed by Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez also have faltered in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. But they have seen some successes, particularly in Pennsylvania, where\u00a0four candidates\u00a0who drew socialist support triumphed in primaries in May. However, on the whole, Ocasio-Cortez -- who\u00a0pointedly did not receive former President Barack Obama's endorsement\u00a0for her own congressional bid -- and Sanders have struggled to take their message mainstream. SOCIALIST TORCHBEARERS FLAME OUT NATIONALLY, DESPITE HIGH-PROFILE SANDERS ENDORSEMENTS On the Republican side, Fung, the mayor of Cranston, has a second chance at the office he failed to win four years ago in a contest against Raimondo. Fung beat Patricia Morgan, a state lawmaker, by double digits. Fung has given few interviews, held no news conferences and said little about his views during the race, as he walked the tightrope of being a pro-Trump Republican in a heavily liberal state. He's said he wants to cut the sales tax from 7 percent to 5 percent, but hasn't put forward a detailed plan to pay for it. Although Trump lost Rhode Island by double-digits in the 2016 presidential race, Fung has praised Trump's \"track record,\"\u00a0saying that\u00a0\"the president is doing a good job in the economy, but I act in my own way.\" He also has backed the White House's broad immigration policies. \"We will not be a sanctuary state, and I will fight against sanctuary cities like Providence.\" \"Unfortunately, under Gov. Raimondo, Rhode Island had the highest murder rate in the region in 2016,\" Fung said in a release. \"When I\u2019m governor, we will not be protecting criminals who are in this country illegally, period. ... We will not be a sanctuary state, and I will fight against sanctuary cities like Providence.\" In one of the few interviews he gave during the primary season,\u00a0with The Providence Journal this month, Fung said he no longer supports a complete ban on \"assault weapons.\" He also said he no longer describes himself as pro-choice, as he had in 2014. And, when asked whether he would support legislation to legalize abortion in the state, his wife, Barbara Ann Fenton, jumped in to answer. Fung agreed with her that it would depend on the bill. Voters in Rhode Island on Wednesday also selected nominees for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, lieutenant governor and some key mayoral races. In the Senate race, pro-Trump former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders won the Republican primary and is set to face Democratic incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse in November.\u00a0Flanders beat California businessman Roque \"Rocky\" De La Fuente, who was running for Senate in numerous states. Flanders, 69, has said he voted for Trump but that he would not reflexively back him. He has called Whitehouse \"silver spoon Sheldon\" and criticized his focus on climate change. The 62-year-old Whitehouse is one of the leading voices in the Senate to do more to address climate change. He also has been harshly critical of Trump. Also on Wednesday, Rep. James Langevin and his Republican opponent sailed through unopposed. Langevin is seeking a 10th term to represent the 2nd Congressional District in western Rhode Island. He's set to face Republican businessman Salvatore Caiozzo in November. And, Republican Patrick Donovan won his party's nomination to challenge Democratic Rep. David Cicilline in November. Donovan, a stay-at-home father, beat accountant Frederick Wysocki in Wednesday's primary. Fox News' Kaitlyn Schallhorn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence gave an often boastful campaign-style speech Wednesday to the closing session of the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting, winning several standing ovations even as some evangelicals criticized his appearance. Pence repeatedly made clear that the SBC \u2014 the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. \u2014 is viewed by him and President Donald Trump as a vital part of their conservative base heading into the midterm elections. He called the SBC \"one of the greatest forces for good anywhere in America.\" Pence devoted much of his speech to touting the Trump's administration's achievements since taking office. \"It's been 500 days of action ... 500 days of promises made and promises kept,\" he said. He enthused about Trump's meeting this week with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and received a big ovation by mentioning the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 a longstanding goal of many U.S. evangelicals. Pence drew more loud applause when he declared Trump \"the most pro-life president in American history\" and noted that he has appointed many conservatives to federal judgeships. While most of the crowd of roughly 10,000 at the convention in Dallas seemed pleased with Pence's speech, some audience members could be seen sitting with their arms folded during the ovations. On Tuesday, as the annual meeting opened, one delegate from Virginia introduced a motion asking that the invitation to Pence be withdrawn and replaced by a time for prayer. Other delegates proposed that the SBC adopt a new policy to avoid speeches by politicians at future annual meetings. But those proposals were defeated or sidetracked. The Rev. Wade Burleson, an outspoken Baptist pastor from Enid, Oklahoma, alluded to those concerns in a tweet. \"The SBC is changing,\" Burleson tweeted . \"More than a few voiced their objections to politicians, even strong Christians like Mike Pence, speaking to the SBC. It's always wise to keep the Gospel a priority.\" There was strong criticism from Michael Wear, a Washington-based consultant who led evangelical outreach while in President Barack Obama's White House office of faith-based initiatives. \"I am saddened Pence wld be so triumphalistic, so unabashed, so jingoistic,\" Wear tweeted . \"I'm more saddened that there would be people in the audience, messengers of the gospel (unless they're outside guests), who would so revel in rubbing their politics in the faces of their brothers & sisters.\" Aside from Pence's speech, the most sensitive issue confronting the annual meeting related to multiple recent cases of sexual misconduct within the SBC community \u2014 and ensuing discussion about the role of women in a denomination with a doctrine of male leadership in the church and in the home. On Tuesday, with little opposition, delegates adopted resolutions condemning any sexual misconduct by SBC ministers, urging more action to prevent \"all forms of abuse,\" and encouraging victims to contact civil authorities to seek protection and support. On Wednesday, the issue resurfaced when Jeffrey Bingham, interim president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, delivered the seminary's annual report, including an update on events surrounding the termination of former President Paige Patterson. One of the SBC's most prominent figures, Patterson was ousted because of his response to two rape allegations made years apart by students. He also was accused of making improper remarks about a teenage girl's body and contending that women who are in abusive relationships should almost always stay with their husbands. Bingham said his goal is \"to create a safe environment and a campus culture that protects and cares for the victims of abuse\" As a step in that direction, he said all staff and faculty will have retaken and completed a course on sexual harassment over the next six weeks. He indicated that the decision to oust Patterson was difficult for the board of trustees' executive committee. The committee \"is made up of 12 godly men and women,\" Bingham said. \"I have seen the agony on their faces. I have seen the tears in their eyes as they have had to make decisions.\" As the annual meeting drew to a close, delegates rejected a motion calling for those executive committee members to be dismissed from the seminary's board. Thomas Hatley, who introduced the motion, contended that the committee acted hastily and unfairly in firing Patterson after he had been granted the status of president emeritus.",

            "article_content": "A deeper look into President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s key rulings as circuit judge. Democrats, Planned Parenthood and others on the left are trying to generate pseudo-hysteria by falsely demonizing Judge Brett Kavanaugh as being anti-woman in the days leading up to the Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday on his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. While trying to portray themselves as champions of womankind, those fighting the nomination of Kavanaugh are instead insulting the intelligence of women and men with their absurd attacks. The Kavanaugh opponents are trying to stir up uncontrolled and extreme emotions relating to the\u00a0Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide \u2013 in their campaign to keep Kavanaugh off the nation\u2019s highest court. No one can credibly claim that Kavanaugh is not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. He\u2019s been a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia since 2006. He has a sterling record since graduating from Yale Law School in 1990, including serving as a Supreme Court clerk, a lawyer in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, and White House staff secretary for President George W. Bush. Judge Kavanaugh has shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that has an intentional, extraordinary record of helping women. So instead of examining his qualifications or judicial record, those opposed to Kavanaugh are working overtime to smear his reputation with false charges. And in addition to trying to derail the judge\u2019s nomination, those opposing him are engaged in a cynical propaganda campaign of political fundraising. They are urging donors to give money to Democrats to defeat Republicans in the November midterm elections in order to block the confirmation of future judicial nominees advanced by President Trump. The campaign to keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court has taken some strange and frankly disgusting turns. For example, a lame Planned Parenthood video, made with the help of the group\u2019s friends at \u201cFunny or Die,\u201d tries to inject humor into the deadly serious topic of abortion. Excuse me for not laughing. It used to be that abortion was discussed in a sober manner, even by those on the left. Remember when they claimed they actually wanted abortion to be \u201csafe, legal, and rare?\u201d Sadly, those days are long gone. Now the pro-abortion forces are trivializing the pain and struggle of women confronted with the terrible choice of whether to have an abortion or instead grant their unborn child the right to live a full life. In the Planned Parenthood video, which is designed to mobilize opposition to Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, an actor who is playing the part of a dumb and clueless conservative addresses women and says: \u201cBasically, I\u2019m here to explain to you,\u00a0as a man, that you\u2019re wrong about Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d Ha! See what they did there? Because only men support Kavanaugh, you see. So clever. The joke continues for what seems like an eternity, and the faux-conservative actor points out that Kavanaugh will be good for women because he has a \u201cfemale wife, female mother, and female mother-in-law.\u201d The actor even says \u201cladies, let me talk to you like a lady\u201d and switches to a falsetto voice. Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t put on a wig and a dress for added comedic effect. They make millions with these jokes. They\u00a0kill\u00a0at the Oscars. But millions of women recognize this nonsense as phony, not funny. They reject the assumption that those of us who support the right to life for the unborn are anti-woman, and that pro-life women are traitors to the cause of women\u2019s rights. Instead of engaging conservative women in a respectful way and debating the record of Judge Kavanaugh, opponents of his nomination prefer to mock the pain of millions of women as one big joke. For example, NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon has partnered with an ice cream shop to sell\u00a0abortion-themed ice cream. The oh-so clever flavor is called \u201cRocky Roe v. Wade.\u201d Why? Because the pro-abortion groups want women to\u00a0celebrate\u00a0abortions and\u00a0promote them\u00a0to girls. Concerned Women for America (CWA), the organization I lead, has thousands of members around the country who support Judge Kavanaugh because he is a man of integrity who will uphold the Constitution as written, instead of bending it and giving it new meaning to promote his personal preferences. I have written about Kavanaugh\u2019s\u00a0substantive record and why we can trust him. Our \u201cWomen for Kavanaugh\u201d bus tour visited seven key states (Iowa, Indiana, West Virginia, Missouri, North Dakota, Alabama, and Florida) to win the support of senators for Kavanaugh. We have felt overwhelming support for the judge from women in those states and elsewhere once they look at his record. But the Hollywood elites and others on the left will not engage conservative women in a meaningful way. So many of them live in a\u00a0bubble\u00a0where everyone thinks alike and everyone who doesn\u2019t is dismissed outright. Their idea of engaging conservative women is \u201ccomedian\u201d Michelle Wolf\u2019s\u00a0shameful treatment\u00a0of Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in April, to the cheers of the liberal media. With this myopic view of women, Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents can say\u00a0ridiculous things\u00a0\u2013 like claiming that anyone who supports Judge Kavanaugh is \u201ccomplicit in evil.\u201d They can\u00a0talk\u00a0about \u201cback-alley abortions\u201d and make absurd claims that Kavanaugh \u201chas a long history of not caring for women.\u201d They know it is all lies, but they are hoping they will galvanize liberal support. American women are not stupid. Millions are seeing clearly that we are being told lies about President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. We realize that anyone nominated by this president to the Supreme Court \u2013 no matter how qualified \u2013 would face a torrent of opposition. Judge Kavanaugh has shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that has an intentional, extraordinary record of helping women. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, all the women who served Kavanaugh as law clerks (unless prevented because of \u201ccurrent or pending employment\u201d)\u00a0wrote that he \u201chas been one of the strongest advocates in the federal judiciary for women lawyers.\u201d Even many on the left are not buying what the radical left is doing with the nomination of such a well-qualified nominee. Liberal feminist lawyer Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman, wrote for Politico: \u201cSometimes a superstar is just a superstar. That is the case with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who had long been considered the most qualified nominee for the Supreme Court if Republicans secured the White House. The Senate should confirm him.\u201d Blatt has personal experience in her law career working with Kavanaugh that gives her a good perspective on the type of justice he will be. Blatt had to admit, though, that \u201cmy friends on the left will criticize me for speaking up for Kavanaugh.\u201d Yes. She is not toeing the liberal line, and there are real consequences for this. Here\u2019s the bottom line: Donald Trump is the duly elected president of the United States, even though that continues to drive his opponents crazy. He has carried out his duty to nominate an eminently qualified judge to serve on the Supreme Court. The Senate should do its job and confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh because he will clearly be an outstanding member of the United States Supreme Court.",

            "article_content": "Chad Grimm, the Illinois Libertarian gubernatorial candidate, speaks with The Associated Press during an interview at the state Capitol in Springfield, Ill. (AP Photo) In a year of unusual candidates, Libertarian Chad Grimm may be the most atypical of the bunch. The 33-year old gym manager from Peoria is polling at 7%, more than twice the margin by which Democrat incumbent Pat Quinn leads Republican challenger Bruce Rauner. Republicans accuse Grimm of being a spoiler candidate, siphoning away votes that could give Rauner the lead. They\u2019ve worked to get him off the ballot in November, but to no avail. [pullquote] To be sure, Grimm is a complicated candidate. He is pro-life, pro-gun, and anti-tax, but also pro-marijuana legalization, pro-marriage equality, and he has derided the wealthy Rauner as a \u201cbillionaire venture capitalist.\u201d Grimm promises to lead Illinois into an era of \u201cless taxes, less prisons and less red tape.\u201d America doesn\u2019t have much experience with Libertarians. We know Ron and Rand Paul by now and they\u2019ve both raised the profile of Libertarianism tremendously. That said, candidates like Grimm still lack a natural constituency who will support them. It follows that the fact that Grimm is polling at 7%, enough to decide the outcome of the election and then some, begs the question of what\u2019s going on with our two-party system. To this end, Grimm is benefitting from the same pervasive dissatisfaction with American politics that is shaping races from Kansas to South Dakota to Maine. Voters are angry and frustrated with the state of politics in America. And it looks like many of those who may have once held their noses and voted for a Democrat or a Republican are finally starting to get serious about other options. Over 40% of Americans are now identifying as independents. We\u2019re seeing their voting power in action in both Kansas and South Dakota\u2019s senate races where independents Greg Orman and Larry Pressler are not only in contention, but leading in some polls. But in Illinois, where politics is notoriously rough and four of the last seven governors have wound up in prison, any candidate who wasn\u2019t a Democrat or a Republican has been forced off the ballot, except for Grimm. So what makes Grimm so special? I\u2019m not convinced that he really is. His role in the election is more about sending a message to Illinois\u2019s established politicians. And that leaves them with little choice but to vote for Grimm. Either that, or they bite the bullet and vote for the deeply unpopular Quinn, or Rauner, who\u2019s earned a reputation as a behind the scenes Republican donor. For frustrated Americans, biting the bullet is less appetizing than ever before. As the races in Kansas and South Dakota show, people are becoming less willing to vote for a candidate they perceive as the lesser of two evils and more willing to see a vote for an independent or third party candidate as a positive political statement, rather than a wasted vote. Put another way, voters across America are looking for ways to register their unhappiness with the state of our politics and the quality of our politicians. Voting for a candidate like Grimm is one way to do that. When people hear a candidate say, as Grimm has said about Quinn and Rauner, that, \u201cOnce [politicians] get elected, the doors close, they smoke the same cigars, and pass the same kind of legislation,\u201d voters recognize the sense of mistrust and dissatisfaction that is spreading throughout the American electorate, and they respond to it. While Grimm won\u2019t be taking over the governorship, he may very well win enough votes on Election Day to deny either Rauner or Quinn the office. The message to Republicans and Democrats is clear. They need to take a good, hard look at why so many Americans just don\u2019t want to vote for their candidates any more. And they need to change it.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why, as with everything else in the Trump era, the midterm elections are about Donald Trump. As with everything else in the Trump era, the midterm elections are about Donald Trump. It was inevitable. It was inescapable. And the president has decided to own it. Like Hurricane Michael hitting Florida with Category 4 intensity, Trump is the gale-force wind who will propel his party to either victory or defeat. As you probably know, the president's party almost always loses seats in the first off-year election. That's why the occupant of the White House usually tries to avoid nationalizing the midterms. By trying to avoid a national referendum, even as they hit the trail, these presidents gave their congressional candidates the space to run local races that are tailored to their states and districts. They even got room to disagree with the party's leader. And that insulated the leaders, to some degree, from a disastrous outcome. So when George W. Bush said in 2006 that his party had been given a \"thumpin',\"\u00a0and when Barack Obama said in 2010 that his party had gotten a \"shellacking,\" they could at least argue that it was not all their fault. Trump will have no such luxury. If the Republicans hang onto the House, he can claim most of the credit. And if the Democrats take the House, Trump will get virtually all the blame. But you know what? He'd get the credit or blame anyway, even if he went on vacation for a month, even if Melania took his phone away. Local issues matter, but this is going to be an up-or-down vote on Trump and Trumpism, period. That's because Trump dominates the public life of this country like no other modern commander-in-chief. He dominates politics, the media, Twitter, entertainment and the cultural debate. He is the driving force in the most hyperpolarized climate in a generation. So if Trump is destined to be the hero or the goat in November, he figured he might as well own it. Politico says that Trump \"is making the midterms a referendum on the one thing he appears most comfortable talking about: himself.\" The president is \"asking supporters to suspend their disbelief and imagine that his head is on the chopping block.\" I really could do without that metaphor. Trump told a Mississippi rally that \"I'm not on the ballot. But in a certain way, I'm on the ballot. So, please go out and vote.\" The story adds that \"Trump often personalizes events and tends to approach issues through the lens of his own experiences.\" Ya think? And if the Democrats are going to run against the president as an authoritarian, racially insensitive divider, he is the one with the megaphone to demonize them as well. In a USA Today op-ed filled with factually challenged statements about the Dems' health care plan, Trump made this argument: \"The truth is that the centrist Democratic Party is dead. The new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America's economy after Venezuela. If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.\" Radical socialists may not be coming to get you, but the president is right that Democratic centrists have all but vanished. So have Republican centrists. It's all base politics now as each party has abandoned the mushy center. This was the reason that Trump didn't make a unity appeal after getting Brett Kavanaugh on the high court, and instead dismissed the allegations against him as a \"fabrication\" spawned by a Democratic \"hoax.\" Steve Bannon has been saying for months that 2018 is Trump's first reelection campaign, a do-over of sorts for the Democrats. That's why the president is acting as if it is.",

            "article_content": "Contest in Houston area one of most closely watched Congressional races on Election Day HOUSTON \u2013 With Election Day just a few days away, Democrat Lizzie Fletcher is feeling optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really great day. I think Tuesday is going to be a\u00a0fantastic day,\" Fletcher told a group of campaign volunteers on Friday. Fletcher is running against Republican incumbent John Culberson in the 7th congressional district in Texas, which covers the western part of Houston. A New York Times/Siena College Poll conducted from October 19 to 25 shows the two candidates in a dead heat. \u201cI think it\u2019s really exciting. People are focused across the country on this district because we have such a great chance of winning this race,\u201d said Fletcher. Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, who's looking to unseat Rep. John Culberson, speaks to volunteers at a campaign event in Houston. (Fox News) Though President Trump won the state in 2016, Hillary Clinton won the district. Still, Culberson often reminds people that he won his race that year, as well, and adds he\u2019ll win again this midterm election. \u201cDistrict 7 voters are well-informed, they do their homework, they know John Culberson is the right person in the right place at the right time,\u201d he said after casting his vote in Houston on Friday. Culberson is relying on a base of moderate Republicans for re-election. \u201cThis is a more affluent district. Republicans here tend to be Bush Republicans where you traditionally have people with high income, high support for business,\u201d said Professor David Branham, a political science professor at the University of Houston-Downtown. In fact, former president George H.W. Bush, who still lives in the traditionally Republican district, once held it as congressman from 1967 to 1971. Branham believes those supporters who align more with Bush-era views could give Culberson an advantage. Republican Rep. John Culberson (left) says he's optimistic despite facing a tight race against his Democratic challenger. (Fox News) \u201cThis district is not a Trump kind of Republican district. Culberson is much more like the Republicans in this district. This is a tough district for Lizzie Fletcher in that she can\u2019t basically run against Trump nearly as easily as somebody else could in a congressional district,\u201d said Branham. \u201cThe district right now, they need to stay with the same absolute, perfect congressman that they have right now\u2014the guy who has been advocating for us, the guy that has gone to bat for us,\u201d said Jennifer McKnight, a staunch supporter of Culberson. CLICK FOR COMPLETE FOX NEWS 2018 MIDTERMS COVERAGE Fletcher, meanwhile, has used healthcare as a cornerstone of her campaign. \u201cPeople throughout the district have talked about their access to affordable healthcare\u2026trying to bring down the costs, bring down the costs of prescription drugs, make sure people have access to care,\u201d said Fletcher. While many Texas counties have seen record-breaking turnout for early voting, the pressure is on to keep the momentum going on Election Day.\u00a0 (Fox News) Fletcher is enjoying a flurry of support brought by the high-profile race between Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. Voters have turned out record-breaking numbers for early voting. \u201cI feel like our country is going in the wrong direction. And, I hope the Democrats will come out in full force and try to change some things,\u201d said Inga Vickers,\u00a0who cast her vote on Friday. THE 9 BIGGEST CAMPAIGN CONTROVERSIES OF THE 2018 MIDTERMS Shifting demographics brought on by Hurricane Harvey last year may also be one reason why the race is close. So, while Republicans currently hold the majority in this district, Branham thinks there\u2019s a chance that might not be the case a few years from now. \u201cHarvey did a lot of damage to the district, so it\u2019s an issue for everybody, and there\u2019s a lot of new voters. And, a lot of those new voters are more Democrat than the people they\u2019ve replaced before,\u201d said Branham.",

A neighbor reported seeing her going for a jog Wednesday evening. The Poweshiek County Sheriff's Office said Monday, July 23, 2018, that Tibbetts had not been found. (Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation via AP) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet?\u00a0Click\u00a0here. Developing now, Wednesday, August\u00a01,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY \u2013\u00a0An Iowa college student who vanished two weeks ago had been planning to travel to the Dominican Republic this week for a wedding, friends said ...\u00a0Mollie Tibbetts, 20, was supposed to accompany her boyfriend Dalton Jack to his brother Blake\u2019s wedding to his fianc\u00e9e, Aimee Houghton, Blake said.Blake had jokingly suggested to his brother that he propose to Tibbetts, his high school sweetheart, during the trip. Tibbetts was last seen jogging on the evening of July 18 in Brooklyn, a small Iowa town where the University of Iowa student had been living this summer with the brothers. At a news conference Tuesday, Kevin Winker, director of investigative operations for the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, said investigators haven't drawn any conclusions about what happened to Tibbetts other than that disappearing on her own \"is not consistent with her past.\"\u00a0He said dozens of investigators from his agency, the FBI and local law enforcement are working on the case, and that they haven't ruled out any possibilities and are checking out every lead they receive. ELECTION MEDDLING, THE SEQUEL? -\u00a0Facebook says it has\u00a0uncovered \"sophisticated\" efforts, possibly linked to Russia, to influence American politics in advance of the U.S. midterm elections ...\u00a0The company said in a blog post that it removed 32 accounts from Facebook and Instagram because they were involved in \"coordinated\" political behavior and appeared to be fake. Facebook did not explicitly say that the effort was aimed at influencing the midterm elections in November, but the timing of the suspicious activity would be consistent with such an attempt.\u00a0The company, which said it is in the early stages of its investigation, held briefings in the House and Senate this week. Facebook\u00a0said it doesn't know who is behind the efforts, but said there may be connections to Russia. The company said it has found some connections between the accounts it removed and the accounts connected to Russia's Internet Research Agency that it removed before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND INFAMOUS:\u00a0Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's lavish lifestyle was front-and-center during opening arguments in his fraud trial, as prosecutors said he lied to put his money ahead of the law, while defense attorneys -- and even the presiding judge -- reminded jurors that exorbitant wealth, in itself, is not a crime ...\u00a0Prosecutors also called their first witness in the case: former Bernie Sanders campaign adviser Tad Devine, who worked closely with Manafort on several elections in Ukraine, including the successful 2010 presidential campaign of since-deposed pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. Devine, under cross-examination by Manafort attorney Richard Wesley, confirmed that Manafort's former business partner Rick Gates handled most of Manafort's day-to-day business operations. The admission was significant because defense attorney Thomas Zehnle said in his opening statement that Manafort relied on others to keep track of the millions of dollars he was earning from his Ukrainian political work, and had misplaced his trust in Gates, who\u00a0cut a deal with prosecutors and is expected to testify in the trial. 3D-PRINTED GUNS FIRE BLANKS - FOR NOW:\u00a0A federal judge in Seattle issued a restraining order Tuesday afternoon temporarily stopping the release of blueprints to make untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed plastic guns ...\u00a0U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order a day after eight states sued the government to block a settlement reached by the Trump administration last month allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms. The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday. The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on Aug. 10. FOX BUSINESS EXCLUSIVE - MOONVES NOT HIDING FROM SCANDAL:\u00a0CBS honcho Les Moonves is planning to speak on the company's earnings call on Thursday, the latest indication that the embattled CEO plans to maintain a public profile amid an internal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations, the FOX Business Network's Charles Gasparino has learned ...\u00a0\u00a0The news, after first being reported by FOX\u00a0Business, spiked shares of CBS as much as 2.28 percent in early afternoon trading Tuesday. Shares of CBS ended the day at $52.67, up 2.71 percent in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company still\u00a0may decide at the last minute to pull Moonves, handing over the duties to the other two executives who deal with analysts' questions during earnings calls: Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianiello and Adam Townsend, investor relations chief, a CBS insider said.\u00a0But the plan,\u00a0as of now,\u00a0is to allow Moonves to appear on the call and take analysts' questions.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 30, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Just a week to go from tonight until the midterms and Election Day is finally becoming a referendum on something that really matters, immigration. Who gets to live here? What does citizenship mean? What kind of country do we want? These are not small incidental questions, which you are watching is not an argument about Russian Facebook ads or Stormy Daniels or her creepy lawyer or some other diversion designed to prevention from thinking clearly. These are core debates. These are the arguments that every functioning democracy must have and yet ours rarely does. Consider the question of birthright citizenship. Under current interpretations of American law anyone born on our soil automatically becomes a U.S. citizen. Context is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if your parents were terrorists or illegal aliens or foreign saboteurs, if their plane was forced down to refuel and you emerged. It doesn't matter If you were born on our property, you are a citizen. In a recent interview with Axios, President Trump suggested, this is not a great deal for America. He pledged to change it with an executive order. As of tonight, it seems likely that order would abolish so-called birth tourism. That's where people travel to the United States solely for the purpose of having kids and winning citizenship along with the many benefits that follow from that. We'll know more about it soon and of course we'll tell you when we do know. But nobody else in Washington is waiting for details. They hate it already. The very same people who have spent decades trying to gut the Bill of Rights are now lecturing the rest of us that the idea is brace yourself unconstitutional. Paul Ryan for example, he is the outgoing speaker of the House. He announced his opposition to this immediately. The very idea he said is ridiculous. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN: Well, you obviously cannot do that. You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well obviously, obviously. Note the phrasing. Obviously, that's what people say when they don't feel like making a rational case for their positions, usually because they can't. Is it really \"obvious\" that the Constitution requires us to give citizenship to the children of illegal aliens. Paul Ryan has no idea. He just doesn't want to have a conversation about it. He wants you to be quiet. In fact, as a legal matter, it is an open question. The Supreme Court has never ruled on it. But there is ample reason to believe the law does not apply to illegal immigrants or birth tourists. Birthright citizenship arises from the 14th Amendment that was passed just three years after the Civil War and it was passed to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. The senator who wrote the citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howard of Michigan explained the point of it on the Senate floor at the time. \"The Amendment will not of course include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\" Again, the Amendment was designed to ensure that newly freed slaves would be treated as the American citizens they were. The point was to enfranchise African-Americans. The point was not to enable the rest of the world to scam our system, to abuse our generosity. Trump's proposal would get us closer to the purpose of the 14th Amendment. And for that he is being denounced naturally as a racist. Listen to some of the dumb people on TV. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What used to be five years ago, 10 years ago, dog whistles to appeal to the fears of white voters now are just stated openly. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The principal debate in Europe in the United States, the real fault line that gets people going is this issue of openness. How open are we to people? How open are we to trade? And it's this issue of national identity versus internationalism, globalism if you will. So what Donald Trump is doing is he is mining that fault line. He is working it, whether it's birthright citizenship, whether it's sending troops to a border that's not under siege. We're no longer arguing serious issues about how to regulate our economies. We're no longer arguing serious issues say about how to fight the Cold War. We are arguing questions about national identity and that's not that far to get from that to issues of racism. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So, let's get this straight, defining citizenship is not \"a serious issue\", only in New York and Washington where serious is where to find good Barada or how to get to the Hamptons in under three hours on a Friday night. These people are total buffoons. In fact, there is no more serious debate than the debate over citizenship. And it's long overdue. Globally. birthright citizenship is the rare exception. It is not the rule. Canada and the U.S. are the only developed countries that have birthright citizenship. Not a single European country allows it. Out of the 54 countries in Africa, only two offer birthright citizenship. Are the other 52 racists? How about Harry Reid, is he a racist too? Watch the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader explain his views on birthright citizenship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER SEN. HARRY REID: With making it easy to be an illegal alien is enough. How about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? No sane country would do that. Right. Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission to give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides and that's a lot of services. Is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer expense in country, county run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien mothers? (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Now as a factual matter, that's tougher than anything Donald Trump has ever said. Keep in mind that just four years ago that man Harry Reid was the top Democrat in the Senate. Try saying that today, he'd be called Bull Connor and shouted off the stage. But the questions he raised are still fair questions. Is unlimited birthright citizenship helping this country or is it hurting this country? Under our current system, illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. and have children are eligible to receive tax credits, food stamps, other welfare benefits. Those are huge incentives. Not surprisingly, one in every 12 births in this country right now is to someone here illegally and that total does not even include birth tourism. Every year tens of thousands of foreign nationals come to this country on tourist visas solely to give birth to children. The Chinese are strongly overrepresented in this. One ad in China offers \"high end U.S. birth tourism specialists\" for just 20 grands, these experts navigate clients through the process of having a child in America. In return for that 20 grands, their kids gain the right to Social Security, Medicare and countless other federal programs. If they come back to the U.S. for college, they get in-state tuition, federally backed student loans, financial aid, all the benefits that ought to be going to actual Americans who are drowning in college debt. This is a scam. There is no other word for it. And by the way don't blame the Chinese or the Russians or the Salvadorans or anybody else using the system, we're the ones offering it. Why wouldn't they take it? The blame lies with us. No other country would allow itself to be relentlessly exploited like this for decades and no other leadership class would side with foreigners over its own people. And yet ours does every time and that tells you everything. Michael Anton is a former senior National Security official in the Trump administration, a lecturer at Hillsdale College and probably the first person in this generation to raise the question of whether birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional. Thank you very much Michael Anton. You wrote this piece, I think began this current conversation this past July and people were stunned to find out that this was not a settled matter, most believe this is etched on the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, but it's not. MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL: Right. CARLSON: And I do want to give credit where credit's due to people that I learned these arguments from. John Eastman. ANTON: Yes. CARLSON: The constitutional scholar and lawyer litigator, he litigates constitutional questions and Edward Irler, who was a student of the American Founding in the Civil War era, who has done a really scholarly work on this. I learned this argument from them. They're two of my teachers, but it's true that it had kind of gone dormant for a while. ANTON: Dormant, this is flat earth society stuff. So, everyone believes that we have a constitutional mandate to allow the children of illegal aliens to become citizens. And they base that belief on a misreading of the very first sentence of the 14th Amendment, which says all persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens. They leave out the part in the middle, subject to the jurisdiction thereof. They either leave it out or they say subject to the jurisdiction just means you have to obey the law. Well, everybody has to obey the law. If you're a tourist coming from England or Canada or anywhere, you have to obey U.S. law while you're in the United States. CARLSON: Yes. ANTON: That doesn't make your children a citizen or U.S. citizen. Subject to the jurisdiction meant something specific to the people who wrote the Amendment. We know this, because they said. You read the debates over the Amendment. They said, it means that you don't owe allegiance to any foreign power, to anyone else, you're subject to the complete jurisdiction in the United States. It means you're not a citizen of another country. So, it clearly doesn't apply to people who aren't citizens or who are born to people who aren't citizens, who are subject to the jurisdiction of another country. The Constitution is clear on that point. There is no statute that says otherwise. But decades ago, the executive branch agencies of the federal government just decided to apply this principle as if Well, we owe everyone birthright citizenship. Now why do they do that. Why do bureaucracies typically in our country anyway typically act without authority. Usually, it's to serve the interests of liberalism when the administrative state starts doing something that it's not authorized to do and that no one has ever told it to do, you can bet it's not doing so for conservative reasons or for reasons that benefit American citizens. It's doing so for reasons that benefit liberalism. And that's what happened in this case. CARLSON: So, you're hearing the argument now from the usual course of dumb people that this like everything that they don't like is racist. ANTON: Right. CARLSON: Correct me if I'm wrong, but the purpose of this Amendment was to enfranchise people who had been and so African-Americans who'd been enslaved. ANTON: Absolutely. CARLSON: And so, in what sense would this. I mean does that argument even make sense. ANTON: No. CARLSON: I want to take it seriously. ANTON: As you say though, the racist it's just a cudgel with which to beat up people whose arguments you don't like. So, the 13th Amendment freed every slave. You had a controversy at the time where some states were saying, OK, you can free the slaves, but we have the power to make them citizens and we're not going to do it. So, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The same Congress, same year that drafted this Amendment that was vetoed by President Johnson. The veto was overridden. So, you get two-thirds of both houses saying, free black slaves, they are citizens. And that also says not subject to any foreign power. Well then, some of the Southern states came back with. OK, well 1857, the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott that no black person, even a free black person could ever be a citizen of the United States. So, the reconstruction Congress said, OK, then we're going to put this in the Constitution, we're not going to let you get away with this. We're going to make this undeniable that every freed slave and their descendants are citizens of the United States. CARLSON: So, an Amendment designed to enfranchise African-Americans born here, being here 400 years, 500 years is now being used by Chinese nationals. ANTON: And Russians too. CARLSON: Russians flying into Guam or Los Angeles to have children here that would be not the original intent. I think it's-- ANTON: Absolutely not. I mean one of the things that I find incredible and amusing sadly so though is that Russia hysteria of our time, Russia supposed to be the biggest enemy of the United States has right now, more dangerous enemy than in the Cold War. We're all supposed to be almost on a war footing with Russia. CARLSON: Yes. ANTON: And the President is criticized for saying maybe we should cool it a little bit and turn the heat down. However, we can't question the practice of Russian women flying to Miami and having their babies to get U.S. birth. So, this supposed enemy of ours, it's a sacrosanct principle to allow them to abuse our system by giving citizenship to their children who are born here, spend a couple of days and then go back to Montreal. So, the real principle that undergirds it is hurting ourselves who are required to hurt ourselves. CARLSON: Hurting ourselves and of course hurting the President. ANTON: The story is all about hurting the President. CARLSON: In America, masochism being the operating impulse of the left. It's bizarre. ANTON: Yes. CARLSON: Michael Anton who kicked this off. Thank you very much. ANTON: Thank you for having me. CARLSON: The president traveled to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania today following the murder of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue and Squirrel Hill neighborhood there. Trace Gallagher has more on what happened. Trace? TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: Tucker, the president's first stop was in fact Squirrel Hill, the historic hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. It is also where the Tree of Life synagogue is located. The scene of Saturday's 20-minute shooting rampage that took the lives of 11 people. The deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. The synagogue itself remains a crime scene, but the president, First Lady, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner along with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Chief of Staff John Kelly went into the vestibule to light candles. And then following Jewish tradition. The president lay stones and white roses on 11 Star of David Markers planted near a makeshift memorial to the victims. The president and his group were accompanied by Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers whose heroics likely saved many lives during the attack. Rabbi Meyer first said, he welcomed Mr. Trump's visit. Then after getting pushback from some congregants changed his mind, but finally decided that accompanying the First Family was the right thing to do. Pittsburgh's Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto and Pennsylvania's Democratic Governor Tom Wolfe chose not to meet with the president. Mr. Trump did not speak during today's visit, but here's what he told Laura Ingraham last night. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I am just going to pay my respects. I am also going to the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And in fact, the president did go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to visit the wounded. The first funerals were also held today, one for 66-year old Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz and enjoying service for brother Cecil and David Rosenthal. Tucker. CARLSON: Chris Gallagher for us. Thanks very much, Chris. Mid-term elections one week from right now one in battle Democrat wants to make it absolutely clear, she is not a nut case like everyone else in the Democratic party. Lisa Boothe has the latest on that race and others after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well, a week from right now, we'll be sitting on the set, reading you election returns, bunch of races coming down to the wire and the landscape still unclear, just seven days out. Once you get closer, kind of couple of different races tonight to get a better sense of what's about to happen. In the state of Florida, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. He's the Mayor of Tallahassee, the one who apparently was under FBI investigation. He decided to boost his odds by feuding with the president. He tweeted this, \"I heard that Donald Trump ran home to Fox News to lie about me. But as my grandmother told me, never wrestle with a pig, you both get dirty=, but the pig likes it. So, ignore him and vote Florida!\". Meanwhile, undercover journalist James O'Keefe has a new video in which a staffer for Kyrsten Sinema out in Arizona says that Sinema is hiding her liberalism to deceive voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You might say, bear, guns and California, we're all like, yes ban them. You say, ban guns out here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is a lot of very conservative people in Arizona. So, she can't alienate the conservative or moderate conservative voters by a super approach. She is pro-choice. She is very liberal and progressive. But she doesn't in this election when to draw too much attention to being progressive. Because she's trying to be more, that's why I think she took so much Democratic help too. Otherwise, she-- (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Yes. Because the country is not quite as crazy as the Democratic Party even in 2018, so lie about it. That's what's happening in Missouri perhaps where Claire McCaskill, the incumbent senator is disavowing the Democratic Party. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D-MO.: I would say this. I would not call my colleagues crazy, but Elizabeth Warren sure went after me when I advocated to link back some of the regulations for small banks and credit unions. I certainly disagree with Bernie Sanders on a bunch of stuff. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: For the record, there is literally no difference between Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill. But whatever, Independent Women's Voice Senior Fellow Lisa Boothe has been on these campaigns for us for a while now and doing a great job. LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks. CARLSON: Lisa, I sense a theme here. Let's start with the McCaskill clip that we just played where some Democrats and some states are pretending to be much more moderate than their voting record suggests they really are. BOOTHE: Well absolutely, Claire McCaskill has said that Elizabeth Warren is one of those crazy Democrats. Yet she has voted with her 60 percent of the time and she's voted with Senator Chuck Schumer 80 percent of the time and she's only voted with President Trump 45 percent of the time. But guess what? She is trying to show that she is chummy with President Trump because he won the state of Missouri by 19 points. She told Brett Baer that she 100 percent supports President Trump's policies on the caravan and on his immigration response to that. So, she is trying to run to the center and Josh Hawley, who is a Republican opponent has really made this issue by calling out Claire McCaskill and saying, you are not a moderate. You are two left leaning for the state. So that's what this is all in response to with Claire McCaskill. CARLSON: Yes, and I've got to say the senatorial comment I can't repress. If Trump wins the state by 19 points, the Republicans should be doing a little better than they're doing in my opinion. I mean look what is that. It's Missouri. But anyway, in Arizona-- BOOTHE: Can't disagree. CARLSON: Yes, please. Kyrsten Sinema Of course running against Martha McSally, the Congresswoman, a veteran, U.S. military veteran. Where is that race right now would you say? BOOTHE: It's still really tight and that is interesting. I would say that President Trump didn't win Arizona by that much in 2016. So, I think it is a little bit more of a swing state than people give it credit for. But look Kyrsten Sinema didn't really start moderating her views until 2012. And so now she is trying to, ever since then she's been trying to present herself as more of a moderate. This is someone that in 2010 attended a Netroots Conference, which is where she said, Arizona is the meth lab of democracy. As you know Netroots is this uber progressive organization and conference. She has also called herself a Prada Socialist in the past and she's had these crazy left-wing ideas and policies on military in the past as well as border security and being part of this no deaths group. So, she is clearly made a calculated move to move to the center, because that's what it takes to win the state of Arizona as a Democrat and for the Project Veritas video, they edited that. We can't independently verify that at Fox News, but I think what it does show is that she's clearly trying to hide some of these past positions that she's had. CARLSON: At least Beto O'Rourke who I would eat broken glass for voting for, I'm not endorsing Beto O'Rourke, but at least I'm kind of a far out progressive and be honest about it. BOOTHE: Right. CARLSON: Maybe get points for that. Maybe, Sinema is going to do the same. Lisa great to see you tonight. BOOTHE: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, a handful of black conservatives are advocating what they're calling Blexit, that would be an exodus of African-Americans from the Democratic Party. Could that actually happen? We've got an update on it next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: So, Kanye West gave a long stream of consciousness talk in the White House recently and he was roundly attacked for. But if you listen carefully, there were some insightful points that he made and some important questions, including whether black Americans ought to be monolithically loyal to the Democratic Party. Why should they be? That's a question other people are asking as well, Star Parker is one of them. She's founder and president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education, she's wrote a piece suggesting that Democrats have moved left on religion and social policy, even the rule of law itself. They could continue to alienate some conservative minded black voters. Star Parker joins us tonight. Star Parker thank you very much for coming on. STAR PARKER, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR URBAN RENEWAL AND EDUCATION: You're welcome. CARLSON: So, there was simple question first, why should African-Americans who for generations have been very loyal to the Democratic Party rethink that loyalty? PARKER: Well, they've been loyal to the Democratic Party, because blacks have bought this idea of activist government, but something very exciting is happening now with Trump in office. The Trump administration is focusing on urban communities and initiatives, so we have two things happening right now that are very, very exciting. Number one, African-American millennials those that kind of weather are motivated, those who can excel and are motivated and say, wait a minute, what have Democrats done for us. We first of all, the millennial does not buy this racism behind every rock narrative of the Democrat Party, because their friends are diverse, they've grown up in a society post-civil rights era. So, they don't know that world at all. But secondly, they're individuals. They like uniqueness. We can see that in the tattoos that they wear. And so, this whole idea of collectivism and big government doesn't work for them as well. But what's also happened is you had that baby boom black, the baby boom black is more traditional in their world view. So, now the Democrat Party has become so extreme to the left, so progressive that it's conflicting with that baby boom black's world view and values and they're concerned about their grandchildren of what they're learning in school. So, we'll see how it all plays out. We're looking very closely. Our group is looking very closely at Wisconsin, at Michigan when we're talking about the Senate seats, when we're talking about the governor seats, we should all be looking at Georgia. We should look at Florida and then even to some degree in Maryland. So, I'm very excited about the momentum. CARLSON: So, if you're an African-American voter and your family has been in this country for 400 years, long time in a lot of cases and all of a sudden, your party is telling you that the real concern is people who aren't even here legally foreign nationals from other countries. Do you ask yourself at some point, what about me, the American citizen? PARKER: Right. CARLSON: Does that turn off voters at a certain point? PARKER: It's not only turning them off that that this hijacking of the civil rights movement is taking place for legal minorities, but illegals are even more frustrated, because now you're looking at an environment to where you have that low wage worker competing for jobs in communities and against people who will not speak English. So, it's not only affecting the real low wage, it's affecting the middle class, because if you want to work in any type of public service for the fire, for the police, for the teachers, anything, you have to be bilingual and this is making a tremendous impact on African-Americans to rethink who these new arrivals are and why they-- CARLSON: I think that's a totally fair question. I never even thought about the bilingual question, but it's a real one. PARKER: It's horrible. You can't even - in California for instance you can take the driver's license test in 40 language. CARLSON: But so, why - I never hear Maxine Waters or any member of the CBC mention that. Why? PARKER: Because they're very invested in progressivism, it's their job to make sure blacks do not get any of this information. The whole Congressional Black Caucus is similar to the overseer during slavery. They had to make sure that no slave gets any information of freedom and that's been their role for the last 50 years. What's happening now with the Internet is people are getting more information. If I gave it my organization UrbanCURE, we have our own news site blackcommunitynews.com, so people are getting other sources of news and they're finding out the truth. But President Trump has said lately about fake news is very real. So, there are many instruments now competing against that to the mainstream media so that we can get other information and blacks are hearing those messages. CARLSON: Star Parker, thank you for joining us. PARKER: You're welcome. CARLSON: San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world could get more expensive very soon. The city may start taxing businesses, hundreds of millions of dollars. They say, we'll fight homelessness. Will it work? I'll speak to a local politician about that after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well, start off and cover the news anymore, but American forces are still fighting in Afghanistan, it's been 17 years since we first sent troops there to topple the Taliban government. We still have thousands of Americans in the country. So far this year, eight of them have been killed. President Trump hates this. We happened to know, he has often complained to people around him about the quagmire that Afghanistan has become. You remember that when he ran for president, one of Trump's central promises was to keep America out of pointless foreign wars like this one. Washington despised him for saying that because it implicated them and their failures, but voters appreciated hearing it. And yet somehow the war in Afghanistan has continued to this day fruitlessly. That's thanks almost entirely to bullying from our thoroughly discredited foreign policy establishment. They are happy to keep things the way they are. 17 years later though we as a country have almost nothing to show for what we spent there the lives and the money. The Taliban remains strong. The U.S. backed government controls barely half of that country. This spring the DOJ described Afghanistan as \"largely lawless, weak and dysfunctional.\" Most depressing of all, we're no longer even aiming at any kind of military victory. The best we can hope for is the sort of stalemate that keeps the Taliban partly in power. So, what is the point of all of this. Well, some people are getting rich from it. Drive through the DC suburbs some time and see for yourself. But most Americans derive no benefit at all. Some families are paying the highest possible price. Two years in, it's not too late for the president to deliver on a campaign promise, he once made and end this disaster. Tomorrow might be a good day to start with that. San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities to live in or do business in, could soon get even more costly. This Tuesday as city - the voters in the city will consider an initiative that would implement a new tax on businesses that money they say would be used to fight homelessness. If approved the tax is expected to cost businesses in San Francisco about $200 million a year. Joe Alioto Veronese is a former member of the San Francisco Police Commission, he is currently running for DA there. He's a frequent guest on the show and he joins us tonight. Joe, thanks very much for coming on. JOE ALIOTO VERONESE, FORMER MEMBER, SAN FRANCISCO POLICE COMMISSION: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So, tax to fight homelessness. How much right now did San Francisco spent already on homelessness? VERONESE: Well, the number they throw out is $300 million, but it's probably closer to about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, if you take into account all the resources that each of the city departments are putting into the issue. The fire department alone and one of the fire commissioners here, we have recently did an audit and almost half of our calls are homeless related calls, 40 percent of our calls are homeless related calls. So, there are a lot of resources going into this issue and I think the mayor is right on this one. She has only been in office for about six months. She says no on C, which is the proposition you're speaking of. And I think she's right about it, because there is this institution that's been built around homelessness that if we keep feeding it money and it's not showing results, it's really just a practice of lunacy. And so, this mayor has said, she's dedicated to the number one issue of solving homelessness. So, for her to say that no on C is really a big deal because she personally sees where this money goes. And so, she is fixing this problem the way it should be. CARLSON: If I can just say, I was just there last week, and the city is inherently beautiful, obviously you know that, but it's the filthiest place I have been in North America. That's a billion dollars in. One or two cities have traditionally done which is to say you're not allowed to shoot heroin on the sidewalk or defecate in front of kids on Market Street. Wouldn't that be a good start, a zero tolerance for outrageous behavior in public? VERONESE: Well, certainly accountability Absolutely, but that's different from homelessness, right. Because you have people that are on the street on a daily basis that aren't necessarily homeless. But if you want to get rid of some of that behavior, you have to install some accountability, our current district attorney has announced he's not running for district attorney again for re-election because he is going to care for his sick mother, which is great, but that leaves our city in a lame Dutch status of which it kind of already was, because a lot of the criminals know they can get away with things here in San Francisco and not be prosecuted much like the images and the things that you're seeing on the streets there. CARLSON: But where is - hold on, I mean I believe that your district attorney is lame. I mean the proof is in the fruit. But where is everybody else, if you walk down Market Street and there are people sleeping perpendicular on the sidewalk in puddles of urine, why do people put up with that? Why doesn't someone say, get out of here. I'm sorry you don't have a right, you don't own the sidewalk, you can't do this, my kids are here. Where are those people, the normal people? VERONESE: I think the people of San Francisco are fed up and they are everywhere. And we're waiting for this new mayor to step up and do something about it. But frankly, she can't do it on her own. We need a district attorney that's going to help out as well and the police department is starting to show some signs that they're going to step up as well under this new mayor. But the reality of it is a lot of San Franciscans, a lot of San Franciscans are fed up with it and they just throw their hands up because they can't solve the problems themselves. They expect the leadership to solve those problems. This current leadership in the DA's office is not doing it. And so that's one of the reasons why I'm running for DA. CARLSON: Have you thought about maybe sending a delegation to, I don't know rural Vietnam or Burma or somewhere in Southeast Asia where the economy is hundred for size of San Francisco. But where there is none of this and ask like why don't you have people defecating on the sidewalk, because you won't put up with it. VERONESE: Tucker, you don't even need to go that far. You know the Bay Area. If you go into the Presidio just across the street from San Francisco, I spoke to some of the police officers there. They have no homelessness there, you don't see people shooting up. It's because they don't tolerate it. CARLSON: Exactly. VERONESE: And the example is right in our backyard. All we have to do is look to the Presidio. CARLSON: Because they won't tolerate it. I love that. That ought to be your campaign slogan. I'd send you money. Joe, thank you. Good to see you. VERONESE: Thanks. Hold on to your money, Tucker. CARLSON: I am going to. I know we disagree, but I agree with that. Thanks. Well, the creepy porn lawyer has had a rough couple of weeks. We've been following it very closely. That's our job. He mangled his attack on Brett Kavanaugh, but he is undeterred in his presidential bid. He's making preparations, tons of people here in Washington are helping him. What is that? We have details after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Michael Avenatti is a beast. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, that's true. He is a beast. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a beast and he keep popping Donald Trump in all of his folks in the mouth. Jon Meacham says, he may be the savior of the Republic. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He really is a master of the media cycle. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I owe Michael Avenatti an apology for the last couple of weeks, I've been saying, I'm not for writing Michael. I've seen you everywhere. What do you have left to say? I was wrong brother. You have a lot to say. The Democrats could learn something for you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has a bigger calling here that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he is doing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The priesthood. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Whatever. He is out there saving the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: The savior of the Republic, you know the creepy porn lawyer really is, he's a Rorschach blot. What you see when you look at him tells you a lot about you. Well, it used to be a media darling as you just saw. But in the past month, it has gotten a lot tougher to be the creepy porn lawyer. First, he failed to defame Brett Kavanaugh after accusing him of serial gang rape. Then he was exposed for failing to pay his taxes. His law firm is even being evicted for not paying rent. Failing on all sides, he has decided to do what they always do in Washington seek refuge and audacity. He's gearing up for a presidential run. Politico reports the creepy porn lawyer already assembled a team of veteran Democratic advisers, including Jack Quinn, who is quite a famous Democratic adviser here in Washington to help him raise money, craft a message and ultimately rule the land as president. Maybe, the creepy porn president will do better than the creepy porn lawyer has done. Tammy Bruce is radio host president of Independent Women's Voice. She joins us tonight. So Tammy, I mean the whole point of never using his name, which I don't even know to be honest at this point is to send obviously the signal that we are not going to take this wholly seriously and yet there are people in Washington, Jack Quinn again, the famous Clinton friend and sort of an eminent guy and a nice guy, he apparently is advising creepy porn lawyer. So, why are all these Democrats taking a non- serious candidacy so seriously. TAMMY BRUCE, RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, they think there might be money. Look, for a lot of these people, this is their job, 24/7 right, 365 is that they work for candidates and people who are ginning up their profile to be serious people or more serious people. But clearly for the Democrats, the bar has become very, very low. It's so low, it's on the floor and you saw that the comments with your montage really remarkable, if this guy not only with the IRS having trouble losing a lawsuit from a former partner to the tune of over $4 million. His former client Stormy Daniels had been told by a judge that she has to pay Donald Trump's legal fees having lost part of a case against him, which is now like over $300,000. So, while creepy porn lawyer is elevating his profile using these people, she is probably going to have to go bankrupt. Julie Swetnick is, and he are under being referred for a criminal investigation by the Senate. She is going to have to get a different lawyer as well to defend her. So, he is destroying these lives and using these women and it looks like maybe the Democratic Party is the next woman that he wants to use to get more money or to elevate themselves. CARLSON: That's such a good point. And actually, I made that point to him in his one and only appearance on this Senate. BRUCE: You did. CARLSON: Here we go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Stormy Daniels was to perform in Richmond in a depressing strip club, you say you're protecting - you're her protector. Why is she working in seedy strip clubs, while you're on television wearing expensive suits? Why are you not exploiting her, why is she doing that? MICHAEL AVENATTI, ATTORNEY: Because she wants to. Tucker. This is America. This is America and guess what, if a woman wants to perform in a strip club, she does so even though-- CARLSON: But she is not getting rich. AVENATTI: Even though people are not getting rich. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: How badly do you think Stormy Daniels wants to perform at strip clubs in Richmond? BRUCE: Look, she - women make their own decisions. We all find our own level and we make choices based on what best suits us. The problem with Mr. Creepy porn lawyer is that, the only thing missing from him is the giant gold ring and a big giant gold necklace as he's using this process to benefit himself. And you see that as the clients lose, as they not - they don't just lose Tucker, they end up having charges against them or having to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, so that they lose, and they get ruined. Now that's the Democrats - look he might be a perfect Democrat candidate because that's what the Democrats do to the country, right. They get in there, they bankrupt us, they ruin our lives, and everything is worse. So, this is clearly what we should expect from the Democrats. But in fact, the base deserves better, women regardless of their party deserve better. The Democrats think that they're - it's that the Me-Too movement and yet this is the man that they want to elevate in this process. They're desperate. There clearly is no talent left. There clearly is maybe not even a party at this point. And that exchange with you Tucker will go down in infamy as an example of what we would expect and would want from leaders in this country and the Democratic Party clearly has I think a hit. Well, I don't know if it's rock bottom yet. Maybe the team of creepy porn lawyer and Hillary for 20 will be great. CARLSON: I want to reasonable Democrat to win. BRUCE: I want that. Yes. CARLSON: They can win. Tammy Bruce, thank you for your smart analysis. BRUCE: Thanks for having me on. CARLSON: Well, the migrant caravan which we're not supposed to talk about because it's wrong. But we're going to anyway is still on its way north making its way here. President said, he's going to meet with thousands of U.S. troops. Is that a smart thing to do? Will it affect the mid-term election a week from today? That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: In the last week before the mid-terms, the political landscape is coming back around to where it all started two years ago. Immigration is a central topic by deploying troops to the border and planning an executive order on birthright citizenship, terrain and birth tourism. President is making it clear that the border and whether it exists at all or ought to be defended is the central issue. Bryan Dean Wright is a Democratic former CIA officer and he joins us tonight. Bryan, thanks for coming on. So, you're a lifelong Democrat from a family of Democrats from Eastern Oregon, moderate FDR Democrats. So, taking Trump the man out of the equation, when they hear policies like this, send troops to the border end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. What's their response as Democrats to that? BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Positive, and the reason is that I think most folks feel a degree of compassion, certain in my own family. CARLSON: Yes. WRIGHT: For the people in Central, South America who are struggling economically, they're in places of poverty. CARLSON: Well, sure. WRIGHT: But most people understand my family included that we have laws for a reason and you can't come in uninvited and unguided and just march across the border. And secondarily, you can't come to the country have children and have very poor English abilities and certainly poor ability to get a job and support your own family and then expect a country or a bunch of other people to support you. So, I think my family is like most and that we want to have compassion for folks who are struggling and suffering. But we also believe that people come here because of the rule of law. And if you don't have the rule of law, you don't have the stability needed to create and grow and create a country that attracts people. CARLSON: Exactly. And you're also from a part of the country that doesn't get a lot of attention which is to say you're not from New York, Los Angeles or Washington DC. And so, the zip code that you grew up and the town that you're from, is it a lot richer than it was 10 years ago. Probably not, right? WRIGHT: No. CARLSON: So, do people there wonder a lot of attention is being paid to foreign nationals, but what about us. WRIGHT: Sure. Well look, I think that you have heard that over the past 20 or 30 years, you had NAFTA certainly, the Chinese entering the WTO that gigantic sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about the 90s, when China started grabbing a lot of those industrial manufacturing facilities, different parts of the country. That impacted places where I come from, right. And my hometown was impacted, our timber mill shutdown. So, absolutely people get frustrated that they feel like they have been left behind and the Democratic Party I think has done a very poor job at rallying the people in rural communities, because they focus now on identity politics, right. If you are particularly colored skin, if you are a woman, if you are gay, whatever it is that's who we want to focus on as a party. We're not interested in people in places that are more rural or people that don't fit that that desired demographic by Democratic Party. And so, I have certainly heard a continued frustration by my family, my friends and I hope that the Democratic Party wakes up and if they don't then you know what the Republicans should continue to do well, because they will serve the interest of the rural people better than anyone else. CARLSON: I would say the leadership on the Hill of the Republican Party cares about rural people about as much as the Democratic Party does, which is not at all. But there are - I think there is a growing realization that that's who they represent. Those who are their people. Why do you think the Democratic Party explicitly attacks people from towns like yours? WRIGHT: I think that we have become in their minds the deplorables, that wasn't just a slip of the tongue by Hillary Clinton. We are the people who cling to our guns and our God. And that's a bad thing. Again, famous words spoken by President Obama. So, for whatever reason, we have become expendable and I think a part of that is because we don't have the numbers that you will find in more urban areas that can bring votes. And so, our interests aren't exactly of interest. And that's frankly the bottom-line is a political calculus that we are not as important as we once used to be, which by the way we're in a big time in the Senate. Right. CARLSON: Yes. Well, certainly it will, despised minority group under attack by politicians rural America. It's pretty disgusting. Thank you. You put it so nicely. WRIGHT: Pleasure. CARLSON: Great to see you. WRIGHT: Thank you. CARLSON: Our show is over. We're sad about that, but we will be back again tomorrow night at 8 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink all in great abundance right now.

            "article_content": "Dodging insults to defending against violent attacks, students at UC Berkeley open up about the dangers and fears of being conservative on a campus famous for its liberal culture. Recent First Amendment rulings by the Supreme Court could force courts and university administrators to take a closer look at controversial practices that have marginalized certain political views \u2013 often conservative ones \u2013 on campus. Free speech on campus has emerged as a hot debate in recent years, amid a rash of speakers being disinvited or violently protested. These issues are often handled in-house \u2013 but now, the courts could hold sway. \u201cWe should expect college campuses to truly be marketplaces of ideas where students learn to value free speech and open inquiry and take that lesson with them as they become the next generation of judges, legislators, teachers and voters,\u201d Casey Mattox, senior fellow for free speech and toleration at the libertarian Charles Koch Institute, told Fox News. One key ruling could be in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, which struck a direct blow to public-employee unions by holding government workers don\u2019t have to pay certain fees to labor groups. But it included a free-speech component that could have a ripple effect on campus. Most public universities require students to pay student activity fees, which in some cases support lopsided politics, according to a report by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a campus free speech legal group. The Supreme Court had rejected a 2000 challenge to such fees, determining a school could require students to pay for the expression of views with which they disagree, as long as the university doesn\u2019t engage in viewpoint discrimination when allocating funds. However, the Janus decision more broadly prevents forcing one person to pay for someone else\u2019s political expression. Mattox argued schools may have to then take a close look at whether their student fees are used in a partisan way. Ironically, cracking down on these fees could free up student groups to bring more speakers onto campus \u2013 in turn, representing a more diverse set of views. \u201cCurrently, many universities limit student group fundraising and prohibit dues \u2013 essentially requiring groups to be funded from these mandatory fees,\u201d said Mattox, also the former senior counsel for academic freedom at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious liberty group. \u201cIf student groups could raise their own funds for speakers and have members pay dues, they could fund their own speakers even without mandatory dues.\u201d Public universities have long made news for blocking speakers, mostly from the right, such as Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager and Ann Coulter -- but also some on the left including Bill Maher and William Ayers. FIRE, the legal group, even assembled a \u201cDisinvitation Database\u201d of blocked speakers. Similar to Janus, other recent cases don\u2019t directly speak to campus free speech, but could establish new precedents, Mattox said. The Supreme Court, in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, struck down a\u00a0Minnesota law that prevented anyone in close proximity of a polling place from wearing certain political-oriented clothing and apparel. The high court held the Minnesota law gave too much discretion to the interpretation of a polling worker or election judge. But, it said states can regulate expression near polling places if it is \u201cguided by objective, workable standards.\u201dThis could push public universities and colleges to set more finite guidelines to determine how student fees are spent to avoid viewpoint discrimination, Mattox said. \u201cThe Mansky decision means that universities will need to guarantee they have systems in place to prevent discrimination against student groups seeking recognition, funding, or to reserve meeting space,\u201d Mattox said. The states of Missouri, Arizona, Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Tennessee, North Carolina and Wisconsin all passed free speech laws for college campuses, according to an American Association of University Professor report in April. Most of these laws prohibit limiting speech to free speech zones and bars viewpoint discrimination. However, the AAUP opposes these laws and proposals. \u201cEven if the current political environment poses significant problems for free speech, the view that the free exchange of ideas no longer occurs on campuses is grossly exaggerated,\u201d the AAUP\u2019s April report concludes. \u201cMany of the most difficult issues surrounding free speech at present are about balancing unobstructed dialogue with the need to make all constituencies on campus feel included.\u201d The Supreme Court, in\u00a0National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) v. Becerra, also struck down a California law regulating professional speech by requiring pro-life pregnancy centers to provide information on abortion. Mattox anticipates this could impact how certain professional schools and university degree programs have used professional ethics codes as speech codes for students.

Sign up\u00a0here.**On the roster: New attorney general, new headaches for Trump -\u00a0Scott\u2019s lead down to .18 percent as recount looms - Sinema takes the lead as Arizona count creeps forward -\u00a0Runoff hopes dangling, Abrams sues to extend count\u00a0-\u00a0In Oklahoma, the deer hunt youNEW ATTORNEY GENERAL, NEW HEADACHES FOR TRUMP\nPresident Donald Trump\u00a0may soon come to miss his old attorney general.\nThe decision to fire\u00a0Jeff Sessions\u00a0as attorney general was hardly a surprise. Trump had long chained him to a rock like Prometheus\u00a0and sent tweets to pick at Sessions\u2019 liver.\nOnce we were past the midterms, it was plain that Sessions would soon enough be heading home to Mobile.\nWhat mattered more was Trump\u2019s choice to replace him. As we have discussed before, the president would have long ago sacked the much-maligned Alabamian but for the fact that any replacement who could get confirmed by the Senate might be even more disobliging than Sessions.\nThe solution Trump seized upon the minute the pressure of the midterm elections had passed was to pick a loyalist, a former cable news commentator, a sharp critic of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and reportedly an informal adviser to Trump as Sessions\u2019 temporary replacement.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s message was clear: Time\u2019s up,\u00a0Robert Mueller.\nBut in\u00a0Matthew Whitaker, Trump may not have found deliverance but instead complicated matters for himself even more.\nIn the post-Watergate era, the Justice Department has operated under strict rules about professional conduct and with built-in curbs against the kind of executive abuses committed by\u00a0Richard Nixon.\nFor starters, that means that there\u2019s even a question whether Whitaker is eligible for the job. Trump holds that since Whitaker was confirmed 14 years ago to serve as a federal prosecutor in southern Iowa, Whitaker doesn\u2019t need Senate confirmation to lead the Justice Department. But as former Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0pointed out, that\u2019s a pretty thin claim.\u00a0\nSince his appointment, Whitaker\u2019s sudden celebrity has revealed lots of baggage. Aside from his work for a Republican\u00a0attack-dog group, there are his many publicly stated opinions about the Mueller probe both in writing and as a legal commentator for CNN. Then there\u2019s his association with a\u00a0dodgy-sounding firm\u00a0that paid a huge fraud settlement.\u00a0\u00a0\nSenate Republicans are already pushing back privately and\u00a0not so privately. By next week, the pressure will be intense.\u00a0\nThe White House seems to be distancing itself from Whitaker, whom the president today claimed not to know. But Trump seems to be struggling to find a confirmable candidate to take over the agency permanently, especially before the Russia probe is concluded. Labor Secretary\u00a0Alex Acosta\u00a0could be slid into the post without Senate confirmation, but\u00a0is said to\u00a0not want the job.\u00a0\nNow, if Whitaker just squats over at the Justice Department and doesn\u2019t do much but be Trump\u2019s eyes and ears, the acting attorney general can probably persist for a while. But It won\u2019t be long before the position becomes untenable. The Russia probe\u00a0needs tending and other criminal matters related to the president\u00a0are ripening.\u00a0\nIf Whitaker starts making material decisions relating to Trump or takes any provocative actions toward Mueller, all hell will break loose.\nWhite House whisperers say that former New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie\u00a0is the frontrunner to replace Sessions. That confirmation hearing would be a doozy as Trump\u2019s campaign transition chairman was asked to explain his independence and then grilled on his own legal woes in New Jersey. Christie would be no sure thing in the Senate.\nThe universe of potential replacements who would take the job and be confirmed starts to look vanishingly small.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump lessened the fallout from his firing of\u00a0James Comey\u00a0as FBI director by tapping\u00a0Christopher Wray, a well-regarded and highly accomplished former federal prosecutor, as his replacement.\u00a0\nBy choosing Whitaker to replace Sessions, Trump has made his own life more difficult.\u00a0\u00a0THE RULEBOOK: MATH IS FOR NERDS\n\u201cNothing can be more fallacious than to found our political calculations on arithmetical principles.\u201d\u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 55TIME OUT: THE AMAZING RACEThe\u00a0Atlantic:\u00a0\u201cTens of thousands of years ago, two gigantic ice sheets smothered the northernmost parts of what has since been named North America. They towered more than two kilometers high and contained 1.5 times as much water as Antarctica does today. \u2026 But once the ice started to melt, these peoples\u2014the ancestors of the Americas\u2019 Indigenous groups\u2014spread southward into new lands. \u2026 That\u2019s a very rough outline, but a new study from\u00a0J. V\u00edctor Moreno-Mayar\u00a0and his colleagues \u2026\u00a0 showed that whatever happened south of the ice, it happened fast. They sequenced the genomes of 15 ancient humans, who came from sites ranging all the way from Alaska to Patagonia. One person from Spirit Cave in Nevada and five from Lagoa Santa in Brazil were especially instructive. They were all just over 10,000 years old, and though they lived 6,300 miles apart, they were strikingly similar in their DNA. Genetically, they were also closely matched to\u00a0Anzick-1\u2014a famous Clovis infant from Montana, who was about 2,000 years older.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with\u00a0your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\nTrump job performance\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a041 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a052.8 percentNet Score:\u00a0-11.8 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0down .8 points\u00a0[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; CNN: 55% approve - 39% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 46% approve - 52% disapprove; ABC/WaPo: 40% approve \u2013 53% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 40% approve \u2013 50% disapprove.]SCOTT\u2019S LEAD DOWN TO .18 PERCENT AS RECOUNT LOOMSMiami Herald: \u201cThree statewide elections in Florida are all close enough to require machine recounts, and two of them would require hand recounts of ballots, based on the latest results posted by the state Friday. With Broward still counting early and mail ballots, according to the state website, and Palm Beach County still counting mail ballots, Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott\u00a0holds a lead of .18 percent over Sen.\u00a0Bill Nelson, or 15,074 votes. (Broward elections officials said Thursday night that its count of early and mail ballots was complete and that they had \u2018no idea\u2019 why the state website didn\u2019t reflect that.) Republican\u00a0Ron DeSantis\u00a0holds a lead of .44 percent over Democrat\u00a0Andrew Gillum\u00a0in the election for governor, or 36,211 votes. Democrat\u00a0Nikki Fried\u00a0clings to a lead of .04 percent over Republican\u00a0Matt Caldwell\u00a0in the race for the Cabinet post of agriculture commissioner, or 2,915 votes.\u201dScott claims \u2018rampant\u2019 voter fraud -\u00a0Sun-Sentinel: \u201cGov. Rick Scott is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate vote counting in South Florida\u2019s Democratic stronghold counties, questioning whether \u2018rampant fraud\u2019 is happening as his race for U.S. Senate appears headed for a hand recount. Scott held a 15,079 vote advantage over incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as of Thursday night. He has filed lawsuits against Brenda Snipes, Broward County\u2019s supervisor of elections, and Palm Beach County elections chief Susan Bucher. The suits accuse their offices of not complying with the state\u2019s public records laws.\u201dLots of Dem ballots in Broward, but not all with Senate votes -\u00a0Miami Herald: \u201cAs of Thursday evening, 676,706 votes had been counted in Broward in the U.S. Senate race, according to the Broward Supervisor of Elections website, overwhelmingly for Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson over Republican Rick Scott. But nearly every other statewide office garnered more votes in Broward than the Senate race, particularly the contest for governor, with 24,763 more voters \u2014 701,469 in all \u2014 weighing in.\u201dSINEMA TAKES THE LEAD AS ARIZONA COUNT CREEPS FORWARDAZ Central: \u201cSuspense and uncertainty now hang over the supertight U.S. Senate race, which has Democrat\u00a0Kyrsten Sinema\u00a0and Republican candidate\u00a0Martha McSally\u00a0separated by just 9,610 votes, according to updated election results. The results were updated after 5 p.m. Thursday, the first time since election night that the tallies had been substantially updated. Sinema was leading as of 6:20 p.m. She had 932,870 votes, representing 49.10 percent of the total reported votes while McSally had 923,260 votes, or 48.59 percent. Green Party candidate\u00a0Angela Green\u00a0had earned 43,838. It's too soon to know who will ultimately prevail. With tens of thousands of outstanding ballots, the campaign managers for both teams conveyed confidence, with each saying the remaining ballots would favor their candidate.\u201dJudge rejects GOP initial request to limit vote counts -\u00a0Mercury News: \u201cA judge on Thursday rejected Republican demands to immediately limit vote counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race in Arizona and has set a hearing on the challenge affecting about 5,600 votes in the state\u2019s most populous county. Judge\u00a0Margaret R. Mahoney\u00a0said it was too soon to require Maricopa and other counties to stop contacting voters to verify signatures on mail ballots. She also declined to order the counties to temporarily separate mail ballots that have been verified by that process after Election Day.

If I\u2019m not mistaken, you need 2/3 of the senate to vote for impeachment, correct? So the best they could do is what they did to Clinton with an impeachment in the House. And what good would that really do for them? In fact the more I talk about it the more I\u2019m for it. See how voters react if they try take a shot at our President and leave him standing. Similar to the way the attacks on Kavanaugh backfired, I would expect the same to happen. It may be smart for their own party to stick to good old fashioned legislating and leave the dirty politics by the bedside where it belongs.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Leda Houser, Thomaston, Ga.[Ed. note: Or, just skywriting here, what if we had a real Congress that did its job and provided appropriate oversight of the executive branch without blatantly making a partisan cudgel of it. There are a lot of reasons Americans are disappointed in Congress, but one reason our lawmakers so richly deserve the opprobrium is that they have lost their abilities as fair fact finders. Their hearings are bad jokes in which lawmakers make speeches hoping to get on television rather than get to the bottom of the questions at hand. I\u2019m sure there will be lots of investigating going on in the next Congress. I highly doubt that much of it will be useful.]\n\u201cPeople can be as negative as they want but I feel great about America in 2018. I know people are divided, but it warms my heart to see so many people caring about our political process like they did this past Tuesday. Young, old, black, white, man, woman, the turnout numbers show Americans are engaged and care about the direction of their country, and that is a blessing whether anyone wants to admit it or not! It is too easy to be negative about the results of the elections instead of sitting back and viewing the beauty as a whole from afar.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Terry Mulleson, Virginia Beach, Va.[Ed. note:\u00a0There are so many hot takes out there today that you need to wear a welder\u2019s mask just to scroll through Twitter. Most of the post-election arguments fall into one of two categories: 1) \u201cThe people I agree with won and that is proof that we should do even more of what I like\u201d and 2) \u201cThe people I agree with lost and that is proof that we didn\u2019t do enough of what I like.\u201d Are you a moderate Democrat? Missouri and Indiana Senate results easily confirm your view that your party has gotten out of whack. Are you a liberal Democrat? Proof that squishes lose. Are you a populist Republican? The same races are proof of your view of the power of MAGA? And so on. Elections, unless they are the kind of presidential landslide not seen in our country in 30 years, are tricky to interpret. Republicans believed that 2010 was a repudiation of\u00a0Barack Obama\u2026 who went on to win handily two years later. Democrats thought the 2012 election was confirmation of a fundamental shift in American politics\u2026 until Republicans took back the Senate two years later. There\u2019s no doubt that Democrats had a very good midterm election \u2013 their best one in the House since 1974 when the Watergate scandal dominated the discussion. What that really means, however, remains to be seen and will very much be determined by the events of the next two years. One thing we do know is that more than 114 million Americans exercised their franchise, at least 31 million more than four years before. Now, I happen to think that it\u2019s fine for folks to not vote (as long as they don\u2019t complain about the government), but I also tend to think that civic apathy is deadly to a republic.

(Associated Press) An employee of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agreed to resign this week after admitting she posted more than 100 social media messages during work hours or on agency property in 2016, urging people to vote for Hillary Clinton. The disclosure came in a news release from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). The agreement between the employee and the OSC includes a five-year ban from working in the federal government, the statement said. The posts were considered a violation of the federal Hatch Act, which prohibits most government employees from engaging in most political activities while on duty, the release said. The woman continued the behavior despite being approached by ethics watchdogs, the OSC said. \u201cWhen a federal employee emphatically and repeatedly engages in political activity while on duty or in the workplace, OSC takes that very seriously,\u201d Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner said. \u201cThis employee thumbed her nose at the law and engaged in vocal partisan politics both with her colleagues and on social media. \u201cThis employee thumbed her nose at the law and engaged in vocal partisan politics both with her colleagues and on social media.\" \u201cConsidering her knowledge of the Hatch Act and continuing disregard for the law, this employee\u2019s resignation and debarment from federal service are proportionate disciplinary actions. This case serves as an important reminder that federal employees must be mindful of the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibitions, especially given the upcoming midterm elections.\u201d Most federal employees are allowed to engage in political activities during their personal time.",

            "article_content": "Incumbent Rep. Martha Roby, a critic of Trump during the 2016 presidential election, facing former Democrat Bobby Bright; Jonathan Serrie reports on the hot race in the red state. In her bid for a fifth term in Congress, Alabama Republican Martha Roby faces a tough battle within her own party \u2014 a GOP primary runoff against Bobby Bright, the former Democratic representative she defeated back in 2010, now running as a Republican. \u201cOur voters are motivated, much more so than our opponent\u2019s, mainly because our people want a change and they want it now,\u201d Bright told Fox News during a campaign stop in Rutledge, Ala. \u201cHer supporters are soft because they feel like she has been compromised.\u201d Roby\u2019s troubles stem from\u00a0her decision to withdraw support from Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign after the release of an old Access Hollywood tape in which Trump talks about groping women. Whoever wins the July 17 runoff will face Democrat Tabitha Isner in the November general election. \u201cThe campaign is long over,\u201d Roby told Fox News while\u00a0campaigning recently in Enterprise, Ala. \u201cWe have been governing and the president, Donald Trump, is just that. He\u2019s president of the United States. Of course I want him to be successful, because when he\u2019s successful, we\u2019re all successful. And we have a shared conservative agenda.\u201d President Trump has endorsed the incumbent, describing Roby in a tweet as \u201ca consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again agenda.\u201d The president\u2019s endorsement appears to have encouraged some voters to forgive her for criticizing a highly popular figure in this red state. Republican Congresswoman Martha Roby\u2019s troubles stem from her decision to withdraw support from Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign after the release of an old Access Hollywood tape in which Trump talks about groping women. ALABAMA'S BRIGHT ROBY FACE RUNOFF ELECTION: A LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES \u201cIf he believes that she\u2019s supporting his agenda, then that goes a long way with me,\u201d said Lanny Shepard, a voter in Roby\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. But Alabama voters are fiercely independent. Trump\u2019s previous endorsements in this state failed to save former Sen. Luther Strange\u2019s reelection bid in a special GOP primary last year. And despite Trump\u2019s endorsement of Roy Moore in the general election, Alabama voters elected a Democrat, Doug Jones, to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Bobby Bright is a former Democratic representative who Congresswoman Martha Roby defeated back in 2010. He is now running as a Republican. \u201cI can support the president and I can support Bobby Bright,\u201d said Brooks Hayes, another 2nd District voter. \u201cI can support the two of them \u2014 separately.\u201d In addition to the president\u2019s endorsement, Roby, as an incumbent, enjoys strong financial backing from Washington. But failing to win last month\u2019s Republican primary outright is a liability for the congresswoman. \u201cIf you\u2019re an incumbent and you outspend your opposition three-to-one and you only get 38 percent of the vote, you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Steve Flowers, an Alabama-based political columnist. \u201cShe\u2019s in trouble right now. If she does win, it won\u2019t be by a landslide. It\u2019ll be because Trump endorsed her and got her out of the doghouse and the National Chamber of Commerce and every political PAC in Washington loaded her up with money.\u201d According to the latest campaign finance filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Roby has raised nearly $2.2 million in her re-election bid. Bright has raised $406,000, including $309,000 of his own money he loaned his campaign. Both candidates bill themselves as conservative \u2014 pro-gun, anti-abortion, supportive of the military and farmers. So, for Republican voters in this red district, the choice may come down to what they view as the greater sin \u2014 being a former Democrat or a former critic of President Trump.

            "article_content": "Don Blankenship is running on an anti-establishment platform in a bid for Sen. Joe Manchin's, D-W.Va., seat. (AP) The West Virginia Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a last-ditch bid by former coal CEO Don Blankenship to get his name on the ballot in November's U.S. Senate race. Blankenship, who finished third in May's Republican Senate primary, had applied to appear on the ballot as a third-party candidate. West Virginia's secretary of state had blocked Blankenship's bid due to the state's \"sore loser\" law, which prohibits defeated major-party candidates from switching to a minor party. The case was heard by a court in upheaval. One of the judges who heard Blankenship's case was filling in for a suspended justice, while two others sat in for justices who retired after lawmakers voted to impeach them. Blankenship had argued that the sore loser law was applied to him retroactively. He said lawmakers clarified the law earlier this year and it didn't become effective until June, after he had begun the process of running as a candidate for the Constitution Party. The secretary of state's office said Blankenship didn't file a certificate of candidacy until late July. The Senate race pits incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin against Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Libertarian candidate Rusty Hollen is also on the ballot. In a statement, Blankenship called the decision \"frightening.\" \"Essentially, the Republican Party can now slander a candidate throughout the Primary, effectively denying that candidate an equal opportunity to win the nomination, and simultaneously pass a law in the middle of an election cycle which prohibits the slandered person from being on the General election ballot,\" said Blankenship, who added that he and his attorneys were \"evaluating our next steps.\" In his reaction statement, Morrisey focused on his Democratic opponent, saying: \"No more distractions to hide lying liberal Joe Manchin\u2019s record of supporting pro-abortion policies, gun control, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign against coal miners.\" Manchin's campaign had no immediate comment. Sen. Joe Manchin is seeking a second full term this November. (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Earlier this month, the\u00a0Gazette-Mail newspaper reported\u00a0that the West Virginia Secretary of State's Office had processed approximately 4,000 signatures on a petition to let Blankenship on the ballot. Of those, the paper found that 45 percent were Democrats, 24 percent were Republicans and 27 percent were unaffiliated or from minor parties. At the time, West Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Belinda Biafore denied directing any support toward Blankenship. \"Anyone who understands what our party is all about understands that we would never ask anyone to support Don Blankenship to have his name appear on the ballot in the general election,\" she said through a spokesman. Blankenship said that most of the signatures were gathered in Democratic areas of the state and show support of a U.S. citizen's right to run for office, not necessarily him as a candidate. In all, Blankenship's campaign submitted 11,468 signatures. On Aug. 11,\u00a0the Gazette-Mail reported\u00a0that some signatories claimed that they had been falsely told the petition was to keep Blankenship off the ballot, not to let him on the ballot. Blankenship is the former CEO of Massey Energy, which owned a mine where a 2010 explosion killed 29 workers. He spent a year in federal prison for safety violations related to the explosion.

Susan Collins.\n\"The point is, I'm the type of guy that can work across the aisle and get things done rather than just go fight and play games,\u201d Golden said.\nDemocrats have sought to use Poliquin\u2019s investment business background against him, but during a visit to the ND paper mill in Rumford, Poliquin touted the resurgence of this once robust industry, arguing his experience is an asset.\n\"My career is not in politics. For 35 years, only in small businesses, so I know how to run the economy,\u201d said Poliquin. \u201cI know how to participate in a real-world economy, grow jobs and that's why I've been so focused on trade and regulations and taxes, what have you.\"\nFox Power Ranking declare the race a tossup and the ad war here has proven to be both expansive and expensive, with millions of dollars worth of outside money pouring in to fill the airwaves.\n\"The size of the district is also important as well because the district is a huge geographic space,\u201d said Michael Franz, professor of government and legal studies at Bowdoin College. \u201cYou have to advertise. You can't do all retail politics like you can in an urban district.\"\nThere are also two independent candidates in the race who could muddy the political waters. \u00a0Maine is using ranked-choice voting in this election.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Allegations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the first Muslim elected to Congress, continued to rock the race for attorney general in Minnesota as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday. Key primary races were also underway in Connecticut, where Republicans hope to snatch yet another governorship in deep-blue New England, as well as Vermont and Wisconsin. The contests, which include House, Senate, and gubernatorial primaries, are a major test of President Trump's influence in the Midwest ahead of the November midterm elections, as several candidates fight to present themselves as the most pro-Trump choices. But the abuse allegation against Ellison, who has vowed to fight President Trump's agenda by seeking to restore ObamaCare and net neutrality regulations, loomed especially large nationally. Critics accused party leaders of staying mum on the situation for political reasons. State attorney general positions like the one Ellison is seeking are increasingly influential nationwide, as state governments escalate their legal assaults on the Trump administration over a variety of policy matters. Ellison has long been a leader in the Democratic Party. The divorced 54-year-old\u00a0is a six-term congressman who became deputy chairman of the DNC last year after falling just short of the top job. He was among candidates rushing to file for Minnesota's attorney general office after incumbent Lori Swanson made a late decision to run for governor. But his efforts to secure the Democratic nomination for Minnesota attorney general were upended this weekend, when the son of Ellison's former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, posted on Facebook that he had seen angry text messages from Ellison to his mother and a video that showed him dragging Monahan off a bed. Ellison denied\u00a0any abuse or threatening messages and said the supposed video \"does not exist because I have never behaved in this way.\" Late Tuesday, just hours before polls closed in Minnesota, the DNC issued its first reaction to the allegations. \"These allegations recently came to light and we are reviewing them,\" the DNC told NPR. \"All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously.\" Meanwhile, former DNC communications director Luis Miranda told NPR: \"The party has no choice but to suspend him at a minimum until they figure out what's going on. Frankly, it would be malpractice not to. We've made it clear we're going to take these accusations seriously.\" The DNC's delayed response to the episode had prompted backlash from top conservatives over the weekend. \"It\u2019s great to be the DNC,\" wrote former George W. Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer on Twitter Monday. \"If Ellison were a Republican, the press would have knocked over the doors of the RNC demanding a statement. But the DNC\u2019s co-chairman? No comment from the DNC. No feeding frenzy from the press.\" KEITH ELLISON, UNDER FIRE FOR FARRAKHAN TIES, CLAIMS HE HASN'T SEEN THE RACIST LEADER SINCE 2013 Former Trump press sectretary Sean Spicer agreed, saying: \"Not only is the DNC silent, the media has failed to cover it:\u00a0\u00a0 DNC Silent As Deputy Chair Ellison Battles Domestic Abuse Allegations.\" On Tuesday, Spicer added, \"So the Sierra Club has issued a statement about the allegations against the Deputy DNC chairman......but the DNC still has not ....and most major 'news' outlets don\u2019t seem to have an issue with that.\" With a huge fundraising advantage and star power over his opponents \u2014 including a visit from 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 Ellison was considered the heavy favorite before the Monahan allegation surfaced. SANDERS ENDORSEMENT THE KISS OF DEATH? SOCIALIST TORCHBEARERS FLAME OUT AFTER HIS RALLIES Monahan, a Minneapolis political organizer, said via Twitter that her son's posting was \"true.\" But she later told Minnesota Public Radio News that she would not release the video because it is \"humiliating.\" Also running in the Democratic primary were state Rep. Debra Hilstrom, former Department of Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman, former Ramsey County Attorney Tom Foley and attorney Matt Pelikan. Governor's races in Connecticut, Vermont, Minnesota, and Wisconsin Connecticut is ground-zero for Republican efforts Tuesday to continue their gains in deeply progressive New England. Republicans hold the governorships of four out of six states in the region, including Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire -- which the GOP attributes to its candidates' fiscal conservatism, moderate social policies, and Democrats' financial mismanagement. Even though Connecticut voted for Hillary Clinton by double-digits in 2016, the state's governor, Dan Malloy, is deeply unpopular, oweing to high taxes and an ongoing budget crisis. Malloy declined to seek a third term. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, former First Selectman Tim Herbst, businessman Steve Obsitnik, former investment banker Bob Stefanowski and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman are the Republicans looking to succeed him. They have disagreed on key issues, such as whether to eliminate the state's income tax. In Vermont,\u00a0Republican Gov. Phil Scott is favored to win re-election, despite drawing the ire of conservative critics by signing the state's first major gun control law earlier this year. No sitting governor has been defeated in Vermont since 1962. WATCH: PROTESTERS HECKLE 'TRAITOR' VERMONT GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING ANTI-GUN LAW Two Democrats are vying to make history in the state on Tuesday, despite long odds.\u00a0Christine Hallquist\u00a0is vying to be the first openly transgender woman to serve as a U.S. governor. A former CEO of the Vermont Electric Cooperative, Hallquist is focused on tackling climate change and implementing universal health care in the Green Mountain State. And a 14-year old boy,\u00a0Ethan Sonneborn, has also thrown his hat into the ring, taking advantage of the state constitution's lack of an age requirement to seek the governorship. Meanwhile, in Minnesota,\u00a0Tim Pawlenty -- who briefly ran for president in 2012 -- is hoping to stage a political comeback and become Minnesota\u2019s governor again, in a race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton that Fox News considers a tossup. Pawlenty has said he voted for Trump, but later called the president \"unhinged and unfit\" -- which may alienate conservatives in the state. During the campaign, Pawlenty and Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson have spent much of their time in the campaign fighting over who previously insulted the president the least. Both men criticized Trump during the 2016 campaign, with Johnson calling the president a \"jackass\" and Pawlenty pulling his support after the \"Access Hollywood tape\" of Trump bragging he could grope women because he was famous. Now, they both say they voted for Trump in the end and would welcome the president's support. Trump has not endorsed either candidate. Pawlenty is seeking the nomination against several other Republicans, including Jeff Johnson, who was the party\u2019s 2014 gubernatorial nominee.\u00a0On the Democrats\u2019 side are: state Rep. Erin Murphy, Minnesota Attorney Gen. Lori Swanson and U.S. Rep. Tim Walz. Tim Pawlenty has previously called Trump 'unfit,' but changed his tune as he seeks the party's nomination for governor. (AP) Finally, in Wisconsin, Democrats are making yet another effort to unseat Republican Scott Walker, a well-known union buster who is seeking a third term. A bevy of Democrats with some high-profile endorsements are competing for the right to take him on in November. House and Senate races A series of House and Senate races are also underway Tuesday. Broadly, Republicans are looking to make gains by winning some House seats in Minnesota, while Democrats are targeting House races in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Perhaps the most notable races are in Wisconsin, where Democrats are fiercely competing for the nomination to succeed outgoing Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced his resignation earlier this year. Teacher Cathy Myers and union leader Randy Bryce are locked in a battle for the Democratic nomination; Ryan-backed businessman\u00a0Bryan Steil is leading the GOP pack. Also in Wisconsin, Republicans Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are seeking to oust\u00a0Sen. Tammy Baldwin in November. The seat is considered essential for Democrats if they want to hold the Senate, and in a sign of the race's importance, more than $35M has been spent in the race. The state party is backing Vukmir, an ally of Gov. Scott Walker. But her critique of Trump as \"offensive to everyone\" during the 2016 primaries has provided an opening for Nicholson, a Marine veteran and former Democrat who spoke on behalf of Vice President Al Gore at the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham everybody. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" tonight from Washington. What's really behind the left's total rage over Kanye West? In moments my angle, we'll reveal what they are really frightened of. And the leftist mob mentality is moving from the halls of Congress and public restaurants to college campuses and even parking lots now.\u00a0\nAhead, we'll talk to two victims of the new mob mentality including the friend of Susan Rice's Republican son who was assaulted just days ago --her son, not the friend -- at a pro-Kavanaugh rally.\u00a0\nPlus, did a pair of Senate candidates just have their own basket of deplorable's moments? Sean Spicer and Ari Fleischer are here to break it all down. It could spell trouble for Democrats in two key Senate races. But first, the liberals freak out as Trump reaches out. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\"\u00a0\nIt was an amazing moment in the Oval Office today when pop culture icon, rapper extraordinaire Kanye West met with President Trump before the cameras. He unleashed a 10-minute monologue where he tried to explain his love of all things MAGA.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\u00a0\nKANYE WEST, RAPPER: You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. You know they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends. But this hat, it gives me power in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like superman.\u00a0\nLike what I need Saturday Night Live to improve on or what I need the liberals to improve on, if he don't look good, we don't look good. This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest --\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Sometimes unlikely figures emerge in American history to play important roles, eliminating at times important truths. And today, Kanye West in his own eccentric way, exposing tolerance of the left. They are denunciations of his White House appearance were immediate and withering.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nAPRIL RYAN, CNN: When it comes to issues of Kanye West bringing black people to President Trump, that's a misnomer.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He certainly doesn't speak to the diversity or to the broad experiences of 40 million black people.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a reality TV show we were watching.\u00a0\nSTEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC: That was an assault on our White House.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: An assault on our White House? Well Kanye did use some coarse language that he shouldn't have used, but in other settings, liberals would have called that authentic. He was being his true self, speaking his own truth. But if you want to talk about assaults or improprieties in the White House, how about this? Or this?\u00a0\nKanye West is hardly a political philosopher, and I've always believed that entertainers should first entertain and keep their politics separate from their art. But I cannot remember any artist on the left who was treated with the same vitriol and hatred as Kanye West has been subjected to since he announced his support for the president.\u00a0\nWhen Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus were headlining Hillary Clinton rallies, running through dorms to register voters, I don't remember anyone at MSNBC or CNN criticizing them for lacking policy experiences. What about when Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the probing policy maven, Mary J. Blige.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMARY J. BLIGE, SINGER (SINGING): It ain't no secret, no secret my friend, you can get killed just for living in your American skin.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: It's like an old coffee commercial from the 70's. And remember Obama was the biggest celebrity hound of them all. I mean, he's relationship was mutual with the celebrities. He was kind of a celebrity and they loved him as vice versa. Here is Barack and Michelle serenading Usher in the White House, but no impropriety or assault on the White House then.\u00a0\nAnd how about Beyonce and Jay-Z? They were in and out of the Obama White House more frequently than the Secret Service. That was all perfectly acceptable. No policy concerns then. But when it was announced two days back that Kanye would be holding a meeting with Trump at the White House, all hell broke loose.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN HOST: So Kanye is going to let the president use him again.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is the token negro of the Trump administration.\u00a0\nLEMON: Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, OK.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIPS)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Kanye is being subjected to the attacks that awake any black conservative who dares to break ranks with the Democratic monolith. Liberals kind of treat these entertainers like pawns who are not allowed to deviate from the leftist group think at all. God protect any Hispanic, gay or black who breaks ranks and goes their own way politically.\u00a0\nRemember the scorn that singer Harry Belafonte, the civil rights activist Harry Belafonte heaped on Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell for working for George Bush?\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHARRY BELAFONTE, SINGER: Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell served Bush because they believe as he does. They embrace his ideology. They embrace his imperial appetite. They are lackeys and tools of that. And my reference to them as the failed house slave, meant that they were not the masters of their own destiny, although they had the choice to be and didn't.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: House slaves, that was really nice. More than 30 years ago, a prominent figure in the Reagan administration argued that black should cast off liberalism for conservative solutions, and summed up how the GOP had lost so much ground saying, \"Democrats smugly assume blacks are monolithic and will by force of circumstances always huddle to the left of the political spectrum. The political right watches this herd mentality and action, concedes that blacks are monolithic, picks up a few dissidents and wistfully shrugs at the seemingly unbreakable hold of the liberal left on black Americans.\"\u00a0\nThat official's name was Clarence Thomas, then chair of the Equal Opportunity Commission. Individuals such as the brilliant conservative economist Tom Soul were courageous because as Thomas noted, \"they refused to give into the cult mentality and childless obedience that hypnotized black Americans into mindless political trance. This is Justice Thomas in 2007.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTHOMAS CLARENCE, U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: We are here not to be proselytized but to think for ourselves. And at bottom, isn't that why we - - one of the reasons we love our free society, that we get to think for ourselves and make our decisions based on certain principles, and to make it possible for others to do the same?\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Absolutely. Now, I'm not going to say that rapper Kanye West is Tom Soul or Clarence Thomas, of course he is not. But I will say that unless he is doing a giant punking of America, he has guts and gusto. Just because he dares to think for himself, think differently, and he is outspoken over-the-top manner.\u00a0\nHe is pilloried by the politically correct performers in politics and journalism and of course in the entertainment industry. He represents a danger to the left because of his huge cultural influence. And moments like this, they are absolutely intolerable and frightening to liberals.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWEST: I guess you know I love you.\u00a0\nTRUMP: I know.\u00a0\nWEST: Did I ever --\u00a0\nTRUMP: But I don't want to put you in that spot.\u00a0\nWEST: No, I'm standing in that spot. I love this guy right here. Let me give this guy a hug right here. I love this guy right here.\u00a0\nTRUMP: That's really nice. Come here.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Could it be that the Trump-West show was an indication that the old Democrats monopoly on black voters is in jeopardy. There is more reasons for the liberals to be concerned. The President support among African-Americans has nearly doubled as of last year. In the latest Rasmussen Poll, President Trump now has a 36 approval rating among African- Americans.\u00a0\nSome attributed the rise to the support from Kanye West and of course a historic low unemployment rate in the black community. Whatever the cause, whatever the reason, the shifting support among African-Americans is very, very significant. Democrats cannot win a national election without their huge swath of black voters, and perhaps Kanye is giving them a reason to look elsewhere for political answers.\u00a0\nSo next time you hear liberal pundits writing him off as a crazy, slave denying lunatic, remember, it's all about the numbers. They have to smear West for fear that black Americans will follow him into the arms of President Donald Trump. And what are the Democrats going to do then? And that's \"The Angle.\"\u00a0\nJoining me now, is Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21 former counsel to then House majority leader Dick Armey. Preston Mitchum is the division chair for the Washington Bar Association, young lawyers division and Charlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA, now author of the book, \"Campus Battlefield.\" He met with Kanye for hours earlier today.\u00a0\nGreat to have you all on tonight. It was a very interesting day in Washington for a lot of reasons, and Preston, I want to start with you. You listened to THE ANGLE. Do you think that any of this overwrought reaction to Kanye West is because the left is worried that if this -- let's say it's even 20 percent support for Trump. That's cataclysmically bad news for Democrats.\u00a0\nPRESTON MITCHUM, DIVISION CHAIR, WASHINGTON BAR ASSOCIATION: It absolutely would be bad news if they were accurate. One thing that I certainly won't come on here and pretend as though Kanye West is anyone's saving grace, not for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. Kanye West acted as a child today. He ranted and raved all in the Oval Office, banging his hand as a child would when they are throwing a temper tantrum.\u00a0\nYou have to almost read hieroglyphics to even understand what he was saying, and I'm actually proud of anyone who knows the Morse code enough to know what Kanye was saying. He grandstanded the entire time and he pontificated on nothingness. As a Democrat I'm certainly not worried about any African-American approval ratings for Trump. No -- they will still receive a low, excuse me, President Trump will still receive a low amount of African-American supporters. Trust that.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I want to get to Charlie in a moment because you actually spent a lot of time with Kanye today. Horace, I'm wondering what the reaction would be if a white person said that he or she couldn't understand what Kanye West had said today in the Oval Office. If I said that, I can't even imagine, you know, the people that would come after me. I think people disagree with him if they think black people shouldn't like Trump.\u00a0\nBut he said some actually interesting things and all. He was like all over the place, but he's not a political person. He's not, you know, no more than Miley Cyrus bumping and grinding or doing the twerk on whatever it was at the Grammy's. She looked like a complete moron, but she's out there banging doors for Hillary.\u00a0\nHillary is the person for you, let me give you the five reasons why. No one talked about Miley, but this is a real problem for liberals. Why isn't Miley Cyrus and Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and all the other people that showed up, over all the years, never heard about policy considerations then.\u00a0\nHORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Celebrity after celebrity has always come out and supported the left and we all were supposed to rejoice. We were honored to have them show up and make their presentation. No one asked them, so wait a second, you don't have your data right. You aren't actually keeping up with what's going on.\u00a0\nThese points you are making are inaccurate. No one says any of those things. We sit back and we clap. When someone like Kanye West says what he says, what he really is doing is saying to black people, look around, think for yourself. You can, it's OK. And that is what is the most dangerous of all.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Charlie, I'm going to play something from the Oval Office that we didn't play earlier. Kanye on liberal racism and get your reaction.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWEST: One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do, the liberals will try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. So when I said I like Trump, to like someone that's liberal, they'll say, Oh, but he's racist. You think racism could control me?\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Look, I had the opportunity to spend the afternoon with them after this meeting and first of all I think it's unbelievably insulting to say that you couldn't understand what he was saying. You know what he was saying\u00a0\nMITCHUM: I don't.\u00a0\nKIRLK: He was saying -- you don't? You don't know what he's saying? I'm defecting from the monolith -- I let you finish, let me finish. He said I'm defecting from the monolith and you have permission to do the same. It took courage for him to do that because his whole life is about selling albums. His whole life is about popularity and so many people in Hollywood and so many people in the music industry are afraid to do what he did.\u00a0\nAnd you know what, you should be quite afraid because even if that Rasmussen poll is half correct, if Donald Trump's approval rating is 18, 19 or 20 percent, the Democrat Party is done. And Kanye West, he's not even saying vote Democrat, vote Republican. He's saying think free, think for yourself, think independent and if you look objectively at what the Democrat Party has done to our inner cities, our urban communities and the black community over the last 60 years, it ravished these communities.\u00a0\nHigh murder rates, crime everywhere. You saw in Chicago, you did a wonderful special there, there has not been a Republican mayor of Chicago since 1931. And yet the black community votes for Democrats at a 95 percent clip. I applaud Kanye West for his courage, for standing up, it is not easy to do what he did.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I got to say I'm not wild about the celebrities in politics and I wrote a book called, \"Shut Up & Sing.\" I jokingly said, Lebron James, shut up and dribble. It was a joke, but it's not what the book called, \"Shut Up & Sing.\" Everyone got all upset. You can't tell Kanye to -- guys, everybody has an opinion, yet the moment you prick someone else they are screaming, I'm a victim.\u00a0\nNo one is a victim. If you want to go out there and take shots at President Trump, calling this and that or the other name, then don't be expecting someone isn't going to come back in your face. So this guy comes out and he says, I like Trump and it's not -- I disagree with you, this is why you should think differently about Donald Trump. He's not good for black -- make that argument.\u00a0\nBut to say he's psychologically inept, he is a mental case, he's dumb, and the word negro used by two black people on set, I mean again, it's a conservative host of any color said anything like that, they'd be gone. They'd be fired. I don't like calling for people to be fired, that's not my thing but the double standard is to me, Preston, is just not good.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: A couple of things, Laura, So one, they should be gone if they were using that word negro, right. But we can have an issue on this country where for some reason many white Americans believe they can use the same exact language against black people that black people can use against black people and it's just not true and it's never been the case. I know that's going to be hard for many people to accept --\u00a0\nCOOPER: Including me. I reject that.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: You can reject that or you would. It doesn't make it accurate. It doesn't make it accurate. It is absolutely --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: -- explain what it means because I'm confused.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: Yes. So, with your statement you said if a white person will essentially make a call for Kanye West calling him a negro they would be called for a firing, they shouldn't be called for a firing. They have have no right to use that language. The language and the ownership and accountability lies as black people to use that particular language. I'm still talking. And on top of the fact that it seems very interesting to me that were something should like make Kanye some savior, some deity --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I'm not -- I didn't say that in my monologue.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: OK, OK, OK. You didn't verbatim say that, just my interpretation. It seems very accurate because in early 2000, conservatives were not out here proud that Kanye West say that George Bush was not for black people.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: No, and I made that point the other night.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: Yes. So we are being very hypocritical in this room if we are going to sit here and pretend as though Kanye West is now a saving grace for the Republican Party.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMITCHUM: -- were disparaging him for making some of the accusations before\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You are right, that I was doing my shut up and sing moment and this is why I said the reason I'm looking at this issue today is because I think people are desperate for solutions.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All people -- it doesn't matter whether you are gay or straight, black or white, people are looking for solutions to heal this country and bring this country forward. And Charlie, you spent a lot of time with him today, I don't know Kanye West. I don't what kind of person he is. I like to judge people on who they are. Preston, we can all probably hang out, have a drink, laugh and have fun, but I don't know what he is like. What is he trying to do here with Trump?\u00a0\nKIRK: Look, first of all, he loves this country and he sees a lot of himself in Donald Trump Someone who has defied the odds, everyone said Kanye West, you can't make your own record album, you can never succeed. He's defied the odds. But instead you did not attack his ideas. You attacked him personally\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nKIRK: First and foremost resort at saying that I have to understand Egyptian hieroglyphics to understand what he was saying. What he said today had more wisdom that anything Barrack Obama said in eight years. He said liberals what blacks to vote Democrats because they want them for political power. Homerun --\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nKIRK: He did unbelievably intellectually, I would say grounded critique in his own way against the welfare state. He also said we had the right to bear arms.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right, Horace.\u00a0\nCOOPER: It's not about Republicans or Democrats. It is seriously about whether people can think freely and it's also about are we going to be individuals. What you just said denies that we're individuals when you claim that black people can use offensive language against other black people, but white is when you said that if a white person said they should be fired. That's offensive.\u00a0\nKIRK: If the liberals can have double standards, you have no double standards at all.\nCOOPER: Well, that's been the case.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: So, it's not about Republicans and Democrats.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, one thing I want to get at little bit, and I like to keep you guys for the whole hour because this is so late. Each one of you has an interesting point of view. In the Obama years we had Snoop Dogg, he's hanging out in the White House. You know, he likes to smoke his pot and all that, and he's laughing about it. You know, he's not really presidential, you know, Clinton handle Monica in the side office of the Oval Office.\u00a0\nWas that presidential? Had Jay-Z and Beyonce mugging in the Situation Room -- we couldn't use that photo because it's licensed. Too expensive. Everyone has a celebrity in and out. Trump has one, pretty much only one or two celebrities.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nBut he can't even have like one celebrity, one African-American celebrity, and that guy had to be destroyed. I just think, what is the big deal if Kanye West is there? Why are liberal so worried about it?\u00a0\nKIRK: Because he's a threat. Because he's an A-list artist that's also married to an entire family with huge cultural cloud. He's a threat to the Democrat monolith. That's why you see Don Lemon trying to discredit him.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: He made a hit -- Kanye made a hit at the Kardashians like (inaudible), nicely gesture, kind of, we're going to have a lot of male influence in that (inaudible) OK. I'm not going near that. Final thought, real quick.\u00a0\nMITCHUM: If we look at the Republican Party, and it's funny that we say Democrats are a monolith because we can certainly see who is the real monolith here and we're looking at the room right now.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right. Well, it's good to have you all on. You guys, I want to have you on for the whole hour but they are telling me I can't do that. For more insight into the mind of President Trump and conservative populism that drove him to office, make sure to pick up a copy of my new book, it's in paperback, \"Busting the Barricades: What I Saw at the Populace Revolution.\"\u00a0\nIt's in bookstores everywhere and you will love it. And next, the media may be losing their mind over this Kanye West meeting with President Trump, but what about the political ramifications inside from some folks and Kanye's hometown of Chicago? Coming up.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: As I noted in \"The Angle,\" the media are freaking out over Kanye West meeting with President Trump's. But we're more curious about whether this translates into actual votes. Here to debate, Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell and Juan Williams, whose new book, \"What The Hell Do You Have To Lose?\" is out now. Fantastic.\u00a0\nGianno, like Kanye, you are a Chicago native. So what are people saying in Chicago about all this tonight? I mean we did that -- our town hall last month and had a lot of fun and really emotional time in Chicago. I understand you were able to catch up to some of our friends and some of the more difficult areas of south and west side.\u00a0\nGIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Absolutely. There were surprisingly for -- I'm sure the mainstream, a lot of people that agree with what Kanye had to say and you had some things in which you highlighted and you talked about stop and frisk a one issue that a lot of Chicagoans care about they are against stop and frisk. I'm sure there is no surprise.\u00a0\nBut certainly this prison reform issue is another big issue. But what I have to say, Laura, is when I read publications today, when I saw what was on social media, even on my own Instagram page @giannocaldwell for those who want to follow, I was distressed, I was upset, especially by my friends over at CNN who used the word token negro.\u00a0\nI mean, friends of mine who are black conservatives, who get this kind of rhetoric thrown at us on a day-to-day basis, you are going to attack someone who, my belief is, whose heart is pure and who want to see the people of Chicago helped and the people across this nation helped? You use that kind of language? I was just disturbed by it all. I got to be honest with you, Laura. It was very disturbing.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Juan, the reaction from the media and some members of the entertainment industry, but mostly the media folks in D.C. and New York was pretty unhinged. I mean, we had people using the negro word and another thing, and then Nia-Malika Henderson, is a political reporter at CNN and she came on right after pretty much this all wrapped up and she said the following -- well, she said, OK, I'll read it to you.\u00a0\nShe said, \"It also speaks to the lack of seriousness that the president looks at African-American issues. It was supposed to be about criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, with that you would think you'd want policy experts,\" she said. \"People who know about these issues instead, we've got Jim Brown who was basically silent and on display and then Kanye West who isn't an expert in any of these things.\"\u00a0\nMy question to Juan is, you know, who is an expert among any of the celebrities that were in and out of the White House during the Obama years?\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think there's a whole different context to Obama's relationship to not only the black community but to racial issues in the country as a first black president, and there were pluses and minuses to be debated, but it's nowhere near the low of Donald Trump in terms of not only the rhetoric he uses, but the substance of his policies with regard to black America.\u00a0\nYou mentioned -- Gianno mentioned criminal justice reform. Remember, they were Republicans working on reducing sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and the like before Trump and Jeff Sessions got in office. All that now, gone. Voter suppression issues loom large as we approach the midterms, healthcare, education.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: How about unemployment?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes, again, unemployment.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: How about African-American unemployment.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: This is one of my favorites because what happens is anytime people say hey, you know what, race relations are worse and in the latest Fox poll, half of Americans think Trump is racist. And Trump said, her, what about the low unemployment rate? Lowest in history.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Juan, were racial relations great during Obama when we had Baltimore on fire -\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: It's not up to me or you Laura.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: -- when we had Ferguson on fire.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Laura, it's not up to me or you. I'm just telling you --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I mean, we had major American cities in flames during Obama, and you were like Obama was a great unifier. Then why did you have Ferguson in flames or why did you have entire buildings on fire --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That's true.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: -- police cars set on fire, violence in Baltimore? And you had people in most polls saying the country was divided. The country has been racially hot for some time.\u00a0\nCALDWELL: It's been divided for a while.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes, but I'm telling you, I don't think there's any doubt about the fact that the country, according to the polls, thinks that we have worst race relations now, that they disapprove of the president's handling of race far higher than Obama's.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right. I know what Obama did for Chicago.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: And I said to you, pass the country including 11 percent of Republicans thinks the guy is a racist.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: What did he do? What did he do for Chicago? Juan, you can't answer the question, this is what drives me crazy.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What's the question?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: What did Obama do for Chicago, Juan?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh. Remember, Michelle went there after the shooting of that young woman who had come to the White House.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nCALDWELL: Let me tell you what President Obama did for Chicago, nothing.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That's not true.\u00a0\nCALDWELL: And the reason why he did nothing because his pal Rahm Emanuel, let's be very honest, his pal Rahm Emanuel was running the city so therefore he didn't talk about the issues of Chicago. There were people dying in the streets as they are today and you didn't get a word out of President Obama on that one.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nCALDWELL: -- executive bridge could have done something real for Chicago. And let me just say --\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nCALDWELL: -- justice reform has gone away --\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nCALDWELL: -- even Ben Jones (ph) is a part of that conversation.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Gianno, let me just quickly say that in fact the criticism of President Obama came from the left for saying to people including at church services, we have to be more responsible, black on black crime is our problem. It's not about race, all of that. And people said why are you lecturing black folks when there is systemic racism? So I don't buy that he did nothing. I think today with Kanye West, what you saw was not a message to the black community. It was a message to Trump supporters ahead of the midterms. Don't worry about the problem of race, I have a black friend, and that's why Kanye was a prop.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: So again, what I have to say is, when people say he is a prop or, he's stupid, or -- I will just go back to the revolving door of celebrities who are making their pitches on a variety of issues to Obama and the Clintons. And this was considered all well and good, whether it was George Clooney or whether it was Jay and Be. Whoever it was, they did celebrity send-off for the president. It was something like the Grammy Awards. I've never seen anything like it.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Laura --\u00a0\nCALDWELL: Let me interject really quickly.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I covered.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Here's what I'm saying. I want Gianno to have his chance, but allow me to respond, Gianno. I would just say to you, Laura, if you look back from Eisenhower who had E. Frederick Morrow, to Ronald Reagan, to presidents Kennedy and President Bush, they had black advisors and Latino advisors. Is Omarosa another celebrity? His expert in terms of dealing with race and civil rights issues?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Now we know why you care. So for you now it's the numbers inside the White House.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, it's about people who know that they're doing, people who have some relationship, establishment relationship to the black community.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: We've got to get Gianno in.\u00a0\nCALDWELL: Kanye became very dangerous to the folks on the left and otherwise when they saw what he did for President Trump's polls numbers in the black community. We know that to be a fact. People have been calling Kanye West stupid and dumb when he has done great work. The guy is a billionaire now. And this was somebody who the odds were against him from birth. So for people to call him stupid and dumb when I'm not aware of anybody's medical credentials who have examined him, to say that is just wrong. Especially black people on CNN calling him a token negro, it's outrageous.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: All right, guys, thank you so much, both you. Could keep it going, I wish we had more time tonight.\u00a0\nTwo Democratic senate candidates might be facing their own basket of deplorables moment. Sean Spicer, Ari Fleischer, both here to explain, next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government.\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, D, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Those two moments caught on camera in 2012 and 2016 became defining moments for two losing candidates. Now, two Democrat Senate candidates are facing similar issues. For Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, it happened when his staff dismissed the candidate's support for Brett Kavanaugh as a way to fool ignorant Tennessee voters.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will we lose voters? Are people of Tennessee ignorant?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Arizona Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema similarly mocked her own constituents in a newly unearthed 2011 video. Watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKYRSTEN SINEMA, D, ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE: Arizona is the state of five Cs. Cattle, copper, citrus, cotton, and climate. And those are the things that out state historically made its money off of. We also have a sixth C, its' called crazy.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nSINEMA: Because what is happening in my state is pure craziness.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: That was the nice stuff she said. Joining us with their thoughts are two former White House press secretaries, the Trump administration's Sean Spicer and the Bush administration's Ari Fleischer. Sean, let's start with you. One of President Trump's major advantages over secretary Clinton with how out of touch she seemed with ordinary Americans. So do these senators face similar ordinary risks here given the revelations?\u00a0\nSEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Absolutely. Pro tip -- don't call the people that you want to elect you crazy. So I think Kyrsten Sinema that was in a close race out there in Arizona with Congresswoman Martha McSally is going to find herself on the back end of the wave that is going to bring Martha McSally to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0\nSimilarly, I think Marsha Blackburn initially was in a tight race going back a few weeks ago with former governor Phil Bredesen. And I think that that race has opened up for Marsha Blackburn. These two folks needed to pretend that they actually were conservatives and that they have championed sort of the issues that they could work with someone like President Donald Trump. And these videos that had both been unearthed proved that they will say whatever they have to say to get into power, and yet they are truly leftwing Democrats that will elect Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi if they ever were to get to Washington.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Ari, authenticity in candidates and on campaigns, in politics sometimes it's hard to find. People kind of sense it, though. I think they know it when they see it. And Trump, his rough edges and all at times, people think this is the guy who is going to fight for us, he loves this country, and we are with him. We're going to stay with him because he loves us, he loves them. What about, especially with Arizona, Ari?\u00a0\nARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You are 100 percent right. There is a real revulsion in this country towards picture-perfect politicians who know how say everything the right way but they don't mean it. So along comes rough, tough, gruff Trump, who just lets it fly, lets it rip. And it makes some people uncomfortable. But on the other hand, I think people actually embrace the fact that he is real. And that has helped him.\u00a0\nIn the case of the Senate candidates in these very red states, there is a terrible tension that they are suffering from. They want to be more liberal, but they know they can't be more liberal, and so it doesn't surprise you when you hear things, you see things like what happened with Arizona, like what's happening in Tennessee, come out of the woodwork, because its' the real reflection of who they are and what they believe. But they have to fake it because they cannot win in a red state otherwise.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: One of the parts of this was when Sinema was saying, there's nothing wrong in the water, something wrong with the people in the public office in Arizona. They are called Republicans, Tea Party Republicans. It's all the same thing, it's called crazy. Again, more craziness. And it goes back to pejoratives. And we're talking about Kanye West, all the criticism of him is he's crazy, he's nuts, he's stupid, you can't understand him. There's very little substantive dialogue.\u00a0\nAnd Sean, I want to go with you and then back to Ari. Nicolle Wallace was on MSNBC today, and we were talking about this push to violence and intimidation, getting in people's faces. She said something very interesting about what she encouraged Jim Bush to do during the debates in the GOP primary of 2016. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nNICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: I told Jeb Bush after that debate that I thought he should have punched him in the face. Even if he lost, he insulted your wife. He came down the escalator and called Mexicans rapists and murderers. He said, what do you think I should have done. I said I think you should have punched him in the face and then gotten out of the race. He would have been a hero.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Sean, she actually told him to do that, apparently.\u00a0\nSPICER: I think the problem I have right now is is that we've gone from joking about things to actually inciting violence. I know Nicolle, not well, but I hope that was in a lighthearted moment. But what I'm continuing to see from the left is, whether it's people getting shot up at a baseball office or going to Andy Harris's office or assaulting Ted Cruz and his wife at dinner, it's the left that continues to push the envelope in a very dangerous place in this country.\u00a0\nI respect the First Amendment and I respect our ability to protest.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But this is ridiculous.\u00a0\nSPICER: And assemble, but this is now crossing the line. And the left seems to be condoning it and encouraging it in a way that I think is very dangerous for society.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But I'm not going to let you off the hook, Ari, on Nicolle Wallace and punching Trump in the face. This is wild. What is this?\u00a0\nFLEISCHER: It's not wild. It's lost. And I think that's what Donald Trump has made people do. They become lost. People who used to have moorings, people who used to say, there's a limit to where we will go. And because they don't like what Donald Trump is doing, they go lower. And that is really going to hurt the Democrats when good people like Nicolle have lost their way and say things like that. Advocating violence, no.\u00a0\nAnd Sean is 100 percent right. That was actually an assassination attempt on scores of Republicans with 200 rounds of ammunition. Don't forget the shooting at the Family Research Council or the firebombing of the GOP headquarters in North Carolina in 2016. These are actual acts of violence, and one of the reasons why I'm so upset about this is because the mainstream media doesn't blow the whistle, put it on the front page, and call them out. They look the other way. And that mean they acquiesce to it.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Bingo. All right, guys -- and tacitly encourage it, I think. Guys, thank you so much.\u00a0\nAnd did you know that Susan Rice's son is the head of the Stanford Republicans? Isn't that interesting? And did you know he was reportedly assaulted recently at a pro Kavanaugh rally? One of his close friends joins us next to detail the latest example of the leftist violence that Ari and Sean were just talking about. Stay there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You saw it when protesters literally tried to pry open the 13- ton bronze doors of the Supreme Court, and you saw it when Antifa took over Portland, physically attacking cars. Leftist violence is also spilling onto college campuses, though, impacting our students. The Republican son of Obama national security advisor Susan Rice says that he was assaulted at Stanford University at an event, believe it or not, supporting Brett Kavanaugh. His best friend who witnessed it, Ben Esposito, is joining us tonight. Ben, it's good to see you, is the treasurer of the Stanford College Republicans. Ben, take us through what happened here.\u00a0\nBEN FRANCISCO ESPOSITO, STANFORD COLLEGE GOP TREASURER: Yes, thank you, Laura, great to be here. So we have these events regularly, change my mind events, where we promote conservative views on a campus that frankly doesn't have a lot of them. So we were standing today, or the other day, for due process. And during this event, one of the protesters who showed up kind of got upset at John, and showed up and pushed him and hit him and pushed him back. And we eventually had to call the police and make sure everything got settled down.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: And it was a woman, I understand? Is that right?\u00a0\nESPOSITO: Yes, that's right. Yes, female student.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Are you identifying her, afraid to identify her? Who is she?\u00a0\nESPOSITO: We've identified her on our Facebook. I don't think we need to throw our name out. Her first name is Melinda, I don't think we need to throw her name out to the masses. But yes, she assaulted John, and right now we are pressing charges for John.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: And she was upset because you were exercising your First Amendment rights? She's a known leftist on campus?\u00a0\nESPOSITO: Not really. In fact it's kind of crazy that it's actually someone we had no idea, because we do know some prominent, very liberal students on campus, but this is just another person, yes. So she was upset at John was filming her ripping these flyers because we are just trying to get these documented. And she wasn't happy at that and she attacked him for it.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Is it harder for Susan Rice's son given her prominence in the Obama administration for him to be a Republican? Does he faced more pushback just because of his family lineage?\u00a0\nESPOSITO: I think perhaps, but really I think the reason he faces the most pushback anywhere is because he's a conservative on a college campus promoting individual liberty. Every day, it's very difficult for students, any student, to promote conservatism. Students are expected to conform.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Hey, Ben, keep doing exactly what you're doing because, guess what, there are a lot more students who agree with you, and you have to have fun doing it, and you have to keep doing it. I went through the same thing at Dartmouth. Keep doing what you are doing. We salute you and give our best to your pal, OK? And stay safe out there.\u00a0\nESPOSITO: We will keep fighting, thank you.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You take care.\u00a0\nAnd the violence and intimidation now apparently follows you even at the bar. You're out there having some fun, you can't do politics there, either. Johnny Mackay made headlines yesterday after someone torched his truck because he dared to have a pro-Trump sticker on it. Johnny, first of all, it's good to have you with us. I'm sorry this happened to you. Is this like a normal occurrence for top supporters in Washington State, which is obviously a very liberal state? What gives here?\u00a0\nJOHNNY MACKAY, TORCHED TRUCK OWNER: No. Washington is actually more pro- Trump than just across the river in Portland, so it's very unusual.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: So what does the sticker look like?\u00a0\nMACKAY: I had two stickers. They both were Trump 2020. One says make liberals cry again, and the other one said, keep America great.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Make liberals cry again is really funny, and you have to get me one, although I think I will put it on my older car. So you came out of the bar, what time, and you left the car there because you stayed there late, and then you came out the next morning, what happened?\u00a0\nMACKAY: My wife was at work and I was home bored, so I went to the bar to have a couple drinks and play some pool. I was only there for about an hour and a half, I had four beers, played a couple games of pool and left at 10:30 p.m. I took an Uber home because I was feeling it. And when I left in the morning, my truck was gone.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: And you found it where.\u00a0\nMACKAY: It was in the parking lot. It was completely torched. Whoever did, the only thing I could think of is they didn't like the Trump bumper stickers, because the lady who initially called 911, she told the bar owner that it said on the front door, it said F-you Trump on it. But the scorch burnt the other part off and all that was left was the Trump part.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I'm sure it wasn't, we love Trump, let us burn your truck. That's a pretty logical guess. I'm really sorry this happened to you. You can't put a bumper sticker on your car. You have to confuse them next time and have like, make America great, and then like, visualize world peace or question authority. You have to some liberal Greenpeace stuff and Trump stuff. Then they'll be stuck and they won't know what to do. Just do that. That will really freak them out, all right? I hope you get a new truck, I hope insurance covers that. Thank you so much.\u00a0\nAnd I will debate a professor who, get this, says Trump immigration policy is the cause of crime. Where? In Mexico. Stick around.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: A policy professor at George Mason University is blaming the Trump administration for crimes in Mexico. Yes, you heard that right. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera joins us now to explain. Thank you for being here. First of all, do you think it's possible that some of the people who have been deported back to Mexico were already committing crimes before they were deported back to Mexico? Because you were saying deportation policy is making Mexico's life worse. Explain.\u00a0\nGUADALUPE CORREA-CABRERA, THE WILSON CENTER: Mexico and the United States, because people are very vulnerable. We have cartels at the border, operating at the border. And we have corruption in Mexico, therefore, when you deport people to the border, they find themselves like they want to come back to the United States. They don't have their families or the network, and some of them are forced to participate in the criminal activities, or some of them want to go to the United States, so they hire some smugglers that are in connection with the cartels.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I understand that. But why is that our problem?\u00a0\nCORREA-CABRERA: Well, it's not your problem, but you might have a problem, as well, because you will have more criminal groups operating on the Mexican side of the border. And as you know, people are still arriving in the United States no matter what.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Do you think we should have any borders, really? Why have a border at this point? Why not just make it all one Mexico and United States, and then the cartel will kind of go out of business because people will just be all one country.\u00a0\nCORREA-CABRERA: I believe every country has to have some kind of limits, and I think borders to establish certain limits to certain forces.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But if you can have a border, then presumably when people don't have permission to be here, then they can be sent home. Every country on the face of the planet sends people home when they don't have permission, and especially if they have committed a crime, and then you're really subjected to deportation. I think Americans don't feel like it's their responsibility to make sure that Mexico -- we want Mexico to be well, but we don't want a lot of people to cross the border. Real quick.\u00a0\nCORREA-CABRERA: I think that you're right, but at the same time the United States can be threatened by more violence at the border.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Will you come back so we can do a really long segment?\u00a0\nCORREA-CABRERA: Yes.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Would love to have you back. Thank you so much. We'll be right back with the last bite. Don't go away.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: It's time for the last bite. NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown was at the White House today and spoke out on NFL players taking a knee.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJIM BROWN, FORMER NFL PLAYER: I can be very blunt about taking a knee. First of all, I'm an American. That flag is my flag. I don't think that we should take knees in protest instead of be standing up for our flag.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Jim, I couldn't agree with you more. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"Fox News @ Night\" team take it from here. They had the big interview with President Trump. You're pretty tough on the president last night, Shannon. I watched the whole thing. It was really good.\u00a0\nCopy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "Supreme Court confirmation battle being closely watched as midterm elections loom. You could almost hear liberals gnash their teeth Monday night as President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. They know they have almost no chance of preventing his confirmation. Kavanaugh is widely liked in Washington legal circles. He gave a humanizing introductory speech after the president introduced him at a White House ceremony. The judge has impeccable educational qualifications and already serves on the powerful U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He is even respected by liberals such as Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who hired him to teach at Harvard Law School before she joined the high court. Democrats were worried about the danger of having Kavanaugh on a track to the Supreme Court back in 2003 when he was appointed by President George W. Bush to the D.C. federal circuit court. They blocked a vote on his confirmation for three years, and only four Democrats ultimately voted for him. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., made his concerns public at Kavanaugh\u2019s 2006 confirmation hearing when he told the nominee: \u201cAs I look through all of the different issues that you have been involved in as an attorney in public service and the private sector, it seems that you are the Zelig or Forrest Gump of Republican politics. You show up at every scene of the  crime. You are somehow or another deeply involved, whether it is Elian Gonzalez or the Starr Report, you are there.\u201d Durbin and his liberal colleagues know there is only one narrow path to stopping Kavanaugh. Right now, the question isn\u2019t if Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, but how many Democrats will find themselves torn between the left wing of their party and political reality. First, Democratic leaders must convince all of the 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in November in states that Donald Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election to oppose his Supreme Court nominee, even at the risk of alienating their constituents. Of these 10 Democratic senators, the most likely to vote to confirm Kavanaugh are Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. All voted in favor of President Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last year. In addition to pressuring every single Democratic senator to oppose Kavanaugh, Democratic leaders must launch a vicious assault to get Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to oppose Kavanaugh. In what could be dubbed Project Fear, Democrats who want Collins and Murkowski to join them in opposing Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation will claim the judge will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide \u2013 and will say that Kavanaugh will end ObamaCare. Both Senators Collins and Murkowski have stated they would have trouble voting for a nominee who has indicated the intention to overturn Roe v. Wade. They also joined Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., in derailing the GOP\u2019s effort to replace ObamaCare in 2017. McCain, who is ill with brain cancer back in Arizona, is unlikely to be able to return to Washington to vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. But I don\u2019t believe there is a realistic chance \u2013 absent the revelation of a personal scandal or an unlikely verbal mistake by Kavanaugh \u2013 that either Collins or Murkowski will vote against him. Both senators have voted for all of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees and overall they have backed the Trump legislative agenda: 80 percent of the time for Collins and 84 percent of the time for Murkowski. Then there is the issue of political survival. As reporter Perry Bacon points out in FiveThirtyEight: \u201cSuch a vote would virtually guarantee that the offending GOP senator would face a primary challenge in their next election \u2013 and likely a challenge with strong support from the party base.\u201d Both Collins and Murkowski have reason to worry on that front. In 2010, Murkowski actually lost her Republican primary in Alaska to tea party insurgent Joe Miller. It was only through an effort worthy of Hercules that the party establishment was able to take advantage of Miller\u2019s rookie mistakes in the general election and re-elect Murkowski on the basis of write-in votes. That establishment support would be absent for Murkowski if she were to break with her party on such a high-profile vote as Kavanaugh. And voter suspicion about Murkowski is still present in Alaska. Running for re-election in 2016 against a hapless Democrat and against Miller (running as a Libertarian this time), Murkowski was only able to defeat her underfunded third-party challenger by 44 percent to 29 percent. The Democratic candidate for the Senate seat from Alaska got only 12 percent of the vote. Changing parties after voting against Kavanaugh would not be an option for Murkowski. The situation is similar for Susan Collins in Maine. Despite being in New England, Maine is not a liberal state. It has elected conservative Gov. Paul LePage twice and the GOP controls one of its two legislative chambers. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly won the state 48 percent to 45 percent for Trump, but if you added Libertarian Gary Johnson\u2019s 5 percent to Trump\u2019s total, Clinton\u2019s performance was anemic. Collins knows that were she to vote against Kavanaugh she would face a bitter inter-party challenge in 2020, and in a closed primary in which only Republicans can vote. \u201cPolitically for Susan \u2026 it\u2019s very hazardous right now for her to take on President Trump,\u201d former Rhode Island Senator Lincoln Chafee, a former Republican who has become a Democrat, told the Boston Globe. \u201cMaine has its strong Trump core. Even if they\u2019re pro-choice I think in this environment many of these people just want to blindly support President Trump, and any deviation from his agenda can be hazardous and invite a primary challenge.\u201d These factors make it unlikely that Democrats can peel away either GOP senator to oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If they fail they will have to worry that several of their vulnerable incumbents up for re-election in November will vote for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation so they can bolster their credentials as moderates. Right now, the question isn\u2019t if Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, but how many Democrats will find themselves torn between the left wing of their party and political reality.",

            "article_content": "Incumbent Sen. Dean Heller is facing Democrat Rep. Jacky Rosen in a tight bid for re-election in Nevada. (AP Photo/Official Photo) With less than two months to go before November\u2019s midterm elections, President Trump is traveling to Nevada to lend his support for an incumbent senator at risk of losing his seat. While Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., has faced tight races in the past, he\u2019s never lost an election. But Democrats see an opportunity to make this the first for him \u2013 and gain headway in taking control of the Senate. Trump lost Nevada in the 2016 election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, 46 percent to 48 percent, respectively. Fox News has ranked the Senate race a tossup. Read on for a look at the candidates. GOP Sen. Dean Heller is facing a tough re-election campaign. (Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun via AP) A longtime Nevada politician, incumbent Sen. Dean Heller has served in his current role since 2011, when he was first appointed to the seat. Prior to that, Heller represented the 2nd congressional district in the House and served as Nevada\u2019s secretary of state. At one point, Heller dismissed Trump and returned a campaign donation. But now, Heller has \u2013 for the most part \u2013 aligned himself with the president on certain issues, including tax reform, stronger border security and supporting gun rights. \u201cEighty percent of what this president has done has been very, very good, very positive,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThe other 20 percent \u2026 he has a reality show. I get it. It\u2019s a reality show.\u201d FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS Trump has backed Heller in the race. His goal for this election, he told the Washington Examiner, is to keep the focus of the campaign on Nevada, instead of Washington, D.C., some 2,400 miles away. And to be sure, his campaign website says he approaches policy issues with one question in mind: \u201cHow does it affect Nevada?\u201d In his last election, which was in 2012, Heller had a one-point victory over Democrat Shelley Berkley. This time around, Heller benefits from more name recognition in the state as well as a heftier campaign coffer. He\u2019s outraised Jacky Rosen so far, with $10.6 million in campaign contributions compared to her $9.2 million. Rep. Jacky Rosen is hoping to unseat incumbent Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada. (AP Photo/John Locher) Rep. Jacky Rosen is a first-term congresswoman, having only been elected in 2016. But Democrats are banking on her as an option to flip control of the Senate back to them. A former synagogue leader, Rosen is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and touts her efforts for bipartisanship in Congress on her campaign website. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to give people someone to vote for instead of something to vote against,\u201d she previously told Politico, adding, \u201cI believe I\u2019m going to win this race.\u201d TRUMP BACKS NEVADA SEN. HELLER, GIVES OPPONENT NICKNAME Rosen has lived in Nevada for almost 40 years and was the first person in her family to graduate from college, according to her campaign website. To do that, she was a waitress and continued to work weekends at banquets when she began her career as a software developer. Rosen has been endorsed by former President Barack Obama and EMILY\u2019s List, a pro-choice organization. She supports access to abortion, a pathway to citizenship for those protected under DACA and more stringent gun control, especially in the wake of the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 people dead. She hasn\u2019t shied away from criticizing the president or hitting Heller over support for his policies, including when it comes to immigration, efforts to repeal ObamaCare, the Republican-led tax reform and his backing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. While Heller has outraised Rosen so far, outside groups have poured $17 million into the race \u2013 with about $10 million going to either support Rosen or oppose Heller, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

            "article_content": "From New Jersey and South Dakota to Montana, a look at notable primary competitions that you should know about. Tuesday kicks off primary elections in multiple states across the country, including Alabama, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. From close primary races to districts Democrats hope to turn blue in the midterms, read on for a look at five races to watch -- that aren\u2019t in California. Democrats are hoping to turn New Mexico blue with the gubernatorial race, and Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham leads the pack ahead of the primary. (Reuters/Mike Segar) Democrats are hoping to turn New Mexico blue with the gubernatorial race this year with an electorate that has been tilting progressive. Susana Martinez, the current Republican governor, cannot seek re-election due to term limits. For the Democrats, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, state Sen. Joseph Cervantes and entrepreneur Jeff Apodaca are contending for their party\u2019s nomination. Both Lujan Grisham and Apodaca come from political families in the Land of Enchantment state. Lujan Grisham, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats, has already secured endorsements from Planned Parenthood, EMILY\u2019s List and a bevy of local labor unions, according to her campaign website. She\u2019s also been endorsed by state Attorney General Hector Balderas. Lonna Atkeson, a University of New Mexico political science professor, told the Albuquerque Journal that Grisham could have an \u201cedge,\u201d as she's the only woman in the race. For Republicans, Rep. Steve Pearce is running unopposed. Pearce is known in Congress as a reserved, \u201clow word-count guy.\u201d He\u2019s voted about 85 percent of time in agreement with President Trump -- although he\u2019s publicly opposed the border wall. Pearce\u2019s campaign has placed an emphasis on job creation as New Mexico has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation. Democrats already control much of New Mexico politics, including the legislature and other statewide offices. A win for Democrats in this race could shut out Republicans from redistricting decisions made in 2021. Clinton took New Mexico with 48 percent of the vote, compared to Trump's 40 percent. From left, Russell Fagg, Troy Downing, Matt Rosendale and Al Olszewski are competing for the chance to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this fall. (AP Photo/Matt Volz) Although incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, has emphasized his record of voting for more than a dozen bills signed into law by Trump, November\u2019s general election is considered a toss-up by Fox News. Four Republicans are vying for the Republican nomination to take on Tester in the fall: combat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and state auditor Matt Rosendale. All four GOP candidates, even Fagg, who is considered to be a favorite among the more establishment-type Republicans, have aligned themselves with the president. \u201cIt\u2019s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump. It\u2019s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana,\u201d Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor, told Fox News. Trump won Montana with about 56 percent of the vote in 2016. In comparison, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain garnered about 50 percent. Although none of the four Republican candidates have star name recognition, Saldin said a Tester loss shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re running as a Republican in Montana statewide, you\u2019ve got a shot,\u201d he said. With endorsements from Sens. Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Rosendale has emerged as a frontrunner in the primary, Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor told Fox News. Rep. Kristi Noem faces state Attorney Gen. Marty Jackley in the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Dakota. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Rep. Kristi Noem and state Attorney Gen. Marty Jackley are facing off in the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Dakota. Although it started off cordial, the Republican primary has turned a bit volatile, The Argus Leader reported -- especially in campaign ads and a recent debate. Jackley has painted Noem as a Washington insider, while Noem has touted her relationship with Trump. The primary is a close one:\u00a0a recent poll from The Argus Leader and KELO-TV has Noem ahead by only one percentage point. Whoever wins the GOP primary will likely face state Sen. Billie Sutton, a Democrat who is running unopposed. The seat is currently held by Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who is term-limited. In the presidential election, Trump won 62 percent of the vote, compared to Hillary Clinton, who won 32 percent. If elected, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer would be the youngest woman elected to Congress at 28 years old. Finkenauer faces three Democratic primary challengers all in a bid to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum. (Reuters/Tim Reid) One of several competitive races where Democrats are hoping to flip a seat is the 1st congressional district in Iowa. Rep. Rod Blum, a Republican, faces a tough re-election campaign in what Fox News\u2019 has labeled a toss-up election. He\u2019s running unopposed in the primary, but a group of energized Democrats are vying to take him on in the general election. His seat is one targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. For Democrats, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer, Thomas Heckroth, Army veteran George Ramsey and aerospace engineer Courtney Rowe will face off in Tuesday\u2019s primary election. Seen as the frontrunner among Democrats, Finkenauer has already gotten the endorsements of EMILY\u2019s List, NARAL and several state lawmakers. She has also raised the most money with nearly $1.3 million, the Des Moines Register reported. Finkenauer, 28, would be the youngest woman elected to Congress if she wins. (Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., became the youngest woman to be elected in 2014 at the age of 30.) The Democratic Party is ready and welcoming a challenging race in November, especially after Trump\u2019s election. Linn County Democratic Party Chairman Bret Nilles previously told Fox News that he\u2019s seen \u201cmore enthusiasm since the election results than we had prior to\u201d the presidential election. Nilles also said he hopes Blum\u2019s support for Trump will help Democrats in November. Trump won about 51 percent of the vote in Iowa in the 2016 election -- compared to Clinton\u2019s 42 percent -- but according to the Des Moines Register, \u201cno party\u201d voters make up a huge difference in the 1st congressional district. About 32 percent of voters in the district are registered Democrats, 29 percent are Republicans and the rest aren\u2019t affiliated with a party, the newspaper reported. \"No Party\" voters hold the secret to understanding why incumbents do well in the district and why a conservative Republican continues to win a district in which Democrats outnumber Republicans,\u201d Christopher Larimer, a University of Northern Iowa political scientist, wrote in a book about the district, according to the Des Moines Register. Blum, 63, was first elected to the seat in 2014. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is expected to hang onto his seat, but his recent corruption and bribery trial could play a big role. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) This Senate seat is almost sure to remain safely in the hands of Democrats -- but expect Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption and bribery case to play a big role. Fox News\u2019 ranks the New Jersey Senate race as \u201clikely Democrat.\u201d Brian Goldberg, a business owner, and Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, are facing off in the Republican primary Tuesday in an effort to take on Menendez. Hugin, who is expected to win the primary, has distanced himself from Trump. Goldberg, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2014, has embraced Trump, on the other hand -- even holding a \u201cSupporters of President Trump Rally\u201d in April. Clinton took New Jersey with 55 percent of the vote; Trump won 41 percent. Whoever Menendez faces in the general, it\u2019s sure to be a \u201cnasty\u201d election cycle, Peter Woolley, a Fairleigh Dickinson University politics professor, told The Morning Call newspaper. \u201cWhen the candidates go negative before the primary is even held, you can look forward to more of the same in the general election,\" he said. Menendez faces a primary challenger in publisher Lisa McCormick who has said she\u2019s running just to give New Jersey Democrats another option. He is expected to beat her in the primary. Menendez was accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. His case ended in a mistrial last year after a jury failed to deliver a verdict. He was formally admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier this year.

(AP) DES MOINES, Iowa \u2013 A wealthy businessman who has never been elected to public office will challenge Iowa's Republican governor in November, offering voters two candidates with contrasting backgrounds and visions for the state. Fred Hubbell, a retired insurance executive, secured the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary by winning a five-candidate contest. He'll face Gov. Kim Reynolds, who ran unopposed. Reynolds, 58, has highlighted her upbringing in rural St. Charles and early jobs like a waitressing gig for the retail store chain Younkers. Hubbell, 67, once served as that company's chairman. His ancestors have lived in Des Moines for more than a century and owned the governor's ornate mansion before it was donated to the state. Reynolds, a former lieutenant governor, was sworn in last year to serve the remaining term of former Gov. Terry Branstad, now U.S. ambassador to China. She's the first female governor in Iowa history and is seeking the distinction of being the first woman elected to the position. Hubbell is well-known in Des Moines for his philanthropy, political donations and family's real estate business. He has traveled the state and flooded television airwaves to highlight his support for reforming the state's Medicaid health care program and funding Planned Parenthood. Reynolds is deeply conservative and signed into law a ban on most abortions around six weeks of pregnancy. It's considered the nation's strictest abortion ban, though it's on hold amid a lawsuit. Reynolds has also been criticized for Iowa's transition to a privatized Medicaid program. Iowa Democrats see the governor's race as the beginning of an effort to retake political power in Iowa, which is now dominated by Republicans after several election cycles. Although they support Trump, a billionaire, Iowa Republicans and Reynolds appear ready to criticize Hubbell for his wealth. \"If you think the governor's office is for sale to the highest bidder, guess what, you don't know Iowans,\" said Reynolds at an event Tuesday night in referencing Hubbell. \"You don't know Iowa, but I do.\" Voters such as Kathy Sparks, who voted for Hubbell, see hope in the businessman's candidacy. \"He seems like a very honorable, intelligent person, and I think he'd be a good leader for our state,\" she said.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: A fiery debate to kick off the 2018 midterms here in Morgantown, West Virginia, tonight. The three top Republican candidates face off to decide which one of them will take on incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin come November. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. Tonight, just a preview of what we can expect over the coming months and weeks as we watch this all play out across the country. It will be a battle to the finish line as Republicans try to hold onto their majority in congress, and Democrats try to sway voters by countering conservatives and the Trump White House. West Virginia is just 1 of 4 states that is heading to the polls this coming Tuesday night, May 8th. Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, all have big races to watch, which Bret and I will be covering for you that evening. All of those states carried by President Trump in 2016. So, here in West Virginia, the Fox News power rankings say it is a toss-up between Democrats and Republicans. And tonight, this race really just got a whole lot more interesting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK MORRISEY, R, WEST VIRGINIA SENATE CANDIDATE: I have the conservative West Virginia values. If you look at Mr. -- the congressman, he actually has been very liberal if you go Obamacare, checkbox, he supported. Hillary, he went and rallied for Hillary. Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry, Planned Parenthood spending, just a couple weeks ago. Evans, you should be ashamed of yourself for that outrageous vote killing the unborn. (APPLAUSE) EVAN JENKINS, R, WEST VIRGINIA SENATE CANDIDATE: Joe Manchin is on the Chuck Schumer team. He's sitting there with Elizabeth Warren, with Bernie Sanders. He's got a 70, 80 percent voting record with them. That's not West Virginia. I welcome the opportunity to take on Joe Manchin this November, and replace him and bring a much-needed Republican vote to the United States senate. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mr. Blankenship, isn't it true that you lived in Nevada? You pay taxes in Nevada? And, in fact, your probation officer is in Nevada, and yet you're running for U.S. senate in West Virginia. DON BLANKENSHIP, R, WEST VIRGINIA SENATE CANDIDATE: Yeah. I pay probably more taxes than anybody on the stage to West Virginia. BAIER: If Joe Manchin comes after you for living in Nevada, what do you say? BLANKENSHIP: That he's living in D.C. too long. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Interesting night. Chris Stirewalt, West Virginia native, and Fox News politics editor live outside the theater tonight. Chris, I'm interested in how you think these gentlemen did up there tonight. CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: I tell you, we had to come inside because they're still rocking out. I don't think they want to go home. They had so much fun with you guys. But, I've got to tell you, I think Blankenship, probably, did himself a world of good tonight. He didn't talk as much as the other two, but he was substantive in his answers. And he was down in the polls coming in here, and maybe did OK. Especially, on that Mitch McConnell answer. MACCALLUM: Yeah. Let's take a look at one of the other very interesting moments from tonight when the candidates were asked to raise their hands when it came to the majority leader. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Please raise your hand if you would support Mitch McConnell for Republican leader in the senate. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: No hands, Chris. No hands up there. STIREWALT: And Blankenship was headed for the deck. So, it was interesting when you listen to the answer from Jenkins and Morrisey, they were leaving their options open. They said, look, you know, I'm not going to support him today, but maybe I'm going to vote for him. Where Blankenship is telling these are primary voters. These -- the Republicans, Republicans, and he said no. And that will mean something. MACCALLUM: Let's take a look at one more moment here, Chris. And Bret is about to join in as well and get a look at this. Let's see one more moment from tonight. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MORRISEY: I have the conservative West Virginia values. If you look at Mr. -- the congressman, he actually has been very liberal if you go Obamacare, checkbox, he supported. Hillary, he went and rallied for Hillary. Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry, Planned Parenthood spending, just a couple weeks ago. Evans, you should be ashamed of yourself for that outrageous vote killing the unborn. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Pretty hot out there. Let's bring in my co-anchor, Bret Baier, who helped moderate this evening. We worked on it together all week, really, coming up with the questions for tonight, and, of course, the chief political anchor at Fox News. So, tell me what -- what do you think -- it's interesting, Morrisey and Jenkins, in particular, were really going at each other. BAIER: Really going at each other. I do want to clarify one thing. There is a Morgantown, West Virginia, song that they took from Rocky Top, Tennessee, and it says Morgantown instead. So, there was a correct song play, it's just. MACCALLUM: It did give Evans Jenkins another opportunity to say how proud he is to be from West Virginia. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Exactly. BAIER: But, I thought it was interesting to watch the dynamic between Morrisey and Jenkins. Obviously, Blankenship had some interesting lines. And, listen, don't take away the possibility that West Virginia could go with an outsider. I mean, obviously, Donald Trump plays well here. You saw how they tried to out-Trumped each other all night long. At 87 percent approval they're going to do that. MACCALLUM: And the fascinating thing to watch, if indeed, tonight is good for Don Blankenship. When they look at the polls and everybody sorts it out is what the Republican is going to do back in Washington, because they went through a similar exercise in Alabama and it didn't work out so well. Don Blankenship doesn't want to be compared to Roy Moore, but that the comparison that's made because of his time in prison. And where would they come down if they started to see him take off? BAIER: I don't know. You know, Don Blankenship is not Roy Moore. He's got some one-liners. He's got some, you know, outside, you know, positioning. I think the traditional bet is to go with the congressman here, you would think. But, I think this is going to be a close race. As you look at our poll, it's -- you know, it's anybody's game. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. Morrisey and Jenkins fairly thinks that they are - - you know, if people are going to choose one or the other of them if they're not going to Blankenship route, and they were clearly trying to define themselves in a very strong way tonight, so interesting -- final thoughts, Chris Stirewalt? STIREWALT: They were to mean to each other. They were to embittering. And they were at each other constantly, too many negatives. They're driving up each other's negatives, and they will pay a price for that. MACCALLUM: We will see. Thank you so much, Chris Stirewalt, native West Virginian, rocky top kind of guy. Thank you, Chris. That was fun. All right. So, still ahead tonight, we've got a lot coming up on The Story. Kim Jong-un taking more positive steps today towards a peace deal, but should President Trump trust this man? Former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has one word and she will join us live in just a moment. Plus, the big question tonight, who is behind the stunning leak of questions that Special Counsel Mueller wants to ask President Trump, and what does it mean for the future of this investigation? Chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, and constitutional attorney, Jonathan Turley, take that on right after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Speculation is running wild tonight over who was behind the latest bombshell leak in the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian collusion. In a stunning development, we now know at least some of the questions of the special counsel and how he wants to grill President Trump if he gets the opportunity. But how does this monumental leak happen? Fingers are pointing in all directions tonight with some, if you can believe it, straight at the president, himself, or perhaps some of his people. Chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, live with all of this tonight at the White House as it unfolds. Hi, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Martha, great to see you. It may be hard to pin this leak on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, because senior White House sources are telling me tonight, he and his lawyers are unlikely suspects over at the special counsel team because all of these questions tip their hand publicly about where they're going. Instead, insiders close to the process focusing on the part of the time story saying this list of questions was compiled by the president's lawyers lead at the time by John Dowd after a series of meetings with Mueller. Dowd, tonight, told me, quote, it's not me, pal. But, note, he left the president's legal team earlier this year after including Mueller's long list of questions could put the president in legal jeopardy if he sat for an interview. This leak is widely seen as an attempt to sabotage that interview. The Times added the leak was a person outside the current legal team, meaning it could not be White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, or the new outside lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, since they're not on -- since they're currently on the team. John Dowd is not on the team. Now, I'm told Cobb and Giuliani are both privately saying they still want the president to find a way to do an interview to try and end this probe. The idea that the president himself leaked it seems remote because he has been pushing to do an interview too. And who ever leaked this list of questions seems to want to scuttle an interview because there are at least four dozen questions that frame this as a pile on. Mueller pressing for answers about the president's meetings with James Comey, Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Plus, questions about whether he spoke to lawyer Michael Cohen about real estate deals in Russia, which we've seem to cross the red line the president established about his business. And, if the president was the leaker he seemed to disguise it, tweeting, quote, so disgraceful. The questions concerning the Russian witch hunt were leaked to the media. No questions on collusion. Oh, I see, you have a made up phony crime, collusion, that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice. Meanwhile, Republican, Trey Gowdy, Bob Goodlatte, are probing some of James Comey's leaks, sending a letter to Sessions. Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein seeking documents on a friend, Daniel Richmond, that Comey used as a go-between to get out some of his memos. Rosenstein, by the way, fired back today at house Republicans preparing articles of impeachment against him saying that the Justice Department, in his words, will not be extorted. I can tell you Republican Mark Meadows has fire back at that and said that Rosenstein should focus on facts, not rhetoric, Martha. MACCALLUM: Ed, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. So, joining me now, Jonathan Turley, constitutional law attorney and law professor at George Washington University. Jonathan, good evening to you. JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ATTORNEY: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: When these questions started pouring out, we all poured through them to try to figure out what they tell us about the direction of this investigation. What was your overall take away with the tenor of these questions and what he's going for? TURLEY: Well, first of all, the release of these questions was a very aggressive act, and it's most likely someone who doesn't want the interview to occur. You don't poison the well that you intend to drink from. And that's what this was an effort to do, to show that the questions were brought to possibly justify a refusal by the president to sit down with Mueller. Otherwise, most of the questions, I'd say 90 percent were highly predictable. If you were to sit down and write out the questions about three months after Mueller was appointed, most of these questions would be those questions. Now, there are some that do cross that redline that Ed was talking about going into business dealings, but those are largely dealing that we knew were on the radar screen from Moscow. I actually think the president could deal with these questions. He could be properly prepared. Where he has to be concerned are the sleeper questions, the ones that look like they're innocuous or housekeeping. For example, when did he first learn about the Trump Tower meeting? He has denied knowing about that before the meeting, so has Donald Trump Jr. The Democrats are trying to establish that it was Trump who was the so-called blocked caller referred to in the house committee report investigation. They did not determine that number. Mueller may have. He has subpoena authority and he could have determined who made that call at a critical point when that meeting was being discussed. MACCALLUM: Yeah. I mean, it's fascinating. When you look at some of these, they are very open-ended, and we all know the way that the president likes to answer questions, and sometimes, you know, ramble into different territory. They're not specific. They're not questions that would be answered with a yes or no. Do you think that is a set up for him? TURLEY: Well, I think there may be a set up here. Whenever you go into these things you have to assume that it could be a perjury trap. That doesn't mean you have to fall in it. I've done a lot of depositions that are a lot more complex than this. He has very good attorneys that will be there with him. If he preps, if he prepares with those attorneys and listens to them, yes, I think he could get through this. I also agree with them that the alternative is not particularly appealing. If he decides to bunker down, then Mueller could hit him with a subpoena. He could challenge that in federal court, but I think you would lose. Now, does he want that to be the media being generated going into the midterm elections? That's a tough call to make. And it will come at costs. MACCALLUM: Jonathan, always good to talk to you. Thank you very much for joining us tonight. TURLEY: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: You bet. Jonathan Turley. Coming up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: So far, whether you look at the Clinton administration, or the Bush administration, or the Obama administration, it never worked out. That was the time to have settled this problem, not now. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, what does the former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, think about that? And, really the whole picture for the Trump campaign right now. A lot going on with North Korea and Syria. We're going to talk to her about that when she joins me live, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CONDOLEEZZA RICE, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: The sooner that North Korea would choose to unconditionally come back to the table it would be the betterment of everyone. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I want to get peace. The main thing. We want to get peace. So, we're setting up meetings right now and I think it's probably going to be announced over the next couple of days, location and date. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was President Trump earlier today saying that he wants peace out of the upcoming summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. My next guest was the last secretary of state to negotiate with the rogue regime, Condoleezza Rice. Served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush. She's also the author of the new book, Political Risk, how businesses and organization can anticipate global insecurity, which is a pretty full-time job for a lot of companies out there right now. Condoleezza, good to see you tonight. RICE: Good to see you, too. MACCALLUM: Thank you so much for being with us. RICE: Good to see you too, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, I want to begin -- there have been so much change, obviously, in the past few weeks, over the past months, when you look at North Korea, when you look at decisions being made in Syria. So, I want to ask you just a broad question, as you watch this president in action, how do you think President Trump is doing on the world stage? RICE: I think on a number of these issues he's doing really quite well. And his administration is breaking some china, to be sure, and doing things in ways that perhaps others might not do them. But, you can't argue, for instance, with North Korea, that they're, actually, perhaps going to get results. I'll tell you, when I first heard that the president had on the spot accepted an offer from Kim Jong Un to meet, I thought, oh, my goodness, what is he doing? And then, I thought, well, you know, nothing else has worked. So, maybe, you should give it a try. And I do think that then-CIA director, now Secretary Pompeo having gone to Pyongyang, we didn't even know about it. That shows some skills to pull that diplomacy off. And so, they've got a real opportunity. I hope the president really is well-prepared for Kim Jong Un, who is a different kind of guy and will try to exploit loopholes. And we have to remember, the nature of the regime. This is a brutal regime. But, if they can get on the road to denuclearization and on the road to peace on the Korean peninsula, terrific, it will be great. MACCALLUM: You make such a great point. I mean, I think in this moment there's so much focus on he and the leader from South Korea, you know, hopping over the curve, and everything looks, sort of, happy and go lucky. But, you know, you think back to Otto Warmbier. You think back to the half-brother who was assassinated in the airport. What would you advise -- if you were to advise the president about this meeting, what would you say to him? RICE: I would say, first and foremost, try to set the tone, set the table, but then let the details be negotiated by your experts, by your secretary, by others, because there are a lot of other countries that have something at stake here. I mean, the Japanese have a lot at stake. I wouldn't be in a hurry to make pledges about what's going to happen with American troops on the Korean peninsula. Because American troops in Korea are stabilizing force, not just in Korea, but in the region as a whole. I would also be very certain that you're getting good step-by-step ways to get inspectors into North Korea. We don't actually have very good intelligence about the North Korean program and having inspectors on the ground can help. So, take your time. Go ahead and set the table, but don't try to get too much done in that first meeting because you don't want to raise expectations and disappoint them. This is a real opportunity. This is a real opening, but it has to be exploited in the right way. MACCALLUM: President Bush, obviously, has been very careful in his comments about this administration, and he's always said that he respects the job of the next president and there's only one president at a time. But, President Trump sometimes takes a shot at former presidents with regard to how they handle these things. Here's a sound bite as an example. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Other presidents should have solved this problem long before I got here. They've been talking for 25 years, and you know what happened? Nothing. The Bush administration did nothing. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Well, what goes through your mind when you hear that? RICE: What goes through my mind when you hear that is you have to respect your predecessors and how difficult some of the issues that they dealt with were. What has changed here and I think what has given President Trump the upper hand is that when the North Koreans got close to a nuclear weapon and delivery system that could reach the United States, people actually began to believe, and he deserves credit for this. People actually began to believe that the United States was not going to tolerate that, that we would go to war on the peninsula rather than allow that to happen. And, I do think it got the attention of the Chinese in ways that, frankly, we were unable to do. But, I would say that there is still a long road between where we are now and the verifiable denuclearization of North Korea. And I just want to repeat, this is a truly awful regime. And one has to be very careful that you don't lose sight of that. So, yes, I wish that other administrations had solved it. This is hard stuff, and I think the president is going to find out it's hard stuff. MACCALLUM: Indeed, it is hard stuff. Political Risk is also hard stuff right now. That's the name of your new book. The title of your new book. And you give some really fascinating examples, Facebook, you know, companies that are dealing with things that they never had to deal with before. Tell us what we should know about 'Political Risk.' RICE: Well, 'Political Risk' is an effort to say to companies and organizations the sources of political risk are now multiplying. It was once in the 70's that you worried about some socialist dictator expropriating your property. That's not your problem now. Your problem is a great power like Russia behaving badly, interfering in American elections, and using a social media platform. Actually, using the social media platform and then bringing disparaged on that social media company. And so, that's a different kind of political risk. You have what happen to United Airlines. Everybody with a cell phone is a reporter. Everybody with a cell phone can document that conditions. When you have supply chains that are reaching all the way into China and we've got talks of a trade war, you're at risk. So, the sources are multiplying. Be careful. Be on your P's and Q's. Watch for what's coming around the corner. MACCALLUM: Good advice. Former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. Thank you so much. Great to see you tonight. RICE: Great to see you too, Martha. MACCALLUM: That is our story from West Virginia. Morgantown, West Virginia, tonight at the Metropolitan Theater. The site of many primary debates. And here to come as we follow them across the country in the 2018 midterms. Next Tuesday, May 8th, Bret and I will be covering the primary elections in four states. Tucker is up next in D.C.

            "article_content": "President Trump set to stump for West Virginia Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey. West Virginia Attorney Gen. Patrick Morrisey is hoping to topple an incumbent Democrat who has held his Senate seat for nearly a decade. Morrisey is locked in a tight campaign against Sen. Joe Manchin, who was first appointed to the seat in 2010. He pulled off an upset in the Republican primary earlier this year, beating out coal baron Don Blankenship and Rep. Evan Jenkins to secure the GOP nomination in May. Although the race leans Democrat, according to Fox News\u2019 rankings, it\u2019s one Republicans hope to take over in the midterm elections. President Trump, who endorsed Morrisey in the primary, has set his sights on helping Morrisey in November. He headlined a rally for Morrisey in the Mountaineer State in August. \u201cI have done so much for West Virginia, against all odds, and having Patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier,\u201d Trump also said in a tweet. Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS West Virginia attorney general and Republican Senate candidate slams his opponent's 'terrible liberal record.' In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state\u2019s opioid epidemic. He sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients\u2019 needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state\u2019s history, according to his campaign website. His past work as a health care attorney and his wife\u2019s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny during the race. His wife\u2019s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion and opposes taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood. He has also said he supports a repeal of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court abortion case. In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he's already worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to \"go after\" sanctuary cities in West Virginia. He said he has an \"excellent\" relationship with the president. Fox News' Peter Doocy and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Corey Stewart, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate and Chairman of Prince William County Board, addresses his supporters at the Electric Palm restaurant on election night (Washington Post via AP) Corey Stewart, a pro-Trump firebrand and former state campaign chairman for Trump's presidential bid, on Tuesday won the Republican Senate nomination and will take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in the November general election. Stewart said he plans to campaign in a Trump-like way that appeals to blue collar voters across the political spectrum. He's also pledged to run a \"ruthless\" and \"vicious\" campaign against Kaine. \"We're going to have a lot of fun between now and November, folks,\" Stewart told a raucous crowd at his victory party Tuesday evening, amid chants of \"lock her up.\" Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016, has a significant fundraising advantage over Stewart. Stewart's win was the second of the night for pro-Trump backers, after Mark Sanford, a persistent Trump critic who often sparred with the president, was unceremoniously unseated in the GOP primary in South Carolina. ALSO ON TUESDAY: TRUMP-BASHER MARK SANFORD SUFFERS MAJOR PRIMARY DEFEAT IN S.C. Meanwhile, the battle lines have been drawn in Nevada's pivotal Senate race, with incumbent Nevada Sen. Dean Heller set to face off in a highly competitive battle against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in November. \"We're going to have a lot of fun between now and November, folks.\" Heller, the only Republican seeking re-election in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, has been aggressively targeted by Democrats because his Senate seat is one of the handful that Democrats hope to flip later this year. He sailed through to an easy primary victory only because of the President Trump's intervention. In March, Trump convinced GOP challenger Danny Tarkanian to drop his bid against Heller in return for a Trump endorsement in a House race. In announcing her bid, Rosen, who beat out several Democratic challengers as polls predicted, has long highlighted the GOP's narrow majority in the Senate to emphasize the heightened national relevance of the race. \"This Senate seat couldn\u2019t be more important \u2014 already this year, Senator Heller has been a deciding vote to confirm Trump\u2019s deeply unqualified Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to allow states to defund Planned Parenthood clinics, and to let internet providers sell your data to the highest bidder without your consent,\" Rosen told voters. Heller was a past critic of the president but has become closer to him in recent months and helped deliver the overhaul of the U.S. tax codes to Trump's desk in December. There was some vote-counting drama as the night unfolded in Nevada. Election officials in two counties said there were a small number of display problems in which some voters didn't initially see a complete list of candidates. Fewer than 30 voters were affected. In North Dakota, meanwhile, former state Republican Party chairman U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer has defeated a little-known opponent to win North Dakota's Republican primary for U.S. Senate. He now faces a tougher campaign to unseat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a race seen as critical for control of the closely divided Senate. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Cynthia Nixon took to Twitter to announce her plan to run for New York governor. The actress will challenge Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in September. Cynthia Nixon, known as Miranda Hobbes by fans of HBO\u2019s \u201cSex and the City\u201d series, officially is challenging incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York's Democratic primary. \u201cNew York is my home. I\u2019ve never lived anywhere else,\u201d Nixon said in a campaign video. \u201cNew York is where I was raised and where I\u2019m raising my kids. I\u2019m a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent.\u201d \u201cI love New York. I\u2019ve never wanted to live anywhere else, but something has to change,\u201d Nixon said, adding that the government should fix the state\u2019s problems with healthcare, mass incarceration and the subway system. Nixon, 52, is no stranger to politics. She\u2019s often butted heads with Cuomo over issues pertaining to public education. She\u2019s advocated for an increase in funding for public schools, breast cancer awareness and gay rights, among other things. She\u2019s protested President Trump and campaigned for former President Barack Obama. Nixon also received the endorsement of the Working Families Party (WFP), an influential, progressive third party in New York. In the primary, Nixon has been credited with pushing Cuomo to the left on some issues, including his executive order granting paroled felons the right to vote in the state. Here\u2019s a look at Nixon\u2019s political advocacy and some of the issues she\u2019s passionate about. Along with her wife, Nixon has championed causes related to New York City\u2019s public schools, including an effort to reduce public school classroom sizes. It was during this campaign that Nixon met her future spouse\u00a0Christine\u00a0Marinoni, according to a profile in The Advocate. Nixon was once arrested during a protest at City Hall aimed at increasing funding to public schools. \u201cWe marched on up, sat down and blocked the entrance,\u201d she told The New York Times. \u201cThe police very politely asked us to move, and we declined. They pulled up the police van and put us in.\u201d The Tony Award winner is also a spokeswoman for the Alliance for Quality Education, a New York-based organization that advocates for \u201chigh quality academic opportunities.\u201d \u201cCynthia is a public school mom who is extremely sincere and knowledgeable and has consistently been outspoken on the need for fair and adequate funding for our public schools.\u201d \u201cCynthia is a public school mom who is extremely sincere and knowledgeable and has consistently been outspoken on the need for fair and adequate funding for our public schools,\u201d Billy Easton, executive director of AQE, told Fox News. \u201cShe\u2019s been a very clear advocate, not just in a sort of self-interested, \u2018I\u2019m just trying to take care of my kids\u2019 [way], but more from the standpoint of every kid deserves a great opportunity,\u201d he said. In an op-ed for The Journal News, a New York newspaper, Nixon criticized the Trump administration\u2019s support for charter schools and implored New York to put more resources into public schools. Actress Cynthia Nixon addresses the crowd during the 18th annual Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) award show in New York March 26, 2007. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson) Nixon was honored with the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Visibility Award in February 2018 because she is a \u201cfearless and outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people,\u201d HRC President Chad Griffin said. \u201cCynthia uses her talent and public platform to speak out for equality in this country and around the globe, and in the process, she is changing countless hearts and minds,\u201d Griffin said in a statement. CYNTHIA NIXON RELEASES MIRANDA-THEMED CAMPAIGN GEAR ON SHOW'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY A year before she was awarded the honor, Nixon protested Trump\u2019s immigration ban at a rally held outside New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn, an important historical site for gay rights. She criticized Vice President Mike Pence, calling him the \u201cposter boy for anti-LGBT rhetoric, legislation and conversion therapy.\u201d \u201cAs LGBT people, we know how important coming out is, but I would argue that our coming out has never been more important than it is right now,\u201d Nixon said. Nixon has been married to activist Marinoni since 2012. The pair lobbied to legalize gay marriage in Washington, where Marinoni is from. After battling breast cancer herself, Nixon became a spokeswoman for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation. Nixon kept her own diagnosis quiet while she received treatment, telling ABC News she didn\u2019t want paparazzi at the hospital. After hearing the news from her doctor, she said she \u201cfelt scared\u201d and didn\u2019t \u201cwant this to be happening.\u201d The cancer was found early, in 2006, and Nixon was able to beat it. She also had some prior experience with breast cancer; her mother successfully battled it when Nixon was a child, according to ABC News. To treat it, Nixon had a lumpectomy and underwent more than six weeks of radiation, Fox News previously reported. Nixon has long been a supporter of Planned Parenthood and abortion rights, attending protests in Washington, D.C., and penning editorials in support of the reproductive health organization. \u201cI am convinced that abortion rights are human rights not only because of compassion for my mother but also because I am a mother of three,\u201d Nixon wrote in an op-ed for Time, detailing her mother\u2019s own abortion. \u201cMany of us who made the decision to become parents have experienced a unique desire for parenthood. But that in no way mutes our desire for abortion to be safe, legal and available.\u201d \u201cWomen must have the right to determine whether and when to have children. That is what reproductive rights are all about,\u201d she continued. \u201cAbortion, like parenthood, is a deeply personal and sometimes complex decision for a woman, and no one can make that decision for her. Decisions about whether to choose adoption, end a pregnancy or raise a child must be left to the woman and her family to determine based on their faith with the counsel of their medical provider.\u201d CYNTHIA NIXON EMBRACES 'UNQUALIFIED LESBIAN' LABEL IN NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL RUN Nixon was a keynote speaker at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas\u2019 awards luncheon in Dallas in March.

(Reuters/Carlo Allegri) Nixon was able to get another big-name celebrity to endorse Bill de Blasio in the Democratic primary when he ran for mayor in 2013: Alec Baldwin. According to a New York Times profile, Nixon sent Baldwin an email, encouraging him to publicly pick de Blasio over Christine Quinn, then the speaker of the City Council. Baldwin responded to Nixon\u2019s email, ensuring her that he would support de Blasio and apologizing for \u201clamely\u201d assuming that she was supporting Quinn as both women are lesbians, according to The Times. She would also get other celebrities on board with de Blasio \u2013 including fellow \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker \u2013 and organized a fundraiser for him.

            "article_content": "Breast cancer specialist opens up about getting pregnant as a teenager and keeping her baby. It had happened to a few girls in my high school before me, some of whom quickly had an abortion and moved on with their lives. Except this time it was me.\u00a0 The flood of emotions I experienced upon learning of my pregnancy as I started my senior year of high school was dominated by fear and shame. Needless to say, this wasn\u2019t the most planned aspect of my life and certainly was not on my regimented timeline for becoming a doctor \u2013 or for life in general, for that matter. Many around me said I wouldn\u2019t accomplish my goals and that if I went through with the pregnancy I would not only ruin my life but my child\u2019s as well.\u00a0 I also found myself questioning whether I really could amount to anything, other than being a statistic and ultimately a single parent. I would be remiss if I minimized this moment into political rhetoric.\u00a0 The decision to have my son at a young age was not based on political or religious beliefs. On the contrary, it was based on emotion and responsibility.\u00a0 Had this happened decades prior I may have been forced into an unsafe abortion or hidden away during my pregnancy and my child would have been given away. I am grateful to have had the choice to choose life. I am a believer that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it.\u00a0There were many dark nights where I questioned my ability to continue moving forward and not become the failure I felt almost destined to be. I spent the next 14 years juggling full-time school, part-time employment and raising a child to the best of my ability.\u00a0 I was privileged that those in my life who may have doubted my decisions did not hesitate to step in and help me. My story is meant to be an inspiration to let women know that they are not destined for failure if they find themselves in the middle of an unplanned pregnancy. And although, yes, they do have a choice, choosing life may be the best choice for them. Now, my dream of becoming a doctor has been a reality for four years, and my beautiful baby boy \u2013 who has been with me since before my high school graduation \u2013 is preparing for his own graduation, and will soon be off to the college of his choice.\u00a0 My hope for him and his life is that he does not find himself ever feeling trapped or \u201cstuck\u201d due to his decisions. But if he does find himself in an unfavorable situation, I hope the last 18 years have taught him that he is in charge of his life, and whether he gets through it or not is on him. Thankfully, my pregnancy was not the end of my story.\u00a0 Today I practice medicine at one of the world's largest cancer centers. I have a loving husband and three incredible sons. I was determined to prove that notorious connotation of \u201cteenage pregnancy\u201d wrong, at least as it pertained to me. Unplanned pregnancy can be devastating to many and not everyone will have an outcome similar to mine if they choose life. But I also know that it is within each one of \u201cus\u201d \u2013 teenage moms \u2013 to get ourselves to where we want to go in this lifetime. The current contention surrounding Planned Parenthood is a result of poor decision making and nothing more. The issue being debated is not pro-life or pro-choice but rather a woman\u2019s access to quality health care and the right to religious freedom. We would be ignorant if we disregarded the crucial health care that Planned Parenthood provides to Americans including cervical cancer screening, clinical breast exams, vaccinations and STD treatments. However, decades ago Planned Parenthood blurred the lines by performing elective abortions under the same roof as these necessary health care services.\u00a0 Although government funding does not directly reimburse for abortion services, their waters are muddied and brings to question the right of religious freedom and whether taxpayers should fund an institution that provides abortions under the same roof. President Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate government funding for Planned Parenthood through Title X is not a threat to a woman\u2019s access to health care. Planned Parenthood reportedly spent $38 million dollars on the 2016 election alone.\u00a0 Rather than spending such a large sum of money on legislators perhaps they should use that money to create a separate entity to separate essential health care services from elective abortion procedures. Sharing my story on my decision to choose life is not a lecture or debate on what is right or wrong \u2013 because, as we all discover, there are few linear right and wrong decisions in life. Rather it is meant to be an inspiration to let women know that they are not destined for failure if they find themselves in the middle of an unplanned pregnancy. And although, yes, they have a choice, choosing life may be the best choice for them. I can also tell you that having my son at the age of 18 has been one of my greatest accomplishments yet.",

            "article_content": "The 81-year-old Kennedy said he is stepping down after more than 30 years on the Supreme Court. Longtime Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday. Here\u2019s a look back at his key opinions during his more than 30 years served on the nation\u2019s highest court. FREE SPEECH - Can a group identifying itself as a religious organization pass out literature on its faith at a public place like an airport? \"The First Amendment is often inconvenient. But that is beside the point. Inconvenience does not absolve the government of its obligation to tolerate speech.\" -- Concurrence in International Society for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee (1992) ABORTION RIGHTS - State restrictions on access to the procedure. \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201d \"People have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail\u2026. We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that, before that time, the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.\" -- Concurrence in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) VOTING STANDARDS - Florida's methods for counting contested ballots in the 2000 presidential election \"The Supreme Court of Florida has said that the legislature intended the State's electors to \u2018participat[e] fully in the federal electoral process,\u2019 as provided in 3 U. S. C. \u00a75. That statute, in turn, requires that any controversy or contest that is designed to lead to a conclusive selection of electors be completed by December 12. That date is upon us, and there is no recount procedure in place under the State Supreme Court's order that comports with minimal constitutional standards. Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the December 12 date will be unconstitutional for the reasons we have discussed, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed. Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy.\" -- Bush v. Gore (2000). Although the controlling majority opinion was unsigned sources have told Fox News it was largely written behind the scenes by Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. FREE SPEECH - Challenge to a federal law placing severe restrictions and penalties on the depiction and distribution of material deemed child pornography \"First Amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end. The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.\" -- Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) EQUAL PROTECTION - Re-examination of a 1986 high court precedent upholding state laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy. \"Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.\" \"As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.\" -- Lawrence v. Texas (2003) CAPITAL PUNISHMENT - Death penalty for aggravated murder committed by those under age 18. \"When a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, but the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.\" \"It is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty.\" -- Roper v. Simmons (2005) CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM - Congressional law restricting corporations and unions from supporting individual candidates through independent expenditures. The court said political speech is a protected to a large extent by the First Amendment. \"This Court now concludes that independent [political] expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\" \"Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people. The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it. By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker\u2019s voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.\" \"When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.\" -- Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) FREE SPEECH - A public official who falsely claimed to have been awarded the Medal of Honor challenged his prosecution under a federal law making it a crime to lie about receiving military decorations. \"The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The response to the unreasoned is the rational; to the uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth.\" -- U.S. v. Alvarez (2012) GAY MARRIAGE - Challenge to state laws that ban same-sex marriage and that refusal to recognize legal same-sex marriages that occurred in other jurisdictions. \"The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them.\" \"Dignitary wounds cannot always be healed with the stroke of a pen.\" \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\" -- Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) AFFIRMATIVE ACTION - Challenge to state law banning use of racial criteria as part of the overall admissions process by state universities. \"Our constitutional system embraces, too, the right of citizens to debate so they can learn and decide and then, through the political process, act in concert to try to shape the course of their own times and the course of a nation that must strive always to make freedom ever greater and more secure. Here Michigan voters acted in concert and statewide to seek consensus and adopt a policy on a difficult subject against a historical background of race in America that has been a source of tragedy and persisting injustice. That history demands that we continue to learn, to listen, and to remain open to new approaches if we are to aspire always to a constitutional order in which all persons are treated with fairness and equal dignity. Were the Court to rule that the question addressed by Michigan voters is too sensitive or complex to be within the grasp of the electorate; or that the policies at issue remain too delicate to be resolved save by university officials or faculties, acting at some remove from immediate public scrutiny and control; or that these matters are so arcane that the electorate\u2019s power must be limited because the people cannot prudently exercise that power even after a full debate, that holding would be an unprecedented restriction on the exercise of a fundamental right held not just by one person but by all in common. It is the right to speak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral process.\" -- Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2016) plurality opinion",

            "article_content": "The 81-year-old Kennedy said he is stepping down after more than 30 years on the Supreme Court. After serving on the Supreme Court for more than 30 years, Justice Anthony Kennedy has announced his retirement -- leaving an open seat on the nation's highest court for President Trump to fill. Kennedy, 81, said his retirement will be effective July 31.\u00a0Last year, his former law clerk Neil Gorsuch took over the Supreme Court seat once occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Read on for a look at Kennedy's time on the nation's highest court and what's next for the vacant seat. In this Feb. 18, 1988, photo Anthony Kennedy, left, takes the constitutional oath as a Supreme Court Associate Justice from Chief Justice William Rehnquist at a White House ceremony. (AP Photo/Doug Mills) Kennedy first took his seat on the Supreme Court on February 18, 1988.\u00a0He was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. He\u2019s been a Supreme Court justice longer than any current member.\u00a0He also has joined the majority opinion of more split cases than any other justices; according to a 2015 Rolling Stone profile, Kennedy joined the majority 84 percent of the time when a case was split 5-4. By the end of his tenure, Kennedy was considered to be a swing vote on the court -- although that wasn't always the case. When he was first seated, Kennedy was considered to be part of the court's more conservative block. In 2006,\u00a0the Washington Post called\u00a0the nation's highest court \"a Supreme Court of One\" after Kennedy decided to side with the court's more left-leaning faction regarding former President George W. Bush's military tribunals for\u00a0Guantanamo Bay\u00a0detainees. WHO ARE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES? In April 2018, The New York Times' editorial board publicly asked Kennedy to avoid retiring, saying, \"Your record is more conservative than liberal, but there's no question that you are less of an ideologue than anyone President Trump would pick.\" President Trump has promised to start looking for a replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy immediately. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) In a statement regarding his retirement, the White House praised Kennedy for having \"authored landmark opinions in every significant area of constitutional law, most notably on equal protections under the law, the separation of powers and the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and religion.\" In 1992, Kennedy joined Justices David Souter and Sandra Day O'Connor in co-writing the Supreme Court's opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern\u00a0Pennsylvania v. Casey. That case upheld women's right to have an abortion but also gave states more authority in how to regulate it. In keeping with his penchant for believing in individual rights, Kennedy agreed with the court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015.\u00a0And in 1996, Kennedy wrote for the majority as the court struck down a Colorado amendment to its state constitution that prohibited local governments from enacting laws that would protect LGBT citizens. \"The right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty,\" Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion for Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which legalized gay marriage. \"The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them.\" SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT NEWS DRAWS REACTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS In 2016, Kennedy upheld the University of Texas' affirmative action program in Fisher v. University of Texas. And in Roper v. Simmons, a 2005 case, Kennedy wrote the majority for the Court in banning capital punishment for minors. \"It is proper that we acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty,\" he said then. Kennedy graduated from Harvard Law School in 1961, after having attended Stanford University and the London School of Economics. In 1962, Kennedy was admitted to the California Bar and practiced law first in San Francisco before moving back to his hometown of Sacramento. Kennedy also served as\u00a0an adjunct professor at the McGeorge School of Law for nearly 20 years, beginning in 1965, according to the Supreme Court Historical Society. Former President Gerald Ford appointed Kennedy to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1976. Kennedy grew up as a well-behaved kid. He was so well-behaved, in fact, that his father reportedly once offered him $100 if he could get himself arrested. Kennedy supposedly never collected on that bet. Kennedy also served in the Army National Guard. The 81-year-old Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said on June 27, 2018, that he is retiring after more than 30 years on the court. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) A Supreme Court vacancy will likely become a key issue in a midterm congressional election year, when control of the Senate is at stake. That body will consider Trump's latest high court nominee, requiring only a simple majority for confirmation. GOP leaders changed the rules when Neil Gorsuch was being considered, to get rid of the 60-vote procedural filibuster threshold. But Republicans only have a slight majority in the Senate -- 51-49, which includes ailing Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Trump has promised to begin the nomination process immediately, pledging to pick from a list of 25 names he started during his presidential campaign and updated last year.

            "article_content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin alleges Bill Browder business associates didn't pay taxes in Russia or the U.S. After having his name invoked in a joint press conference with President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, businessman and Magnitsky Act advocate Bill Browder boasted that he has \u201chit the Achilles' heel of the Putin regime.\u201d Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital, spoke to Fox News just minutes after Putin mentioned his name during the press conference Monday in Helsinki, Finland following his summit with Trump. \u201cWhat this shows is that my advocacy of getting Magnitsky Acts all over the world passed\u2014in seven countries\u2014has hit the Achilles' heel of the Putin regime,\u201d Browder told Fox News, referring to his push for Russia sanctions. Putin mentioned Browder while outlining a proposal to question the 12 Russian intelligence officers indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury for allegedly hacking Democratic targets during the 2016 election. Putin\u2019s plan, which Trump called an \u201cincredible offer,\u201d was to question the 12 Russians indicted for allegedly meddling in the election, allowing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team to be present -- if U.S. officials \u201creciprocate.\u201d Putin suggested this would mean Russian agents could be present for questioning U.S. officers \u201cof interest\u201d to them. \u201cSo we can bring up Mr. Browder,\u201d Putin said during the joint press conference, accusing his associates of illicit activity in Russia. \u201cI\u2019m not even an American citizen,\u201d Browder told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m a British citizen and have lived here for 29 years.\u201d Browder has worked for years to advocate on behalf of his former business associate Sergei Magnitsky. Browder had hired the late Magnitsky to uncover details of massive $230 million financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and died in Russian police custody nearly a decade ago, allegedly beaten to death. In the wake of his colleague's death, Browder advocated for the Magnitsky Act, which was first passed in the U.S. in 2012. The Magnitsky Act\u00a0brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering. FIRM BEHIND ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER ALSO WORKED FOR RUSSIA, SENATE WITNESS SAYS Browder further claimed Monday that a Putin associate benefited from the financial fraud Magnitsky uncovered and added: \u201cPutin should be interrogated for his role in that crime.\u201d Browder testified last year before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his knowledge of the controversial firm Fusion GPS. Browder, during that testimony, claimed that the company worked on the infamous anti-Trump dossier while also working \u201con behalf of the Russian government\u201d to fight the U.S. sanctions that had enraged Moscow\u2019s elite\u2014under the Magnitsky Act. FIRM WORKED ON TRUMP DOSSIER WHILE FIGHTING SANCTIONS FOR PUTIN-TIED FAMILY, KEY WITNESS SAYS Browder testified that Fusion GPS conducted a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him in a bid to fight the Magnitsky Act. Browder also testified that that campaign was orchestrated by Natalia Veselnitskaya\u2014the same Russian attorney who sought the highly scrutinized Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. \u201cThey were talking about a repeal of sanctions so that Russian torturers and murderers could keep their money in America,\u201d Browder testified. In retaliation for the U.S. passage of the law, Russia banned Americans from adopting Russian children. That June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower was billed to the Trump campaign as one to discuss Russian adoption and potentially get dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Browder testified last year that adoption was \u201ccode\u201d for talking about the Magnitsky Act.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" September 25, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: We are not the destroy Trump media. This is an important week for the country. We hope you'll stay with us. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham, who've invaded our territory in Washington, D.C. today, is live next, Laura. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, why are you up on the roof? Is that the cooler place to be? You and Martha are up on the roof and we are just in our lonely studio. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Unbelievable. HANNITY: Slow down! Slow down. There is actually a huge party going on over there. They're just playing Earth, Wind and Fire. INGRAHAM: All right, we're good. HANNITY: You complain you don't go to Singapore, you complain you don't go to Helsinki, you complain you are not on the roof, why all the whining? What's up with that? You sound to me like a liberal. INGRAHAM: I want you to do the white man dance, that kind of dance, you know, the middle-aged guys do when Earth, Wind, and Fire comes on. Come on, you got to go do that Hannity. I'm just kidding. HANNIITY: Wow. INGRAHAM: It was a great show tonight. HANNITY: Yes, that is what they call that dance, yes. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: Great show tonight Hannity. All right, everybody. Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I'm Laura Ingraham back in Washington on another very important news night. Throughout tonight's show, we're going to reveal exactly how the left is working to delegitimize the Supreme Court nominee and why the Kavanaugh battle is so important to the future of the Republican Party, the court itself, the country, and yes, to your family. Plus, breaking reports tonight on the fate of Rod Rosenstein. Congressman Jim Jordan has something to say about it all. He'll be with me later in the hour. But first, the lessons of the Kavanaugh battle. That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Well the president gave Republicans a master class in retaliating against the tactics of the left today. Undoubtedly weary of watching the daily smear storm buffeting a Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump decided it was time to do what he does best, fight back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Democrats are playing a con game, C-O-N. A con game. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible) TRUMP: They know it's a con game. They know he's high quality. And they wink at each other. They are winking. They know it's a con game. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Donald Trump is never going to be content to hang back and play defense when he sees his agenda in jeopardy. He tried that a little bit a few days last week when the Ford allegation was dropped and he won praise for being measured and presidential. That's nice, but meanwhile, his nominee was under massive left-wing assault as Republicans on the committee were bending over backwards to accommodate the accuser's demands for delays and various conditions. Well, Trump is back and not a moment too soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Is a shame that you can do this to a person's life. I will tell you, maybe even more important, who is going to want to go before this system to be a Supreme Court judge or to be a judge or to be even a politician? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's a great point. I mean, notice how he boils it all down to a stark set of facts? Facts that can be understood by all Americans. And he's unafraid -- when everyone else is telling them don't do it, don't do it -- when necessary, to counterpunch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Thirty-six years ago? Nobody ever knew about it, nobody ever heard about it? And now a new charge comes up, and she says, \"Well, it might not be him. She thinks, maybe it could have been him, maybe not. She admits that she was drunk. She admits time lapses. There were time lapses. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And he's taking the same approach on the world stage. At the U.N. today, as the global elites shifted in their chairs uncomfortably, he delivered a fiercely pro-American, pro-sovereignty message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy. America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, he is defiant. He's unapologetic, clear. We need more, not less of that today. But I want to get back to Kavanaugh because last week with Trump on the sidelines, Senate Republicans walked right into the trap set by the left-wing smear squad. So folks like Senator Flake, Collins, and Murkowski, they felt pressured to give into the MeToo militants, forcing Senate Judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley to postpone last Thursday's Kavanaugh vote. When the Democrats, though, were given an inch, they took a mile, and they began to slowly take the confirmation process hostage. And what did Republicans get for all of their cooperation and sensitivity? An extended, vicious news cycle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, D\u2014IL.: I've heard, you know, many, many predators say and refute allegations against them. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She has nothing to gain here and everything to lose, that he was a drunken, almost rapist. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And think about that. They are willing to put on the Supreme Court someone who very well may be a sexual predator. (END VIDEO CLIPS) INGRAHAM: A mob-like circus in the hallways of the Senate offices, and to now anti-Kavanaugh nasties are targeting and trying to humiliate Republican senators when they are out in public. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE/FEMALE: We believe the survivors. We believe the survivors. We believe the survivors. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I think most Americans bristle at this stuff. These uncivil tactics and slimy smears against good people I think are exposing just how radicalized, how contemptible some strains of today's Democratic Party has become. But I think there is something positive that has emerged in all of this. Republicans are beginning to see what they are capable of actually accomplishing when they work together. Without the interparty fights, the warfare interparty, they can actually do a good deal of good. I am told that President George W. Bush is making calls on Kavanaugh's behalf. And it was very encouraging to see McConnell stand firm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R\u2014K.Y., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Justice matters. Evidence matters. Facts matter. Vague, unsubstantiated, and uncorroborated allegations of 30 plus-year-old misconduct where all the supposed witnesses either totally deny it or can't confirm it is nowhere near grounds to nullify someone's career or destroy their good name. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Amen. And it's about time all Republicans called this out, what they have done to Brett Kavanaugh for what it is. It's a total disgrace. But the Democrats of course conveniently look the other way when their heroes are accused of rape, abuse of interns, and even when they leave a woman to die in five feet of water. But Kavanaugh, with no criminal record and no pattern of abusive conduct, must be destroyed at all cost. A lot of you may not know that Texas senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, the new darling of the left, actually has a criminal record, including a DWI and a burglary arrest but no big deal. OK, come on. At least he condemned what happened to Ted Cruz last night. That was nice. Negotiating with terrorists, we hear that it's always a bad idea, almost always. By doing so, what do you get? You get more terrorism. It is good that the GOP has not given into this rabid mob mentality because to do so would have only emboldened the worst instincts of the left. Senator Grassley's decision to schedule the Kavanaugh committee vote this Friday in the morning is another positive development tonight. If the GOP continues to fight for fairness and justice in the way that Trump has on issue after issue, we may not only see a Justice Kavanaugh. We may just hold the majority come November. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me with reaction, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in New York and here with me on set, chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp and Democratic strategist and University of Maryland professor Jason Nichols. Jason. JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes. INGRAHAM: Take it away. NICHOLS: Well, I think there are a couple of things that you said that were really important. Number one, that the president definitely fights for his agenda but he doesn't always fight for the American people. And that is a big problem. I think also there is precedent for doing a full investigation. There is no reason to rush this process. I 100 percent believe in due process, Laura. I believe that Brett Kavanaugh deserves 100 percent to be able to clear his name if he is not guilty of these crimes. INGRAHAM: How does he clear his name here? NICHOLS: Well, he gets a full investigation so that one day when his daughters go and Google this, they can see our father was not guilty -- INGRAHAM: Oh, really? That's what they're going to Google? Because guess what, when we Google various conservative names right now, including mine, the nastiest, nastiest things come up. That is why I don't Google anymore. NICHOLS: Hey, nasty things come up -- INGRAHAM: Guess what -- but there is no clearing your name. That is the old Ray Donovan line from the -- where do I go to get my reputation back? That's what Ray Donovan famously said. He was cleared. He never really did get his reputation back. MATT SCHALPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Look, Laura, I think we actually -- INGRAHAM: Hold on. We got to go. SCHLAPP: I think we actually will settle this at the ballot box. I completely agree with what you said in your opener because this has all become intertwined. You have Republicans around this country that are distrustful of what their party will do when it comes to a fight and I agree with you. They are standing firm, Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell. They are doing the right thing. I actually think the Republicans realize, if they boggle, if they bungled us, if they dropped the ball when it comes to Kavanaugh, there will be a meltdown in November. And I think these Republican senators understand, this is the time to stick together and keep your promise and get it done or the Republicans will have a revolt. INGRAHAM: The base is going to revolt. The base will be in revolt. SCHLAPP: I'm not sure it comes back if it happens. INGRAHAM: They said it on my radio show. They've said it to us in tweets. If the Republicans cannot get Brett Kavanaugh through, Pam Bondi, a Bush guy, who is about as middle-of-the-road as a juror, fair, respected, then who will they going to get through? I mean, he was the consensus pick for Republicans. He wasn't, you know, a couple other people that were on the list who were considered more conservative. He was a Bush guy. And so Bush is picking up the phone and he's calling people and saying, guys, this is ridiculous, what has happened to him. Pam, I want to play for you something that John Clune, Deborah Ramirez, the second accuser's attorney said today with I think it was on, yes, Anderson Cooper. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: If there is no FBI investigation and it was just a matter of submitting testimony and evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee, to committee investigators, that is not something you recommend that your client do? JOHN CLUNE, ATTORNEY FOR DEBORAH RAMIREZ: I wouldn't recommend that you do that, no. That kind of cross examination cannot be a replacement for a meaningful investigation. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Pam, you are a state attorney general. If you care about getting all the facts out, get them out as any way you can. I mean, it's a little late in the game to be entering third and fourth witnesses. \"New York Times\" wouldn't even go with this story. Your thoughts on what his concern is, though? PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA: Well, I mean it's the 11th hour, it's ridiculous. And good try Jason on the due process. As Laura said, I've been a prosecutor since my early 20s and you know, due process, the rule of law is being unraveled here if they get away with this. It's about the presumption of innocence. Ramirez, there is nothing to even confirm her story. She can't even confirm that it's Brett Kavanaugh. This is a good man and thank goodness he has a strong wife and it's a shame that his daughters even have to endure this. You know, really, it sunk to a new low for all of us to have to listen to this, and this good man. I know him, Matt, you know him much better than I. Laura, you've known him. And to serve in public office, when it sinks to this low, to serve your country, and give back these vicious attacks, it's despicable. INGRAHAM: Jason, I want to go back to this idea of what you do in college. You are a professor. Kids in your classes go out in a weekends, have fun, yes? NICHOLS: Sure. INGRAHAM: They go have fun and probably drink a little bit, right. They're probably under 21. NICHOLS: Sure. INGRAHAM: Do you think 30 years from now, when they are for a big job, maybe in the military, maybe they go to some CEO of some company, that one person with no corroboration should be able to stop one of your students from getting a job? Do you think that would be fair, you have to prove your innocence? NICHOLS: Again, I think that what's fair -- what's fair is if they are accused of sexually assaulting somebody, that there is an investigation, and that is all the people are asking. INGRAHAM: OK, so one person they could do -- NICHOLS: But there's more than -- Laura, there is more than one person. There is more than one person. SCHLAPP: No, no, no. INGRAHAM: No, no, no. NICHOLS: No, it's not. Laura, it's not. INGRAHAM: There is no corroboration -- NICHOLS: If there is a whole lot of shaming of Ramirez because, oh, she was drunk. First of all, 50 percent of sexual assaults involve alcohol. INGRAHAM: No, I'm not shaming anyone. NICHOLS: Well then there is more than one person. INGRAHAM: No, no, no. I'm not shaming anyone. NICHOLS: Let's not say there's no -- INGRAHAM: I'm not shaming anyone. I have no doubt that something did happen, probably to both of them. I have no reason not to believe that. But what I will say is that any man, a brother, a husband, a father, a cousin, this could happen to any man in the United States. Of course there are sexual assaults and of course there is. There is no due process -- due process isn't having to prove your innocence. That is innocent until you are proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. That is not the standard. NICHOLS: I want law enforcement to do an investigation. SCHLAPP: But they have. No, no, no, they have. I want to take this head on because he's had six FBI full background checks. Half of his life, he has had the FBI checking everything about him. When they do those background investigations, they check everybody in your past life. They want to make sure you can't be blackmailed. They want to make sure there is nothing serious that will compromise your ability to do the job. That was all done. And the fact this is this, Joe Biden said it during the Clarence Thomas hearings. The FBI simply gives us what she says and what he says, and at the end of the day, we will learn nothing more if the FBI spends one more minute -- (CROSSTALK) NICHOLS: So a three-day investigation is going to cause a problem? That's what happened with Anita Hill. SCHLAPP: You will learn nothing new. NICHOLS: There was a three-day investigation. SCHLAPP: It's the Senate. NICHOLS: Then give it to him. SCHLAPP: It's the Senate's job at a confirmation. They have lawyers on both parties. It's their job to do the investigation. INGRAHAM: I mean, no one\u2026 idea that people are interested in getting out the truth here, this is an all-out smear of a good man. NICHOLS: I have nothing against Brett Kavanaugh. INGRAHAM: I'm not saying you do. I'm just saying this process is not geared toward finding the truth because we know -- how many of us could figure out, what did I do 36 years ago? (CROSSTALK) NICHOLS: The right trots out Juanita Broaddrick every five minutes and that is probably 45-years-old. And I believe she -- SCHLAPP: Don't go after her. That's not-- (CROSSTALK) SCHLAPP: Let's not do that. NICHOLS: -- the right to the same thing. INGRAHAM: Right, well, she didn't get it. She didn't get it. She was laughed off. (CROSSTALK) NICHOLS: I agree! INGRAHAM: Guys, and Pam, I want you to respond to this. There was a guest on CNN today, Yodit Tewolde, talking about the comparison between Bill Cosby and Kavanaugh. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YODIT TEWOLDE, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: This is a monumental defining moment this week, when you have someone like Cosby going to prison and then in the same breath having Kavanaugh possibly going to the highest court in the land, and so anyone that's defending Kavanaugh could not in the same breath now apply this. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Pam, take it away on that. BONDI: I can't believe that they would even use those two names in the same sentence. Bill Cosby is an accused rapist. Brett Kavanaugh has devoted his entire life to serving others and the rule of law. They are attempting to destroy a good man. This case does not warrant any investigation, none whatsoever. There is no corroboration. That is why the FBI won't look at it. There is nothing there, as Matt said, he's gone through six FBI background checks. And if anyone can come forward -- Jason, if someone tried to say this about you, it would be disgusting and despicable. There is no corroboration at all. Nothing. NICHOLS: Well then why not bring in Mark Judge, why not bring in people -- I'm not -- BONDI: There is nothing to go forward. Nothing left at all. INGRAHAM: I think the Democrats better watch out because if they want to go down this road for every nominee -- BONDI: Bring it on. INGRAHAM: -- tables are going to be turned and you better be starting to\u2026 what you did in eighth grade, guys. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: You cannot put every man in the target zone. It's not fair. And real victims of sexual assault have also spoken out against this, saying it hurts our cause. So it plays both ways. Passion is a very high on this issue. Fantastic panel, as always, gentlemen and Pam, thanks so much. And in a latest stall tactic by the Democrats, they are bristling at this Republican suggestion that a sex trauma expert question Christine Blasey Ford this Thursday. Republicans though are rightfully pushing back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS, D\u2014DEL.: By hiring an outside attorney who is a specialist in such crimes of prosecution, this will turn into a trial of Dr. Ford being conducted by someone they have hired. MCCONNELL: We want this hearing to be handled very professionally, not a political sideshow, like you saw put on by the Democrats when they were questioning Judge Kavanaugh. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now on why this could be the right move for the GOP, former sex crimes prosecutor, Nicole Debord. Nicole, the \"Washington Post\" is reporting that Rachel Mitchell, she's an Arizona County sex crimes prosecutor, could well be selected to question Dr. Ford. Now, why could this be actually a good idea in your opinion given what is at stake here? NICOLE DEBORD, FORMER SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR: Well, why not have someone who is familiar with the issues and these types of cases ask the questions that people have been trained over the years in handling these cases to anticipate? That way, everyone will have the answers to whatever questions they may think of as it relates to this issue during the hearing, as opposed to after. Hey, why didn't we ask this? Why didn't we ask that? By bringing in an expert who knows the kind of questions that come up in these cases, we will know it at the hearing. INGRAHAM: Yes, I mean, each senator only gets five minutes so why would they want to waste the time trying to figure out which direction to go in when a sex crimes prosecutor can see the signs of trauma. It is very curious to me by the Democrats, many of them who have already declared this a crime, wouldn't want to someone who prosecutes these crimes to do the questioning. It's almost as if they want the visual of the men interrogating a victim or an alleged victim. By the way, a letter for Michael Bromwich, who is Ford's lawyer, one of her lawyers, said the following. \"This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. Neither Dr. Ford nor Judge Kavanaugh is on trial. The goal should be to develop the relevant facts, not try a case.\" Your reaction to that, Nicole? DEBORD: How better to develop the relevant facts than to have somebody who tries these cases all the time, asking the questions that the people would want to hear the answers to. It can't be a mistake to have somebody who handles these cases regularly ask the types of questions that you would experience in court. Now, I recognize that this is not a criminal trial, but it is an allegation of a serious nature and it's the kind of allegation that this particular proposed questionnaire has asked and has asked questions about on many occasions. So to me it seems like a no-brainer. Have somebody with experience as opposed to somebody who really knows about politics more than they know about these types of trials ask the questions. INGRAHAM: I mean, if everybody wants to take it out of the political realm, great. I think it's a great idea. Thank you so much, Nicole. And up next, who is funding the protester groups that are swarming Washington? They want to take down Brett Kavanaugh, but who's putting the money up? An \"Ingraham Angle\" investigation followed by a woman who actually came to D.C. after she got an email from one of these groups. She is with us. Stay right there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: OK, who is exactly behind promoting these occupations and protests against Judge Kavanaugh? We have an \"Ingraham Angle\" investigation for you tonight. The Women's March has been at the forefront of the anti-Trump movement, as we all know, day after inauguration and the big protest. And are taking the lead now, stating just today, \"We are organizing an impactful, non-arrest, direct action to make sure that the Senate knows that #WeBelieveChristine and demand that they #CancelKavanaugh and vote no on his confirmation.\" The Women's March group counts Planned Parenthood and Natural Resources Defense Council as their premier partners. Both groups have actively opposed Kavanaugh since he was announced. Now, those groups take on significance because of their association with George Soros. According to an extensive study by the Media Research Center, 100 of the 544 Women's March partners have received a total of $246 -- am I reading this right -- 637,217 from Soros at last count. It's Trump change. Here to react, Triana Arnold James, is an anti-Kavanaugh protestor from Georgia who learned of the D.C. protest from a Woman's March email. Along with the contributing editor of \"The American Spectator,\" Jeffrey Lord, and Dave Bossie, former Trump campaign co-chair and president of Citizens United. Great to have you all on tonight. This is a big week for Washington and the court and Triana, I am so glad you came on tonight. So, walk us through how you found out about what was happening here. TRIANA ARNOLD JAMES, ANTI-KAVANAUGH PROTESTOR: Well, I have always been an advocate. And so through advocating and volunteering with the Women's March and other organizations, not just the Women's March, you know, you get the emails, you get the updates, you find out what is going on, and so when I found out that they were going to be here in Washington, D.C., I came from Georgia. INGRAHAM: So you just came on your own time and you are staying in a hotel? JAMES: I'm staying at a hotel. INGRAHAM: You're paying your own hotel here. JAMES: Yes. I'm not a paid protester. INGRAHAM: OK. And when you come here, do you get -- do you get like instructions like where to go? Because I know a lot of people are at St. Stephen's church, not too far from here, but -- the meet up places, how do that work? JAMES: Yes. There's meetings and trainings that let you know, you know, what to do, what not to do and things like that. And so it's very organized, and it's very good to be with everyone. INGRAHAM: What you do for a living when you're not doing this? JAMES: I'm retired, I'm a veteran. INGRAHAM: Fantastic. And what about Kavanaugh do you not like? What do you know about him? What do you not like? JAMES: Well, I don't have anything personally against him. I just think that this is a bad look for America. I think that he has not been forthcoming and I don't believe that we need another Clarence Thomas situation on the highest -- INGRAHAM: I clerked for Clarence Thomas. If you knew him, you would love him. He's a great person. JAMES: And I'm pretty sure he is a great guy. I'm pretty sure he's a great guy. INGRAHAM: I'm going to convince Triana. By the time the end of the segment, I'm convincing you because Triana is too cool. She has 12 kids she's raised with her husband, OK, eight boys -- JAMES: Eight boys, four girls. INGRAHAM: OK, eight boys. What could happen to eight boys? DAVID BOSSIE, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS UNITED: $250 million. They should take care of her hotel. INGRAHAM: Yes, like what the heck? Take care of Triana. JAMES: No, I didn't know that was -- INGRAHAM: I think they got a little help for that hotel room. BOSSIE: George Soros -- it's not surprising that George Soros us behind this. George Soros paid for the fake dossier. Paid Glenn Simpson in Fusion GPS so, he's connected throughout all of the left-wing activities in this country and around the world. It doesn't surprise me. What I would like to see, maybe a little consistency from these protesters. Maybe they can go out and talk about Cory Booker as a groper or maybe they could talk about Keith Ellison, you know, battering his girlfriend or may be, you know, Senator Carper from Delaware who beat his wife. Maybe we can have a conversation that's a lot bigger than just some unfounded, quite honestly, with no evidence to back it up, no corroboration, no witnesses against poor Brett Kavanaugh. These same Democratic senators are saying that he is guilty until proven innocent. That is not how we are supposed to do this. INGRAHAM: No, and I've got to say this, some of the criminal justice stuff that is being done, actually President Trump is actually moving on this issue -- BOSSIE: Yes. INGRAHAM: -- I think they are actually making interesting coalitions with minority groups and others who normally don't look at the Republican Party in a very charitable way. But part of what is bringing them together is this idea that prosecutors are overzealous and are convicting people who really don't have a shot at either defending themselves or convicting them before they have really had an opportunity to put on the kind of evidence they need to. So it's interesting that these groups are kind of turning on -- BOSSIE: There's a backlash coming. INGRAHAM: -- I don't think it's a sense of fairness. JAMES: Well, I don't think -- INGRAHAM: -- hold on one second. Jeffrey Lord, you have done and actually you have experience in this because of your work in another judicial confirmation that involved a similar type of swarm. Tell us about it. JEFFREY LORD, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR: Yes, yes. My best friend from college was Judge D. Brooks Smith who is now the Third Circuit chief judge, Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He was the Reagan chief judge of the western district. In 2001, when President Bush 43 picked him to go to the Third Circuit, and they did exactly what they did to Robert Bork and what they are doing here. And the thing you've got to -- you always have to gauge the groups behind the scene. For example, one senator had 21 of his 28 questions submitted to Judge Smith that I tracked down where word for word in some cases, from internal memos that we got a hold of from one of these interest groups. They are very, very powerful. And there were 27 of them who arranged -- who orchestrated against Judge Smith. And they give stories to the press which \"The Washington Post\" published. They do all of these kind of things, and it's a real serious problem. And what we are seeing here are Democratic senators basically, what you can't see are the groups behind these Democratic senators that are pulling the strings, which they are doing. And George Soros as a matter of fact paid for one of those groups in 2002. INGRAHAM: Open Society Foundation has an enormous amount of money. A huge amount of money. They can spend it anyway they want. That's the law. If they want to give money to Planned Parenthood, want to give money to National Resource Defense Council, they want to give money to the Women's March, he can do it. We are the Republicans. The Republicans have to have their own groups like this. BOSSIE: We are. We are outgunned. They have a very dedicated, Tom Steyer, George Soros, and their leftwing billionaires -- INGRAHAM: They want to rock this vote the midterms. They want to rock this vote. BOSSIE: They do, and elections do have consequences, and we need to make sure that our people turn out in November. INGRAHAM: Triana, last word to you -- LORD: The one thing, if this backfires -- INGRAHAM: Well, there might be signs it's already backfiring. Triana, what do you hope to accomplish with your time here? ARNOLD: I hope to accomplish that he receives a \"no\" vote. And I understand you say poor Brett, but what about Dr. Ford? What about Ms. Ramirez -- BOSSIE: She is going to get her opportunity on Thursday. JAMES: Right. And so that is all we are asking for, that an accurate FBI investigation be conducted. Mr. Kavanaugh has not been forthcoming -- INGRAHAM: What you mean he's not been forthcoming? JAMES: For example, he has not been forthcoming with everything about his past. INGRAHAM: What his past -- he's been in public service for almost three decades. BOSSIE: Six background checks. JAMES: That's a problem. INGRAHAM: That's the problem? JAMES: If you are a judge, wouldn't you want to see the evidence? Wouldn't you want to hear all sides? INGRAHAM: Do you know what you were doing 36 years ago? I don't know what the heck I was doing. JAMES: I actually do. I actually do know what was doing 36 years ago. INGRAHAM: What were you doing? JAMES: I was a child model for a company -- INGRAHAM: But if someone comes along and said, you did this, you were a child model, you did this, and you are like, no, I didn't. No one is corroborating the person accusing you. Where to go to get your good name back? You don't go anywhere because -- JAMES: So why can't he ask for an FBI's investigation in order to get his name back? BOSSIE: That's not his job, and that's not the FBI's job. And we learned that from Clarence Thomas. JAMES: And I'm not backed by George Soros. I don't know him. So I don't have any connection to him. BOSSIE: Thank you, Joe Biden. JAMES: But I just think we need to take a polygraph, do an FBI -- INGRAHAM: Polygraphs aren't admissible in court for a reason. Guys, we're out of time. Ahead, a former FBI official reacts to the idea Triana is putting forth that the agency could somehow get to bottom of these charges against Kavanaugh. Is that realistic, and could that ever really happen? More than three decades ago? Plus Frank Luntz tells us why the Democrats tactics might be backfiring. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The Kavanaugh accusations lacking all corroboration were purported to have taken place over 35 years ago. Yet still the calls for the FBI involvement continue you heard from our previous segment. Now, I wonder what prominent Democrats, say, former vice presidents, were saying that during the Clarence Thomas hearings? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: If the next person that refers to an FBI report as being worth anything obviously doesn't understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period. Period. The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you wouldn't like it if we did, because it is inconclusive. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: \"Period, period.\" Don't we just love Biden. He's the gift that keeps on giving. Please run in 2020. Here to react, Bill Gavin, former assistant director of the FBI in New York. Bill, we've all been having fun with this tape today. It was back on tape back then. But it is the talking point of the activists. I think they get their sheet of talking points, bullet point, bullet point, all we want is an FBI investigation. Bill, what's the truth about what the FBI could do here? BILL GAVIN, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR OF NEW YORK: it's so crazy. I just don't understand, everybody wants an FBI investigation. An investigation of what? A criminal investigation? You want the FBI to go stick their nose into someplace where they have absolutely no jurisdiction? There is no predicate offense for the FBI to look at? That doesn't make any sense. Now, is there any -- nobody is going to deny that maybe something happened to Dr. Ford and I don't want to be de minimis of that. But let's face it, there is nothing for the FBI to look at from a forensic point of view. There has been no allegation, there has been no complaint filed by Dr. Ford locally where the FBI could go back and look at these reports and see what's in there. Nothing they can do. INGRAHAM: Bill, but clearly Senator Gillibrand knows a lot more about investigating then you do. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D\u2014N.Y.: A Fox News interview is not the same as an FBI interview. And if he's willing to talk to Fox News about his views, I don't understand why he's unwilling to talk to the FBI so they can do a proper investigation. He said over and over again, he wants a fair hearing. Well, a fair hearing means you have an FBI that investigates the facts. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Bill, take it away, final thoughts. GAVIN: How anybody that is allegedly educated and has worked themselves into the position to be in the Senate can have such an inane assumption is crazy. I don't understand what they are saying, and they don't understand the complexity of what has to be done in something like this. INGRAHAM: Bill, it's a talking point. GAVIN: Laura, the investigation should be of the despicable, horrible, unethical performance of Senator Dianne not-so-Feinstein. This is ridiculous what she wants done. She held that letter for, what, 45 days? Then redacted it in such a way to make it look like it would support her point of view. She offed for Dr. Ford, who she promised to maintain her anonymity, she offed her because it was her own good. INGRAHAM: You know what I want, and Bill, thanks so much. I want an investigation of who leaked that letter. Who got that out? It's not her office, oh, really? OK. Let's investigate that, shall we? Bill, thanks so much. And the conventional is that this Kavanaugh fight must hurt the GOP with suburban women in the midterms, right? But is that the case? For answers, let's bring in polling guru Frank Luntz. So Frank, how is this all playing out across the country? FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: Everyone is paying attention to it. So in the process of moving for the session on Thursday, and I have a higher percentage who say that they are extremely or very interested in any issue since Donald Trump was elected. Everyone is going to be watching, although I actually hear that it's possible she won't show up on Thursday. INGRAHAM: I'm betting she doesn't show up. LUNTZ: So something to consider. And women are paying attention to it. The key for Republicans, it was smart for them to go to outside counsel. It was smart for them to have a woman asking the questions because you knew that the Democrats were going to demonize whatever the Republicans did. That said, the GOP has to be careful about what they say and how they say it. INGRAHAM: Apparently, they're not going to say anything because there is going to be an outside prosecutor. Now the Democrats are complaining about that. Regarding polling, might, at some point, doesn't it appear to be obvious that this entire thing was strung out in order for Ronan and Mayer and Avenatti and the dial in accuser squad came around and try to find other people who were allegedly in some way harmed by Brett Kavanaugh, isn't that kind of becoming obvious to people? LUNTZ: But what the Democrats didn't realize is that the closer this goes to the election, the more likely the Republican base says, I hate this, I'm going to vote, I'm going to participate. I actually think if they manage to delay the vote to the middle or the end of October, the Democrats will lose a seat or two because of it, because every Trump will vote. INGRAHAM: The favorability of the Republican Party is the highest it's been in seven years, 45 percent, to 44 percent Democrats. Is it just the economy, part of this factoring in perhaps? LUNTZ: And I just finished a survey, and I found the Republican numbers to be within two points of the Democrats and I thought it was wrong. So something is happening out there. And I will give one explanation. Donald Trump is talking about issues that nobody talks about. I'll give an example. Prescription drugs, prescription drug companies. Trump is actually saying that he is going to hold the companies accountable for how much they charge the American people. When is the last time the GOP had the guts to say that these medications cost too much and the prescription drug companies -- INGRAHAM: Free marketers don't like that. LUNTZ: And he's standing up to China. We have an amazing economy right now, unemployment at record lows, more money in people's pockets. INGRAHAM: He's laughed at the U.N. kind of, but I think he handled it really well. He said I didn't expect that reaction. It was a great moment for Trump. But the fact that the elites at the U.N. are kind of sneering at him and shifting in their seats, I don't think that sits well with the American public. I think they stand up for the president when the global elites sneer at him. They sneered at Reagan. LUNTZ: But let's balance this, because the Democrats are still more interested in the election, and they are still more likely to vote. The Republicans still faces an uphill battle to keep the House. INGRAHAM: Is it possible that Kavanaugh gets on the court, that encourages Republicans, gets them more excited about turning out? LUNTZ: The later that the vote comes, the more excited the GOP becomes. INGRAHAM: Very interesting. So it might cut against when people want to come get him on the court fast but drag it out. Frank, thanks so much. LUNTZ: Thank you. INGRAHAM: And some breaking news tonight on the fate of Rod Rosenstein. Congressman Jim Jordan is here next on that. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: A lot of news tonight. What a difference 24 hours can make. Reports tonight that we may not have seen the last of Rod Rosenstein. The deputy attorney general was apparently ready to quit yesterday but was worried about Trump coming after him, and today sources are telling \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Washington Post\" that he will survive at least until after the midterms. If he is indeed saying my next guest wants him in front of Congress before the week is out. Joining me know, Congressman Jim Jordan. Your reaction to these reports? And we have another piece of news that we're going to talk about in a moment as well. REP. JIM JORDAN, R\u2014OHIO, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: That's up to the White House. Here's what I know. You got the guy who in effect is running the Department of Justice who in front of subordinates is talking about recording the commander in chief. That is never supposed -- do we really want that to happen in the United States of America? The same guy who fired Comey, the same guy who hired Mueller, the same guy who signed the third FISA renewal, the same guy who threatened a House Intelligence Committee staffer and the same guy who has made it difficult for us to get the documents we need is now inside meeting, according to \"The New York Times,\" threatening to actually record -- INGRAHAM: A joke. It's a joke. It's sarcastic. JORDAN: I don't care. INGRAHAM: This is a set up. They say it's a set up for the president, fire him and it's going to be a -- JORDAN: If the president fires him or not, what we are saying is, you need to come in front of the Judiciary Committee and answer our questions. The America people need to know what took place. Who was in that meeting? Was Andy McCabe in that meeting? Was Lisa Page, was Peter Strzok? INGRAHAM: It's in the case notes, right, it's in the case notes? JORDAN: So McCabe must have been there, but who else was there? We need to talk to those people as well. So this is the kind of thing that, again, when you are the guy running the Justice Department, which is what Rod Rosenstein is in effect doing, you can't be making statements like that, even if you are joking around. I want to know who was in the room and what took place. INGRAHAM: There's another report tonight that Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte from Oversight and Judiciary have invited Loretta Lynch, former attorney general, Sally Yates, former acting attorney general, and I think one of the person -- Jim Comey -- to come back to testify on Capitol Hill. They sent out letters, \"Politico\" is reporting tonight. JORDAN: That's good. I think it's going to take more than an invitation. I think it's going to take a subpoena. INGRAHAM: They're not going to stroll up and say what you need? JORDAN: Of course not. INGRAHAM: I want Susan Rice back. I actually want her on Capitol Hill. I want the unmasking. JORDAN: We know next week, Jim Baker, former chief counsel at the FBI, was demoted then left the FBI. The former chief counsel is going to be in for a deposition. That's important next Wednesday and then in a couple weeks, October 19th, we have Nellie Ohr. INGRAHAM: Oh, Nellie. JORDAN: Wife of top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. INGRAHAM: This is the first time. JORDAN: First time, so that is important as well. But again, it may take subpoenas for them to be there so we can get the questions answered that we need answered. INGRAHAM: This is what Adam Schiff on MSNBC said last night about the GOP, basically you, and the rule of law. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D\u2014CALIF., RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Right now we need to be sounding the alarm. And we need to be calling out the Republican members of Congress who have been all too timid and at times complicit with the president's attacks on the rule of law. The speaker at the Senate leader cannot plausibly claim anymore, if they ever could, that the prospect of interfering with the special counsel is theoretical. It's real. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Focusing on the special counsel deal. They are all worried about protecting the special counsel. They are not worried about protecting the rule of law but they are worried about protecting the special counsel. JORDAN: Rule of law? Remember what took place here. The Clinton campaign paid for the dossier, a piece of garbage document. They took that document, dressed it all up to a secret court to get a warrant to go spy on a fellow citizen associated with the Trump campaign. Using one party's opposition document to go spy on the other party. And he is talking about we're infringing or hurting the rule of law? That is why we are focused on this. The kind of thing that took place there should never have it in this country and we know that it did. That is why we need Rod Rosenstein in front of us to answer questions about all this. That is why we need Lynch, Comey, all these people -- INGRAHAM: Simpson has also been invited apparently, according to the political reporting, Glenn Simpson. JORDAN: I think Glenn Simpson said something to the Intelligence Committee that is not square with what Bruce Ohr told us in his deposition. I think he has got some real concerns, and he should be in front of us as well. INGRAHAM: Jim Jordan, we're going to be following this very closely. Thanks for the update. And up next, my message to all you parents about the terrible lessons that this Kavanaugh mess is teaching our children. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Among the many ill effects of the Kavanaugh saga are the twisted lessons that some young people might glean from it. Among them, men are presumed guilty when accused by a woman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HALLIE JACKSON, MSNBC HOST: Do you believe Judge Kavanaugh does deserve a presumption of innocence are not? SEN. MAZIE HIRONO, D\u2014HI.: We are not in a court of law. We are actually in a court of credibility at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Number two, boys should fear or even avoid close relationships with girls or young women in high school and in college. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think there's lots of questionable things that went on -- I think there's a lot of people that would be interested in protecting graduates of Georgetown Prep. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And if you are man, no matter how hard you work, how much you succeed, how devoted you are to equality, uncorroborated allegations can derail your next job or your next promotion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The easiest pathway here for Republicans and for Kavanaugh is for him to withdraw. Don't take this controversy to a court that he holds so dear, the highest court in the land. Withdraw. Have Trump nominate somebody. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And finally, character assassination is justified so long as it serves the left's ends. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC HOST: If they go through a Senate hearing at it becomes a circus, they push it through, he passes, he's seated on the Supreme Court, there will be, as we said last week, an asterisk next to his name as long as he is there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Actually, the asterisk will be next to the names of once respected journalists who degraded their reputations to defame a good man. It's up to each of us to defend our sons, brothers, and your husbands to make sure that a travesty like this does not happen again. And remember, women can be wrongly accused as well. We'll be right back with my response to Jimmy Kimmel's sleazy Kavanaugh commentary. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Time now for the last bite. On last night's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" the comedian offered this trenchant analysis of the Kavanaugh fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: I think there's a compromise here. And hear me out on this. So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK. In return, we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone. (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I suppose you can take the boy out of \"The Man Show,\" but you can't take \"The Man Show\" out of the boy. He seems to have a real obsession here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIMMEL: This game show is called guess is in my pants. Now, I've stuffed something in my pants, and you are allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants. You'll have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants. You ready? Go. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: At least we know what Jimmy's favorite clothing line is. Do you get the joke? I think.

(Youtube) A Maryland Democrat running for Congress decried the lack of female doctors in the House and promised to tackle widespread \"mansplaining\" on healthcare if elected. Nadia Hashimi, a pediatrician and author, is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination to replace Rep. John Delaney, D-Md. Delaney is leaving his seat to run for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020. In her first official 30-second ad announcing her campaign for Maryland's 6th District, Hashimi says Congress has \"too many multimillionaires and politicians \u2018mansplaining\u2019 health care.\" \u201cIs there a female doctor in the house?\u201d the ad's narrator asks. The camera cuts to what is apparently her home. \u201cThere is in this house.\u201d The ad then shows a picture of U.S. Capitol, with the narrator saying there are \"zero female doctors\u201d in this house. Hashimi said, if elected, she will protect Planned Parenthood, combat opioid addiction, ban assault weapons and fight for affordable healthcare and prescription drugs. According to The\u00a0Washington Post, Hashimi disclosed that she earned over $350,000 last year and has over $1 million in investments. Her husband, a neurosurgeon, earned over $680,000 last year. She claimed her bid for U.S. Congress is different because she's not aligned with \u201cBig Pharma.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re getting at are the kinds of people who are making decisions around health care who have corporate interests, which I don\u2019t have,\u201d she told the paper. Hashimi will have to fight off seven other Democrats running for the seat. The winner of the June Democratic primary will then face one of the Republican candidates, which include Lisa Lloyd, a nurse practitioner. The seat is considered to be deep-blue as Rep. Delaney won the reelection in 2016 by a 16-point margin.",

            "article_content": "President Trump makes remarks on immigration laws, family separation at his Make America Great Again rally in Kentucky. During a campaign rally in Richmond, Kentucky, Saturday night, President Trump spoke before a crown in support of\u00a0Republican Rep. Andy Barr and slammed\u00a0Democrats, at one point accusing the party of being \"totally consumed by their chilling lust for power.\" Barr, who has held his seat in Congress for three terms, is going head-to-head\u00a0with Democrat Amy McGrath in midterm voting next month. If Democrats win seats in the upcoming midterm elections and take office, \"all they'll do is obstruct,\" Trump said, while touting the country's status under his party. \"Under Republican leadership, America is booming, it\u2019s thriving. America is winning again because we are finally putting America first,\" Trump said. When people head to the polls in November, he\u00a0said the country \"faces a simple choice.\" \"You can either vote for Democrat mob rule or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom and justice,\" he said. Over the course of the rally, the president was joined on stage by Barr, who he said was \"a great man\" and \"a great congressman,\" and fellow Republican Kentucky lawmakers Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Mitch McConnell. Trump praised Paul and McConnell for supporting Brett Kavanaugh all through his nomination process for the Supreme Court, despite sexual misconduct allegations against him. Kavanaugh denied the accusations. Of Kavanaugh, who was sworn in to the nation's highest court last weekend, Trump said that \"never has a man been treated so badly.\" \"What the crazy, radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace,\" Trump said. \"They were on a mission to obstruct, resist, delay, demolish and destroy. The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power.\" Trump kicked off the rally saying that earlier Saturday,\u00a0\"we celebrated another tremendous victory\" when he \"welcomed home\" recently freed American pastor Andrew Brunson, who visited the Oval Office\u00a0earlier Saturday. Brunson was released from house arrest in Turkey on Friday after being imprisoned since October 2016 over\u00a0alleged ties to an outlawed group. The arrest was part of a crackdown on a failed coup against Turkish President Recep Erdogan\u2019s government. A Turkish judge on Friday ordered the pastor freed\u00a0after sentencing him to time served on terror and treason charges. Trump said Brunson was now back in the U.S. with his family and thanked Erdogan, adding that the two countries will likely \"establish a terrific relationship.\" In continuing his attack on Democrats, Trump claimed\u00a0that they want to get rid of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and \"want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs.\" \"Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens,\" Trump said. \"Republicans stand proudly with the heroes of ICE\u00a0and border patrol and law enforcement.\" The U.S. has \"the dumbest immigration laws in the world,\" Trump said, adding that \"we're getting them changed.\" \"We need some more Republicans, we need some votes,\" he said. Ahead of the rally, Trump backed Barr on Twitter, calling him a \u201cfantastic guy.\u201d \u201cStrong on Crime, Tax Cuts, Military, Vets & 2nd A,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cHis opponent will NEVER vote for us, only for Pelosi. Andy has my Strongest Endorsement!!! See you in Kentucky.\u201d The Democratic Party has focused on Barr\u2019s seat in its drive to regain control of the House. Former Vice President Joe Biden rallied for McGrath on Friday in Owingsville, stressing the significance of the midterm vote. \u201cThis election is bigger than politics,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": " In a House Oversight Committee\u00a0hearing\u00a0earlier this year, I asked Dr. Bret Weinstein, a professor at Evergreen State College in Washington state, a question: \u201cIn a \u2018safe space\u2019 (on a college campus) could you say this sentence? \u2018Donald Trump is president.\u2019\u201d His response \u2013 unbelievable as it sounds \u2013 began with \u201cwell, it depends.\u201d I stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact,\u201d I said. There\u2019s no \u201cit depends\u201d about it. Donald Trump was elected as president of the United States on Nov. 8, 2016 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. No amount of \u201csafe space\u201d pretending can change that fact. The exchange with Weinstein highlights the level of absurdity we have now reached in America. Simply stating a fact on a university campus \u2013 where students go to learn facts \u2013 could land you in trouble and result in disciplinary action. And unfortunately, the attack on free speech is not limited to colleges and universities. The federal government has also attacked the free speech rights of Americans. For example, over a period of many years the Internal Revenue Service systematically targeted people for their political beliefs. Under the First Amendment we have several fundamental rights. But the most vital is our right to free speech. And when our nation\u2019s founders wrote the First Amendment, they were particularly concerned about our right to speak in a political fashion. In America we have the right to criticize the government and not be harassed for doing so, yet that is exactly what the Internal Revenue Service did when it targeted conservative speech. But while government and academia have attacked free speech, the biggest threat may be large social media companies. In 2012 former Twitter U.K. General Manager Tony Wang\u00a0stated: \u201cWe are the free speech wing of the free speech party.\u201d Obviously Wang was marketing Twitter as a platform where all ideas are welcome. Oh, how times have changed. Earlier this month, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u00a0said\u00a0Wang\u2019s 2012 pronouncement \u201cwas a joke.\u201d We shouldn\u2019t be surprised by Dorsey\u2019s statement. In July Vice News\u00a0reported\u00a0that four Republican House members \u2013 Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Rep. Devin Nunes and California and me \u2013 were shadow banned by Twitter. Shadow banning does not affect a person\u2019s ability to go on Twitter and read tweets or post tweets. But it prevents others from reading the person\u2019s tweets. Twitter claimed the problem was just a glitch in the company\u2019s algorithm, calling it a \u201csearch auto-suggest issue.\u201d And of course, the response from Dorsey was predictable. \u201cWe do not shadow ban according to political ideology or viewpoint or content,\u201d he said. Really? Congress should also look to appoint a task force to examine all restrictions placed on the First Amendment, with a specific focus on social media companies. There are 535 members in the U.S. Congress. But only four conservative Republicans were shadow banned. What was the \u201cglitch\u201d in the algorithm? The names Gaetz, Meadows, Nunes and Jordan? Twitter is not alone in limiting free speech. Other high-tech companies are also restricting speech, and most often it is conservative speech that is targeted. For example: Any attack on free speech is troubling, but big tech\u2019s assault is the most troubling. Social media are now part of every American\u2019s life, and big social media companies have unbelievable control over the type and flow of information. If they can restrict certain types of speech, then their ability to impact elections and public policy is virtually unlimited. The First Amendment was written to protect speech \u2013 and not just speech that we agree with.\u00a0Congress needs to have more hearings and more oversight, which would mean more\u00a0information for the American people. Congress should also look to appoint a task force to examine all restrictions placed on the First Amendment, with a specific focus on social media companies. This is not a partisan\u00a0issue. Free speech is fundamental to the health of our great country, and Congress should treat it with the respect it deserves.",

From a list of four books for students taking an English 1 College Prep course at Wando High School in Charleston, two are focused on racism and police brutality. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an indoctrination of distrust of police and we\u2019ve got to put a stop to that,\u201d John Blackmon, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Tri-County Lodge #3, told the\u00a0local news. \u201cThere are other socio-economic topics that are available and they want to focus half of their effort on negativity towards the police? That seems odd to me.\" PARENTS ANGERED AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD PARTNER LEADS \u2018GRAPHIC\u2019 SEX-ED LESSON IN SCIENCE CLASS Students can pick \u201cAll American Boys\u201d by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely, which is described as \u201cthe story of two teens, one black and one white, who struggle with racial tension in their school and their community,\u201d in the class assignment, or \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d by Angie Thomas, described as the main character witnessing her childhood friend, Khalil, being shot \u2013 unarmed \u2013 by a police officer. While the students have two other options on the reading list, the Fraternal Order of Police says the two anti-police books should be dropped from the list because they focus on negativity toward officers. The school is reviewing the book materials after formal request for reconsideration was submitted. \u201cI understand two of the selections/choices for this summer\u2019s reading list for English 1 College Prep classes are considered controversial by some members of our community,\u201d Wando Principal Sherry Eppelsheimer wrote in a statement. \u201cI appreciate their concern and input regarding this matter.\u201d The school board could pull the book the books from the summer reading list, if it decides to take up the issue.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" June 25, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Organized hatred, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Remember in 2009 when President Obama, speaking at Notre Dame said this about the need for civil discourse? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESDIENT: As citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate? How does each of us remain firm in our principles and fight for what we consider right? Without, as Father John said, demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh what a nice sentiment, but where is he tonight? What does he say about the threats against the Trump administration? Somehow the Dems went from hope and change to nope and deranged. Over the weekend the owner of a Lexington, Virginia eatery, you probably heard of that, it's called the Red Hen did something incredible. She asked White House spokeswoman, press secretary Sarah Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant, simple because she works for Trump. Well the owner of the Red Hen Stephanie Wilkinson told the Washington Post, \"I have a business and I want the business to thrive. This feels like the moment in our democracy where people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals\". So Ms Morality walked Sarah Huckabee outside and told her the Red Hen has, \"Certain standards that I fell it has to uphold such as honesty, compassion and cooperation\". And she invited Huckabee to leave, which the White House press secretary did. Now Huckabee returned home with her husband but the rest of the family went to another restaurant across the street. Well that didn't stop Wilkinson or her crusade to drive Conservatives apparently from establishments, even ones she doesn't run, in the same town. Governor Mike Huckabee was on my radio show today. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) FORMER GOVERNOR MIKE HUCHABEE: There's a part of that story that has not been told. You're going to be the first to hear it. Sarah and her Husband just went home, they'd just sort of had enough. But the rest of her family went across the street to a different restaurant. The owner of the Red Hen, because no body's told this, then followed them across the street, called people and organized a protest yelling and screaming at them from outside the other restaurant. (END AUDIO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Publicly shaming Conservatives and targeting them in public. It's become the new tactic of the left. It's not enough to malign them for their beliefs and positions. Now they have to be publicly humiliated, including their families and, you bet, their small children. Incidentally, Huckabee's in laws, I love this, are Liberals, they don't even like Trump. Hollywood is getting in on the action too, actor Seth Rogan. He bragged on TV how he recently embarrassed speaker Paul Ryan in front of his children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SETH ROGEN, ACTOR: And he said, \"Can I have a picture with you?\" And I look over and his kids are standing right there, expectantly, clearly fans of mine and I said, \"No way man\" and I couldn't stop and I said, \"Furthermore, I hate what you're doing to the country at this moment and I count the days till you no longer have one iota of the power that you currently have\". I look over and his kids are still standing right there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Nice guy. I always get him mixed up with Jonah Hill for some reason but if I were Seth Rogan, I'd be trying to keep every fan I could. He's not exactly Chris Pratt but I digress. By the way even the Cineplex isn't safe from the tactics of the left. Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, she attended a showing of Mister Rogers, documentary ironically is all about civility and kindness. Apparently the left wing mob who confronted and flicked spit on the attorney general of Florida, didn't get the memo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What would Mister Rogers think about you and your agency in Florida? Taking away health insurance, put people with pre- existing conditions, Pam Bondi, shame on you. Shame on you, shame on you. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: So that's the video of Bondi leaving the theatre, so that's what they wanted. But as she came in, she and her boyfriend were verbally assaulted and physically threatened in the concessions line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: They came up again and every curse word in the book and they said to him, \"Hey blue eyes, come on, aren't you going to protect her?\" Using a lot of other words too, \"Aren't you going to protect her? What are young going to do? What are you going to do?\" And they're this far from my face, one spit on my head. They were trying to create a fight. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh you bet they were. And if this continues, somebody's going to get hurt. Now imagine if just a few years ago, Obama administration officials or just run of the middle Democrats were verbally assaulted in that way. There would be called for the National Guard to step in, but since Conservatives are being targeted, all bets are off, all standards are out the window. This is all evolving into a type of domestic terrorism and it's only going to get worse. Homeland security chief, remember Kirstin Nielson, was driven out of a restaurant in DC last week by angry protesters. White House senior advisor Steven Miller was also reportedly heckled at a DC eatery. And tonight protesters are reportedly staked outside his apartment building. They even staged a protest outside of Nielson's home, blaring audio of this child separation at a border facility. These are anarchic, organized spectacles, they're no accident. Each flash protest is planned out and choreographed. It's planned online first, again, and it's meant to shame the political opponent to stoke violence and hatred, and maybe even intimidate people in the future from getting involved in the Trump administration at all. Why would they want that hassle? Then at a weekend rally, this is the best, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, issued her own very soft call to action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: The American people have put up with this President long enough. What more do we need to see? What more lies do we need to hear? You see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you form a crowd and you push back on them. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: We're going to be talking about that phrase, \u2018Push back on them', in just a moment. We invited Ms Waters and a number of Democrats to appear tonight, no surprise, they all refused. She did find time to go on MSNBC tonight and Sunday to share tis unifying message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATERS: And I want to tell you for these members of Cabinet who remain and try to defend him, they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant, they're not going to be able to stop at a gas station, they're not going to be able to shop at a department store. The people are going to turn on them, they're going to protest, they're going to absolutely harass them until they decide that they're going to tell the President, \"No I can't hang with you\" (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Harass them, approach them, drive them out, push them back. So is Maxine Waters fomenting violence using her position as a member of Congress to do so? Well frankly, I said this today on radio, Paul Ryan should at the very least open an ethics enquiry into Waters' rhetoric and I think they should move to censure her. She seems to be using her office to foment, or at least justify, acts of harassment, intimidation, that could very well lead to violence. Now reactions of outrage from the White House to Nancy Pelosi forced Waters to the microphone today. But if Maxine Waters thinks a non-apology double talk, 48 hours after her incendiary and outrageous statements that she repeated yesterday are sufficient to quell the firestorm? She has another thing coming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATERS: There's nowhere in my statement, any time, any place that we talked about harm. And so our members of the Democratic caucus are talking about civility, and that makes good sense. But protest is civility. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Drive them out, harass them, get up in the face, all the things that people take away from what she said in her very words. For threatening women and children at a dinner, at the movies, it's civil Maxine? No wonder why she's too afraid to come on. She'll only go onto the soft ball interviews on MSNBC maybe she should come on a show she can't intimidate. Let's be clear, she knew exactly what she saying and she did not apologise for her comments in the least. The woman has been saying crazy, hateful, incendiary things for years, and the difference now is the entire Democratic Party had drifted into Maxine land. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATERS: As far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell. I don't honor him, I don't respect him and I don't want to be involved with him. The American people had better understand what's going on, this is a bunch of scum bags. Let's impeach 45, impeach 45, impeach 45. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: The left wants to cry targeting people, maliciously attacking them in public for their beliefs and lifestyles. But now because Conservatives are the targets, a new standard has emerged. Since they believe Trump's policies are detestable, or sorry Nazi-like, the left believes it's a by any means necessary scenario, so they attempt to justify their thuggish public bullying, by blaming whom? Trump of course. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) ELISE JORDAN, JOURNALIST: Should someone who lies constantly and enables the President's lies be openly welcomed in society wherever they please. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would say that the polite discourse in inappropriate when there are babies in cages. Does that mean we're going to violent? No. But does that mean Sarah Sanders can have a nice quiet dinner when she is taking our tax dollars to implement this policy, I don't think so. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It wasn't until we had three year olds in caged that these people couldn't go into public, too bad on that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But this vulgarity that exists represented primarily by now pushed by the President but now coursed on either side of the isle has made it much worse and much harder to do anything in this country. (END VIDEO CLIPS) INGRAHAM: Oh spare me. For decades, Hollywood and the left have driven any semblance of decency and civility from the movie house as well as the lecture hall. They've cheapened everything from the music to fashion but Trump is to blame for the vulgarity of the culture? Nice try. Our politics are now devoid of conversation, debate, ideas. The left has created a political culture where demonization of opponents and boycotts are routine. Hey, if you can't debate them and beat them in a debate, try to shut them down altogether. Organized chaos is their favourite tool, yes, it's very Alinskyite. But the idea is not to come to some common understanding, or even win an argument of course, but to destroy political opponents and you bet, attempt to silence them. When Democrats are urging uprisings online to deny Republican women safe havens, peace, just having a dinner in private, in a public place? A moment of enjoyment for her family, they won't allow that? Something is deeply wrong. Now is the moment for all people, right and left, to condemn this uncivil disobedience and those advocating for it. Threatening, yelling and haranguing officials in public? That's not going to create positive outcomes or a better policy, even Chuck Schumer said that today, good for him. It will only harden the political divide in this country and perhaps, lead to violence. And any blood spilt, remember what happed a year ago with Steve Scalise, any blood spilled will be on the hands of Maxine Waters and any Democrats or never-Trumpers condoning tacitly or explicitly these ANTIFA style tactics of vicious intimidation. And we will not stand for that, and that's the Angle. All right, let's discuss with my first guest, Monica Crowley, senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein is a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jason I got to start with you, former member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters comment, a non-apology apology this morning at 9am on radio. I called for her censure, on the floor of the House or Representatives, where do things stand tonight? JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: No if you impugn the integrity of another member, if you're in sighting violence like that, she should be censured and I'm glad you brought that up. I think that is very appropriate. Make members of the House of Representatives vote on whether on not they think it's acceptable what she's doing, what she's trying to do. Because this is the face of the resistance movement, it is violent, it is vulgar, it is a scorcher philosophy and it is going to lead to violence unless the rest of the body stands up and says, \"This is not acceptable\" INGRAHAM: Richard RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You know Jason just said and you said earlier, someone might get hurt. Donald Trump at a rally during a campaign said punch him in the face and guess what? We saw that video of somebody walking up the steps and getting punched in the face. Somebody got knocked over, driven over and murdered in Charlottesville because they were racist protesting or taking issue with the protesters in Charlottesville. So people have gotten hurt from uncivil behaviour and I think for people who are Trump defenders to stand up on behalf of somebody who mocks a disabled, you know go down the list, derided a gold start family, the list goes on, for them to call out somebody else for being uncivil is a bit much. Look, Maxine Waters is not the face, much as you or others would want them of the Democratic Party. When Michelle Obama said, when they go low, we got high, I think that stood of where Democrats wanted to be. INGRAHAM: Where are the Obama's? GOODSTEIN: What I'm saying the problem is, that position lost. So I think I don't blame somebody like Maxine Waters kind of taking the position she did. INGRAHAM: I think everybody's rhetoric needs to come down a little bit. I agree with you on that, I really do and I think we all can do better. There are many Democrats, however, who have supported Maxine Waters. Let's watch a few of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: Do you wish she hadn't said it? REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT, D-N.Y.: No she has the right to say what she feels and I support it SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: Yes if I saw an administrator out and about, there's nothing wrong with confronting that person. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He doesn't even know how to refer to a staffer. Monica, look, Trump can get pretty heated sometimes so I think Richard has a point there but you as a sitting Congresswoman, represents a part of LA that's seen violent riots. Remember that's when she really cut her teeth, her claim to fame was 1992, I went back and watched that today. She said push back on them Monica, turn on them, harass them so they can't go into public. Turn on them, push back on them. That's not debate them play fun with them, that was different. A crowd surrounding an individual with her children or with her family members, that's a different deal. MONICA CROWLEY, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH: Yes and we are so far beyond normal politics Laura, that's sometimes it's difficult to see what's really happening. But let's be really clear, the left is at war. The left is at war with the constitution, with the rule of law, with free market economics and with their very values. So they are fighting this wat 24 hours a day, seven days a week and now they are in a position where they are losing both on politics and policy. So they are resorting to these tactics of reaching for the most extreme rhetoric and the most extreme activity to try to divert attention from the fact that they're agenda has failed and continues to fail. The President's agenda, the Conservatives' agenda is in fact winning. But the fact now, we have to understand that we are engaged in this wat whether we want to fight it or not. The Alinksy tactics, the Cloward and Piven tactics of overwhelming the system whether it' at the border or elsewhere-- INGRAHAM: Well they want anarchy. Anarchy is their friend, correct? CROWELY: Absolutely and it's about destroying the system so they can rebuild it in their sort of radical amass. INGRAHAM: I would say,Jason also flooding the border is a way, you got a lot of old voters, you got a lot of old tedious old clunky voters you got to replace with new voters. I really believe that's always been a strategy of the left. The Chamber of Commerce types that love the cheap labour but they love to flood the border, flood the zone, whatever you want to call it with new voters, new people. They don't lie the old people of the United States, they voted for Trump, for goodness sakes. But Jason the President tonight spoke out about Maxine Waters, I want to watch here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There only good at one thing, what's their term. Resist. It's the Party of Maxine Waters, do you believe her? No, no, no, no, this had become the Party of Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well look, Chuck Schumer came out today and tried to distance himself. I think he saw where this was going, even Nancy Pelosi tepid criticism. But she did have her supporters out there and even in the media a lot of never Trumpers, hate Donald Trump, anything that could throw a wrench into his plans. But Trump's not letting this go, should he let this go Jason? Should he just focus on the substance let Nancy Pelosi implode? CHAFFETZ: No, look, this is much deeper than anything that's happened in the last week. The Democrats, they're minds are exploding because Donald Trump is not only garnering more support and has a lot more public support than a lot of previous Presidents have, you know, at this point in his Presidency but his policies are working. Look at all the economic indicators, look at what's happening overseas and this so-called big wave that was going to hit us in the 2018 election, that's not happening. And the only thing they're left with is this desperation of yelling screaming, taunting people and it's not productive. INGRAHAM: Last word. GOODSTEIN: Listen, the reason that Democrats' heads are exploding is because it shocks the conscience to see babies in these metals fences, cages, call them what they want, that's what shocks the conscience. You want to talk about violating the constitution, that's what's got people going crazy-- CHAFFETZ: Oh don't do that. Where were you in 2014 when I introduced an asylum reform bill that passed out, I passed out a bill out of the judiciary committee in March of 2015, go back and read it. GOODSTEIN: That was for-- CHAFFETZ: Democrats were nowhere in support of that bill. It talked about accelerating the reunification of children and their parents. Where were the Democrats? I didn't have a single Democrat come and support us to do that bill. Democrats were nowhere, they didn't care about it. GOODSTEIN: 68 centers voted for an immigration reform bill. Not all that long ago, and that was Republicans. INGRAHAM: I think even J. Johnson, I thought it was interesting that he came out over the weekend and said, like we did what we did-- GOODSTEIN: I agree. INGRAHAM: We did what we did because they were seeing everybody, same thing that we're seeing now, they were seeing everybody absolute overwhelming of our borders and we have limited resources and a limited amount of people. We can't process 50,000 people in three months, it's really hard to do that so here was a moment of candour from J. Johnson. But everything's got to calm down, everything's got to calm down, the Democrats have to calm down and this violent rhetoric has got to go. Great panel guys. Mark Meadows reveals how Congress is squeezing the DOJ and FBI next. Tired of getting the run around from the FBI and DOJ, Devin Nunes went straight to the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats today. Nunes had given the agencies a five pm deadline to turn over key documents in the Russia and Hillary Clinton investigations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: I would say we cleaned up most of what was on the table except for the most important piece, \"Did you or did you not run informants into the Trump campaign, especially before the investigation even began?\" Very simple question, it deserves a very simple answer. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well the FBI responded very late tonight saying they're already responded to Nunes' request. Congressman Mike Meadows joins us now to respond. That just happened, apparently Congressman, so you guys have all the documents you are entitled to. REP. MIKE MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Well the one thing that FBI and DOJ is very good at is creative writing. You know, any time that you would suggest that we have all the documents, when we have tens of thousands of documents that have not been delivered. As we speak right now, we have a valid subpoena that has not been really responded to appropriately and its 97 days and ticking. So for them to suggest that we have everything is just factually incorrect. INGRAHAM: Kevin Kleinsmith, tell us about Kevin Kleinsmith. MEADOWS: Well obviously Chuck Ross did-- INGRAHAM: We need our own deck of cards, just to identify them because they're lots of casts and characters. It's like the love boat. MEADOWS: Yes you've got Sally Moyer, you've got all these different individuals but there is one common theme and it's called bias. Bias is against this President-- INGRAHAM: He was an FBI agent, number-- MEADOWS: And it was actually attorney number two, what we believe-- INGRAHAM: Attorney number two in the I.G. Report. MEADOWS: What we believe Chuck Ross, the I.G. has not confirmed that, that's what we suspect. But Chuck Ross did some great reporting today and said that, actually, he was the one reporting Papadopoulos. So here you have someone that was key to opening up this investigation in the Donald Trump Russia collusion narrative that never happened and yet, you've got someone with inherent bias that started it. It's just extremely troubling. INGRAHAM: Now Kleinsmith, like Moyers, is evidencing bias through various text messages that were released. MEADOWS: Right, I mean a lot of text message and it's not just the text messaged, it's the fact that they were key components of an investigation that Peter Strzok was involved with. So it's all of them coming together with not, not two but five people that were biased against this President and yet, initiating the very investigations. So here's the interesting thing Laura, what we've got to do as a country is become transparent. Give us the documents, let us put them out to the American people, let them judge for themselves what is right and what's wrong and it's time. I've said this before, the DOJ and the FBI has an opportunity to either be part of the clean-up crew or the cover up. INGRAHAM: I wonder what happened with Jeff Sessions because he was on our show last week and he seemed, \"Okay, we're working on getting these documents and\". What's going on? Is he not aware of-- MEADOWS: He's recused himself -- INGRAHAM: That's right he's recused himself. MEADOWS: But he's really recused himself of any knowledge of what's going on. Rod Rosenstein knows better, I mean he really does know better and the buck stops with him. And I can tell you that we are going to have full action this week, Laura this week on the House floor where we compel them to turn over those documents. INGRAHAM: So just so people know, Kleinsmith is the one who wrote, \"Viva la resistance\". MEADOWS: If he is indeed attorney number two, which we believe that he is -- INGRAHAM: Maybe a really dumb question but why is it that we can't identify attorneys working for the, they're not exactly undercover agents working in the-- MEADOWS: You've hit the nail on the head. Actually they're not part of the counter intelligence division-- INGRAHAM: Which they were trying to pass them off as, correct? MEADOWS: Which they were trying to say the I.G., they're actually part of the general counsel's office. So an attorney working for the FBI, normally is not an undercover operation and certainly wasn't here. INGRAHAM: News tonight that Eric Prince's computers have been seized and so forth, any thoughts on that? Former Blackwater CBO MEADOWS: Well so what you see is Bob Mueller continuing to grab and collect information. By the way, you got 1.2 million documents from Donald Trump in 90 days and yet they can't turn over 50,000 documents to Congress in nine months, there's a problem. INGRAHAM: What's next for Nunes after the 5pm deadline, FBI said you guys got everything, what's next? MEADOWS: I think the next thing for Flora action for all of this where-- INGRAHAM: Ryan will do that? MEADOWS: Well he made a promise to Jim Jordan and I last week, that said if we didn't get all the documents by Friday, then we would see Flora action this week. I'm waiting for him to follow through on that commitment but if he doesn't we have appropriate-- INGRAHAM: He will, he's a man of his word. MEADOWS: Well, we're going to count on it. INGRAHAM: You've got to keep the pressure on him. MEADOWS: This week. INGRAHAM: Congressman thanks so much for being with us. MEADOWS: Thank you. INGRAHAM: Another deadline that has passed. Let's get reaction from Former Attorney General Mike Mukasey. Judge Mukasey, great to see. You just heard from the Congressman. This is wild, the justice department said you've received all the documents, essentially, you're entitled to. Where are we tonight Judge? MIKE MUKASEY, FOMRER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well I haven't seen the subpoena and I haven't seen the documents so I'm a little bit in the dark about where we are. But it's not an impossible task to turn over documents. I think they ought to do more discussing in between them in and among themselves than posturing publicly. INGRAHAM: Well it looks like the documents Nunes requested were about informants placed inside the Trump campaign or who approached the Trump campaign. I think part of what he's trying to determine, when this investigation really began because they were saying that this investigation into the Trump possible collusion began into the end of July of 2016. But indications are that it began in the spring of 2016. State department very well involved, the Christopher Steele and that Dossier, in and out of the halls of justice and perhaps the state department so I think that's what they're worried about. That who was really running this investigation and who gave it the impetus Judge, from the very beginning? MUKASEY: Well you hit the nail on the head, that's what we really need to know, when I started and how. And to the extent that there was, I mean I'm interested in example, in knowing how this informant who started out as a CIA asset suddenly became an FBI informant. You know, those two organizations don't really play with each other's toys. And I don't understand how that happened, who brought it about, who paid him, what he was told about his responsibility in going into the Trump campaign, and when that happened. That is something that I think we ought to know, and if there were any others obviously we ought to know that as well. INGRAHAM: Judge, something I just asked Congressman Meadows about the failure of the inspector general to reveal who these staff attorneys are at Justice. And again, it looks like one of them, Mr. Clinesmith, was writing unbelievable text messages that he was so depressed after the election, he was stressed and depressed, and basically saying the resistance lives on. He's involved at the heart of this investigation along with Strzok and of course Moyer. But we're not revealing whose these people are? Why? They're not undercover agents. MUKASEY: Obviously not. And I think that Ad even more significant, at least to me, is not just the statements about the resistance but rather a set of messages that pass between Strzok and his friend the night that Donald Trump got the nomination where she wrote to him this is unbelievable that Trump has gotten the nomination. His response was, yes, this increases the pressure to terminate MYE, which was the code name, midyear exam, for the Clinton investigation. That's not just an expression of opinion, that is a statement about how we ought to do our jobs. And that on my reading was not in the I.G. report, I don't recall seeing it. And that's something I think they ought to question Strzok about when he testifies. INGRAHAM: And judge, he was just walked out of the DOJ last week. Apparently just lost his security clearance. That's what Jeff Sessions said, he just lost his security clearance. Someone who was a political advocate running two critical investigations as the lead investigator. I never worked at DOJ. I've worked at the White House and Transportation, Education, Supreme Court. I've never worked at DOJ, but if that's the way business is done at the DOJ at these high levels, we are in big trouble in this country. Big trouble. MUKASEY: It certainly doesn't inspire confidence, nor does something that was reported in the I.G. report, namely that there were FBI agents in contact with the press who were getting free meals, free tickets, and other perks, and that there were so many of them they couldn't tell who had leaked information. Now, that was an absolute jaw dropper. The notion that FBI agents were getting compensation essentially from reporters and developing relationships with them, that should have been a firing offense. INGRAHAM: Judge, thank you so much. We're going to debate the left's dangerous flirtation with political violence after the break (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Tonight we welcome back the return of our arbiter statement. Isn't that fun? We discussed the dangers of the left lurch from political dialogue towards physical confrontations in tonight's Angle. But other questions linger. Did the Red Hen restaurant violate the rights of White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders when it kicked her out? And did Congresswoman Maxine Water illegally incite leftists to commit violence? Here to debate both of these issues, attorney and former Georgia state rep LaDawn Jones and political analyst and Washington attorney Gayle Trotter. OK Gayle, you have the floor. What possible cause of action could Sanders have against this restaurant? GAYLE TROTTER, ATTORNEY: Yes. The restaurant violated Sanders rights because they discriminated against her in service under the Virginia human rights act which does not allow places of public accommodation to deny service to people based on their personal beliefs. INGRAHAM: That would include political beliefs. TROTTER: It doesn't say specifically, but the statute specifically says that it should be interpreted broadly, and other states including D.C. right were we are say that political belief, sources of employment, where you live, where you work cannot be held against you in denying service. INGRAHAM: This is a civil cause of action, what kind of damages? Treble damages, punitive, compensatory, what do you get? TROTTER: Yes. And if there were leftists trying to put this in force, they would put this business out of business as we have seen in other situations. INGRAHAM: The Washington Post, LaDawn, said no cause of action here even though a lot of these civil rights attorneys weren't applauding this action said Sarah Sanders is out of luck. What is your thought? LADAWN JONES, ATTORNEY: I agree. I also don't applaud the action but I don't think there's a cause of action there. Our legislatures in Virginia or anywhere else have to make it very clear that they do not allow discrimination based on political beliefs. They would have to prove int his cause of action to be successful that this location, the Red Hen, they always stop people with these particular personal beliefs or political beliefs rather than just Sarah Sanders herself. And because this was targeted directly at her and for her participation with the Trump organization, I don't think that they could win here. TROTTER: I disagree. The comments that the restaurant owner made specifically said they were denying that service based on her personal beliefs. And when you look at those particular statements they would be entered into evidence as completely exonerating Sarah Sanders and making sure that the restaurant had discriminated against her. And even if you go to the point saying that Virginia statute only allows places not to discriminate based on religion, certainly in immigration religion has come into this over and over again. People on both sides have been citing Bible statutes talking about this and saying definitely this is a religious issue as well. INGRAHAM: LaDawn, you can respond to that, then I will give you the next point. JONES: I find it interesting that when we talk about these causes of action, we've seen these cases come through the Supreme Court. We've seen these laws come through several states where there were direct things that our laws have prohibited based on race, religion, sexual orientation that conservatives have fought very hard to say it's OK for someone to express their personal beliefs for religious freedoms. It did not apply in those cases. It will not apply here. INGRAHAM: This is Maxine Waters on Saturday versus Maxine Waters tonight, or today. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and create a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they are not welcome. I have not called for the harm of anybody. This president has lied again when he is saying that I called for harm to anyone. This Don the conman will say anything. He is the one that is responsible for promoting violence. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: LaDawn, she says push back, obviously the import of that is drive them out. She's urging people to surround members of the administration when they are having a private dinner with their children, it doesn't matter. How is that not ultimately inciting people to violence? And she says no, that's not what I intended. But you are telling people to harass other people. She is a smart woman, she knows what the word \"harass\" means, does she not? JONES: I'm sure she does, but let's look at the legal sense of the word. What do we have the right to do as Americans? One of the fundamental rights is to -- INGRAHAM: Not incite violence, LaDawn, not incite violence. You don't have the right to do that. JONES: Well, she did not ask them to incite violence. She asked to push back on their policies. INGRAHAM: She didn't say on their policies. No, no, no she did not. I listen very closely, four times. JONES: She said as he said push them out of the store but not drive them over with a car. INGRAHAM: Are they public accommodations, though? Those are -- according to the statute, they are public places of gathering, so you have free association, Gayle. Look, I think it's a tough call on this, but she has free association as a person, Sarah Sanders. She can freely associate with anyone she wants and go anywhere she wants. But this is a private establishment. So does a private establishment say we have the right to serve you if you are barefoot, we are not going to serve you if you are a member of the Trump administration. TROTTER: There is no question when talking about what Maxine Waters said that this is inciting. And the First Amendment does not protect incitement of violence. She wants mob rule, and she's talking about a specific action against people whose names we know, 23 members of the cabinet. Six of them are Republican women. INGRAHAM: Create a crowd, push back on them, and tell them they are not welcome anywhere. I think if those words were used on any other class of people who happened not to be related to Trump or supporting him, I think the left would have a huge problem. They'd have lots of creative liberal lawyers who say, there could be because of action. This is a conspiracy to deprive someone of their First Amendment rights. But this is a good arbiter segment. You were both really good. I don't know, can I have a tie? No, I can't. I think Gayle has it this time. I don't have my gavel. JONES: Of course. INGRAHAM: No, it's not of course. I said it was really good and I want you back, you're both great. Thank you for so much for joining us. And the Bible has been used to both attack and defend the president's immigration policy. So what's the truth? An important debate with a panel of distinguished religious leaders, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: We recently witnessed that weird spectacle of Ali Velshi at MSNBC reading scripture to attack the administration's immigration policy. That followed Attorney General Jeff Sessions quoting the Bible to justify that policy. So all of this has sparked a really big debate. It's really interesting among Christian leaders on immigration. So let's discuss that now with a pair of very distinguished religious leaders, I'm delighted they are both with us, Dr. Darrell Scott of the president's Faith Advisory Council, and Dr. Kent Ingle, president of Southeastern University. Great to see you both. Dr. Ingle, let's start with you. You're actually, I think, a supporter of the president but you disagree with his policy that it initially, at least, separated families, child in one area, parents more in a formal immigration detention. Why? KENT INGLE, PRESIDENT, SOUTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY: Sure. I appreciate President Trump's leadership, and he is trying to do the right thing. He wants to uphold the laws of the land, there's no doubt about that. I think the issue there was to not only provide protection which is what he wants to do as it relates to borders, but I think also you have to look at compassion. How do you bring the human element into this situation so that you can provide human dignity and respect and care and compassion and provide an element that gives both. And I think that's the thing that a lot of Americans are hoping that our president will step up in a way, along with the congress, the House, the Senate, our leaders will do the right thing and provide that protective and compassionate pieces to this legislation. INGRAHAM: Pastor Scott, this is Bishop Michael Curry who was just slamming Jeff Sessions for invoking the bible. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BISHOP MICHAEL CURRY, PRESIDING BISHOP OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH: For our Christians to quote Romans 13 over Jesus of Nazareth, as if Jesus of Nazareth doesn't exist, that it seems to me is highly problematic. And it's just flat out wrong. It's unbiblical, it's un-Christian, and it's un- American. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Pastor, your reaction to that? And I have something to say about welcoming the stranger. Go ahead. PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT, TRUMP FAITH ADVISORY COUNCIL: It's not unreasonable to refer to the scripture, especially if you are a Bible believer. It's not unusual to refer to scripture as a basis to validate any actions that you engage in. Once again, if you are a Bible believer, we oftentimes use scripture to confirm or validate actions or activities that we engage in. I don't see anything wrong with Jeff Sessions utilizing that scripture because that scripture simply says to obey the civil authorities. Notice something. Jesus nor the Apostle Paul never endorsed sedition or rebellion or violent uprising against Rome, and in using that scripture he was saying that in order to advance our cause, violence is not the way. Obey the laws of the land so they won't have a reason to accuse us of any wrongdoing. Obey the laws of the land and put other matters into the hands of God and he will work it out. INGRAHAM: Pastor Ingle, the Bible calls on us to welcome the stranger, and it's very powerful. Welcome into your table, invite a stranger to your home for meals and so forth. But the Catholic bishop seemed to take that to mean open borders. They have a really big wall around the Vatican, it's a beautiful wall, a really nice wall. But that means anyone who steps foot over the border has to be processed into the country and released. How is that welcoming the stranger according to Biblical text? That does not mean to be devoid of all laws of the land, does it? INGLE: Absolutely. And I go back to that passage the attorney general referred to in Romans 13 talking about obey the laws of the land. When you talk about the context of God's law, God's law always for protection, it's always for peace, it's always for harmony. And so that's why when you look at the issues that we are facing with immigration reform, all the issues and challenges that we have seen over the last couple of weeks, you have to have a come together approach that covers all the issues of -- well, you have to look at the issues of collaborating on providing security at the wall. You have to look at issues of compassion as it relates to bringing families together. INGRAHAM: What about compassion for Americans. We all do what we can to donate to organizations that help people on the ground in their home countries. So many Christian organizations, faith-based groups in Guatemala, Central America, South America, Africa and around the world, that's where we as individuals can make a difference through our faith, through our churches and our organizations. It doesn't mean that we have to completely smash our own rule of law and say OK, you have a really sad life, I understand it's horrible, so we have to allow you to come into the country no matter how you come in. I want to get Pastor Scott on that. This is a very liberal priest known as Father James Martin. He's not a big fan of Trump to put it lightly. That is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FATHER JAMES MARTIN S.J., EDITOR AT LARGE, AMERICA MAGAZINE: No one wants to be a refugee, no one wants to be a migrant, but they do it out of great love for their families. They have lots of guts to do it, and I think it's up to us to welcome them. I think the problem with a lot of these Christians who are saying they are reading the Bible is I don't know what bible they are reading because the Bible I read has Jesus always reaching out to those on the margins, including and most especially migrants and refugees. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Pastor Scott, a lot of Americans feel like they are on the margins, like two blocks from where we broadcasted from there are a lot of homeless on the street, literally two blocks from where we are. Your comments on Father Martin? SCOTT: There is a difference between migrants, refugees, and illegal immigrants. The parents of these children know that they are committing a crime when they endeavor to sneak into this country. This country has a zero-tolerance policy. They know that our president is hardline in regards to that, but they try to sneak in anyways. Now, anyone, an American citizen regardless of race, creed or color, if you are engaged in the commission of a crime and you are caught in the commission of this crime and you are apprehended, and you have a child in your custody, that child is going to be removed from your custody and placed into child services until either somebody comes and gets them or they are remanded over or whatever. And so I don't understand why we are taking any culpability toward this crime that is being committed away from the parents and making it as if we're just grabbing kids and putting them into concentration camps, because that is not the case at all. There is a crime being committed, the children are in the custody of the criminals. INGRAHAM: And its Donald Trump's fault. And its Donald Trump's fault that a crime is being committed. SCOTT: Because you told yourself I'm going to sneak into America, I'm going to sneak into America despite the law, and I'm taking my child. I wouldn't even put my children at risk like that. I have grandchildren. I wouldn't even try to do that if I know it was a zero-tolerance. INGRAHAM: It's a dangerous journey, that's for sure, up through Mexico. Phenomenal segment. Thank you, both. And by the way, the greatest hits from the president's remarks at a campaign rally tonight, and my live interview with the man he was there to support, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: South Carolina holding a runoff election in the GOP primary race for governor tomorrow. And President Trump stopped for incumbent Governor Henry McMaster at a huge rally tonight. Thunderstorms delayed Trump's arrival by an hour, but it was worth the wait for the crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. HENRY MCMASTER, R-S.C.: South Carolina loves Donald Trump. And we were watching these forces of nature, and there was the lightning and there was the thunder, and the storm and of the rain. And then it cleared. Then Air Force One landed and the real force of nature got off the plane. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So please get your -- out tomorrow and vote. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: We had to bleep the president tonight. Joining us now, Governor Henry McMaster. I was like, OK, it's a family hour, OK, Mr. President. We don't need the a-word. But he was into the moment there. So how did you rate the president's performance, go. MCMASTER: A plus. The place was bursting at the seams. We had an overflow in the auditorium and over 1,000 people outside couldn't even get in to play safe. The people of South Carolina love Donald Trump and he certainly didn't disappoint. It was terrific. INGRAHAM: So you guys gave Trump a 14-point victory in 2016. That was a big smash of Hillary Clinton, although South Carolina has changed a lot over the years, Governor McMaster. It looks like you will beat John Warren tomorrow although you want everyone to go out and vote for sure. But it's changed a lot demographically, and we see the resistance ramping up across the United States, including what Maxine Waters said over the weekend. She kind of didn't really apologize for it at all. But have you ever been harassed in public or do you feel the change in the discourse? MCMASTER: No ma'am. And I really don't think we have seen much of that here. I just can't believe Maxine Waters and these other people, they have gone crazy. And the debate about whether it's a violation of this law and inciting a riot, and it probably is a violation of a lot of laws, but even worse than that is it's just plain bad manners. I just don't know what these people are thinking. People look at them for guidance, look at them for leadership, and they are talking and acting totally responsibly. It is hard to believe, but we don't have much of that in South Carolina. That crowd tonight was about the same as the others. They were delirious with joy to see Donald Trump in South Carolina, and when I campaigned for him in the primary, the presidential primary, it was the same thing. I have seen such enthusiasm close to what I have seen with President Trump and then candidate Trump one time, and that's when I saw a Beatles concert years ago. People were just going wild and they do that every time they see Donald Trump. They love Donald Trump, can't get enough of him. INGRAHAM: John Warren, your opponent, says he is the more Trump-like character and has the more Trump-like views. MCMASTER: That's nonsense. As President Trump said tonight, he and I think alike, we are doing the same things. Of course President Trump has been involved in politics deeply for a long time. Remember he wanted to run for governor of New York, and before that he was involved with people running the Reform Party. But he is a student of politics and history. He was a world figure before he became president. And he and I are doing the same things, cutting taxes and regulations, getting rid of sanctuary cities, protecting the children, no tax money to Planned Parenthood. And we've got a robust economy here. We are just booming in South Carolina, $6 billion in investment, $20,000 -- it's the same thing that President Trump is doing, and we love him. INGRAHAM: Governor, we're going to be watching closely tomorrow night. We really appreciate you joining us, staying up late after the rally. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: I know it's hip to hate on the media, and come one, we do it from time to time here as well. But displays like this tonight, well, they don't help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SHOUTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, it's got home Jim Acosta, OK. I'm not a huge supporter of Jim Acosta over at the other network, but you mainly need it to rhyme.

This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" October 14, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST:\u00a0 Good Sunday morning. Could Republican House lawmakers subpoena Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if he doesn't provide them with an on-the-record interview about reports he offered to wear a wire during meetings with President Trump? Well, the campaigner in chief makes the case for the GOP this midterm election, and U.S. diplomatic tensions with Turkey ease, while intensifying with Saudi Arabia. Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Thanks so much for joining us.\u00a0 I'm Maria Bartiromo.\u00a0 Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" It is a big week ahead for House lawmakers looking for answers after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decides not to testify to Congress about report he planned to spy on the president.\u00a0 Rosenstein adamantly denies the claims.\u00a0 But not everybody is convinced. We talk with House Judiciary Committee members Jim Jordan and John Ratcliffe coming up, and the next steps to probing the DOJ and FBI action to the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Meanwhile, President Trump fires up the base during a rally in Kentucky last night.\u00a0 House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy will talk -- join me, talking about the state of play for keeping that chamber in Republican hands come November, as well as his bill that he just introduced to fully fund the border wall. Plus, the release of American Pastor Andrew Brunson by Turkey may help repair strains with that NATO allies.\u00a0 But now cracks emerge with Saudi Arabia after a Washington Post columnist disappears and is presumed dead. All those stories and a lot more this morning right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte now threatening to subpoena Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this as Republican push for answers on whether Rosenstein was serious when he reportedly floated the idea of secretly recording President Trump. We have two members of the Judiciary Committee on the program this morning, Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe a short time ago.\u00a0 He will be joining us momentarily. Right now, my first guest, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, is joining me.\u00a0 He also sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and he is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning.\u00a0 Thanks so much for joining us. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO:\u00a0 You bet.\u00a0 Good to be with you this morning. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 I know you have a big week ahead in terms of testimonies. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 You have got Glenn Simpson, who is expected on Tuesday; then, on Thursday, James Baker; Friday, Nellie Ohr. Let's talk first about Rod Rosenstein. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 He was supposed to meet with Congress.\u00a0 What happened? JORDAN:\u00a0 He didn't show up. Look, when you're the guy who in reality is running the Justice Department, and the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asks you to come, you are obligated to come and you're obligated to come and testify under oath.\u00a0 He didn't do that. So if it takes a subpoena, that's exactly what should happen.\u00a0 We need him to answer questions about all kinds of issues associated with the Trump-Russia investigation, but specifically the statement that it's alleged that he said where he talked about actually recording the commander in chief of our great country and he talked about the 25th Amendment. That is specifically what I want to ask him about. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Now, he said that he was saying it sarcastically, that it was a joke.\u00a0 But since he said that he didn't really mean that in a serious way, we have heard from a number of people. Kim Strassel from The Wall Street Journal did an op-ed on this. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 As well, you have got John Solomon from the Hill. And in John Solomon's op-ed which was posted last week, he writes this, that, basically, this was the plan. He joined me last week on FOX Business Network on the morning program \"Mornings with Maria.\" Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL:\u00a0 There are three separate FBI agents, McCabe, Lisa Page, and James Baker, the former FBI counsel, all who say this was a serious plot, this wasn't a joke, there was a real discussion in May, right after Comey was fired, about possibly taking out the president by recording him and then going to the Cabinet invoking the 25th Amendment. Just think how extraordinary that is.\u00a0 That's a political solution.\u00a0 And you have got the Justice Department and FBI, who are not supposed to be involved in politics, having the discussion.\u00a0 Joke or no joke, it's a serious matter.\u00a0 And it's a sort of an infringement on what the Justice Department and the FBI are supposed to do. I would expect Chairman Gowdy and lawmakers like Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan possibly to issue a subpoena to force this issue with Rosenstein as early as today or early next week.\u00a0 I think that's a second thing to watch, in addition to the contempt filing that we should see. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Congressman, your take? JORDAN:\u00a0 No, exactly. He's got to come in and answer questions.\u00a0 Who else may have been in that room?\u00a0 I will tell you this, Maria.\u00a0 When Jim Baker was in his deposition two weeks ago and was asked about this, he was as serious as you could be in describing what he understood took place in that meeting between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein, where Mr. Rosenstein talked about actually recording the president of the United States. So he needs to come in and answer questions.\u00a0 And, like I said, if it takes a subpoena, that's exactly what should be issued. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 So, you were in the deposition with James Baker, the first one. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 And you are going to be with him this upcoming Thursday.\u00a0 What do you want to get from James Baker this week? JORDAN:\u00a0 Well, first of all, remember who this is.\u00a0 This is -- this is the FBI chief counsel.\u00a0 All kinds of things flow through him.\u00a0 So when he says that he believed Rod Rosenstein was serious about this, this -- this alleged statement about recording the president, you got to take that with the weight that it comes with, because it's the -- it's the FBI chief counsel. So we're going to ask him more about.\u00a0 We -- our previous deposition was cut off early.\u00a0 We ran out of time.\u00a0 So we need him back in there, where we're going to ask more about that specific meeting that took place, and then his conversations with people who were in that meeting, how those went and who all he talked to you. So all those things need to be asked. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Well, it's interesting, because you have spoken with him ready.\u00a0 And then we know that he also met with the lawyer from the Democratic National Committee on Mr. Sussmann. So tell us why that's important. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. Well, that you now have so many different people communicating information to the FBI about the Russia investigation.\u00a0 Remember, you had Nellie Ohr, who we're going to interview later this week. Nellie Ohr's husband, who's a top official at the DOJ, was getting information that he was passing on to the FBI.\u00a0 You had Glenn Simpson and actually Christopher Steele, the guy who wrote the dossier, passing information directly to the FBI.\u00a0 And now we know that the chief lawyer for Perkins Coie, who represented the Democratic National Committee, is giving information to the FBI chief counsel as well. So all these sources giving information to the FBI, I think it was this idea that the more people you have talking about the big lie, which was the dossier, the more apt people are to believe it.\u00a0 And that's exactly the technique and the method they were trying to use to get people to buy into this dossier that was actually used to go spy on the other -- other party's campaign. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 But what must be said here are the people that were giving the information to the FBI were all working for the opposition, Hillary Clinton. JORDAN:\u00a0 Bruce Ohr's wife was working for the opposition.\u00a0 Glenn Simpson was certainly working for the opposition.\u00a0 And Michael Sussmann, the lawyer at Perkins Coie, was the key lawyer for the Democrat National Committee and the Clinton campaign. So that's exactly right.\u00a0 And yet the document that was put together, this dossier, was what was used to go to the secret court to get a warrant to go spy on the other campaign. That is never supposed to happen in this country, but it did. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 But the other thing is that Rod Rosenstein OKed the final FISA warrant.\u00a0 I mean, that FISA Warren to spy on Carter Page was re-upped three times.\u00a0 And the final one was given the green light by Rod Rosenstein. So is he a witness? JORDAN:\u00a0 Exactly -- exactly right. I mean, there's all kinds of conflicts here.\u00a0 We now know the story that Mr. McCabe and Mr. Rosenstein have been in conflict and arguing about who should be recused.\u00a0 I think actually they're both right.\u00a0 Both of them should be recused from overseeing anything to do with the Mueller investigation. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you about the conflicts that we're seeing between what you have heard from Andrew McCabe, who now has been referred criminal -- for criminal charges, and Rod Rosenstein, because, apparently, there are conflicts in what the two say. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. No, there are.\u00a0 No, exactly.\u00a0 And I -- like I said, I think both of them should be -- shouldn't be overseeing the Mueller investigation, because McCabe had the conflict when his wife was running for office.\u00a0 And, of course, Rosenstein wrote the memo to -- that was given to the president that became the justification for firing James Comey. And one of the things Mueller is looking into is potential obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey.\u00a0 So, exactly right.\u00a0 I think they both should not be involved.\u00a0 Neither should be involved.\u00a0 And, of course, Andy McCabe isn't right now because he's been fired. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 The president has said he's not going to fire Rod Rosenstein at this point.\u00a0 Given what you know, should he actually step down? JORDAN:\u00a0 Well, I mean, look, I have not been a big fan of Mr. Rosenstein. The fact is, we have asked for the McCabe memos.\u00a0 There's been a subpoena for those.\u00a0 We haven't got those.\u00a0 We have asked to see the document that Mr. Rosenstein wrote on August 2, 2017, which altered the scope of the investigation that Mr. Mueller is doing.\u00a0 We haven't been able to see that. We have asked for specific portions of the FISA.\u00a0 We haven't been able to see that.\u00a0 We have asked for the 302s that -- Bruce Ohr's 302 when he had conversations with the FBI detailing what he said to Glenn Simpson and Chris Steele.\u00a0 We haven't seen that. And John Huber, the guy who was put in charge the U.S. attorney to look into all this, we have not had one report from him over the last six months since he's been on the job. So take all that, and then add into the fact that Rod Rosenstein was a no-show this week, and Glenn Simpson is taking the Fifth on Tuesday.\u00a0 That is the thing that frustrates me and, more importantly, frustrates you in the media and those people across this great country who want to know exactly what happened. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, we're going to speak with Congressman John Ratcliffe in a few minutes.\u00a0 He has seen a lot of this classified information.\u00a0 And he's going to talk to us about the implications. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 But you just rattled off a couple of things that need to be public. Will the president declassify these documents, so that the American people can understand how they put together this narrative that Donald Trump had anything to do with Russia meddling in the U.S. election? JORDAN:\u00a0 Let's hope so. I mean, a few weeks ago, the president initially said that he was going to declassify them.\u00a0 He altered that and said that he would now run it through the inspector general, Michael Horowitz.\u00a0 I hope that happens as soon as possible. I do think, at some point, we're going to get this information.\u00a0 We need to, because, again, we have got to get answers to these important questions that -- that go to the heart of this idea that it's supposed to be equal treatment under the law.\u00a0 It's supposed to be the rule of law.\u00a0 And I don't think that was followed in how the FBI started and launched and ran this -- this investigation into the president and to Russian. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Well, of course.\u00a0 And they were overseeing two investigations, one investigation into this narrative that Donald Trump had anything to do with Russia meddling.\u00a0 At the same time, they were running the investigation into Hillary Clinton and her e-mail scandal. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 And those two investigations were handled very differently. You said it.\u00a0 This is about America.\u00a0 This is about the rule of law.\u00a0 This should never have happened... JORDAN:\u00a0 Well... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 ... where people in power could put their finger on the scale. Congressman, will there be any accountability for all of this? JORDAN:\u00a0 Well, let's hope so. I actually -- I hope, in the end, we get a Justice Department that will hold people accountable.\u00a0 But the frustrating part is this pattern.\u00a0 Remember, it was just a few years ago where we had Lois Lerner at the IRS target conservatives for their political beliefs.\u00a0 She was brought in front of Congress.\u00a0 She took the Fifth. We had Bryan Pagliano, who set up the e-mail server for Secretary Clinton.\u00a0 He was called in front of Congress.\u00a0 He took the Fifth.\u00a0 And now we have Glenn Simpson, the guy who was paid for by the Clinton campaign, who put together this fake dossier that was used to go spy on the Trump campaign.\u00a0 He now is supposed to come in front of Congress Tuesday, and he's going to take the Fifth as well. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 So, it sounds like they're all getting away with it. JORDAN:\u00a0 This is a dangerous pattern. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 It sounds like they're all getting away with it. JORDAN:\u00a0 No, I know.\u00a0 And that -- and that's the part that drives Americans crazy. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 That's right. JORDAN:\u00a0 This idea that there's now this double standard, one set of rules for us regular folk, but a different set if you're part of the politically connected class. And that is what is -- that is what is so wrong.\u00a0 And that's why I am bound and determined we're going to subpoena whoever we have to and get the answers, and hopefully have a Justice Department who will actually prosecute -- prosecute people who deserve it. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 But there is a big if there, if you hold on to the majority. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Going into the midterm elections, all guys are wondering if these investigations even continue, because, if the Democrats flip the House, we may never hear another word about these investigations. Then there's this. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Some are calling it a new low in political discourse. Stay with us, Congressman. JORDAN:\u00a0 OK. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 I got to get your take on the comments from some top Democrats that are raising red flags ahead of the midterm elections. Congressman Jim Jordan is with us. Stay here to react. Also ahead, Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe, as well as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\u00a0 Big show ahead. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures.\u00a0 Let us know what you want to hear from all of those people who are coming up. We are looking ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Welcome back. I'm back with Congressman Jim Jordan of both the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees.\u00a0 He's also a House Freedom Caucus member. And, Congressman, as we went to break just a moment ago, we talked about the midterm elections.\u00a0 Things have gotten heated up, with your detractors and the left throwing people out of restaurants, talking about, if you don't agree with us, there won't be any civility. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Here's a former A.G. Eric Holder and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton just in the last two weeks. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:\u00a0 Michelle says, you know, when they go low, we go high. AUDIENCE:\u00a0 We go high. HOLDER:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 When they go low, we kick them. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, D-FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:\u00a0 You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. That's why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.\u00a0 But, until then, the only thing that the Republican seem to recognize and respect is strength. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Congressman, this is just extraordinary. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 We know one of your colleagues, Steve Scalise, almost died.\u00a0 He got shot in the baseball practice. JORDAN:\u00a0 Yes. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Almost dead.\u00a0 Thank God he's OK. So, no civility until the Democrats are back in control.\u00a0 Your take? JORDAN:\u00a0 No, they -- the left and the Democrats have taken the most extreme positions in American history. I said this the other day.\u00a0 They applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag.\u00a0 They embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great.\u00a0 And they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports the president. So I think this campaign, Maria, is real simple, the extreme and radical and crazy positions the left and the Democrats are now taking vs. the amazing record under the leadership of President Trump over the last 20 months. I mean, think about it, regulations reduced, taxes cut, economy growing at 4.2 percent, unemployment its lowest than 40 years, court -- Gorsuch and Kavanaugh both on the court.\u00a0 We're out of the Iran deal.\u00a0 The embassy is in fact in Jerusalem, and the hostages have come from North Korea. Frame it up like that and, if we do that, go run that kind of campaign, their craziness and what's been accomplished in the last 20 months, I think we win and we keep the majority, and they don't get to run out the clock and do all the crazy things they want to do if, in fact, they get power. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 So, has sentiment changed post-Kavanaugh, from your standpoint? What do the midterms look like right now, from your standpoint? JORDAN:\u00a0 I -- I... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Will the Dems take over the House? JORDAN:\u00a0 yes, I definitely think it's helped Republicans to see this -- for the American people to see us actually standing firm and getting done what we said we would get done. And the president has certainly done that. He's doing exactly what he promised he was going to do, what he campaigned on, and what he was elected to do.\u00a0 The House needs to do a better job, frankly. But if the Democrats take over, we will never get to build that border security wall that we promised the American people.\u00a0 We will never replace ObamaCare.\u00a0 We will never defund Planned Parenthood.\u00a0 We will never reform welfare like we need to. So that's what's at stake.\u00a0 And I think that's exactly how we have to frame it up over the next 23 days... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 All right. JORDAN:\u00a0 ... and have that kind of energy and intensity.\u00a0 And if we do, I think we win and keep the majority. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 All right, we want to keep following that. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.\u00a0 Thanks very much.\u00a0 We will be watching. JORDAN:\u00a0 You bet.\u00a0 Thank you. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Jim Jordan joining us. House Republicans may get a crack at two key players in their investigation into the anti-Trump dossier this upcoming week -- the answers they could provide and why one of the biggest players in the investigation is refusing to testify. Texas Republican Congressman, member of the House Judiciary John Ratcliffe joins me next, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Welcome back. We just heard from Congressman Jim Jordan. My next guest is one of his colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee.\u00a0 He also plans to question some key players in their investigation into the FBI's handling of the Russia probe, as well as the Steele dossier, this week. Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS that helped assemble the dossier, was expected to face the panel on Tuesday.\u00a0 He is rejecting a subpoena to testify.\u00a0 He says he's going to take the Fifth, while former FBI general counsel James Baker plans to testify on Thursday of this week. Nellie Ohr worked as a contractor for the firm.\u00a0 She is the wife of the number four executive at the Department of Justice, Bruce Ohr.\u00a0 She is set to testify on Friday. Let me bring in Texas Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe.\u00a0 He sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, as well as the Judiciary.\u00a0 He is a former federal prosecutor. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.\u00a0 Thanks very much for joining us more. REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R-TEXAS:\u00a0 Good morning, Maria. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 What's most important about this upcoming week? RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, as you know, we did subpoena Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS co-founder, the person who commissioned the infamous Steele dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. He has indicated through his lawyers that he plans to take the Fifth or assert his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\u00a0 The reason for that, Maria, is that Glenn Simpson had previously testified under oath to the House Intelligence Committee that he never met with Bruce Ohr or discussed with Bruce Ohr the Steele dossier prior to the October FISA application in 2016 or the 2016 presidential election. That is in direct contradiction to what Bruce Ohr told me under oath last month.\u00a0 So I'm not surprised if Glenn Simpson is taking the Fifth.\u00a0 He probably should.\u00a0 He's in real legal jeopardy.\u00a0 Very clearly, someone is not telling the truth. Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr's wife, certainly can shed some light with respect to that circumstance.\u00a0 But we also need to find out from Nellie Ohr, who was paid $40,000 by Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS for her work, including the work on the Steele dossier, why that fact, the fact that the wife of the number four person at the Department of Justice, who, along with her husband, had operational roles with respect to the Steele dossier, that that fact wasn't disclosed by the Department of Justice when they presented that evidence to the FISA court. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 So -- so, where is the crime then?\u00a0 Is it her husband?\u00a0 Or is it her?\u00a0 She did all of this research, which was never verified, on Donald Trump, and then put it in this dossier, and then put it on a little thumb drive and gave it to her husband at the DOJ, who wasn't even working on anything about Trump at the time. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, ultimately, the questions with respect to the FISA court and the representations that were made, remember, what we're talking about is the extraordinary measure of getting a warrant to spy on an American citizen. And if that was done under false pretenses, with false information or false verifications, then that's violating someone's civil liberties under color of law, 42-USC-1983 violation. So that's why we need to talk to Nellie Ohr and others to try and determine what the FBI knew, when they knew it, what the Department of Justice knew, when they knew it, and why those representations weren't fully disclosed to the FISA court. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 It sounds like there was a group at the top of the FBI and the DOJ who frankly didn't like Donald Trump, didn't want him to be president, so they just actively tried to stop him. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, I think that's a fair summary. The same folks that prejudged Hillary Clinton's innocence prejudged Donald Trump's guilt.\u00a0 And the same names are the same folks whose conduct is at issue with respect to how evidence was presented or not presented to the FISA court. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 You have got to explain to me how it is that somebody who OKed, gave the green light on the FISA warrant based on all of this unverified information -- I'm talking about Rod Rosenstein -- the same guy who wrote a letter to have Jim Comey fired, and then was upset that the president mentioned that he wrote the letter to get Comey fired, the same guy who is running the DOJ today who has been sitting on documents that you and your colleagues have been asking for, for more information about how this all came up, this is the same individual who's overseeing the Robert Mueller investigation? RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, the reason for that, Maria, is that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has not appointed a special counsel. Think about the extraordinary circumstance that you just described.\u00a0 The head of the FBI, acting Director Andy McCabe, and the head of the Department of Justice with respect to the Russia investigation, Rod Rosenstein, in direct conflict with one another, each accusing the other of not telling the truth with regard to whether or not someone wanted to record the president of the United States. That's why we have special counsel provisions.\u00a0 The FBI and the Department of Justice cannot be expected to fairly investigate that matter, when the heads of both of those components at the Department of Justice are in direct conflict.\u00a0 There should be a special counsel, so that we can get answers to these questions. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 But there was a lot of strategy going on here.\u00a0 There was a media leak strategy.\u00a0 Let's leak a lot of this unverified stuff to the media, so that the media can start talking about it.\u00a0 And they did. There were informants involved.\u00a0 There was a really significant strategy here in trying to take Donald Trump down, it appears to me.\u00a0 Why won't the president declassify all these documents, so that the American people can clearly understand what happened here, rather than having this hint of Donald Trump had anything to do with it in the zeitgeist? RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, that's a good question for the president of the United States. Here's what I can tell you, Maria.\u00a0 All of the documents that Chairman Nunes and others are seeking to declassify, to have the president declassify, I have seen them. And I can tell you, as a former federal prosecutor, my opinion is that declassifying them wouldn't expose any national security information, wouldn't expose any sources and methods.\u00a0 It would expose certain folks at the Obama Justice Department and FBI and their actions and their actions taken to conceal material facts from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Let me give you an example that may put this in context with -- without revealing anything that's classified.\u00a0 The underlying pretext to the entire Trump-Russia investigation, Maria, is this idea that George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign associate, had a conversation with an Australian diplomat about getting Hillary Clinton's e-mails from the Russians. Hypothetically, if the Department of Justice and the FBI has another piece of evidence that directly refutes, that directly contradicts that, what you would expect is for the Department of Justice to present both sides of the coin to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to evaluate the weight and sufficiency of that evidence. Instead, what happened here was, Department of Justice and FBI officials in the Obama administration in October of 2016 only presented to the court the evidence that made the government's case to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Right. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Declassification would corroborate what I just related to you. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Can Robert Mueller do the special investigation without looking at all of this?\u00a0 I mean, how is that investigation having any credibility if he's not actually looking at who did collude or who did work with the Russians? RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 That issue, I would advocate for the appointment of a special counsel other than Robert Mueller to look at these specific issues. With respect... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, but I want to know where the Mueller is going. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 So, where it's going, in my informed opinion as a prosecutor, is that it's winding down. I have watched closely what's been happening.\u00a0 And if you look at what the special counsel's office is doing, it's staffing down.\u00a0 Folks that are working with the special counsel team are leaving and going back to the offices from which they were detailed. At the same time, the special counsel is outsourcing and delegating investigative matters back to component agencies or component compartments within the Department of Justice and the U.S. attorney's office.\u00a0 All that signals a winding down. And it's consistent with the special counsel indicating that it will accept now written answers from Donald Trump's lawyers about all matters collusion-related to obstruction-of-justice-related. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Right. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 I think, at the end of the day, Maria, where we are headed here is no charges for collusion or obstruction with anyone associated with the Trump campaign, but a report from Bob Mueller outlining perhaps some questionable conduct, and we will be left arguing with our Democratic colleagues whether that rises to an impeachable offense, even if it's not criminal in nature. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 All right, let's take a short break. We have a lot more to cover with you, Congressman, Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe. Up next, on Saudi Arabia, it says it will not be threatened, after President Trump warns of severe punishment if the country is responsible for the disappearance of the Washington Post columnist. Back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Welcome back. I'm back with Congressman John Ratcliffe. Congressman, thanks so much for being here. We talked a lot about your week ahead.\u00a0 And we will be watching what takes place in these testimonies next week, of course. You're also on the Homeland Security Committee.\u00a0 And I want to ask you about one of the international stories of the day.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia is issuing a warning this morning following President Trump's threats over the missing Washington Post columnist. The Saudis say: \"The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether through economic sanctions, political pressure or repeating false accusations.\" There is an arms deal at stake here.\u00a0 Your thoughts on the relationship between the Saudis and the U.S. today? RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Well, Maria, very clearly, this is a gruesome allegation, that the Saudi government was involved in the slaying or alleged slaying of Mr. Khashoggi. But, again, it's still just an allegation at that point.\u00a0 I still subscribe to the theory of innocent until proven guilty.\u00a0 And unless and until we see this incontrovertible evidence that the Turkish government says that they have, I think we should certainly proceed cautiously in this area. Listen, I understand, if it is true, we need to take some punitive action against Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 But cutting off ties or ending arms deals with an ally in the Middle East only creates a vacuum for our adversaries there. Saudi Arabia may be a tenuous ally, but they are still an ally in the most volatile region in the world.\u00a0 And they have been an important counterweight to the actions of our true adversaries, like Iran and Syria and even Russia in that region.\u00a0 So we need to move carefully here. I trust that President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo and Ambassador Bolton and others will get the information they need to fairly evaluate this and determine what sort of diplomatic actions need to be taken against Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 But we need to -- we need to be very careful here. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, particularly since this is our ally up against Iran, which continues with its hate and terrorist behavior. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.\u00a0 Thank you very much for joining us. RATCLIFFE:\u00a0 Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Congressman John Ratcliffe there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 On this Election Day, November 6, every American faces a simple choice.\u00a0 You can either vote for a Democrat mob rule, or you can vote for a Republican Party that stands proudly for law and order, fairness, freedom and justice. Simple as that. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 That was President Trump last night in Kentucky making the case for Republican candidates with T-minus 23 days until Americans head to the poll. We are now in countdown mode going into the midterm elections. Joining me right now is the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy. Great to see you, Congressman.\u00a0 Thanks very much for stopping by this morning. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CALI., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much for having me back. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 So here we are, 23 days away from the midterms.\u00a0 Let's start there. I know you have been traveling the country, trying to support your colleagues across the country in different races, as well as raising an enormous amount of money for your colleagues in the Republican Party. Give us the sentiments in terms of where you see the midterms headed. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Well, I think the midterms have actually changed in the last month. The intensity level, there was an advantage on the Democratic side, but that has narrowed after viewing what the Democrats have done to Kavanaugh.\u00a0 And so I see the intensity level shifting. There is a real concern that I have, though, because Michael Bloomberg, if you watched, who recently re-registered a Democrat, he is trying to buy the Democratic nomination to run against President Trump.\u00a0 So he has put in $80 million to try to win the House. The president was just there in Kentucky because that's one of the first races you're going to want to watch, Andy Barr against Amy McGrath.\u00a0 And Amy McGrath, in her own words, this is how she describes herself, the most liberal Democrat in Kentucky. So I see this is going to be a battle because of the financial resources the Democrats have against us.\u00a0 But a number of our candidates are doing very well and have gotten a bump in the last couple weeks. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 You know, it's interesting when you look at that, because, for the longest time, the Democrats tried to say they were the party of the American worker. And yet, when you look at the donations from individuals into the Republican Party, you are beating -- you are beating the Democrats in that regard.\u00a0 But they have got a handful of big, deep-pocketed donors, like a Michael Bloomberg, like a Tom Steyer. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Just think the three -- the three individuals who are funding the Democratic Party, George Soros.\u00a0 You have got Michael Bloomberg.\u00a0 It's not just $80 million into the House.\u00a0 He put another $20 million to try to win the Senate. Then Tom Steyer, more than $120 million he has spent trying to win.\u00a0 But his main goal is trying to impeach President Trump.\u00a0 He brags that his impeachment list is bigger than the NRA list.\u00a0 Those three individuals are trying to buy our government in this process.\u00a0 It's very disturbing. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 I want to get to your bill in a moment, because I love the -- I love the name, Build the Wall, Enforce the Law.\u00a0 Yes. Let me -- let me first, though, ask you about the important races that you're watching.\u00a0 You mentioned Kentucky. What other races should we be watching in terms of a close call here between Dems and Republicans? MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Well, the first thing you want to watch, where could the Republicans actually defeat a Democrat? I would look in Minnesota, right there, Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber.\u00a0 Those are two seats that Democrats currently hold that we're in a very good fight to win. Now, you also want to watch, for your viewers, where could they help in the process, this Bloomberg money coming in?\u00a0 It's coming a great deal into California, where they're spending $10 million on individual races. But look at the open seat in Orange County.\u00a0 Here's Young Kim, an immigrant from South Korea, Republican, running against Gil Cisneros, who was accused earlier this year from a Democrat running for the statehouse of sexual harassment.\u00a0 Young Kim is leading right now. But we have seven seats in California, where I have never seen so much money being spent of them attacking.\u00a0 Then you could go out to Barbara Comstock, who is still in the lead, who is -- the Democrats have fought every time, but who has been such a big fighter. Then think of this.\u00a0 Bloomberg just sent a million dollars against Karen Handel right outside of Atlanta -- Atlanta. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Huh. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Karen won that big special election earlier this year with all that money being spent against her.\u00a0 She's one of the -- one of the hardest-working freshman and most successful legislatively we have had. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Wow. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 And then think of this, this open seat down in Miami. That is a highly Spanish-speaking district that the Democrats thought they'd pick up easily.\u00a0 They nominated Donna Shalala.\u00a0 Remember her, decades ago, in the Bill Clinton administration? BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 We have Maria Elvira Salazar, who not only speaks Spanish, where Donna Shalala doesn't.\u00a0 She was a reporter on Univision and Telemundo for a number of years.\u00a0 She knows the community. So for those out there trying to claim something different, we need the intensity level.\u00a0 We have a disadvantage with money.\u00a0 History is against us.\u00a0 But we're going to beat history.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Look at what we have done with the economy. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Look at what we have done to the VA, reforming it, rebuilding our military. Look what we have done to combat opioids, the largest comprehensive bill you have ever seen, more than $4 billion. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Right. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Stopped human trafficking, modern-day slavery online. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, and that's... MCCARTHY:\u00a0 This is about results vs. Democrats' resistance. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, results vs. resistance, you have said that now a number of times in, and it speaks accurate. Let me ask you this, because one of the big issues is immigration. Let's take a short break.\u00a0 And then I want to get into the weeds in your new bill, Build the Wall, Enforce the Law. We are talking this morning with the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy. We will take a short break and come right back and hear about the bill he's bringing to the floor. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Welcome back. I'm back with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And, Congressman, you have introduced a bill to fund the border wall.\u00a0 Tell us about it.\u00a0 What does -- where does the money come from?\u00a0 And where does the money go? MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Well, this is a bill called Build the Wall, Enforce the Law. Now, remember, Maria, we have fully funded the first request of the president to start building that wall.\u00a0 And we are at $1.6 billion. This will finish the job at 25. But it's more than just building the wall.\u00a0 What this is about is safe communities, our children, protecting them from fentanyl, protecting them from gang members and from human trafficking. So what the bill does is even further.\u00a0 It gives an advanced appropriation that fully funds the wall.\u00a0 But, more importantly, it goes in to protect them. Remember what he will do.\u00a0 Oppose sanctuary cities.\u00a0 So, for those states that are protecting these illegals, they don't get grants from the federal government.\u00a0 Or what do you think about Kate's Law, that it makes the penalties harder if somebody comes here illegally, gets deported and enters back in here? But, more importantly, it will remove the illegals who belong to gangs like MS-13 that are going into our communities and causing havoc and drugs throughout. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 We have got the pictures... (CROSSTALK) MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Plus, there's a new... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 ... at the border, which we're showing -- $16.6 billion is going to be dedicated to the physical barriers, while the rest is going to cover the technology, operations and other infrastructure costs, as you mentioned, which are all associated with border security. What are the chances of passage?\u00a0 Because we have been talking about this border wall.\u00a0 The president wanted the money available a year ago. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 And, you know, we have worked through the appropriation process. And in the House, we had the $5 billion in it.\u00a0 But that has really frustrated me in the past.\u00a0 So why don't we advance it all?\u00a0 That's why I introduced the bill.\u00a0 When we go back in session, we will vote on this in the House.\u00a0 This is what we will be taking up with the DHS appropriation bill. In the Senate, they have been lower.\u00a0 But look at what the Senate has been able to achieve when they worked together, fought hard and stayed with Justice Kavanaugh.\u00a0 I believe we can get this done.\u00a0 That's why I introduced it.\u00a0 That's why we will fight for it. And, more importantly, there's another element of this bill.\u00a0 You know what's happening out there in these Democrat-controlled liberal cities?\u00a0 They are now allowing illegals to vote, devaluing all of our votes, especially those naturalized citizens... BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Wow. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 ... to become an American citizen, taking away their power. They legally allow illegals to vote in school boards and others.\u00a0 And now, even in California, that register -- registers you to vote at the DMV, their own government acknowledged they made a mistake and have registered illegals to vote throughout.\u00a0 This is a real concern I have. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Yes, that's happening in San Francisco, right?\u00a0 That's happening in San Francisco. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 And when we put this on the floor, the Democrats voted against it. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Incredible. Congressman, we will be watching the developments.\u00a0 Thanks so much for joining us this morning. MCCARTHY:\u00a0 Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Congressman Kevin McCarthy there. President Trump welcoming home Pastor Andrew Brunson after he was detained for two years in Turkey. The panel is up next.\u00a0 We will weigh in. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0 Pastor Andrew Brunson should be freed and should be allowed to return to his family, to his home, to his church and his nation in the United States of America. The truth is, as I said earlier this week and the president's made clear, transferring Pastor Andrew Brunson to home arrest is just not good enough.\u00a0 And the United States of America is prepared to bring sanctions against Turkey until Pastor Andrew Brunson is free. (END VIDEO CLIP) BARTIROMO:\u00a0 And the pastor is home now. That was part of my exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence back in late July. Now Pastor Andrew Brunson is back home on U.S. soil, receiving a heartfelt welcome from the president at the White House on Saturday.\u00a0 The move perhaps easing months of diplomatic strain between the U.S. and Turkey. Let me bring in our panel right here on this. Lee Carter is president and partner at the communications firm Maslansky and Partners.\u00a0 Ed Rollins is a former campaign manager for the Reagan-Bush '84 for ticket and a FOX News contributor. Good to see you both.\u00a0 Thank you so much for joining us. ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you. LEE CARTER, GOP POLLSTER:\u00a0 Nice to be here. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Your thoughts on the pastor? ROLLINS:\u00a0 This wouldn't have happened if the president and Pence and others hadn't put pressure on them.\u00a0 They have putting pressure for two years, and the reality is, this is very, very important.\u00a0 They already convicted him, unjustifiably. He would have sat for another two or three years in jail if Trump had not beat on Erdogan to make this happen.\u00a0 And where this is important is the evangelical community, which is a very important part of our political base, wanted this man, who was unfairly imprisoned, to come home.\u00a0 And I think it's a great thing. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 It has been a priority for President Trump to bring home these people who have been imprisoned... ROLLINS:\u00a0 Absolutely, from the get-go. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 ... whether it's Turkey or elsewhere, Iran as well. Is this resonating with the American people, Lee, going into the midterms? CARTER:\u00a0 I think it's really important going into the midterms. President Trump has done really well on these issues where he's had to be strong, negotiate, get people home, or do things that people said he couldn't otherwise do.\u00a0 This is one of those moments. And that visual of the pastor praying over the president yesterday is one that is energizing the Republican base.\u00a0 You can see it in social media tracking.\u00a0 And that kind of thing is really, really important going into the midterm. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes. ROLLINS:\u00a0 Without paying hostage money, which is what Obama did repeatedly. So, I mean, the bottom line is, this -- just using the powers of the American public, our economic powers, and our military power to really put pressure on. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Yes, and he said it many times.\u00a0 We will not pay ransom money. You will release these people. ROLLINS:\u00a0 That's right. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Let me ask you. We just had this conversation with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about the money raised.\u00a0 This is where the Republicans are at the disadvantage, right, Ed?\u00a0 You got Michael Bloomberg giving $80 million, Tom Steyer tens of millions, George Soros paying the activists.\n\u00a0\nROLLINS:\u00a0 Majority Leader McCarthy has done a fabulous job of being out there, raising money, trying to -- trying to supplement this. But it's overwhelming.\u00a0 And we have a lot of close races.\u00a0 At this point in time, I think we have probably lost already 14 or 15 of our House races because of the open seats.\u00a0 And we're down really where we got to win everything else that is on the board. And it's -- when you are talking about a million dollars a week in L.A., and we have got four or five congressional seats in L.A. area, if it wasn't for McCarthy's effort, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't even be in the game. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 He's raised something like $70 million or something from various... ROLLINS:\u00a0 Well, unfortunately, the speaker didn't step aside.\u00a0 And so McCarthy has really stepped in and filled in the blanks, and I think has done a superb job. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 People were surprised that Paul Ryan didn't step aside sooner. Lee, what do the elections look like from your standpoint? CARTER:\u00a0 Look, I think that we have got to be looking at more than money. We have also got to be looking at the message.\u00a0 And I don't think the Democrats have a consistent message.\u00a0 And I don't think that they necessarily understand what the American people are looking for. When you look at where we are right now, a lot of people say that it's likely going to go to the Democrats.\u00a0 I don't see the same thing, because some late-breaking trends right now are indicating to me that Republicans could have a much better time than we think. One of them is being voter enthusiasm.\u00a0 Voter enthusiasm is matched to Democrats now.\u00a0 For the first time, Republicans, in a number of months, it's 79 Republican, 81 percent Democrats as far as voter enthusiasm.\u00a0 That's within the margin of error. When you look at the issues that are most important to them, people are talking about how health care is the number one issue.\u00a0 But then you follow that by immigration, taxes, the economy.\u00a0 Those are issues that Republicans do really well on. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Right. CARTER:\u00a0 So I think that it's a lot closer than people are thinking. And I don't think it's a landslide or a shoo-in by any stretch. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 They could hold on to the majority. Real quick, Ed. ROLLINS:\u00a0 We are certainly going to pick up two or three Senate seats.\u00a0 I think we're very strong on that. In the House -- the biggest problem with our House is, we have those 40 open seats. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 All right, we will leave it there. Because you got 40 retiring or resignations. ROLLINS:\u00a0 Retires.\u00a0 Otherwise -- otherwise, we wouldn't even be sweating this. BARTIROMO:\u00a0 Ed Rollins, Lee Carter, great to see you both.\u00a0 Thank you so much. Have a great day, everybody.\u00a0 That will do it for us.\u00a0 I'm Maria Bartiromo. And I will see you tomorrow on Fox Business, \"Mornings with Maria.\" END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" May 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. INGRAHAM: Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" A historic day and two huge exclusive interviews for you. We've got the inside story on Trump pulling the plug on the Iranian nukes deal. In my exclusive interview with National Security Advisor John Bolton. He will also update us on North Korea talks as Secretary of State Pompeo just landing there for a second visit. Plus, in another angle exclusive, the Israeli ambassador to the United States tells us what the end of the Iran deal means for his country and the entire Middle East. We are also watching important primary races around the country tonight. We are going to take you to Fox election headquarters when the results come in. And did the met gala in New York salute religion or mock it? Raymond Arroyo will tell us in our \"Seen and Unseen segment\" and Joe Piscopo is here to talk \"Saturday Night Live\" bias in the dearth of comedy. But first, when #metoo becomes he too. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Just a few hours after the New Yorker broke its story charging New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman with abusing four women, he resigned his office. Now isn't it rich that he set himself up as the hero of the #metoo movement by using his office to sue Harvey Weinstein? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman: Women were coerced into facilitating Harvey Weinstein's misconduct, sometimes they were targets themselves. If they refused they were threatened. They knew how pervasive it was and not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up. We have never seen anything as despicable as what we have seen here. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I guess it takes one to no one. Schneiderman was also the darling of the anti-Trump media and fellow Dems for challenging Donald Trump's nearly every move. He has filed over 100 lawsuits or administrative actions against the president trying to stop his DACA plan, the travel ban, health care deregulation. It went on and on. If Schneiderman quickly became a champion of the left resistance, a kind of superhero, which was how comedian and fan girl, Samantha Bee, attempted to frame him on this now scrubbed episode of her show. (VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It depends on what getting engaged means. Next time, Samantha, be careful. That's so bad. Did we really write that? Next time do a better job choosing your superheroes. I've got to say, he did like to dress up apparently, so maybe this superhero thing does work. Well, Schneiderman tries to explain away the charges against him this way, he said, \"In the privacy of intimate relationships I've engaged in role- playing and other consensual activity. I have not assaulted anyone.\" Superman didn't beat the hell out of Lois Lane, Eric. Four women romantically involved allege that Schneiderman abused them, including claims that he smacked, spit on, choked, and demeaned his victims. What a guy. He threatened to tap their phones or have someone follow or even kill them if they attempted to leave the relationship. As New York's highest-ranking law enforcement official this is the guy who attended the Women's March alone, by the way, with Harvey Weinstein. And he would later use his prosecutorial authority against Weinstein and fought to get his victims greater compensation. It was Eric, thank you, thank you, thank you. As his profile rose as a leader of women in the wake of the \"Me Too Movement,\" his victims were persuaded somehow to come forward. But they met their own resistance from the left. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In those conversations after the fact, a lot of their friends and loved ones said don't do it, don't speak out against him and in some cases that was because they feared the risk of reprisal, but also in some cases those friends warn them off of talking because they thought he had the power to do too much good for the Democratic Party. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Wow. In other words, so long as Schneiderman was willing to use his office to block the Trump agenda and was working to tear down Trump, keep your tales of abuse quiet, ladies. Take one for the team. What's a little collateral damage, right? It reminds me of how Harvey skated for so many years. Sure, he had money and he had power to make or break a career, but he also had the right political views. He had the coolest friends and all those politicians he raised millions for, valuable commodity. But back to Schneiderman. Most of them knew or should have known about his history, a lot of the Democrats, people were championing him. A lot of the allegations against him. But they kept on their blinders, again, how convenient. If this were a Republican, he would be decried on every cable show with barely a break for breaking news on the Iran deal. But instead of going after Schneiderman for his misdeeds and his abuse of office, today's never- Trump media merely used the scandal as just another vehicle for trashing conservatives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Democrats have tried to be very consistent when members of their own have been called out to draw a contrast, but there is not a lot of indication that this administration, unfortunately likes to take the high road. Taken down by lifting women up. What a bizarre world we live that Donald Trump is accused of sexually harassing dozens of women and admits that he assaulted women on tape and yet people like Mike Pence talk about what a great Christian he is. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One of the president's biggest foes, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned over abuse allegations. Is this a tipping point for Trump? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Wait a second, is this a tipping point for Trump? How about is this a tipping point for the left and the people who claim to be protecting America's women or is slapping, choking, spitting, making women of color call him master acceptable behavior? Well, until it's discovered. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway certainly reached her tipping point yesterday. She nailed Schneiderman's hypocrisy when she tweeted out, \"gotcha\" above a Schneiderman tweet where he wrote no one is above the law and I will continue to remind President Trump and his administration of that every day. Instead of acknowledging Schneiderman's loathsome and perhaps even criminal behavior, Planned Parenthood action, that's the political arm of the abortion giant decided to go after, wait for it, Kellyanne. They tweeted out, \"Kellyanne, delete your account.\" OK. What all this tells us is what so many of us have thought really for a long time. The left, while claiming to be the true honest champions of women at many times at many points consider them to be disposable, especially when they become politically inconvenient. Eric Schneiderman was a stalwart political ally of the left, but he's out of the picture now, so move on, quickly, move on. And it's back to vilifying Trump and any woman who supports his agenda. Are any of you fed up with this rank hypocrisy? We too. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining us now for reaction is Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and RNC committeewoman in California along with Monica Crowley from the London Center for Policy Research. OK. We have so much news to get to, Ladies. Let's start right here. The resistance loved Schneiderman because he represented for them this kind of superhero. You saw that Samantha Bee absurd little cartoon skid that you try to scrub off of her website until someone grabbed it first. He was a hero and then when he was exposed, literally and figuratively, they kind of brushed that aside and quickly move on. We get rid of people fast and you Republicans, you defend Donald Trump. Monica, how to respond to that? MONICA CROWLEY, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH: That's a complete b.s. argument, Laura, because the Democrats will only throw over those who are accused of this kind of stuff when it's politically expedient for them to do so. For example, Senator Al franken from a reliably Democratic state, Minnesota. If, for whatever reason, his seat was somehow in play for a Republican they would have fought tooth and nail to preserve the guy. I mean, that kind of argument really doesn't hold a lot of water. The Democratic Party now for decades has protected men who have advanced the left-wing agenda and in particular the pro-abortion. You go back to Ted Kennedy, who actually kills a woman and yet when he died he was praised as a lion of the Senate and a real champion for women. Same thing with Bill Clinton until just recently. It is a remarkable thing that the Democrats for so many years have said we embrace humanity in the abstract, but when it comes to actual individuals, actual people and actual women, they tend -- not everybody, I don't mean to make a sweeping generalization here, but some of their most high-profile men that they have celebrated have abused and assaulted women who have been closest to them. INGRAHAM: You know what's just wild? If you go back and listen to his comments, we played one in THE ANGLE. He could be describing himself. You men who abuse women and threaten them, talking about of course Harvey Weinstein. It really could have been just a narrative about the charges these women are now making about him and they were in a consensual relationship that were twisted and slavish and abusive, et cetera, et cetera. When you watch the way this is being covered, even certain Republicans -- there was this woman, Amanda Carpenter who used to work for Ted Cruz. She was on MSNBC today I guess pushing a book. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: It is infuriating when I say -- I'm going to call out the women. Women who are believed to be Christians like Kellyanne Conway, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, McDaniels, go out and send hush payments, money to an alleged child molester in Alabama. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Harmeet? HARMEET DHILLON, RNC NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN: That's ridiculous. The moral equivalence is not there. The big difference between a consensual relationship in a private settlement versus sexual assault and violence as multiple Democrats have been accused of as Monica mentioned. The fact that this guy was forced to resign within three hours, you know what that tells me? It tells me that Democrats knew. Democrats were silent. They did not have any qualms about rushing to judgment because he's been doing this for eight years. The fifth woman came out today in \"The New York Post\" and told a story about a story in 2010 when he drove drunk, slapped her, choked her, demeaned her, et cetera. Don't tell me for a minute that Democrats close to this guy didn't know, his staff knew. Staff transportation was used sometimes with these women and his staff was used to deny the story to the New Yorker. They should be looking in the mirror today. The reason that Democrats quickly got rid of him in the evening was to hope that there wasn't going to be a news cycle around this today, but we do need to talk about it. We need to talk about the fact that this man was allowed to get away with this for so many years, that he was hiding in plain sight with all the statements. There were a lot of people, (inaudible) one of the famous people mentioned in the story who know about this because he dated one of the women who was abused by this guy. All of these people kept silent because of the greater good, the moral relativism. INGRAHAM: You heard what Ronan Farrow said in an interview. I really salute his reporting on this. A young kid, 30 years old. He says -- I'm paraphrasing, he said it wasn't going to look good for the Democratic Party, Monica and -- DHILLON: The relativism, it's shocking. Everything is OK if you love abortion. CROWLEY: That's absolutely true. The other part of this equation that is so important is the blatant hypocrisy part. I want to make this really clear. When you have a politician running for high office who professes to be a champion of family values, essentially a choir boy and then they are caught in something like this, the whole thing blows up. Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, they never professed to be a choir boy. Neither did Eric Schneiderman, but the difference with him is he was the chief law enforcement officer of the state of New York. He was the attorney general, very close to the governor, obviously wanted higher office. This is the man whose hypocrisy came in a different form. He was attacking Donald Trump in a whole range of ways. He was attacking Harvey Weinstein and using his legal authority as attorney general to go after these men. Properly so, but you know what? Those who shout the loudest are often the ones with the biggest skeletons in their closet and that's the problem with Eric Schneiderman. INGRAHAM: The buddha says the finger is always pointed back at you. The more judgmental I guess run the risk, no one is perfect here. Some of the headlines that we have seen recently about this. Again, the left-wing superhero Eric Schneiderman. The real reason the left loves Schneiderman is they thought his neck he would take Donald Trump. Eric Schneiderman is gone but the New York legal resistance to Trump will go on. They think this new acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood would be a breakthrough attorney general if she received the permanent nomination from I guess the governor appoints her, Harmeet. She has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court. She clerked for Thurgood Marshall. She's a reliably liberal. These cases against the president will go on. Some people think on legal blogs that I was reading, all of it should be considered fruit of the poisonous tree in a way because of this tainted figure who was running these investigations and running these prosecutions. But the cases against Trump and I think treating Trump as the big nemesis and maybe you can take some of the Mueller investigation under New York jurisdiction, so he couldn't fire anybody. The left is still going crazy about all of that tonight. DHILLON: The left is going crazy about it, but the new attorney general is a career person. I don't think it's possible for somebody to be as biased and frankly is psycho about Trump as Schneiderman was. I think that maybe they will take a step back. There are Democrats who opposed Trump around the country, but they haven't been as vicious and personal as Eric Schneiderman and I have to think that the skeleton in his closet is one reason why he couldn't come to terms that he's that person and he sort of focused it on Donald Trump instead. A lot of even liberal commentators have pointed out that a lot of his anti- Trump legal actions have been sort of a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. There's this of filing stuff, very little comes out of it. INGRAHAM: It was about him. Monica, I will let you close it out. Burnishing his own reputation and when Andy Cuomo thought I'm going to run for president, he wants to run for president. He had to be road kill for Cuomo. He had to get him out of the way because he wants to be the Democrat nominee against Trump in 2020 or against some Republican if Trump for some reason doesn't run. That's why they got rid of him so fast. CROWLEY: It's a big loss for the left in this sense. You are right about Cuomo. He threw him overboard like that. Again, political expediency. The other part of this is that Schneiderman was going after Donald Trump and his administration at the state level because the argument was if you prosecute Trump and members of his administration and palaces of the state level that is immune from a presidential pardon. So now the left is going we lost our main guy, so we will see if his replacement does the same thing. INGRAHAM: We've got to find a quickie replacement to get Trump out of office because lord knows we are losing all the substantive arguments. Fantastic panel, thank you both. Stay right there for insight on today's huge news you will not see anywhere else in moments. My exclusive interview with National Security Advisor John Bolton on a major breakthrough in the North Korea talks and the inside story of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuke deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today's action sends a critical message. The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises I keep them. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: President Trump made the historic decision today to withdraw the U.S. from the nuclear deal with Iran. He also signed a memo slapping tough sanctions on the Iranian regime. U.S. allies have complained that leaving the deal could be dangerous, but the president said it's more dangerous to keep the deal in place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT TRUMP: The Iran deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing we know exactly what will happen. In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons. At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction, that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program. Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: On top of that, more huge news. The president announced that the time, date and location have been set for a settlement with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now in North Korea for a second time to pave the way for the talks. Moments ago, I spoke exclusively with president Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton about today's developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: OK, this is a big day today. People are freaking out. The usual suspects are freaking out. A couple of other not so usual suspects. This is what the Democrats said about this deal back in 2015 when Obama had negotiated it. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ, D\u2014NEW JERSEY: The whole purpose of our negotiation was to ensure that there would be no pathway for Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capabilities. This deal doesn't achieve that. SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER, D\u2014NEW YORK: This agreement is too flawed and too dangerous for us. REP. STEVE ISRAEL, D\u2014NEW YORK: I read the joint comprehensive plan of action last night, over 100 pages. I will be honest, I was skeptical going in. There's nothing I read last night that alleviates my skepticism. (END VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The fact is the deal has been flawed from the beginning. I think the president laid that case out in his statement today. He gave the Europeans and others a chance to fix it. It was not doable because the flaws go right to the foundations of the deal. He did what he clearly advertised he was going to do as far back as the 2016 campaign, pulled the united states out of the deal. Why? Because it's in our security interest to get out of this flawed deal. INGRAHAM: John Kerry today explained why he was doing his own little version of talking to Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE (via telephone): Until today, until this afternoon the policy of the united states of America was to be in the Iran agreement. Until today, our nation remained one of the guiding forces within that agreement and only today did the policy change. My conversations with these people have been normal conversations that I assure you every former secretary of state has with leaders of other countries and all I did was suggest to them, you guys really ought to try to keep the agreement. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: John Kerry's objective was to get a deal. It's not surprising John Kerry's objective today was to keep the deal. It's the wrong objective. The objective should be to prevent Iran from getting deliverable nuclear weapons. The deal not only didn't accomplish that objective, in many ways it facilitated Iran's efforts. What President Trump did by pulling out of the deal is get back to what the real objective should be, stopping this dangerous regime from threatening us and our friends around the world with nuclear weapons. INGRAHAM: John Brennan, another good pal of yours, former CIA director, he said this about how the whole development with the Iran deal could affect our conversation with North Korea. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I can understand how it helps in any way the ongoing discussions with North Korea and the efforts to try to denuclearize the peninsula. It totally undercuts the credibility of America's word. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOLTON: As on so many other things Director Brennan is flatly wrong. In fact, he's 180 degrees in the wrong direction. As President Trump said this sends North Korea signal that we are not in these discussions with Kim Jong-un just to have a deal. We are in them to denuclearize North Korea. It's an indication of how serious President Trump is. As he said, when he says he's going to do something, he carried through on it. INGRAHAM: Iran today said they are going to continue to try to abide by the terms of the deal working with Russia, China, France and beyond. How do you respond to that? BOLTON: I think Iran has demonstrated in so many ways it couldn't care less about the restrictions of this deal. What it wants are the economic advantages that Obama and Kerry gave to them. Of course, it will try and keep those.But we will see, I think the real performance is going to put them in a position where our European friends have got to come along and put sanctions back on and to do what we've already begun to an extent, we will do even more tomorrow.Work with the Europeans and others not only on nuclear issue but on Iran's ballistic missile development, its continuing support for terrorism and its military activities that jeopardize our friends like Israel and the Arab states in the region. INGRAHAM: Samantha Powers, former U.N. ambassador for Obama tweeted this about what this deal and leaving it did, \"Trump has demolished America's credibility and paved the way for Iran to restart its nuclear program. Trump has done the unthinkable, isolated the U.S. and rally the world around Iran. The cost of using military force have only increased.\" Basically, she's arguing that we could be getting closer to a war with Iran because of what you guys did today. BOLTON: Once again it's exactly the opposite. This deal didn't stop the nuclear weapons program. That's part of the problem. INGRAHAM: But they did get inspection. They did have some inspection of sites they got to choose. Where their inspections before the deal of any type that were useful? BOLTON: There were, but they are certainly not adequate on the critical issue here of Iran's military activities before now and continuing. We saw from what the Israelis released, although the data went back some years, Iran clearly had a weapons program. We don't know the full extent of it today and by allowing this deal to continue we were simply giving Iran more time to get closer to nuclear weapons. INGRAHAM: The former U.S. ambassador to NATO said it essentially today a month-long effort by the U.S. closest allies to persuade President Trump to stick to the deal has failed. The failure not only dooms the deal itself but also shows that when it comes to U.S. foreign policies, policy, allies no longer count. Is that the message that Macron, he comes, has a great state dinner. We have, of course, the German chancellor in town, Angela Markel and they feel like they are second-class citizens here. America will go her own way. BOLTON: That statement was just completely the opposite of what the president's view is and it's why we are going to continue to work with the allies to do something effective about Iran's malign influence in the Middle East and not taper it over and pretend that we've actually stopped them. INGRAHAM: The president's way of making decisions is fascinating. He likes a lot of input even though he campaigned against the Iran deal repeatedly saying it's the worst deal ever, when did he finally decided to leave the Iran deal? BOLTON: I think just before the speech really. INGRAHAM: Before the speech? BOLTON: The process you've described is accurate. For people who don't understand how the president considers these things, he doesn't make spur of the moment decisions. He has listened to everybody who wanted to talk to him up to and including over the weekend with Prime Minister May of Great Britain. He gave every one of them a chance to try and fix the deal, and unfortunately they didn't come close because the deal itself is inherently flawed. Iran should not have uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities. That's what we are going to ask of North Korea. That's what we ought to be thinking of. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: So what can you tell us about Pompeo's trip to North Korea? We see Kim Jong-un was walking on the beach today with the Chinese leader. This is all tangled up in U.S. trade policy too, and Lighthizer and company didn't get any real progress that we know of him with China last week on their big trip. We need China to help with North Korea. Are they an honest broker? Tell us what's going on here. BOLTON: There's a lot of parts in motion, and Secretary Pompeo should be arriving in North Korea right now. He's there to talk about the preparations for the Kim Jong-un summit with President Trump. We are going to pursue this as aggressively as the president pursues any negotiation and see if we can't reach a historic deal. INGRAHAM: Are we going to get these hostages back that we should've gotten back a long time ago? BOLTON: The president said quite some time ago, I've repeated it, we want these people released. They shouldn't be part of the deal. INGRAHAM: It shouldn't be part of the deal? BOLTON: It should happen before the deal. INGRAHAM: OK, so is that going to be you are going to let these people free or this is off, is that where we are going? BOLTON: Mike Pompeo is on the peninsula now. We'll see how this comes out. Keep your fingers crossed overnight. But let's not miss the question as well of what the meeting with Kim Jong-un itself is going to produce. INGRAHAM: Are you having fun in this job? BOLTON: I'm having a great time. INGRAHAM: This is kind of like your dream job. Let's face it. You are over at the U.N. and the State Department, and you have kind of seen it all. But you are right in the thick of it in historic times. BOLTON: It's even more fun than being a FOX News commentator. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: They think you are the devil. You are the Trump whisperer, you're getting them to do all neoconservative stuff, and you say? BOLTON: I'm doing the best I can, but I think everyone should understand on the national security advisor, I'm not the national security decision- maker. He makes the decision. He knows what he's doing. INGRAHAM: John Bolton, it's great to see you, thank you for joining us in primetime. BOLTON: Glad to be here. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Our thanks. That was a fun interview with John Bolton. And the end of the nuke deal has put Israel on high alert and a war footing, concerned that Iranian forces in Syria may attack. Up next, the Israeli ambassador joins us for analysis on what today's news means to America's closest allies in another \"Angle\" exclusive. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The end of the Iran deal is even bigger news in Israel believe it or not then it is here. Joining is now exclusively to react to today's event is Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer. Mr. Ambassador, thanks for being in here tonight. This is a wild day. The globally -- AMB. RON DERMER, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: A great day. INGRAHAM: A great day for America, our security, that of our allies in the Middle East. But the global elite, one after the other came out, even since my sit-down with John Bolton, Hillary Clinton just tweeting Iran is now more dangerous. She said anyone who thinks bombing is the answer is woefully misinformed, et cetera, et cetera. I didn't put the whole thing up there. But John Brennan, former CIA director, also coming out, simultaneously the president lied about the Iran nuke deal, undermined global confidence in the U.S. commitments, alienated our allies. This is a danger to America's national security. Obama same thing, it's one after the other after the other. And you say? DERMER: Israel disagrees, and this is something that unites Israelis across the spectrum. The prime minister gave a full-throated endorsement to what President Trump did today. Look, there were people three years ago who said this deal was going to actually going to push more further away, and if you didn't do this deal than it was going to bring more closer. The exact opposite has happened. We argued then that this deal, by giving all of these billions of dollars to Iran, was going to fuel Iran's war machine and we would see its effects in the Middle East. And that's exactly what you have seen over the last three years, in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen. Iran is far more dangerous today because of this deal. INGRAHAM: They have the cash. DERMER: The chances of war are much higher because of this deal. What President Trump did today is he took a deal that basically puts us all on cruise control heading over a cliff, because in a few years all of those restrictions on Iran's nuclear program are going to automatically removed and then Iran doesn't have to sneak in or break into the nuclear club. They can just walk into the nuclear club. And he turned the wheel. That doesn't mean that there's not more challenges, but at least we know we are not heading off a cliff. And right now what Israel is dealing with our acute security challenges that actually increased in the wake of the deal. So it might be the people in Britain and in France and in Germany think the world is safe, but the people who actually were the guinea pigs in this experiment, the Israelis and the Arabs who came out both -- INGRAHAM: And you mention that obviously the Saudis came out big time in support, other Arab nations. DERMER: And the Emirates gave a public endorsement of this because they have seen the consequences for their own country. And as I've said for years, when Israelis and Arabs are on the same page, people should pay attention. We were the guinea pigs in this experiment. It has gone very wrong, and we are very grateful for President Trump for making this courageous decision to shift course. And we hope that other parties now will unite behind his leadership and actually get a deal that will prevent Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons and confront them. INGRAHAM: You have all these Democrats like Schumer and Menendez, all these people who were saying how rotten the Iran deal was when Obama was about to enter into it. Now you don't hear so much from them. By the way, I know you are going to be thrilled to hear that R.T., Russian television website, is saying the Israel lobby is calling the shots in Trump's rollback policy on Iran, Max Blumenthal, who I know you know well. So now President Trump who has been campaigning for years against this deal and speaking about it, apparently you are the one calling the shots. So it's either John Bolton calling the shots or the Israel lobby calling the shots even though the president has been single-mindedly focused on this issue for years. Unbelievable. DERMER: It's been no secret what Israel's position has been on this deal. The prime minister of Israel came to Congress and spoke up against this deal. And what he said at the time, people should remember, is that the danger of the deal is not that Iran is going to violate it and get the bomb. It's that they can keep this deal and they can walk into an entire nuclear arsenal. What Prime Minister Netanyahu showed last week, last Monday, were the secret archives where Iran was keeping in these vaults all the information they need. INGRAHAM: I love the props he had. All the binders, that was great. DERMER: What are they doing with that information? They are going to use it in the future, and they want to use it to have nuclear weapons. And that's why this decision was -- INGRAHAM: The Trump critics don't let me look at the evidence, facts get in the way of my thinking. Tonight Golan Heights is on high alert. Reports from multiple outlets, I believe the BBC and others, Time magazine reporting that Israel attacked Syria an hour after the Iran deal was ended and that a couple missiles were intercepted by the Syrians, and Israel has not yet responded. What is happening? DERMER: I'm not going to confirm those specific reports. I can tell you that Iran has a policy to try to establish military bases to attack Israel in Syria. We have been very clear that that's a redline for us, that we are not going to allow Iran to establish those bases. INGRAHAM: Syrian army bases were apparently -- DERMER: Iranian bases and Syria from which to attack Israel. And Iran has vowed in recent days to launch attacks against Israel. So we will do whatever we have to do. INGRAHAM: Why does Israel not confirm or deny whether it hit these bases that are in Syria that are run by the Revolutionary Guard if indeed it's in Israel's national security interest? I'm just curious. DERMER: I will leave it to all sorts of speculation. We get accused of many things that we don't do, and this is our policy. But we are very clear, the prime minister has been very clear about what his redlines are. We are not going to allow Iran to establish a permanent military base, bases in Syria. We are not going to allow them to transfer sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah, which is effectively in control of Lebanon. And we are very serious about enforcing those redlines and we will do whatever we have to do to defend our citizens. INGRAHAM: What's the difference between the relationship, if you could elaborate a little bit very briefly, between President Trump and Bibi Netanyahu and Bibi and Obama? What's the difference. Allies obviously, but what's the difference, the feel, the tenor? DERMER: First of all, the prime minister and the president have a wonderful relationship. It's a very warm one and a very close one. They also see eye to eye on the major challenges facing the two countries. INGRAHAM: President Obama did not. DERMER: He did not. He thought this deal, and he said he thought -- INGRAHAM: Not just on this deal. On a lot of other elements. DERMER: President Obama thought this deal was better for America and better for Israel, and I think he was being sincere. I think he was wrong, but Prime Minister Netanyahu thought this was a very dangerous deal. President Trump thinks this is a very dangerous deal, and that has actually brought us together. And the relationship between Israel and the United States under President Trump has never, ever been stronger. INGRAHAM: Are you going to be there for the new unveiling of the embassy? DERMER: The moving of the embassy, which is another great decision that is going to happen this week and we deeply appreciate that. INGRAHAM: I didn't get my invitation. DERMER: You are invited to our independence day event right here in Washington on May 14th celebrating the 70th year of Israel's birthday. I'm going to have to host that event here so I'm not going to be in Jerusalem for the opening of the U.S. embassy, but we are very grateful. And this is a historic day that will resonate for generations and generations to come. INGRAHAM: We are so let delighted you came back and were able to talk to us tonight. Thank you so much Mr. Ambassador. DERMER: Pleasure. INGRAHAM: And up next, the fashion industry gets religion at the Met gala, or do they? And farewell tours that never end. Remember Barbra Streisand's? Seen and Unseen with Arroyo next. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Time now for our Seen and Unseen segment. We need some type of stage. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm waiting for that graph. INGRAHAM: I'm going to do shadow puppets. We expose what's really behind the big cultural stories of the day, including last night's outrageous Met gala. The theme was heavenly bodies, fashion and Catholic imagination. Hollywood and the fashion industry showed off their finest, but did they cross the line into sacrilege? Here with answers, New York Times bestselling author and FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo. Now, we are just spoil sports here, because honestly, as Cardinal Dolan said in New York, there's nothing offensive here about this, Raymond. I'm sure if they did a gala representing the Prophet Mohammed in curious ways everybody would be celebrating it over at CAIR tonight, right? ARROYO: This is to show the Catholic imagination. INGRAHAM: Who is this? ARROYO: That's Katy Perry. Katy Perry in her angel wings. The stars traditionally come out. The theme -- this is Sarah Jessica Parker with a nativity atop her head. There's the problem with all of this. INGRAHAM: What. Baby Jesus is up there? ARROYO: Yes. There are some Catholics that look at this and they say these vestments that are on display from the Vatican, they mean something. And what they mean, they point to the reality of the mass. And Catholics believe in the mass. Jesus himself becomes present. That's what all the smells and bells and the art and the architecture is about. When you remove that meaning you are left basically with a very glitzy drag show. INGRAHAM: Why are they doing this? What did Dolan give? ARROYO: The Vatican. No, the Vatican gave sacred vestments to be displayed at the Metropolitan Museum. They should have attached -- they really should have put some conditions, though, on the line. That's Cardinal Dolan. Cardinal Dolan, it turns out, did you see Rihanna earlier? She had the papal miter on. INGRAHAM: Do we have the Rihanna photo? ARROYO: Apparently that is Cardinal Dolan's lighter. He admitted today he loaned Rihanna this miter. They retrofitted it for her. She returned it today. So I'm sure there are some people -- INGRAHAM: When Brad Pitt wants to go get a Halloween costume is he going to give it to him too? It's ridiculous. ARROYO: Go to Cardinal Dolan's house. INGRAHAM: They're not going to do it. They wouldn't allow it. Jewish people wouldn't allow this, rightly, and the Muslim people wouldn't allow it. It would be considered disrespectful. The Christians and the Catholics you can always trash. Dolan helps them apparently. ARROYO: Last week we were talking about a girl in Utah who wore a Chinese dress and people said you are culturally appropriating. This is misappropriating religion. Here's my biggest problem with it. Next to these sacred vestments that Popes were, what you have on display, put this other item. There were other fashion, these designers created other items including a bondage mask with rosaries on it. You can't see it, it's on the righthand side there. And look at this other thing. This is Catholic inspired -- INGRAHAM: Shower curtain. ARROYO: Shower curtain with a very low cleavage. This is side-by-side with people vestments. INGRAHAM: A bondage? As Dolan, is he standing near the bondage hat? What is going on with that? ARROYO: Cardinal Dolan said this was to bring up the good, the beautiful, and the true. INGRAHAM: And the letter. ARROYO: It's very hard to see that through this narcissistic -- INGRAHAM: This is 50 shades of Catholicism here. I'm going to get in all sorts of trouble. ARROYO: I know. It's right on the edge of sacrilege, but we'll forgive you. INGRAHAM: Forgive me. OK, let's move on. Our next topic of course -- ARROYO: Retirements in the farewell tours that never end. I know you've gotten in line for some of these. Elton John, 71 years old. INGRAHAM: Is it finally goodbye yellow brick road? Finally, gone. ARROYO: Except he's going to be saying goodbye for the next three years. INGRAHAM: Is he going to weddings? I hear he did Russia's wedding years ago. ARROYO: He did. But this goodbye tour is going to last for three years,300 concerts he's going to do to say goodbye. Apparently Elton John, Joan Baez, Paul Simon, Ozzy Osbourne, Anita Baker, they are all retiring. INGRAHAM: Anita Baker, I love her. She's a great voice, but she's not exactly filling arenas. This is like Spinal Tap. Remember Spinal Tap? Remember in Spinal Tap when they're like used to fill arenas where now it's filling 800 seats in theaters or 1,000 seat theaters, and they thought we are still relevant. ARROYO: Look at Ozzy Osbourne. He retired in 1992, and now he's back. INGRAHAM: This is great! The left will be really happy. ARROYO: I dug this up. Cher, the farewell tour of Cher. Can you play that bite quickly before we run out of time? INGRAHAM: Cher, I got you babe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHER, SINGER: OK, so I always wanted to do this. This is the last time I'm going around. And really this is the last time, OK? I promise you I am not lying, this is so farewell. I am so totally farewell honestly, OK. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: OK. Do you know when that was? 2002. She is still back -- in fact you can find her right over here at the MGM. Do you know what it proves? Old acts, they never die, they wait for the next booking. Like me. I'll be back next Friday. INGRAHAM: So are we going to announce that we're retiring? ARROYO: We retiring. This is a farewell tour. INGRAHAM: It's going to go on. ARROYO: Beyond Friday. INGRAHAM: But Barbra Streisand promised us she was retiring. ARROYO: I remember. I got $1,000 in the hole. INGRAHAM: This is like the rug stores. The rug stores. ARROYO: Going out of business. INGRAHAM: They are going out of business. We lost our lease. Then you drive by, the kids are like, mommy, that rug store, what does lost lease mean? That's been up there for 10 years. ARROYO: Laura, if you think it's the last time you will pay double. INGRAHAM: Garth Brooks, didn't he retire? Barry Manilow? ARROYO: Not yet. INGRAHAM: That's still going on. Former stars of \"Saturday Night Live\" are forming their own resistance against the show's relentless leftwing bias and gasbags. Up next one of those voices is here, don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Joe Piscopo is the latest \"Saturday Night Live\" veteran to call out the show for its leftwing tilt and constant Trump bashing. But what did he think of porn star Stormy Daniels' appearance this past week? Joining us now live from New York is Joe Piscopo. Joe, great to see you. I grew up watching all the greats, Jane Curtin and Phil Hartman, Eddie Murphy. This is comedy to end all comedy. Your era of the show was great. Now it's so political that I think it turns a lot of people off. And then this weekend reality hits comedy I guess and Stormy shows up. JOE PISCOPO, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\": I'm not part of a resistance. What were you, like nine years old when you were watching? INGRAHAM: Thank you. I appreciate that during PISCOPO: Seriously. I have such immense respect for \"SNL.\" that's where I come from and I'm so appreciative and grateful for everything that the show has given me, so I don't mean to criticize it at all. I had a nice conversation with Maria Bartiromo, and we started just joking back and forth about Stormy Daniels and now a porn star is on \"SNL\" and how did we get here? I don't even get on \"SNL.\" It was a joke. And then of course it just blows up. INGRAHAM: So you are now stepping back, Joe, because you probably got some blowback from your old pals at \"SNL.\" I'm just guessing. PISCOPO: No. I'm not stepping back at all. It was a mistake to put Stormy Daniels on the program. The show is better than that, and I don't back down -- I will double down and triple down on that. And what gets me really upset is when people tell me what to say, how to say it and what to think, and that's not going to happen. I'm on the radio every morning, I'm going to bed now, I've got to get up in a couple of hours on AM 970. And the one thing we always say. We say what we want, I don't care about the political correctness, the people don't care about Stormy Daniels. We don't care about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. I don't care about LBJ. I don't care about John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. We don't care. Tell me about North Korea, tell me about the Iran deal, tell me about infrastructure, tell me about helping the inner cities. INGRAHAM: That's a riot. That's a laugh riot, the infrastructure. PISCOPO: The fact of the matter is, Stormy Daniels has no place -- why didn't they get Kristen Wiig to play it? I just happened to mention that, but it was wrong to put her on. This is a role model? I don't go back on what I said. INGRAHAM: I actually like a good laugh. We are all punk-able. PISCOPO: Maxine Waters, how funny is Maxine Waters? How funny is Adam Schiff? INGRAHAM: Where is Sheila Jackson, have you ever done Sheila Jackson Lee on \"Saturday Night Live\"? Really do Nancy Pelosi the way she really should be done. I want to play Baldwin doing Trump over the weekend, let's watch, compilation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEC BALDWIN, ACTOR: Siri, how do I kill ISIS? (LAUGHTER) BALDWIN: This is a BlackBerry. (LAUGHTER) BALDWIN: Thank you, judge, or what you call a lady judge, a flight attendant, something like that. (LAUGHTER) BALDWIN: Testing, testing, China, China, huge China. (LAUGHTER) BALDWIN: Vladimir is an amazing person and he knows me better than anyone. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I actually like the little Vladimir Putin guy. But what I think happens in comedy today is that you lose kind of it -- I'm really dating myself, but Rickles could be really cutting and rude, but it was hilarious. And if you are being spoofed, you laughed right along with it. PISCOPO: You're right. I'm a huge Alec Baldwin fan, I will tell you straight up, and I don't back down on that, either. I always admired the man's talent. You've got to laugh a little bit, and I would suggest, and I've said this before, when I did Ronald Reagan and we took shots at Ronald Reagan, we did it with respect. But what did they do? And I said this before on the network here, Laura, Ronald Reagan invited me to the White House. And then when I met the great gipper and I shook hands with his great man, it changed my life. It changed my whole political outlook. You know what I'm saying? I'm saying everybody has got to lighten up. Donald Trump should invite Alec to the White House. Everybody has to stop the hate. Stop the hate. We can laugh a little bit. Don't put porn stars on national television. We don't need that. That's all I'm saying. INGRAHAM: Got it. Joe Piscopo, thanks so much. When we come back, a special day in history, but will any students even have known about it? We'll fill you in next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Today was V.E. day. Seventy-three years ago the allies declared victory over Nazi Germany. But how many public school students, private school students for that matter, learned about this historic sacrifice that the day represents, one of the most important days in American history? The answer, sadly, is not many. The U.S. government's most recent report card found that only 18 percent of eighth graders scored proficient or better in knowledge of U.S. history, 29 percent had less than basic knowledge. A survey in February found two- thirds of American millennials could not identify Auschwitz, 22 percent hadn't heard of the holocaust. This isn't a small issue. Either we learn history, our nation's founding, our constitution, or my goodness, about the mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. Remember to tweet me your thoughts @IngrahamAngle about the show. Things you want us to cover on the show, or just criticisms of Raymond. That's all the time we have tonight.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster: Putin or the Democrats? For some today it\u2019s not so easy - Time out:\u00a0Almost Heaven\u2026 on a bun -\u00a0Trump reportedly wanted Russia charges pre-summit - Roby rolls to victory despite past trump criticism\u00a0- Smells like schnitzel PUTIN OR THE DEMOCRATS? FOR SOME TODAY IT\u2019S NOT SO EASYWe seldom notice the way that technology changes us. It happens gradually and, as individuals, we tend to be poor observers of our own behavior. That goes for politics, too. Think, for example, how the technologies of ultrasound and neo-natal care have shifted the discussion about elective abortions after the first trimester. But technology also changes the business of politics. Much of the work of campaigns and elections used to be hunches and gut instincts. We\u2019ve only had modern polling past 60 years or so, and for most of that time what surveys could reveal was pretty limited.\u00a0 But in the past three decades, the same kinds of market research tools that big companies use to try to sell you fish sticks and Fords became part of politics. As data was changing the way we do everything, it was changing politics, too.\u00a0 The dawn of the digital age kicked that all into overdrive. Campaigns used to have to guess at what voters wanted. Now voters go online and by their blabbing and the digital breadcrumbs they leave behind from their searches and page preferences show campaigns who they are and how to best persuade them.\u00a0 The ability to both identify and persuade voters has been a substantial factor in what\u2019s moving Americans apart these days. Thanks to being able to chop the electorate into such tiny pieces, candidates are able to put together winning coalitions without having to do much persuading.\u00a0 The time when candidates felt obliged to have a broad-spectrum message is fading in favor of building and maintaining a political base.\u00a0 Aside from the obvious cultural damage that it does to divide and divide and divide and divide voters, it also has some very unhappy consequences as it comes to the politicians themselves.\u00a0 No politician has embraced the concept of base politics with the vigor of\u00a0Donald Trump. He knows what his voters want and he is determined to give it to them. And if that enrages Democrats and turns off moderates, so much the better.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s obsessive base maintenance has helped him in governance at many points. His Supreme Court picks and tax cuts are aimed at keeping faith with the folks who elected him. And whether you like them or not, Trump\u2019s immigration clampdown, trade war and pummeling of our traditional allies is part of that too. It\u2019s not like he kept these things a secret when he was running.\u00a0 But Trump\u2019s tunnel vision has led him to the lowest low points of his presidency, including this week.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s expressions of moral equivalency between the United States and Russia, feverish conspiracy theorizing and attacks against his fellow Americans on stage with Vladimir Putin\u00a0must have sounded pitiful to most.\u00a0 The country has become inured to Trump\u2019s rhetorical excesses. The constant outrage with which Trump\u2019s outrageous statements were met during the 2016 campaign and at the beginning of his presidency was simply unsustainable, so folks both for him and against him started tuning Trump out.\u00a0 But in the moment where the words of a president arguably matter most, Trump\u2019s comments struck home even among those who had become numb to his shock-jock routine. Presumably, Trump felt free to speak from the heart in Helsinki because what he said reflects the views of some of his most stalwart supporters. It\u2019s certainly not a majority of the country, and it may not even be a majority of Republicans, but among a substantial number of Trump voters, the idea that\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0is worse than Putin is completely obvious.\u00a0 As we have said many times before, there\u2019s a chunk of the electorate that wouldn\u2019t even care if Trump\u00a0had\u00a0colluded with Putin. And if all that happened was that Putin helped Trump win the election, to these folks that says only good things about the Russian strongman. When Putin smirked to\u00a0Chris Wallace\u00a0that what was in the emails his agents stole was true and therefore appropriate to release, he was echoing a Trump campaign talking point.\u00a0\u00a0 Those same political hatreds well nurtured by the divisive politics of our time have put us in a point where at least a quarter of Republicans think Putin is an alright guy, according to polls. They no doubt see his interference in the election as a good thing since it was, in their minds, for the correct side.\u00a0 Our rotten politics has infected seemingly everything in American life, and that goes for our foreign policy too. Yes, there were American left-wingers who preferred the Soviet Union to the GOP, but vanishingly few would have ever felt comfortable saying so. Now, it\u2019s acceptable among some ring-wing sects to pick the Kremlin over the Democrats.\u00a0 What Trump discovered, though, is that his base is not as big as he thinks it is. The painful walk back you watched Tuesday, much like the one he tried to execute last summer in the face of another base maintenance debacle concerning the white nationalists in Charlottesville, reflected that realization. What some Republicans like about Trump \u2013 the things you saw in Finland \u2013 most Republicans only tolerate for the sake of obtaining their preferred policy outcomes. And Monday was too much for the normies.\u00a0 But what got Trump to the point that he felt free to speak so freely in front of Putin is the fact that in our sliced and diced electorate, the passionate support of a chunk of the electorate is more valuable than having broad support.\u00a0 THE RULEBOOK: AIR SUPPLY\u00a0\u201cBut it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 10TIME OUT:\u00a0ALMOST HEAVEN\u2026 ON A BUN\u00a0 Happy National Hot Dog Day, dear readers. While we strenuously object to the proliferation of fake holidays, we will not pass up this excuse to tell America the truth about frankfurters. We know that from Coney Island to Chicago to Chavez Ravine there are many local favorites for what constitutes hot dog bliss. But we think it\u2019s time to tell you the truth: West Virginia hot dogs are the best. To make the ideal West Virginia hot dog, start with not a jumbo beef frank, but a humble weenie with a little snap to its casing and a light spice in its filling. Cook it on a griddle and nestle it in a pillowy soft bun. Apply yellow mustard, raw white onion chopped finer than baby\u2019s breath and then the sauce.

Deputy Attorney General\u00a0Rod Rosenstein\u00a0went to Trump last week and offered him the choice: before or after the Putin summit on Monday in Helsinki? Trump chose before, ultimately putting the issue into the spotlight just 72 hours before the high-stakes meeting, the people said. In the end, Trump faced a torrent of bipartisan criticism for suggesting he was leaning toward accepting the Russian president\u2019s denial that his government was behind hacking during the 2016 presidential election, even though Trump had hoped the indictment of 12 Russians on charges of meddling would give him the upper hand, one of the people said.\u201dAccording to Trump Russia will \u2018help\u2019 with NoKo -\u00a0Reuters:\u00a0\u201cPresident Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Russia would help with North Korea and offered an enthusiastic update on the U.S. process of negotiating with the antagonistic Asian nation over nuclear weapons. \u2018Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along,\u2019 said Trump on Twitter. \u2018There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!\u2019\u00a0At the same time the tweet was published the RIA news agency reported that a summit between the leaders of Russia and North Korea is \u2018on the agenda.\u2019\u201dPompeo to testify before Senate on summit -\u00a0The Hill:\u00a0\u201cSecretary of State\u00a0Mike Pompeo\u00a0will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week, where he's expected to face a grilling over the summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Trump. Pompeo will publicly testify before the committee on July 25, a GOP aide confirmed to The Hill. His testimony will come a week after Trump sparked intense, bipartisan backlash in Washington when he appeared next to Putin at a joint press conference in Helsinki, Finland, and denied that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d ROBY ROLLS TO VICTORY DESPITE PAST TRUMP CRITICISM\u00a0Montgomery Advertiser:\u00a0\u201cDespite a five-candidate primary which forced her into a runoff, Rep.\u00a0Martha Roby\u00a0on Tuesday silenced critics with a decisive victory over former Rep.\u00a0Bobby Bright\u00a0for the Republican nomination in Alabama's 2nd congressional district. Roby won another shot at her fifth term Tuesday, bringing home 48,277 votes to Bright's 22,767. The Associated Press called the race less than two hours after polls closed. A seasoned politician whose first taste of campaigning came at age 26 in a Montgomery city council race, Roby approached the GOP primary and subsequent campaigning in a business-as-usual manner. But Roby has been fighting for her political life after weathering accusations of disloyalty, and she took the dais at her watch party with a tone of impassioned gratefulness and a clear exhale.\u201d S\u00e1nchez announces bid for Dem Caucus chair\u00a0-\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cRep.\u00a0Joe Crowley\u00a0has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since his shocking June primary loss as his colleagues have begun openly plotting to succeed him. Rep.\u00a0Linda S\u00e1nchez\u00a0(D-Calif.), the No. 5 Democrat behind Crowley, brought that battle to the forefront Tuesday by officially announcing her bid for Democratic Caucus chair. Rep.\u00a0Barbara Lee\u00a0(D-Calif.), S\u00e1nchez\u2019s opponent for vice-chair in 2016, has also said she\u2019s strongly considering jumping in the race.\u00a0\u2026S\u00e1nchez\u2019s announcement tees the caucus up for a months-long leadership race that likely won\u2019t end until after Thanksgiving.\u201d Arizona Rep. rips his colleague McSally amid bitter primary -\u00a0Arizona Republic:\u201cRep.\u00a0Paul Gosar, a conservative Republican from northwestern Arizona, broke from traditional norms and endorsed former state legislator\u00a0Kelli Ward\u00a0for the U.S. Senate over his colleague Rep.\u00a0Martha McSally. In a statement announcing the endorsement, Gosar questioned McSally\u2019s conservative Republican credentials, a public broadside to the conservative image she has been peddling to primary voters as she seeks the GOP nomination for Arizona\u2019s open Senate seat. \u2018We cannot afford another establishment patsy who promises one thing and votes differently,\u2019 Gosar\u2019s statement said. \u2018Arizona has suffered for years with a lackluster senate delegation that promised one thing during the election and did another back in D.C. \u2014 Kelli is not like that. Her opponent, Martha McSally, is. In my time working with Martha, I found her, though likable personally, to be very inconsistent politically.\u2019\u201d House Republicans falling behind in midterm fundraising -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cAn unusually large number of House Republican incumbents were outraised by their Democratic opponents in the past three months, more stark evidence of GOP candidates' money woes, which continue to expand the number of seats susceptible to Democratic takeover. Democrats in 56 House districts surpassed Republican incumbents in second-quarter fundraising, according to a POLITICO analysis of the latest Federal Election Commission filings. Sixteen of those House Republicans finished the quarter with less cash in their campaign accounts than Democratic opponents, while no Democratic members lag their Republican challengers in cash.\u00a0It\u2019s a financial trend line that has gotten worse for Republican candidates over the past year, even as megadonors pour millions into the House GOP super PAC \u2014 a reflection of Democratic intensity that has coursed through the party\u2019s donors and voters since President Donald Trump\u2019s election.\u201d Cuomo donor gave enough times to drive down average donation amount -WashTimes:\u00a0\u201cAlways be a man of the people; especially if you can game the system to look like one. At least since Sen.\u00a0Bernard Sanders\u00a0turned it into a talking point that the average donation to his 2016 presidential campaign was $27, politicians have touted a small figure as proof they run a grassroots campaign and aren\u2019t the product of a few big donors. According to a report Tuesday in The New York Times, the campaign of Gov.\u00a0Andrew Cuomo\u00a0took it to a new level, taking absurdly small amounts of money from people to make the average donation size smaller. Some of those donors were dedicated though. The Times reported that in the run-up to the reporting deadline, donor\u00a0Christopher Kim\u00a0contributed 69 times. But 67 of those donations were of $1 each.\u201dDem's campaign manager quits after video shows candidate secretly backing gun ban -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cThe campaign manager of a Democrat seeking a U.S. House seat in upstate New York quit the campaign Tuesday, after a video showed the candidate saying she wouldn't publicly endorse a ban on certain firearms -- for fear that she\u2019d lose the election.\u00a0Mike Szustak, who since April had run the campaign of candidate\u00a0Tedra Cobb, told the Watertown Daily Times that he\u2019s no longer part of Cobb's bid to unseat Republican incumbent\u00a0Elise Stefanik\u00a0in New York's 21st Congressional District. The departure follows revelations that Cobb won\u2019t publicly state that she favors banning assault rifles. The video was first revealed by the Washington Free Beacon. Fox News also reported on the video.\u201d Trump spends the most on political FB ads -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s official: President Trump is the single biggest political advertiser on Facebook. Mr. Trump and his political action committee spent $274,000 on ads on the social network since early May, outpacing the second-biggest spender, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care. Planned Parenthood spent just over $188,000 on Facebook ads over the same period. The ads bought by Mr. Trump and his PAC were also seen the most by Facebook\u2019s users, having been viewed by at least 37 million people since May. That compared with 24 million people who saw the second-most viewed group of political ads, which were also from Planned Parenthood.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYHouse passes ice resolution\u00a0-\u00a0Roll CallHouse looks to match Trump\u2019s border wall request\u00a0-\u00a0WaPo Calif.

Missouri is sitting right at the top of my inbox for the next Senate race rating update. I think this one is getting ready to ripen and I promise we will be doing a deeper dive on the subject very soon.] \u201cMy husband and I had about convinced ourselves to support Trump in 2020, even though his behavior is disgusting at times, but seeing the look on his face during that presser was a tell.\u00a0 I don't\u00a0know\u00a0what he is hiding, but this seems to be deal ender.\u00a0 How many times can he escape to live another day.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Karen Morrow, Tampa, Fla.[Ed. note: I would only caution you, Ms. Morrow, to not put yourselves in a box. Had the Democratic nominee in 2020 been, say,\u00a0Tim Kaine\u00a0or some other moderate-sounding, ethical person with the requisite experience there are millions of Republicans who might not have voted for Trump. Some would have voted for the Dem, but many others would have felt better about the idea of a protest candidate. The peril that Clinton represented in the eyes of many conservatives was real, and her own ethical quagmires were rank enough to deny the Blue Team the opportunity to really hit Trump where it hurts.\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0likes to say, \u201cDon\u2019t judge me by the Almighty. Judge me by the alternative.\u201d And for all of the remarkable and unsettling things about the 2016 election, one part remains inescapable: Democrats chose their worst nominee in a couple of generations. I\u2019m quite certain that Trump stands a very good chance at getting re-elected despite this most recent meltdown. This is, after all, the same guy who equivocated over the murder of a protestor by a white nationalist and still can claim the support of about four in 10 voters. One of the main reasons Trump stands such a good chance at re-election is that Democrats right now do not look like a party inclined toward moderate outreach toward persuadable voters. It\u2019s doubtful Trump could get as lucky as he was in 2016 with a candidate like Clinton, but never say never.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.SMELLS LIKE SCHNITZEL\u00a0London Telegraph: \u201cStaff handed out free deodorants to passengers on\u00a0Vienna\u2019s notoriously stuffy U6 [subway] line this week, and it appears the initiative was popular: the entire stock of 14,000 deodorant sprays was grabbed in a single day, and plans for a second distribution have had to be shelved.

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the rare step Monday of releasing her DNA test results examining her possible Native American ancestry, tries to eliminate critics' line of attack against her. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s heavily promoted DNA test showing she likely has some Native-American ancestry\u00a0ended up handing more fodder to Republican critics, who\u00a0pointed out the test results indicate she could actually have less Native-American heritage than the average European American. Meanwhile, President Trump on Monday afternoon added new conditions to his earlier offer to donate $1 million to a charity of her choice if she took a DNA test as part of a debate challenge. \"I'll only do it if I can test her personally,\" the president told reporters while touring Hurricane Michael damage along the Gulf Coast. \"That will not be something I will enjoy doing either.\" Warren, D-Mass., took the rare step Monday of sharing\u00a0DNA test results examining her long-challenged Native-American bloodline. \u00a0According to the analysis, as first reported by The Boston Globe, \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Warren\u2019s family tree is European and there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d she has Native-American ancestry \u201cin the range of 6-10 generations ago.\u201d As reported by the Globe, this means she could be between 1/64 and 1/1,024 Native American (though the newspaper initially published an erroneous figure and had to correct it). Republicans countered, though, that\u00a0having such a trace amount of Native-American heritage should not give Warren \u201cthe right to claim minority status\u201d -- as she was accused of doing to advance her career at Harvard years ago. \u201cWarren might even be less Native American than the average European American,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Reed said in a statement Monday. He also cited a 2014 study\u00a0that puts Warren's claims in perspective. The study, published by a team of scientists in late 2014 and featured in\u00a0The New York Times, amounted to the largest-ever genetic profile of the U.S., based on 160,000 people. The study examined the average Native-American ancestry for Americans\u2014including European, African\u00a0and Latino Americans. According to the Times report on the study, which can be found on the National Institutes of Health website, \u201cEuropean-Americans had genomes that were on average 98.6 percent European, .19 percent African, and .18 percent Native American.\u201d WARREN RELEASES DNA ANALYSIS ON NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE, FIRING BACK AT TRUMP ATTACKS For Latino Americans, the average percentage of Native-American ancestry was 18 percent; while African Americans\u2019 average was .8 percent. If Warren is 10 generations removed from a Native-American ancestor, she would be no more Native American -- .09 percent -- than any of the groups studied in that research. If she's 1/64 Native American, it amounts to 1.5 percent, or greater than the average European American. Warren, who is mulling a 2020 presidential run, repeatedly has been mocked by\u00a0President Trump\u00a0for claiming Native American heritage. Trump has dubbed her\u00a0\u201cPocahontas\u201d for months. But in apparent response to those jabs, Warren produced a video for her Senate re-election campaign playing up the results of her latest DNA test. In it, Warren says: \u201cThe president likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?\u201d Stanford University Professor Carlos D. Bustamante, who did the analysis, replies: \u201cThe facts suggest\u00a0that you absolutely have Native American ancestry in your pedigree.\u201d Warren used the Globe report to directly respond to Trump's charity challenge. \"By the way,\u00a0@realDonaldTrump: Remember saying on 7/5 that you\u2019d give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry? I remember \u2013 and here's the verdict. Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center,\" Warren tweeted, including a link to the group's website.

            "article_content": "From abortion to gay rights, the Republican appointee's legacy is examined on 'Journal Editorial Report.' This is a rush transcript from \"Journal Editorial Report,\" June 30, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. PAUL GIGOT, HOST: Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. And we begin this week with a dramatic end to the Supreme Court's term. Justice Anthony Kennedy announcing his retirement Wednesday, giving President Trump his second vacancy to fill in a once-in-a-generation chance to cement conservative control of the nation's highest court. The 81-year- old Kennedy stepping down after 30 years and setting up a confirmation battle in the Senate just before the midterm elections. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Bill McGurn, editorial board member, Allysia Finley, and editorial features editor, James Taranto. James, what difference is it going to make for the Supreme Court without Anthony Kennedy? JAME TARANTO, EDITORIAL FEATURES EDITOR: Anthony Kennedy was an unusual member of the courts, particularly after Justice O'Connor left. He was the most heterodox of the nine justices. I use the word \"heterodox\" advisedly. He was often called a moderate. He's really not a moderate. He has very strong views on subjects, but they don't always line up with the traditional liberal conservative dichotomy. He's very much in favor of gay rights, he's very much in favor of free speech, whether it's a liberal free speech argument or a conservative free speech, so he was something of a wild card on the court. Most likely, the new justice will be more apt to line up with the other four Republicans -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Well, that could be the case. Although, Dan, it's interesting, because if you look at his First Amendment jurisprudence, for example, Kennedy was very, very strong. Wrote the Citizens United decision, for example, on campaign finance and free speech. And there's no guarantee that his replacement, even if a so-called conservative, is going to be as strong on, say, the First Amendment or even on states' rights. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST/DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, that's right. All of these nominees when it comes down to the Supreme Court, intelligent person, they have their own minds. By and large, they are able to identify whether they will vote most of the time with conservatives or the liberals. But there's no real predicting. And a lot of these issues have been in play. I think, the First Amendment, going forward, is going to be a big one as people begin to argue that the First Amendment should give weight to things like hurtful speech. In the last term, Justice Gorsuch, in one of his interesting concurrences, said he would like to revisit the Fourth Amendment on searches and seizures. He thinks it's very unclear. He thinks the court ought to do some housecleaning there. It's a little hard to predict, other than as James suggests, probably the next nominee will align with the conservatives. Almost certainly. GIGOT: All right, Allysia, let's talk about the politics of this. Already, we are seeing the Democrats react with horror at this place. They are still very sore over Merrick Garland not getting a vote in President Obama's last year in office. But Congress has confirmed many, the Senate has confirmed many judges in midterm years. ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: I think that's right. Elena Kagan was, David Souter. You can go to Justice Scalia. Several nominees from both parties have been confirmed during a midterm year. GIGOT: The filibuster is no long -- FINLEY: Right. But you can blame Harry Reid for that. In 2013, because he wanted to basically pack the D.C. circuit so that they could reinforce the Obama regulations. GIGOT: That was for appellate courts. FINLEY: That's right. GIGOT: Then with the Gorsuch nomination, the Republicans decided to get rid of it for Supreme Court nominations, but that's, in part, because the Democrats opposed Gorsuch. FINLEY: Right. They didn't want to allow confirmation. That's because, partly -- well, I think you saw Manchin, Donnelly and Heitkamp essentially did vote -- GIGOT: Three Democrats. FINLEY: Three Democrats did vote but they would not have allowed Trump to get any nominee onto the courts. GIGOT: They supported Gorsuch, and they wouldn't have unless the Republicans had shown in advance that they had the votes to confirm. FINLEY: That's right. GIGOT: I think the Democrats would have been a lot smarter to support Gorsuch and retain the filibuster for this nomination. BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Absolutely. They have nothing going in. A couple of things. One, the fact that they are reacting so strongly tells us the Supreme Court probably looms too large in our life. GIGOT: Could not agree more, Bill. MCGURN: I mean, and the fact that Justice Kennedy often substituting his personal beliefs for the law. That's a problem, whichever side comes out. I think one of Justice Kennedy's great contributions, though, in those decisions where it went south was producing some of Justice Scalia's greatest dissent and most memorable phrases about, you know, fortune cookies and so forth. But I think that the reason the Supreme Court especially looms large for the left, it's their preferred legislature. Right? They would rather work through and get five justices to put something through that couldn't make it through the Democratic system, especially on state-by-state basis. And that's why they are so very upset at this. GIGOT: James, our friends on the left are already saying this is going to be the end of abortion rights, the end of gay marriage, but I really do not see that happening, even with a fifth conservative vote. I think, certainly, Chief Justice Roberts will be very cautious about overturning any of these --- any of those precedents. TARANTO: I think gay marriage is here to stay. It's never going to be overturned. How would you undo all of these marital contracts that have already been entered into by the people all over the country? On abortion, I think it's quite possibly that eventually Roe v. Wade will be overturned. I think it will take years. It will probably take at least six justices. I think they will proceed cautiously. GIGOT: Yes, they will proceed cautiously. But, James, I'm not sure even the conservatives on the court will overturn it at this stage, Roe v. Wade. It would be very, very disruptive. I don't know. Dan, what do you think? HENNINGER: Yes. I think that's right, especially John Roberts being chief justice. He's very aware of the court's reputation. I think that part is overblown. Make no mistake, the liberals are going to elevate this issue during the battle over abortion rights, women's rights, minority rights, health rights. They will try to make it a big political issue. The problem is, that could animate conservatives and Republicans to turn out in November. I think the Democrats are in a very, very tough spot with this nomination, politically. GIGOT: All right, thank you all. When we come back, from free speech to affirmative action, a look at Anthony Kennedy's legacy and how the Supreme Court is likely to change with his retirement. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: A Ronald Reagan appointee, Justice Anthony Kennedy was at the center of many court's biggest decisions over the last three decades, casting the key vote in landmark cases involving abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, guns and campaign finance. Ilya Shapiro is editor-in-chief of the \"Cato Supreme Court Review.\" I spoke with him earlier about the Kennedy legacy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) Ilya Shapiro, welcome. Let's talk about Justice Kennedy and his legacy. You wrote this week that while you ended up agreeing where justice came out on a lot of cases, you disagreed with the way he got there. Explain that. ILYA SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CATO SUPREME COURT REVIEW: Yes. Part of the rule of law isn't just getting the right results, but the reasoning matters. That's why the Supreme Court explains itself so people can follow how the law develops, what it means, what the Constitution means. And Justice Kennedy didn't follow kind of conventional jurisprudential methods, be that originalism and textualism, be that legislative history or the purpose of a given law or anything in particular. People tried to evaluate -- I certainly did -- how he got to the answer in a lot of different areas of law, but often there was a simple inscrutability. He seems to find, for example, the equal dignity clause with respect to gay rights, or the idea that a civilized society doesn't pass laws that harm people, for example, rather than importing either a national rights theory of the law or involving constitutionalism or anything. So, yes, I agreed with him a lot. He was probably the most Libertarian justice, although that's a low bar. But a bit of a black box as well. GIGOT: And I agree with you, I think, on his racial jurisprudence. For example, he didn't give clear guidance, even though he was swing vote on issues like university racial preferences. But on the First Amendment, for example, I think that he had actually a very clear sense of what was legal and constitutional under the First Amendment. He provided the key fifth vote. For example, he wrote the opinion on Citizens United. And had a lot of these First Amendment cases gone the other way, his vote, we would have a diminished free speech right. SHAPIRO: Yes, that's one of the exceptions that proves the rule that I was talking before. Absolutely. Justice Kennedy was actually not the swing vote on First Amendment cases, Citizens United or otherwise. He was the most pro-free speech justice that we've had in quite some time, maybe ever. You saw that in several opinions this term, this past week, whether with the compelled speech with public sector unions or crisis pregnancy centers or Masterpiece Cake Shop, for that matter. Very solicitous First Amendment protections. GIGOT: Let me push back again. I think, if you want to describe Kennedy's jurisprudence, one way to do it would be that he a kind of jurisprudence of personal liberty that is -- that led him to, for example, the social left on abortion rights and gay rights, but on free speech and gun rights and even property rights, led him to what we would call the right. But that was the consistency of the core of his jurisprudence. What do you think about that? SHAPIRO: Again, you're trying to make consistent claims across issues and I don't think it holds up. You mentioned property rights. He was one of the votes for the government, for the development agency in Kelo v. New London, that you can take property from a private business or individual and give it to another private actor. And so, again, it's harder to contextualize across issue areas. Certainly, he was for personal liberty in many ways, but not in the way that Libertarian, not in the way that Cato Institute or other classical liberal organizations or scholars might like. He didn't apply national rights theory or any other way that you might describe. Like Gorsuch, like Neil Gorsuch, the newest justice, I think is dedicated to. And so it really depends on how it fit into his view of the world. In certain cases, the Constitution's structural protection for liberty, be that federalism or separation of powers, were very important. And he was a key vote on the Obamacare case, for example, fully in line with striking it all down. But in other examples, Raich versus Gonzales, the federal government, yes, apparently can regulate plants that you grow in your own backyard. That was a medical marijuana case. GIGOT: Right. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: All right, fair enough. I agree with you, there's some inconsistency there. But on the balance I would say he did strike -- he did tend to support cases that helped a clear definition of the separation of powers. But I want to talk about Neil Gorsuch. His first year on the court, very important term. How do you think he did? (CROSSTALK) SHAPIRO: I think he did really well. He very quickly has become my favorite justice. He's the only PhD on the court, and his approach is very philosophical, very first-principles oriented. You saw that, for example, in his opinion in Carpenter v. United States, relating to whether the police need a warrant to get cell phone location data. And although, technically, Gorsuch was dissenting from that ruling against the criminal defendant for the government, that dissent was a concurrence in all but name. He had some technical reasons there. But calling for a fundamental rethink of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence not to be tied to 50-year-old precedent about the reasonable expectation of privacy, which, after all, is judge made. Even more than Justice Thomas who focused on property-right aspect of the Fourth Amendment, Gorsuch really looked at, have you taken steps to protect your personal effects and papers, whether that's digital, contractual, property or otherwise. You can see that again and again in textual and first-principle constitutional cases. He really wants to go back to that well. GIGOT: One question about the future of the court after Justice Kennedy. A lot of people on the left are saying that Roe v. Wade, abortion rights are in jeopardy with a new justice. Do you think that that --- that Roe v. Wade would really be overturned at this stage? SHAPIRO: Not Roe v. Wade itself or Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which was, of course, Kennedy's standard about the undue burden and all that. But with John Roberts presumably moving to becoming the median justice -- GIGOT: Right. SHAPIRO: -- which is the case we have another Gorsuch, he's an Incrementalist and a Minimalist, so I doubt that he would want sweeping over-rulings of a whole slew of controversial precedents. But he would be more likely to uphold restrictions. So some of the restrictions that have been overturned or struck down in the last little while on abortion and other things would be upheld without necessarily overturning some of these long-standing precedents. GIGOT: And gives state a chance to regulate a little more but upholding the fundamental right. Ilya Shapiro -- SHAPIRO: I think that's right. GIGOT: -- thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. SHAPIRO: My pleasure. (END VIDEOTAPE) GIGOT: Still ahead, a blockbuster end this week to a banner Supreme Court term. From First Amendment rights to public union workers to President Trump's travel ban, our panel looks back at Justice Neil Gorsuch's first year on the court and Anthony Kennedy's last. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Even without the Kennedy announcement, the Supreme Court this week wrapped up what can only be described as a blockbuster term, with the justices handing President Trump a big win in his so-called travel ban, and public-sector unions a big defeat in their effort to collect fees from non- union workers. We're back with Dan Henninger, James Taranto, Allysia Finley, and Bill McGurn. Bill, what's your big takeaway from this? MCGURN: Well, I think we had some blockbuster cases. Janus alone is a huge one. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: This is a --- (CROSSTALK) MCGURN: On the funding of whether public unions can coerce dues from people who don't want to pay them. So this is a huge victory. I think it's a victory subsequently for the First Amendment. But it's a huge defeat for a lot of the Democrat interest groups because they've used this money that they were able to coerce from people in politics. I think, likewise, the First Amendment case on the pregnancy centers in California. They're not going to have to be compelled to give out abortion information and so forth. The travel ban, of course. I think the travel ban is in a separate category, because I think, if it was anyone but President Trump (CROSSTALK) MCGURN: -- that wouldn't have even been an issue. It might not have even got to the Supreme Court. What's interesting about this with Kennedy is, normally, he's known to be the fifth guy voting with the liberals on a case. There were nineteen 5-4 decisions and none of them in this term did Kennedy join with the liberals for a majority. GIGOT: Any other cases that you'd cite, Allysia, major cases this year? FINLEY: I think the Carpenter decision, which came out last week, where Justice Roberts sided with the four liberals in expanding, basically, the Fourth Amendment to cell phone records and cell phone data. And the way he did so was kind of hazy and it could be extended. But this has never been this case. (CROSSTALK) FINLEY: The Fourth Amendment has never applied to third-party data. So he set a new precedent that could really make it harder for law enforcement and national security to do their job. GIGOT: Dan, what do you make of Neil Gorsuch's first term? HENNINGER: I thought Gorsuch began to establish himself as a clear and independent voice. And as Ilya Shapiro was suggesting in the interview, Neil Gorsuch, he's a young -- I think, Paul, he's a young member of the court. Probably, he will be joined by another young member of the court. And some of these younger judges, I think, feel that, over the years, the Supreme Court has become muddled. A lot of the law is simply unclear in areas like the Fourth Amendment, possibly, in the First Amendment as well. And I think he's going to spend a lot of his time going forward kind of being the voice of clarity about the Constitution on the court. And I wouldn't be surprised if the new judge joining him, say, Amy Barrett, for instance, from Notre Dame, if perhaps she's the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on the appellate court in D.C., are going to join him in that effort. GIGOT: James, what about the liberals this year? They won a couple of cases, certainly with Carpenter. What do you make of the divide that I think you see emerging between Breyer and Kagan, on the one hand, and then Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsberg on the other? TARANTO: Yes, this divide, we have seen it for a while. In the Obamacare case, in 2012, Kagan and Breyer joined Roberts and the conservatives in striking down the medical -- limiting the Medicaid expansion. So this is something that we have been seeing for a while. Sotomayor and Ginsburg, particularly Sotomayor, seem to be much more about issuing a cri de coeur in favor of their vision of equality or what have you. And it is an interesting divide. It's not entirely homogeneous. GIGOT: Well, and I think that with Kagan, the calculation may be that she's willing, in particular --- she's very shrewd. She may be willing to go with the chief justice to form a majority as long as it is a fairly narrow decision. I think the Masterpiece Cake decision, where the baker got the right not to bake the cake, wedding cake for -- (CROSSTALK) TARANTO: Or the administrative law case, which she wrote a 6-3 ruling with the other three liberals on the other side. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Exactly. That's correct. But in both of those cases, you had a relatively narrow ruling, and not a landmark ruling on the fundamental constitutional principle. Do you agree with that? TARANTO: Yes. And Masterpiece Cake Shop was a Kennedy ruling. And this was a case in which Kennedy reached a middle-ground result because he was balancing two values that he believes very strongly in, gay rights, on the one hand, and freedom of conscious on the other. GIGOT: Any big takeaway from you, James, on this term? Any other takeaway? TARANTO: I think that the biggest thing is these two cases that came out this week, the Janus case on union agency fees and the NIFLA v. Becerra case on crisis pregnancy centers, these were two cases that the court said very strongly you cannot require people to say things that they don't believe, you can't require them, in effect, to take an oath against their conscious. And that was an important thing that needed to be said. GIGOT: Dan, is the chief justice going to emerge as the swing vote, do you think? HENNINGER: Yes. I don't think there's any question about that. And it's going to be remarkable because a chief justice normally is not the swing vote. And that puts Justice Roberts in a very powerful position both distributing cases and maybe deciding, ultimately, which way the court is going to go in the future. GIGOT: You agree with that? MCGURN: I agree with Dan. And I think part of the reason I think the chief has -- he would like fewer 5-4 decisions, even if the price for that is narrower and so forth. And the chief has a lot of latitude about taking cases himself. So I think we will see interesting maneuvers. But,, look, I hope, at the end of the day, it means that a lot of cases that now get to Supreme Court, should go back to the American people to decide at the ballot box. GIGOT: All right, thank you all. Still ahead, the president takes on Harley-Davidson after the motorcycle manufacturer announces its plans to move some production overseas. So as retaliation begins for the Trump tariffs, will other swing-state industries follow? We will ask Harley's home-state Senator Ron Johnson, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So Harley-Davidson is using that as excuse, and I don't like that because I've been good to Harley- Davidson. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Harley-Davidson is a true American icon, one of the greats. And I see it so often, wherever I go, whenever there's a motorcycle group, often times, it's a Harley. And the sound of that Harley is a little different, I have to tell you. It's really good. So thank you, Harley-Davidson for building things in America. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: That was President Trump last year praising Harley- Davidson as an American icon. The president striking a decidedly different tone this week after the motorcycle maker announced it would move the production of its Europe-bound bikes overseas, a result of retaliatory tariffs enacted by the European Union last week. Mr. Trump accusing Harley of using his trade policies as an excuse, and tweeting Tuesday that the move would be the beginning of the end of the company. Joining me now is Republican Senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, home of Harley-Davidson's headquarters. Welcome, Senator. So you're a businessman. You were before you got to the Senate. You know what it takes to make money. What do you make of Harley-Davidson's move of some production overseas? SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS.: Well, they are having to remain competitive and we are facing tariffs on imported products into Europe from 6 percent up to 31 percent when they are facing raw material steel price increases because of the generalized tariffs on steel and aluminum. They can't sell their products. They are going to lose the markets. They will lose the sales. And they would even lose the workers here in Wisconsin because they don't have the sales or they have the opportunity to produce these things overseas where they can buy steel at world market prices and that could charge the tariff going to Europe. They are put in a horrible situation. They're making rational economic decision. And I heard members of this administration talk about there's going to some short-term pain for long-term gain. And no doubt, some of that short-term pain would be temporary, but some will be immediate and permanent. And this is certainly one of the decisions. I talked to the CEO of Harley, and he said maybe within a couple of months they could reverse decision, but if this doesn't get taken care of, it's going to be a permanent loss of jobs. And it's very unfortunate. GIGOT: Yes, because if you're making a long-term investment decision in the tens of millions, maybe a hundred million dollars, you're not reversing that once you start to make that decision. JOHNSON: Paul, I also talked to -- a woman came in with a group of people who supplied the trucking industry. And she has a manufacturing business she's been in the building for 20 years, about $50 million worth of sales. She told me if this isn't fixed within the next few weeks, next couple of months, she's out of business in about three months. (CROSSTALK) JOHNSON: Again, a permanent immediate pain. GIGOT: OK, some of your colleagues have been talking about trying to take back some of the power that Congress has given to the president, all presidents on trade for many decades. Bob Corker was offering an amendment in the Senate to restrict the definition of national security under Section 232. Do you support that effort? JOHNSON: I was one of the early co-sponsors. I'm not sure we have to do it immediately, but I think certainly, over time, Congress must regain so much of the power. And this is just one of those areas in terms of tariffs. We need to reclaim that power. Let's face it, we need an executive to negotiate trade deals, but it should come -- those should be negotiated with full consultation. And the deals should come back to Congress for ratification and approval. GIGOT: You know, Senator, I've talked to your colleagues about this. I would say that, by far, the majority of the Republicans agree with you on this. And yet, your leadership has not wanted to have a vote. They did move on this, this week, but it was blocked by Democrats, Sherrod Brown on the floor. Are more of your colleagues getting concerned about this and its economic impact? JOHNSON: Sure, because they also had businesses, like I just -- whether it's Harley-Davidson or one manufacturer, who I can't name because they fear retaliation. There are 30,000 waivers have been requested by the Commerce Department of these tariffs. Those are 30,000 situations where people are, again, experiencing the short-term pain. This is not Republicanism. This isn't conservative free-market economics when we literally have, what, now Commerce Department operating which business is going to succeed and which is going to fail. No, more and more Republicans Senators will be hearing from constituents and they are going to be hearing of these situations where is it's going to be immediate and permanent pain to this long-term strategy. GIGOT: So what recourse do you have in Congress to actually make the president change course, I guess, other than speaking up? Is there any recourse you have? JOHNSON: We really don't, because even if we were to pass this in the Senate, I'm not sure it would pass in the House. And it would certainly be vetoed. I don't know if we would be passing measure with a veto-proof majority. All we really can do is continue to point out these real-world examples of the immediate and permanent pain caused by this trade war. GIGOT: All right, let me ask you a question before we go about the president's summit with Vladimir Putin. Is it a good idea for him to meet with Putin? And what -- do you have any advice for the president? JOHNSON: Well, on Sunday, I'm flying to go Moscow myself and I'm going to join the delegation of, I think, four or five other members of Congress. We need to be talking to -- to all of our adversaries. Russia has 7,000 nuclear weapons. Their aggression is destabilizing so many areas of the world. I sure wish Russia was no worse than a friendly rival as opposed to the unfriendly adversary it is right now. I'm for talking to people and try to turn down the heat and try to find areas of cooperation. GIGOT: OK, but are you a little worried about any kind of a deal that, for example, would cede Crimea or eastern Ukraine to Russia? JOHNSON: Absolutely. We need to address Russia with strength and resolve, don't let it put any pressure until we actually see verifiable change in their behavior and real cooperation. Same thing is true with North Korea as well. We have to treat both of these adversaries through a position of strength and resolve. GIGOT: All right, good luck on the Russia trip. Thanks for coming in. When we come back, a stunning upset in the New York primary. Ousts a long- time Democratic leader. What Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory could mean for the party's ability to govern, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We are excited about another generation of people coming into the Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: A stunning defeat Tuesday for the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. Ten-term New York Congressman Joe Crowley, who was widely considered a top candidate to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was soundly defeated in Tuesday's primary by a 28-year-old newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former community organizer for the Bernie Sanders campaign and a self-described Democratic Socialist. We are back with Dan Henninger, Allysia Finley and \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial page writer, Kate Bachelder Odell. So, Allysia, how did she do it? How did Cortez do it? ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: She ran on the progressive platform. She ran on single-payer health care, a federal jobs guarantee, and abolishing ICE, which is exactly a new one here. GIGOT: This is immigration enforcement. FINLEY: Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And she went down to the border, made an issue of Trump's family separation policy. And meanwhile, Crowley really took the race for granted. He didn't really -- he had a 10- to-one funding advantage. But I don't think he saw this coming. GIGOT: If he had 10-to-one funding advantage, he spent a lot of money on the race, so he must have thought that there was a real contest here. Has the district changed, was there a low turnout? FINLEY: There was high progressive turnout. And I think especially among young people, she did really well, in an area where you have a lot of young Millennials moving in. And I think they really thought, we need to have generational change. And she played to, you know, the identity politics. She's Puerto Rican, campaigning against a white middle-aged man. GIGOT: All right. We white middle-aged men just have a real problem these days. Kate, what message are the Democrats who are back in Congress going to take from this? KATE BACHELDER ODELL, EDITORIAL PAGE WRITER: Well, it's interesting, Paul. There's been talk back and forth in the Democratic Party about whether this is aberration or a sign of a larger problem for Democrats, right? I tend to think that there are some unique characteristics to this district and how it's changed over the past 20 years since Crowley started representing it that do make it unique. But also, it really just energizes the movement. And Cortez said on her victory night that they need a whole caucus of Democratic Socialists. And I think she's committed to making that happen. GIGOT: And Ocasio-Cortez, Dan, I think is -- she will put scare in so many other Democrats because, even if there are some aberrational characteristics of this district, unique characteristics, that doesn't mean that they will still not say, hey, I don't want a primary like this happening to me. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: That's right, Paul. I do think her victory is probably a little bit overstated. I think Joe Crowley lost touch with his constituents. But the liberal press is suggesting this will have big implications in the House of Representatives. They're arguing that Nancy Pelosi, who would be speaker if they won in November, is old, and her number two, Steny Hoyer, from Maryland, is a white male, and this means that the House is becoming more diverse, meaning more women and more minorities. And even suggesting that Nancy Pelosi could face a challenge, say, from a member of the Black Caucus. GIGOT: Kate, do you think this signals more polarization in the House if the Democrats do take control in November, which I think there's a very good chance they will? ODELL: Oh, absolutely, Paul. I mean, some things she's proposing are things that all Democrats really want, but some are afraid to commit to, like large tax increases to fund Social Security. But the only thing I'd ask of her list of policy items was a one-time large student loan forgiveness round. Some of these things will get more attention as that problem becomes more acute. And I do think this is just going to create a crack-up. GIGOT: You know, it's interesting, Allysia, you follow California politics and New York state politics, and already you've seen governors of New York State, Andrew Cuomo, very different now in eight years after he first ran in 2010 as a moderate. And Gavin Newsome, the lieutenant governor, the Democratic candidate for governor in California, now much further left. So this primary suggests -- I think it's an indication, another indication that the Democrats are moving left. FINLEY: I think that's right. You also have what we talked about earlier, the Janus case. I think one of the reasons that we've got Gavin Newsome, and we've seen made Andrew Cuomo moved left was to gain public union support. You wonder, well maybe there'll start to moderate, but there are other cultural shifts in the party pushing left, especially with the resistance to President Trump. GIGOT: Now, Dan, you know, a lot of Republicans say, well, they are moving too far left, this is going to cost them elections. That's what the British Tories said about Jeremy Corbin when he took over the Labour Party, and he almost won the last election. HENNINGER: Yes, the Republicans cannot rest on their laurels now. They will have to take the fight to the Democrats. They make these highly rhetorical arguments about stalling part of health care system, inequality, and these are argument that is the Republicans will have to address. They can't assume that the Democrats are self-destructing. That's not going to happen. GIGOT: All right, thank you, all. When we come back, a compromise immigration bill goes down in the House as the debate over the border taking an ugly turn. So is there a path forward on this divisive issue. And will the left's rhetoric help or hurt them in the midterms? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good morning. (SHOUTING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) (SHOUTING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Or actually. (SHOUTING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bad morning. (SHOUTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Republican leaders suffering another setback this week with the House soundly defeating a so-called compromise immigration bill. The measure getting 121 votes, far short of the 218 needed for passage. That defeat coming as the debate over immigration takes an uncivil turn with members of the administration being heckled at their home and at public venues. And a Democratic congresswoman telling supporters to harass officials at department stores, restaurants and gas stations. We are back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and Kate Bachelder Odell. Kate, why did the immigration bill fail so miserably? ODELL: It's a good question, Paul. So 120 votes is a pretty embarrassing defeat. But there are a lot of authors of this failure. One of them was President Trump, who did not go out and campaign for the bill and try to get it passed. There are other authors, too, like the Freedom Caucus, who have moved the goal post on what they are interested in getting in exchange for a deal on DACA and whose own bill, the Bill Goodlatte bill, failed also on the floor. But the Democrats have been cynical about this discussion as well. GIGOT: They want an issue. Is there -- in November. Do -- they think it will help turn out of their voters. But is there any chance of anything happening on immigration between now and election, for example, on family unification at the border? ODELL: The Republicans have been working on a bill on that issue but it's not clear where Trump is on signing it at this point. And that's one reason that it's been delayed and has not come to a vote yet or even introduced. But -- so I don't see much opportunity unless there's change. Because I think one thing that we were discussing is when voters know that both parties are being cynical about having political issue instead of resolving a real problem for young adults, who some of them are in the military, I think that's when they start to vote for people who are more radical. GIGOT: Dan, where does that leave the moderates, so-called moderates who are pushing a discharge petition to be able to consider abill taht would give legalization for the DREAMers but also have tougher border security? This kind of leaves them high and dry. HENNINGER: I would say it leaves them on the bubble, Paul. That's why they wanted the vote. Had this incident down at the border with the separating mothers and fathers from children not happened, I don't think this would be a big issue in November. It is now. And the issue is there are between 20 and 24 Republicans who is are in very tight battles for their seats. These are not sure Republican seats. And they have to wonder whether the moderate, Independent voters in their districts are going to punish them for what has happened at the border. That's why they wanted this vote. So it's going to be an issue in November for about 20 Republicans. GIGOT: Both parties. Trump seems to think it's a good issue. Republicans, Democrats think it's a good issue for them. We are seeing such a breakdown of civility on immigration. It's more polarized than ever. What do you make of this call to harass -- BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Well, I think that's the one thing that could turn from the Democrats to Republicans. (CROSSTALK) MCGURN: Yes. I don't think people want to see that. Look, it's intractable in the sense there are Republicans that don't want any compromise because they feel it would give a path to citizenship or amnesty, right, however you define it. GIGOT: Deport -- (CROSSTALK) MCGURN: They're willing to live with status quo rather move an inch on -- in this direction. Democrats I think have long preferred the issue. It allows them to call the Republicans racists, the status quo. I think, politically, that does benefit -- the status quo does benefit the Democrats that way. And I think that now we've reached a point where it's hard to get any deal before November. GIGOT: You saw, Dan, where Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders in Congress, they basically said, knock it off, Maxine Waters, stop it, we don't think this helps us to have that kind of a call for harassment. HENNINGER: Yes, they've got -- the question is, can the Democrats control their left, because the moderate left are into mass protests, they're into disruption. They invaded a restaurant in Washington, D.C., where Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was having dinner, screamed at her in front of the other dinners, went to her house and screamed at her. This sort of thing makes a lot of voters uncomfortable. They think it raises the law-and-order issue. And the Democrats, I think, would like to tamp that down. They want the protests, they want opposition, but they don't want that kind of violence beneath the surface. MCGURN: Yes, I agree with Dan entirely. Except I would say this. What's shocking is how many Democrats don't condemn what Maxine Waters is saying. And how tepid some of the advice against her is. I think that's a new change. I think Maxine Waters used to be seen kind of at the fringes, and now a lot of people are afraid of her in her own party. GIGOT: Kate, quickly, who do you think has the advantage on immigration going into November? ODELL: I think it hurts both parties, but I think it will hurt Republicans worse. And I think most Republicans understand that, other than a small island of them. GIGOT: Yes, because they are the party in control and they haven't solved the problem. All right, we have to take one more break. When we come back, \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Time now for our \"Hits & Misses\" of the week -- Bill? MCGURN: A hit to Benjamin Netanyahu. After Iran's good performance in the World Cup by its soccer team, he did a video applauding them for their play. But linking it to the courage of the Iranian people that are now demonstrating on the streets in Iran. I think it is an odd time when the prime minister of Israel has more confidence in the people of Iran them their own government. GIGOT: Thank you, Bill. Kate? ODELL: Paul, this is a hit this week for Charles Rettig, who is poised to be nominated to run -- who is nominated to run the IRS. This week he said in his confirmation hearing that he was committed to running a top-to- bottom unbiased IRS. This agency has had some amusing problems lately, like the tax Web site blowing up on Tax Day. But also, more serious issues like the attacks targeting conservative groups. And especially important, because we have a new tax law that needs implementation. Cheers to this agency getting some long-overdue and new political leadership. GIGOT: All right. Allysia? FINLEY: This is a hit to Federal Judge William Alsup, out of San Francisco, a Bill Clinton appointee, who this week threw out a lawsuit brought by San Francisco and Oakland against oil companies for causing climate change. The judge even went so far as to say that there have been benefits from fossil fuels. Congratulations for speaking truth to liberals. (LAUGHTER) GIGOT: All right. Dan? HENNINGER: A big miss to the American Library Association. It has rescinded an award it gave year ago to Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of \"Little House on the Prairie,\" because it didn't like the way she depicts Native Americans. It says she doesn't do it with enough inclusiveness, integrity or respect. Then it said, this should not be construed as an act of censorship. Paul, the rest of us do not have to participate in that kind of disgusting doublespeak. That is censorship. GIGOT: How long is the list, Dan? I mean, we have Mark Twain, \"Huckleberry Finn.\" You can't read that. It is getting longer all the time. HENNINGER: It is getting longer all the time. It is beginning to look like book banning to me. GIGOT: All right. And remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC. That is it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" June 20, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to \"Hannity.\" President Trump wrapping up a huge enthusiastic rally in Minnesota. We'll show you all the highlights. That's coming up tonight, including his comments, all-important comments on immigration. Now, earlier today, the president signed an executive order ending the separation of children and parents who crossed our border illegally but not before Democrats and the so-called mainstream media went off the rails. In moments, we're going to show you just how insane and unhinged the left and the media has become, even the president's 12-year-old son, a target of a repugnant attack. And we'll also reveal a blatant double standard in the media. In fact, the press gave a pass to the beloved Barack Obama, the anointed one, over his border tactics, including -- you guessed it -- separating children from their parents. We have the evidence tonight. And also, anti-Trump deep state sycophant Peter Strzok, he is in huge trouble. Earlier, we reported that he was escorted out of the FBI headquarters. Well, next week, the disgraced FBI agent could be forced to testify before Congress. Bad news for Andrew McCabe, James Comey, and, yes, even Robert Mueller and his witch hunters themselves. After all, Strzok is at the very center of what is a tangled web of nothing but corruption and extreme bias, oh, to influence a presidential election. And we're just at the precipice of the biggest scandal in modern political history. It's only getting started. We have a jam-packed edition. I know the president's not doing my hour tonight, like Tucker, of \"Hannity\" tonight. We begin with our important breaking news opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: The president's raucous rally that you saw right here on Fox just ended, but you wouldn't know it if you were watching the mainstream media. CNN, they barely covered it, and conspiracy TV MSNBC literally acted like it wasn't happening. Now, by the way, of course, we brought you the rally, including when the president took Democrats, the mainstream media to task for their blatant hypocrisy over the topic of immigration. And one of the reasons the media didn't cover it, they would have been called out for all of their lies and the fact that they're missing the biggest story in American history. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats don't care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities, your schools, your hospitals, your jobs or your safety. Democrats put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens. We've already started the wall. We got $1.6 billion. The wall has been started, in San Diego and lots of different places. And we go but, boy, it's tough. They want to do anything they can to obstruct and to make sure it doesn't happen. But it's happening, it's happening. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, for days, the so-called members of the press, the destroyed Trump media, along with their friends in the Democratic Party, they have been in a complete utter insane meltdown over reports that children were being separated from parents at the border after being detained for crossing the border illegally. And I've said numerous times this week, no one ever wants to see ever a kid separated from their parents. Nobody wants to see that. And earlier today -- by the way, the president has been saying it all week. The president addressed this important issue and he signed an executive order on doing their damage and ensuring that illegal immigrant families would be kept intact. By the way, not his law, he didn't pass it. Congress did. Another president signed it, but he fixed it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Border security will be equal if not greater than previously. So, we're going to have strong, very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together. I didn't like the site with a feeling of families being separated. It's a problem that's gone on for many years as you know, through many administrations, and we're working very hard on immigration. It's been going on for 60 years. Sixty years, nobody's taken care of it. Nobody's had the political courage to take care of it, but we're going to take care of it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: So, today, the president undid the damage Congress mandated and a previous president signed. Now, this order fills a void vacated by Congress which has totally dropped the ball when it comes to both illegal immigration and legal immigration. Now, it's time for these lazy, obstructionist members of Congress to step up and do their job, and that's a permanent solution -- fix our broken immigration system. And by the way, if we're going to do it, let's do it right. If we're going to do it, every bill, any bill needs to literally point out what the president laid out. And by the way, go back to the State of the Union Address. Secure the border, build the wall, the problem is solved completely, but it must be completely funded and constructed and the money -- well, I don't trust these guys, get it upfront or no deal. And, by the way, all the loopholes have got to be closed that are used by criminals and terrorists and enemies of this country to ever enter the country, and that includes ending the visa lottery system. That includes ending catch-and-release of illegal immigrants they'll never show up to court, eliminating chain migration. And then and only then, OK, the Democrats will win something too. They'll get their concessions on DACA. And, by the way, the issue of child-parent separation will end forever, something we all say we want. Now, the wall, the lotto system, the visa lottery, the end of catch and release, they can't be talking points. Congress, we're on to you. We're watching you. We know you often lie in your talking points and say one thing, and it never matches the fine print of the bill. So, don't play these swamp games the American people are now hip to your little lies. Everything that we're talking about needs to be straightforward, fully legislated and enacted before any so-called DACA compromise. And, now, without a wall, without border enforcement -- well, the problems that the wall will never go away, ever. And sadly, that were -- you know, we have to see all of this through the prism of the midterm elections. Everything you're seeing and hearing from politicians and on these fake news networks is about 2018. And instead of passing legislation and permanently fixing a big problem for the country, immigration -- well, you've got many Democrats, they'd rather use this issue to malign their political opponents. They never solve the problem, which fits perfectly into their brand of identity politics. They want the American people to believe, as they do every two to four years, Republicans are racist, they are sexist, they're misogynist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, oh and they want dirty air and water, and they want to kill your children and push your grandmother over a cliff. You hear those lies every two and four years, I played the history of this so many times on this show. Let me tell you the four things that will happen, by the way. You let Democrats win this election, this midterm and guess what's going to happen? This is their agenda. Number one, they want to impeach the president but they're not going to tell you that. They told every Democrat: stop Maxine Waters from saying impeach 45. They want to do it, but they won't tell you. The rest of their agenda -- they want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare. And just like Nancy Pelosi said, they want to roll back the tax cuts and steal those crumbs back, as she called them, that the president gave you in the tax cut bill. Now, earlier today, the president exposed what is the Democrats and the media's blatant hypocrisy. Look at the video that the president tweeted. This is kind of priceless. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Our immigration system is broken. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. BILL CLINTION, FORMER PRESIDENT: All Americans, not only in the state's most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF.: The people who should be here are those who come legally. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We have to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: Oh, so the president's and the Democrats and the media, they all play politics. Now, this president has vowed to fix the immigration crisis in this country, but that didn't stop your media from going completely off the rails insane. Listen to a clip, NBC news reporter Lester Holt interviewing a border patrol chief. This is outrageous. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LESTER HOLT, NBC NEWS: Do you feel like the bad guy in this to some extent? I mean, you are the instrument of a policy that is obviously very controversial right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: A bad guy? OK, Lester, maybe you ought to get out of that studio once in a while. I've been to the border 12 times, all across, Rio Grande to San Diego. I've been in the drug warehouses. I've been out when they have arrested gang members and I've been out in the drug warehouses, floor to ceiling, all laid at the altar or going to our kids. Lester, no wonder why you're not number one in news anymore. You know what? Risking his life? Yes, he's saving our kids from drugs and those people that have bad intentions that cross our open border. And it gets so much worse. We're talking about a full-on psychotic meltdown. Holocaust comparison, some of 22 of them. Slavery comparisons. Well, you have to see it to believe it. Check out this insanity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) ENRIQUE MORONES, BORDER ANGELS, ON MSNBC: Donald Trump without a doubt is pure evil. When you played the tapes of what was heard a couple of days ago in the centers, it's horrific. How can people do that? That hasn't happened in this country since the time of slavery. It hasn't happened in the world since the time of the Nazis. And Donald Trump is right there with them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is as if George Wallace had won in 1968. The one through-line here from Charlottesville to this issue is, to use your phrase, a return to the most disturbing elements of white supremacy, white male supremacy to be precise, in the national character. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Overnight, they've now created criminals. So, people are trying to understand what's happening here, that's what happening. You know what, Elie Wiesel, may he rest in peace, what he said to me was he said, you know, the Nazis had it perfectly correct, they declared us an illegal people. That's how it began. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: I don't want little children ripped from their parents' arms. I don't want them marched off to, quote, showers. WES LOWERY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: You look at this historically throughout American history, no matter the policy you're talking about, the separation of families has always been something that speaks to a level of inhumanity. If -- you go back to slavery. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: By the way, liberal Joe thinks he's a conservative. Now, if you can believe it, the reaction from some on the left was even so much worse and so much more disgusting. Now, by the way, I have to warn you, you have kids at home and I hate ever saying turn off the channel or just be careful, what I'm about to show you is not suitable for kids. Actor Peter Fonda, remember Hanoi Jane, brother of him, tweeted about Donald Trump's DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Kirstjen Nielsen is a lying bleep that she'd be put in a cage and poked at by passersby, the bleep should be pilloried in Lafayette Square naked, whipped by passerby while being filmed for posterity. And then he continued his rant, and this time, he turned his sick, twisted, ugly vicious rage towards a 12-year-old kid, and, by the way, the president and Melania Trump's son Baron. We should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand up against the giant bleep she is married to. Ninety million people in the streets on the same weekend in the country bleep. OK, disgusting. Now, rightfully, the first lady has every right to protect her child. And by the way, making terroristic threats against the first family, that's actually illegal and she contacted the Secret Service after that horrible tweet and Peter Fonda then lately perhaps sobered up deleted the tweet, later apologized, saying in part he went too far. Peter, too far? Well, you could be arrested for those words and frankly you probably should be. And here's the big question of the day: where's Nancy Pelosi? Where's Elizabeth Warren? Where is the champion of women Hillary Clinton? Where is the outrage from the so called compassionate left? Now, Peter Fonda's comments are sick, twisted, ugly, demented and this is the insanity coming from America's left. And it's -- there's a lot more. Look at Occupy Wall Street promoting the murdering of ICE agents. A member of Antifa publishing a list of 1,500 ICE agents personal information, blasting it all over Twitter. They're going to get somebody killed here. This is not a game. And then this happened: Donald Trump's DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen who's following the laws of Congress, the laws of the land, literally is run out of a restaurant last night by a group of leftist protesters and we have the video. Watch this left-wing insanity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Nielsen (INAUDIBLE) you're eating dinner and you're complicit in the separation and deportation of over 10,000 children separated from their children. (BOOS) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're eating Mexican dinner, as you are deporting tens of thousands of people who come here seeking asylum in the United States. We call on you to end family separation. CROWD: End family separation! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Apologize! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Apology! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is in a Mexican restaurant of all places. The (EXPLETIVE DELETED) gall! Shame on you! CROWD: Shame, shame, shame! Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fascist pig! (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Hillary, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, where are you? Where's the Me Too movement right now tonight and the assault and the horrific vicious things that are being said here? Which brings us to a very important point. While the left, the media literally blows up over the Trump administration's, quote, border tactics, and they're obeying the law, they were very quiet when Obama was their president. The images we're about to show you, take a look at this, children in cages, sleeping in cages, oh without their parents being there at all. Many separated from their parents. These images -- they weren't taken after Donald Trump was sworn into office. No, we checked it out today. \"The Daily Caller\" printed a lot of these. This was under Barack Hussein Obama. Those pictures are from the Obama administration and this is how they detained illegal immigrants and children. In fact, one such Obama era policy actually detained minors without their parents for months before releasing them back to their home countries. And remember, it was President Obama who prosecuted oh nearly a half a million illegal immigrants, not Donald Trump. It was Obama who said he was merely enforcing the laws -- laws that he alone can't change and even if they create great damage, he's compelled to enforce the laws of Congress. Remember? He said all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: There are those in the immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are illegally with legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books. But I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. When I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you, not just -- not just on immigration reform. But that's not how -- that's not how our system works. I'm the president United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: My job to execute laws that are passed. I'm not the emperor. That's exactly -- by the way, what Donald Trump signed today, let me be blunt, it'll last five minutes in a courtroom before it's thrown out, but at least gives Congress time to do their job. We're going to have more on immigration throughout the show tonight. But, first, we have something else to bring you that the left, the mainstream media is barely touching. And, by the way, one of the biggest stories of our lifetime, of course, the inspector general's report totally vindicating the president's decision not only to fire James Comey but the I.G. corroborating everything we have told you for months on this show that the rest of the media never talked about -- a two-tiered justice system, a rampant deep state bias, an attempt to literally create a soft coup in America and prop up one candidate and destroy the other candidate and you thought Watergate's a big deal and so much more. The mainstream media -- well, they couldn't care less. Look at the headline from Newsbuster's today. Monday, CBS News totally ignored the I.G. Horowitz first testimony since the release of the I.G. report. And after two days of damning testimony from the I.G., Michael Horowitz, and so many new revelations surrounding Peter Strzok, yesterday, your friends at ABC so-called news Georgie Stephanopoulos place, NBC News, they avoided covering Strzok at all, the guy at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in American history. Of course, we know one of the most central figures, of course, was the anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and I doubt he's going to testify. Let's see if he chooses the right to remain silent. Now, we showed you a detailed timeline last night revealing what is rampant by is shared between Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page, including clear instances where Peter Strzok, the head of both investigations, was vowing to work against Strzok and protected Hillary from known felonies. Now, remember, Strzok was also the lead agent in her case, that is the server investigation and then immediately thereafter tapped for the lead role in the FBI's Trump Russia investigation, rendering by the way illegitimate Mueller's investigation. He cleared Hillary who committed literally felonies one after another, he vowed to protect by the way, and he worked against Donald Trump and tried to destroy him. And that was all in the context of a presidential election. That sounds like a big deal to me in a lot of different ways. Oh, and by the way, as he's trying to protect Hillary Clinton, isn't it interesting that it didn't work out? Anyway, as we scroll forward, remember, Strzok was the lead agent and Hillary's server investigation then tapped for the lead here. OK, nobody in the media is telling you any of this. He clears one person -- think about this -- in the context of a presidential election, in the context of a presidential election you know targeting Donald Trump who eventually becomes president. All right. Now, as we move on he will be called to testify before Congress and, by the way, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is reportedly ready to issue a subpoena. My prediction, he ain't going to talk, just a guess. He'll join us in a few minutes of the upcoming showdown. And, of course, we also know Strzok is just the tip of the FBI's high-level corruption. In fact, the I.G. referred five agents for investigation over rampant anti-Trump actions and Strzok's pending testimony could blow the lid off this deep state house of cards, which this is all beginning to collapse, people are going to go to jail over this. In other words, we're now created a deep state firing squad. And we're learning another wrinkle in the deep state scandal. It surrounds Christopher Steele. Guess what? Christopher Steele, the foreign spy who the Clinton campaign paid for to produce phony Russian lies against Trump - - well, that guy infamously known as the dossier creator filled with those Russian lies -- well, Steele, by the way, you know, he was welcome at Obama's State Department just days before the 2016 election, where he allegedly briefed officials. So, what did John Kerry know? What did Obama know? When did they know it? Because you know what? What do they do with this phony information? And, by the way, when is the media going to start talking about all of this? And more importantly, what is the next shooter drop in all of this? We have so much more to come and what is the biggest political scandal in your lifetime and you at the forefront of seeing it. All right. Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer joins us, the author of \"Why We Fight: Recovering America's Will to Win\", Sebastian Gorka, and senior fellow with the London Center for Policy Research, Monica Crowley. Sean Spicer, let's first go to the absolute venom of people on the left and the lack of coverage of the biggest story in their lifetime and the lack of telling the American people the truth about Obama's separation policies. SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I thought your monologue was spot-on. I mean, it's unbelievable what the left says and does and gets zero outrage and zero coverage. And I think most of it is because you kind of pointed out in the monologue, the media agrees with it, and when they agree with it, they ignore it and they almost, you know, in some cases I think they mistakenly retweet it or like it because they forget that people actually can see some of those tweets. But it's amazing to me, the lack of outrage. I mean, these people -- you pointed out the Peter Fonda tweet. There are so many more where they use disparaging language, make threats and yet there's zero coverage. Yet, anything that's done on the right by the president or any of his supporters is called out and asked for an immediate apology and has to be denounced. The way in which they view the same kind of outrage is unbelievable. There's zero when it comes to people on the left. And it's, you know, everyone needs to be denounced and we have to have boycotts and censor the people on the right whenever they do anything. And I'm not excusing any of the behavior on the right. Don't get me wrong. I think when people do something wrong -- HANNITY: All right. I'm sorry -- SPICER: -- they stepped over the line, they should be called out. But it is unbelievable what happens on the left, the way they get away with it. HANNITY: You think about this, Monica, OK, talking about raping a woman, talking about kidnapping the first son, 12 years old, and putting him in a cage with pedophiles, and then there was even an assassination CBS reported a real threat against the president today. Is the rhetoric connected to it by these people on the left? MONICA CROWLEY, LONDON CENTER FOR POLICY RESEARCH: We are so far beyond normal politics, Sean, and the reason is because Donald Trump, from the moment he came down that escalator in June 2015, represented a serious existential threat to the ruling class on all sides and that includes the mainstream media. And from that moment on to this very day, their mission has been to destroy him, everybody around him, discredit his presidency, destroy his voters, smear them as well, because he must not be allowed to succeed. And that's why you see this kind of over-the-top extreme reaction. Their first response to anything this president says or does is always to reach for the most extreme rhetoric and actions. And that's not going to end anytime soon. HANNITY: Stay right there, Monica. Monica stays with us. Sean Spicer stays with us. Dr. Gorka, I promise you're up first when we get back. Also, an exclusive interview with Bob Goodlatte. What is he going to do with Peter Strzok? And Jim Jordan. Stay with us. Busy news night. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As we continue, Sean Spicer, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Monica Crowley. Dr. Gorka, I did not mean to talk so long in my opening monologue, although I kind of really did. DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Is this what you do to the Singapore crew, Sean, really? (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: I know you traveled 24 hours in the air both ways for our audience. I love you. Don't worry. GORKA: The hypocrisy -- can we have some honesty about this immigration issue? So, suddenly, the left, Peter Fonda included, care about minorities and care about children? What about the 60 million children that have died in the womb since Roe v. Wade? What about the money they spend on Planned Parenthood? Nineteen million African Americans killed in the womb. They -- that's how they care about minorities. But let's forget about pregnant women and embryos, if they want to call them embryos. When did we hear the left talk about Nisa or Kayla, the 15- year-old beautiful girls that were murdered in Long Island by gang members born abroad? I didn't hear them protest about needing to protect American children from gang members. The hypocrisy, the rank hypocrisy tells you one thing, Sean, they are desperate. They have no message for November. The economy -- the rally was incredible, the things that the president rallied off about the economy, North Korea, raising the pay of our military -- they are desperate and this is a very good sign of how desperate they are. HANNITY: I don't have a lot of time tonight as we did go along in the open segment. But, Sean, you know this media. You know fake new CNN didn't want to cover this and they only dipped in occasionally and why MSNBC same thing? I'll tell you why. Because they would be exposed in the president's speech and rally for being the liars that they are. SPICER: Well, look, I think you pointed out in the monologue. The bottom line is I think the president is getting results whether it's the economy or foreign policy. I think the media has made it very personal. They don't like him. They don't -- they never liked conservatives. We knew. But this is very personal for them. They don't like him and they're not going to do anything they can to talk about the results that he is getting from the American people. I'm glad he took the action today. The images of watching children was horrible and it was heart wrenching. I'm glad he took that action today to make it happen. I hope Congress follows up on the president's action. But what the media is doing and what the left is getting away with something that's just something -- I am speechless. HANNITY: All right. We're going to leave it there. By the way, Monica, somebody said the nicest thing about you today. I'll tell you about it later. (CROSSTALK) MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK. Thanks, Sean. HANNITY: Thank you for being with us, all of you. Dr. Gorka, our Singapore friend. All right. As we mentioned in our opening monologue, the chairman in the House judiciary committee, Bob Goodlatte says a subpoena could soon be issued for the Trump hating FBI agent Peter Strzok. Chairman Goodlatte joins us right now to explain. Mr. Chairman, to me, here are more questions than there are answers, number one. And number two, in spite of Strzok's lawyer saying yes, we are going to willingly come before the committee, I don't believe that for 10 seconds. Let's see it before I believe it. REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Are you asking me that? HANNITY: Yes, sir. GOODLATTE: Absolutely. He's got to appear before the committee. We believe we have an agreement for him to appear next week. It's important that he appear for an interview. And then we'll have a public hearing after. And we are prepared to issue a subpoena for anything that's necessary to do. But if he appears voluntarily we're good. But if reneges, he'll see a subpoena immediately. HANNITY: Sir, let me ask you, because there was a meeting last Friday. I understand you were in that meeting, along with Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy Gowdy and Speaker Ryan and Rod Rosenstein. And you were promised documents according to the published reports, sir, and those documents that you have been subpoenaing and requesting and Trey Gowdy has been and Devin Nunes has. They promised them this week. Or you guys promised that you will in fact, hold them in contempt and perhaps issue articles of impeachment as it relates to Rod Rosenstein for their obstruction and unwillingness to abide by congressional subpoenas. And why do I think if I did it, I don't think I would get away with it. GOODLATTE: I don't think anybody should get away with it. I also believe that we have -- thanks to John Loesch, the U.S. attorney from Chicago -- we have a much better situation, we have now access to over a million documents in a room at the Department of Justice that we can see unredacted and then we can point individual documents and demand that they be produced. But there are other things in that subpoena where we specially asked for. Some of it been complied with. Some not. And the speaker made it very clear that if they didn't produce them this week, that they would face the resolution which has been already introduced. HANNITY: All right. Mr. Goodlatte, I want to thank you for what you are doing. And if we don't get those documents, I hope you hold them accountable and I believe you will. I know you meant what you said. Joining us with more, Ohio Congressman and Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan. Congressman Jordan, I don't see the documents presented. And we now have all the evidence we need, Hillary, it's irrefutable, committed felonies. Lead investigator Strzok exonerated her long before he ever interviewed her or the witnesses, which means the fix was in and then they tried to smash and destroy Donald Trump the other candidate. I can't think of a worse abuse of power or corruption scandal in American history. Maybe you can help me out. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: No, no, you're right. The same six people, the key people who ran the Clinton investigation then ran the Russian investigation. Think about this, Sean. Jim Comey has been fired. Deputy Director McCabe has been fired, faces a criminal referral and lied three times under oath. Chief of staff Jim Rybicki has left the FBI. General counsel Jim Baker demoted and has now left the FBI. Lisa Page, FBI counsel demoted now left the FBI. And of course, Peter Strzok deputy head of counterintelligence demoted and a couple of days ago escorted from the FBI. So when you have ever seen a federal agency where six of the top people ran the two most important investigation I've ever heard of, when have you ever seen that happen? So, yes. Mr. Goodlatte is exactly right. If they don't give us the documents we are going to pass a resolution on the House floor. The speaker has been clear about this. HANNITY: How soon? JORDAN: It will happen next week if they don't do it. It will -- the speaker has been clear. They will -- we will pass that and whole House will go on record saying Mr. Rosenstein, give us what we are entitled to have to get answers for the American people. And then if he still doesn't do that then it's contempt. And then finally the ultimate leverage we have and ultimate pressure we have is the impeachment article. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And you are telling the American people tonight you will do all of this, this is not a game? This is -- if they don't us their word. (CROSSTALK) JORDAN: If they don't give us -- well, this is -- but it's the speaker of the house, this is Devin Nunes, this is Chairman Goodlatte, these are the people in the House and Senate who says we a right to get that. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I agree. JORDAN: And the full House will -- the resolution has been filed by Mr. Meadows and I several others. Mr. Meadows filed it last week. HANNITY: All right. Let me ask you this. JORDAN: That's what have to happen this. HANNITY: So, apparently this was a little bit of a showdown on Capitol Hill on the floor today between Mark Meadows and who's the chairman of the freedom caucus and Speaker Ryan. And apparently it was about the talking points that are being fed to the president and the American people about immigration don't match up with the bill. Are we being lied to or mislead again by Republicans? JORDAN: Sean, I wasn't a part of it. Normally I would be a part of that conversation with Mark. I wasn't on the floor. This time Mark and the speaker had a conversation-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Have you seen the bill? Do they match the talking points which this is what is about? JORDAN: Here's -- well, I haven't had a chance to fully review the bill yet. Both bills are going to be on the floor tomorrow, but what I do know is Goodlatte, Chairman Goodlatte's first piece of legislation is the one that is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election. More importantly, consistent with what we told the American people we were going to do. Because it does the good borders, builds the wall, stops the chain migration, stops the-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Wait, wait. OK. The most important thing, is the money for the wall up front? All of it? JORDAN: It has to be. It has to be in both bills. But the first bill is the one I think is the best bill. That's the one I'm supporting. HANNITY: All right. By the way, I know you were a wrestler in college. You only lost one match all your life? JORDAN: I lost more than that in college. I lost more than that in college. High school. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: High school you won one match. JORDAN: That was a long time ago I saw it. HANNITY: Listen, I've my second degree brown belt in mixed martial arts, but I don't think I'm messing with you. Wrestler-- (CROSSTALK) JORDAN: I won't mess with you. Thanks, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Thank you, congressman. When we come back, more highlights of the president's incredible rally tonight. So much energy in that room, sir. According to David Schoen we got a lot of people legally in jeopardy. This has only just began actually. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With Peter Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. (CROWD BOOING) TRUMP: I don't think their wife and husband are too happy about that. What do you think? What do you think? I don't think so. No, but have you been seeing this whole scam? Do you believe what you are seeing? No matter she did. No matter how many crimes she committed which were numerous, they wanted her to be innocent. With me, nothing. No collusion, no nothing and they wanted to take all of us, they wanted to put us in trouble. And it's not working too well, I'll tell you. (CROWD CHEERING) TRUMP: Disgusting. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The president earlier tonight talking about the I.G. report. Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter, civil rights and criminal defense attorney, David Schoen. All right. This is only the tip of the iceberg. You just heard from Jim Jordan, Bob Goodlatte, we know this war is going on behind the scenes, Sara, and we also know that they are going to ultimately be not only criminal referrals but if there's justice in America there's going to be indictments of some of the highest level people in the FBI. SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's really significant, Sean. Because this is like the first time in American history in modern American history where we are seeing this. One of the important things that I think developed this past weeks is what Mark Meadows disclosed. It was the fact that there is a possibility that the 302's which we've mentioned before on your show, those are the interviews that Peter Strzok conducted with General Mike Flynn or other witnesses in this case. Now, Meadows didn't specifically talk about Flynn's case in particular, but that 302's may have been altered both in the Clinton investigation and in the Trump investigation. So if that turns out to be the case, that is an extraordinary violation. And it could be a Giglio violation which if that's the case -- I mean, if it's in Flynn's case, it could be that the judge could throw the case right out. HANNITY: Pretty amazing. Let's go to the legal criminal side of this. David Schoen, I don't think I would want to be any of these people at this particular point in time. But the big caveat here. If there is equal justice under the law, and by the way, that would also mean that Hillary would also be charged with felonies even today. DAVID SCHOEN, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: That's right. And of course, it is a big if unfortunately, but let's hope justice prevails. Let's not make the mistake though of marginalizing Strzok and these others. What the inspector general identified in an entire culture of corruption and bias. They are bad apples but it's not just a question of a few bad apples. Let's be forward thinking and not reactive. Because what we know for sure is Mr. Mueller handpicked a committee to makeup his special counsel team that has the exact same agenda. We should demand the e-mails especially those who are former Justice Department employees like Mr. Weissmann and others demand their e-mails. I would imagine we would see some things similar to what Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page, agent two, agent five, Mr. McCabe wrote and spoke about, stop Trump agenda. HANNITY: Is this illegitimate the entire -- since the get-go is, literally the fix in for Hillary rigged an investigation and then immediately the same people start the sledge hammer on Donald Trump to destroy him. Does that render everything-- (CROSSTALK) SCHOEN: That's right. HANNITY: -- Mueller is doing illegitimate or question the legitimacy of it? And if you are an attorney for any of these guys, do you not go to a judge and say, judge, this is predicated on a prejudice that exited from the get-go, therefore none of this should be admissible? SCHOEN: Absolutely. The United States Supreme Court in Kyles versus Whitley said the integrity of the investigation is always at issue and must always be at issue in the case. The investigation is what informs a prosecutor's decision and ultimately the discretion. But again, we know that these same people have that same agenda. There's just no question about it. HANNITY: Yes. Let me go to Sara. Sara, you have some breaking news as it relates to General Flynn and his story. Wow. Nobody thought he lied. But yet he got charged for lying. CARTER: Yes. And he pleaded guilty. I mean, he was strong armed according to the sources that I have spoken to. I mean, he lost million dollars trying to defend himself. He had to sell his home. HANNITY: Lost his home by the way. CARTER: Yes, he lost his home. His family was threatened. So there was a lot of reasons why General Flynn would just want this over with. And it's such a flimsy charge. Because according to Comey himself, behind closed doors, the agents didn't believe that he was lying. But then you have to ask yourself this. Peter Strzok was one of those agents that interviewed Flynn. Peter Strzok is still up and hopefully will be subpoenaed and hopefully will speak to Congress. But he was already tainted. When he went into that interview, he wanted to take people down in the Trump administration. And so I believe that everything he touched was tainted. And I don't know what his attorneys are going to do. But certainly something is going to will come of this. HANNITY: All right, guys. Thank you both. (CROSSTALK) SCHOEN: The I.G. said it's a huge cloud. Thank you. HANNITY: Yes. We'll never give up on this story. And I'm telling you now the real hard work of justice begins. That's the interesting part of all of this. When we come back, the ever so shy, the ever demure non-controversial Roger Stone is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Special witch hunt, witch hunt counsel Robert Mueller reportedly examining a previously undisclosed meeting set up between Trump associate Roger Stone and a Russian figure who allegedly tried to sell information on Hillary Clinton. By the way, this was not disclosed by Stone or former Trump aide Michael Caputo during their interviews with the House intel committee. And based on a pair of letters from attorneys for Stone and Caputo, they now believe the guy was an FBI spy, informant trying to set them up. Here to explain more the author of a brand new book \"Stone's Rules,\" the ever so shy, demure, and non-controversial Roger Stone. All right. So you're kind enough to send me your book. Every chapter is about how you dressed. Roger, I wear jeans and t-shirts except for this hour of my day. I broke every rule. ROGER STONE, FORMER TRUMP ADVISER: But you have good taste in neckties, Sean. So, it's so bad. HANNITY: Half of them are Trump ties. Way before the election, by the way. You know, I read -- when I first heard the headline, I'm like, OK, why didn't they tell? And then as I read it and talked to Michael Caputo about it, why didn't you just tell. So you met with some guy that said he had dirt on Hillary, offered-- (CROSSTALK) STONE: Michael Caputo contacted me and he said that he had been contacted by a man using an alias as it turns out Henry Greenberg who had an information that he said would be of great value to the Trump campaign. I met with him. And it turned out-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: By the way, this is important, every Congress would take the call if they got that call. We got info on your -- oppo research on your opponent. STONE: Well, and then in a presidential year, I mean, I was writing a book the making of the president. I was starring in a Netflix documentary. HANNITY: I saw it. STONE: I was appearing on today on info wars where we're fighting a terrific war against net censorship. But I took the meeting. And Henry Greenberg turns out to be an FBI informant of Russian descent who's admitted to the country nine times on informant visas, who is a violent felon who otherwise could not be in the country. And then he tries to entrap me, but he gives away the game when he says he wants $2 million for negative information on Hillary. When I tell him I don't have $2 million. He says it's not your money I want. It's Donald Trump's money. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Did you ever agree to Donald Trump-- STONE: I think is the first known example of the Peter Strzok insurance policy. I think it was an FBI plant seeking to compromise and I think to entrap me and compromise Trump. I never mentioned this to the president-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Have you -- why didn't you mention it earlier? Again, your lawyer said you spoke honestly and truthfully. It never came up in the hearing. Why didn't you bring it up? STONE: Well, in all honesty, remember this is May of 2016 which is prior to Hillary raising Russo phobia. I simply didn't remember it. But since the results of the meeting, don't produce anything illegal or improper, I have no reason to dissemble or to hide it. I merely forgot it. The more important question is, why is a government informant who has been admitted into the country nine times on FBI visas-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Violent felon. STONE: -- coming to see me at all. It's a set up. HANNITY: You know, this is, you know, between the spies in the campaign and everything else we now know, I want the answer to your question. Why? Why was this guy trying to set you up? Now you never told the president, correct? STONE: I never mentioned it to candidate Trump or President Trump. HANNITY: All right. STONE: Rudy Giuliani is exactly right about that. Because it was such a ludicrous idea. I turned him down flatly. The Washington Post accurately reported that. I said, no dice. Not interested. It's just like a shakedown but now we know it was worse. It was a set up. HANNITY: This is scary. Scary times. \"Stone's Rules,\" Roger Stone, good to see you. Thanks for being with us. When we come back, more highlights from the president's rally tonight, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. During his rally tonight in Minnesota, the president spoke about a successful negotiations with North Korea, the media ignore that, too. As well as the I.G. report. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: They stopped shooting missiles over Japan, they stopped all nuclear testing. They stopped nuclear research. They stopped rocketry. They stopped everything that you'd want them to stop, and they blew up sites where they test and do the testing. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Yes, they forgot to report all that stuff. All right. We have a lot more tomorrow night. Let not your heart be troubled. We will always be fair and balanced. There she is, Laura Ingraham.

            "article_content": "Republican candidates are fighting over who has helped President Trump for the longest time. Peter Doocy has the latest on the Republican Senate primary in West Virginia. Considered a toss-up in the midterm elections, the West Virginia Senate race is one where Republicans hope to have the chance to unseat incumbent Joe Manchin, a Democrat who first won the seat in a 2010 special election. According to a Fox News poll, three Republicans are considered to be \u201ctop tier\u201d candidates ahead of the May 8 primary: Don Blankenship, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey. Jenkins, a U.S. congressman, topped the list of Republican contenders. Earlier this month, the candidates faced off in a Fox News debate, with each one trying to align himself with the president more so than the next. All three also maligned Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. Manchin is not running unopposed; he races a primary challenger in Paula Jean Swearengin, an environmental activist whose platform is more in line with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont. President Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 40 points in the Mountain State in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0Trump has urged voters to support either Morrisey or Jenkins, saying Blankenship could not win the general election. From their focus on former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies to their courtship of coal workers, here\u2019s a look at the top three Republicans competing for the GOP nomination today. Don Blankenship, 68, was imprisoned in a federal jail for a year in 2016 after he was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards -- and he\u2019s still fighting the conviction, blaming the Obama administration every step of the way. Blankenship, the former head of Massey Energy Company, calls the 2010 explosion that killed 29 people at the company\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine the \u201cworst tragedy of my life.\u201d Blankenship has sought to have his conviction thrown out, and he\u2019s promoted a pamphlet he wrote in prison that he said sheds light on his prosecution, the explosion and an Obama administration conspiracy against him. He\u2019s also compared the tragedy to that of the 2012 Benghazi attack, calling the blast \u201cObama\u2019s deadliest cover-up\u201d\u00a0in\u00a0a campaign ad. He\u2019s been called the \u201cvillain of our times,\u201d compared to failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in West Virginia.\u201d He\u2019s also been the nearly $745,000 target of the Mountain Families PAC which opposes his Senate campaign. Despite running for Senate in West Virginia, his primary residence,\u00a0according to The New York Times, is a $2.4 million home near Las Vegas. As a candidate, Blankenship has a goal of hosting town hall meetings in every one of West Virginia's 55 counties, according to Politico Magazine. He\u2019s resonating with voters such as Rev. Becky Deitch, the chairwoman of the Brooke County GOP who told Politico, \u201cThe common man doesn\u2019t want another politician. I could tell from his handshake. He\u2019s real.\u201d A memorial outside the Upper Big Branch mine to 29 men killed in a 2010 explosion stands near Montcoal, West Virginia. (AP Photo/John Raby) \u201cI think the big issue in West Virginia is jobs, and I\u2019m the guy that created a lot of jobs in West Virginia and neither of my \u2026 opponents did,\u201d Blankenship told Fox News. He also said he\u2019s \u201cbetter positioned\u201d to deal with the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic that has hit West Virginia particularly hard since his company dealt with workers who struggled with drugs. A supporter of Trump, Blankenship advocates for building a border wall and ending so-called sanctuary cities. However, Trump has urged voters not to support Blankenship, saying that he could not win the general election. That lack of support hasn't seemed to phase Blankenship, though. \"Neither of my opponents can beat Joe Manchin without my support, but I will beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment,\" he said in a statement to Fox News. \"West Virginia voters should remember that my enemies are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and my opponents would not even be running as Republicans had I not resurrected the Republican Party in West Virginia.\" \"As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it,\" Blankenship said of the president's tweet. Blankenship got into some hot water during his campaign when he said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s father-in-law is a \u201cwealthy China person.\u201d He has accused McConnell of creating jobs for \u201cChina people\u201d and said his \u201cChina family\u201d has given him millions of dollars. McConnell has been married to Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, since 1993. Chao was born in Taiwan, and her father was born in China. Blankenship denied the comment was a \u201ctarget on his family,\u201d but rather an \u201cobservation that Mitch\u2019s family is very well-connected in China.\u201d In Fox News' poll of Republican Senate candidates, Blankenship came in third with 16 percent of likely voters saying they would select him. Still, 24 percent of voters remain undecided, according to the poll. Rep. Evan Jenkins has been a congressman for only three years, but before that, he served as a state senator in West Virginia for 12 years. Jobs, coal, senior citizens and the Second Amendment are all important issues to Jenkins, according to his campaign website. He also focused on his anti-abortion record in his first television advertisement. Jenkins, 57, helped create the nonprofit Lily\u2019s Place, a facility that cares for newborns who are born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which occurs when babies are exposed to drugs while still in the womb. Jenkins has made a point in his campaign to distance Manchin, one of the more conservative Democrats in Washington, from Trump. However, Jenkins, too, used to be a Democrat. He switched to the GOP in 2013. But that wasn\u2019t his only party switch; Jenkins was first a registered Republican until 1993, according to Roll Call. As for jobs, Jenkins stressed the importance of coal growing the local economy in an interview with the Herald-Dispatch. He said he\u2019s worked with Trump on easing Obama-era regulations on the coal industry and has supported additional funding for clinics and healthcare services for miners who suffer from \u201cblack lung disease.\u201d Jenkins told Fox News West Virginia needs a \u201cnew voice\u201d to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice,\u201d Jenkins said of the race. He accused Blankenship of \u201cusing his checkbook\u201d to launch a \u201cvendetta\u201d campaign that\u2019s all about his name. As for the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, another Senate candidate, Jenkins called him \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d \u201cin the swamp\u201d and for the opioid industry. Jenkins has also stressed during the campaign that he supported Trump in the presidential primary, as opposed to the other candidates. \"We're starting to see hope and opportunity come back to West Virginia,\" Jenkins told Fox News, saying voters want someone \"who's getting the job done, working with President Trump, bringing this renewed sense of confidence as proud West Virginians.\" Jenkins leads the field of Republicans in Fox News' poll with 25 percent of likely voters saying they support him. However, 24 percent of voters are still undecided. Patrick Morrisey is the first Republican to serve as attorney general in West Virginia since 1933, his campaign website\u00a0boasts. First elected to serve in the position in 2012, he was re-elected in 2016. Now Morrisey has his sights set on the U.S. Senate. In his campaign, Morrisey, 50, has harped on his efforts as attorney general to curtail the state\u2019s opioid epidemic. He\u00a0sued the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying it allows companies to not take into account patients\u2019 needs when selling drugs. And his office has reached settlements with pharmaceutical distributors for about $47 million, the largest in the state\u2019s history, according to his campaign website. But his past work as a health care attorney and his wife\u2019s work as a lobbyist who has represented several pharmaceutical clients, including those involved in opioids, have come under scrutiny. His wife\u2019s lobbying firm was also paid $460,000 by Planned Parenthood, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported last year. Morrisey has said he is staunchly anti-abortion, opposing taxpayer dollars going to Planned Parenthood and supporting repealing Roe v. Wade. In an interview with Fox News, Morrisey said he's worked with Trump to get rid of some Obama administration regulations and to \"go after\" sanctuary cities. He said he has an \"excellent\" relationship with the president. \"As voters focus the last two weeks, they're going to learn who is the proven conservative,\" Morrisey said, calling Jenkins a \"political opportunist\" who \"stands for nothing.\" Morrisey has been endorsed by the conservative National Review, which heralded him as a \u201crock-solid, independent-minded conservative who would be a valuable addition to the right flank of the Republican caucus.\u201d Morrisey has also been endorsed by Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. He is just behind Jenkins, according to Fox News' poll, with 21 percent of likely voters throwing their support behind the attorney general.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 12, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Brett Kavanaugh has been sworn into his new position on the Supreme Court. But the Left has one arrow left in the quiver. One way they think they can stop him from serving on the Court. We're going to tell you what it is later in the show joined by our Liberal Sherpa, Cathy Areu, she'll try to explain it. It's unbelievable and we're not overstating that. But first tonight, Kanye West, as you know, spoke at the White House yesterday. He drew a huge amount of news coverage for what he said. Commentators generally were not impressed. Many of them dismissed the whole thing as a sideshow and, in some ways, they were right about that. West made a number of interesting points. But in the end, he's just an entertainer. Donald Trump was there too. He is the President of the United States. He's the most powerful man in the world. And yet, also, like the rest of us, ultimately he's just passing through. There will be other presidents. The question we should care about is bigger than two people, any two people. This is the most important question. Is America still a free country? Can people openly express their beliefs in public? Are they still allowed to say what they think is true without being punished for it? That's what matters most. It matters far more than any single politician or rapper or mid-term election. And by that standard, the one that matters, what happened yesterday at the White House tells us a lot about America right now, much of it ominous. In case you missed it, here's part of what Kanye West said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANYE WEST: You know, people expect that if you're Black you have to be Democrat. I have a - I've - I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of Black people end up being Democrat. They say, you know, first of all, it's - it - it's a - a limited amount of jobs. So the - the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, \"We'll give you more money for having more kids in your home.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So to sum up, Kanye West says that Liberal social programs have undermined the Black family. He notes that African-Americans face enormous pressure not to support Republicans. And he suggests that the Democratic Party often displays undisguised contempt for men and for masculinity. When you think about it, these are not especially controversial statements. They are all obviously true for one thing. Anyone who pays any attention, at all, already knows that. What West said is so hard to rebut factually that nobody even tried to do that. Instead, they attacked him as a person. They attacked his decency and his mental condition. Now, if that sounds familiar it's because this is now a universal tactic on the Left. They don't want to argue with you. They want to denounce you. Watch Don Lemon over at CNN deliver his deep critique of President Trump's domestic program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DON LEMON, CNN: Why doesn't President Trump condemn racism? His own words and actions tell you why. He's a racist. Let me not mince words here. This president traffics in racism. Roseanne's tweet was straight-up racist, yet the president failed to condemn it. Why? Because he can't. Because his own words and actions are racist too. And we have to stop pretending that this president has nothing to do with it that he's not emboldening racist and racism. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: The best thing about this style of argument is you don't actually have to learn anything, master any details because facts are irrelevant. What you're saying is my opponents are bad people, you must ignore them. So it wasn't obvious though how the Left was going to pull any of this off with Kanye West. At first, they attacked him as crazy but that didn't really make sense. If you think that Kanye West is mentally ill, why are you attacking him for that? And, of course, you can't really call Kanye West racist because he's Black. But then Don Lemon cracked the code. You must ignore Kanye West, Lemon explained to the rest of us because Kanye West is a traitor to his race. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: What I saw was a minstrel show today. Him in front of all of these White people, mostly White people, embarrassing himself, and embarrassing Americans, but mostly, African-Americans. And now, all of a sudden, he is the person who represents the African-American community? He doesn't. This was an embarrassment. Kanye's mother is rolling over in her grave. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: There you go. According to Don Lemon, Kanye West's skin color means that he is required to behave in a very specific way. If he chooses to behave in any other way, he should be punished because according to Don Lemon, Kanye West's race is his destiny. It defines everything about him. People used to talk like this 50 years ago as they defended racial segregation in the American South. What a surprise to learn they are still talking that way? But this time, it's on CNN. Michael Eric Dyson went even further though than Don Lemon. For the crime of being friendly with a politician he doesn't like, he says that Kanye West is actually, despite all obvious appearances, a practicing White supremacist. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY: This is time for us to say, \"Kanye, we as African-American people cannot stand idly by while you give cover to a man who has proved to be a White supremacist.\" This is White supremacy via ventriloquism. A Black mouth is moving but White racist ideals are - are flowing from Kanye West's mouth. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Keep in mind they're calling Kanye West the crazy one. But, of course, they don't mean it. They wouldn't be so angry at him if they did mean it. The real fear is that Kanye West isn't crazy at all and that you might listen to him. This isn't about Kanye West or even about Donald Trump. It's about power, most things are. Suddenly a small number of ideological gatekeepers basically control what everybody else in this country is allowed to say and think. These people work at Google, in CNN, in the U.S. Senate, maybe even down the hall from your office in the Corporate Sensitivity Department. They're enjoying the power they have because people always enjoy having power. But they're worried because they can know they can only maintain this system, the one they benefit from through fear and lying. If enough people to decide to ignore their rules and think for themselves, it's over. They have no more power. A whole country of people saying what they think is true, that's their nightmare. That's what they fear the most. It could all start by the way with a single person, I don't know, a rapper speaking stream-of-consciousness one afternoon in the Oval Office. And from there, who knows where it could go? Other people might stop hiding their unapproved opinions. It's a terrifying prospect to them. Free speech is like a virus, better to stop it while you can. Don Lemon is no genius but he understands that. Deroy Murdock is a contributing editor at National Review Online and he joins us tonight. Deroy, what are they saying, really are they saying about Kanye West? DEROY MURDOCK, NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE: Well Tucker, they're saying a couple of things. One is that unlike back in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, you may recall a number of protesters holding up signs that said \"I am a man.\" CARLSON: Yes. MURDOCK: Essentially they're saying and he - he's not able to say that - he has to hold up a sign that says \"I am not a man. I'm not allowed to think on my own. I may not have my own opinions. I must do whatever the Liberal orthodoxy says.\" And because he didn't do that, people aren't saying \"Well, Kanye was wrong on this or he's mistaken on that - that issue. He had his facts wrong.\" They had to denounce him as a minstrel, a Negro, kind of words you've not heard since - since Jim Crow was - was buried back - back in the mid-1960s. I think it's Epps extraordinary. You know, you come on every night and people disagree with you and tell you you're wrong. But nobody says \"Well Tucker, you're a bad White person or you're White trash\"-- CARLSON: Exactly. That's exactly right. MURDOCK: --or anything like that. They just disagree with your views. But they attack him as a human being and - and try to remove his - his blackness from him, which I think is extraordinary and hideous and disgusting. CARLSON: But they're not even really treating him as a human being with autonomy and the right to form his own opinions, reach his own conclusions. They're treating him as an interchangeable piece of a larger whole like a - a nameless, faceless drone who must obey. MURDOCK: He's a drone who's fallen out of line and they can't have that. And the fear, I think, they have is that people will listen to him and start asking questions like \"Well isn't it interesting that we've had a President who after a year and a half has managed to bring Black unemployment to its lowest level in history? We're growing it twice where we were two years ago.\" And suddenly, Black folks start to think well maybe this President's working out, his policies aren't - aren't this racist attack we've heard about that they might suddenly start voting that way, and the Democrats will be in very big trouble. So, very important to knock Kanye down, attack him, degrade him and dehumanize him, which is exactly what the Left is doing tonight. CARLSON: Have you ever seen anything like this, so I mean am I mis- remembering? We're roughly the same age. I don't remember people using terms like that, terms that are so ugly I'm actually not going to repeat them. I'm not a very shy person. People didn't use to talk like that in television, did they, until recently? MURDOCK: Not so much, not to this level and almost as uniformly and - and - and consistently across any number of cable channels, various people coming out. This professor, Dyson, from my alma mater, Georgetown University saying the kinds of - kinds of things he is that Kanye's a White supremacist that he's a ventriloquist that I guess Trump is the puppeteer, you know, pulling his strings or something like this. I mean if - if Donald - Donald Trump were a White supremacist, why would he have one of America's biggest rappers in the Oval Office? Wouldn't that destroy his White supremacist base? I mean if David Duke were present you think he'd have Kanye West in the Oval Office? This makes absolutely - absolutely no sense. It's not logical. And I think it just shows the tremendous state - state of desperation in which the Democratic Left finds itself today. CARLSON: It's - it's interesting the level of bullying that goes on. I mean you think - if they really thought he was crazy, and they're saying he's crazy because I guess it's OK to mock people's mental illness now-- MURDOCK: That's right. CARLSON: --that's a - that's a new rule too that I might get used to-- MURDOCK: Same as my guess too. CARLSON: Exactly. But if they really thought that he was out of his mind, they would smile indulgently like you do to the guy eating imaginary insects on the bus, right? MURDOCK: Exactly. Or you - or you -- CARLSON: They don't think you're crazy. MURDOCK: --we call a doctor and help them out something like that -- CARLSON: Exactly. Well, thank you, exactly. MURDOCK: --well look, he - he talked about job creation. He talked about specifically improving the economy and the crime disaster in Chicago. He talked about Montessori schools. I mean it was definitely a stream-of- consciousness kind of a monologue, if you will, but he had some very solid things he had to say in there. And he also made the point that why is it - where is it written that if you're Black, you have to be a Democrat? And he seems to be breaking away from that notion. And if enough Blacks break away from that notion, the Democrats are going to be in really bad shape because Blacks constitute such a large part of the Democratic base that if eight out of 10 Black folks stay Democrat, and two out of 10 decide to vote Republican, the Democrats are going to go the way of the Whig party, and they'll be gone. CARLSON: So but wouldn't - look, you've got to be - you've been in journalism a long time, you've got opinions. I certainly have them. They're on full display. But wouldn't you feel a little bit - wouldn't your conscience ache a little if you found yourself night after night repeating the nastiest possible talking points on behalf of a political party and pretending that you were a journalist? MURDOCK: I-- CARLSON: Would you do that? I've heard you attack the Republican Party many times. MURDOCK: I - I - I wouldn't do that. I - I try to talk about - I present my opinions and try to back them up with facts and figures and - and quotes and - and evidence. These people aren't doing that. CARLSON: Right. MURDOCK: They - they scream \"Oh, Trump's a racist. He's a racist. He's a racist.\" Where's the proof of that? If he were racist, why did he go campaign in Black churches in Detroit and in Flint, Michigan? CARLSON: Right. MURDOCK: Why did he go campaign in a charter school in Cleveland? Why did he bring in, one of his very first acts, the presidents of historically Black colleges and universities and - and welcomed them with an open - an office in the White House to assist them? He made the MLK birthplace a national historical monument, something Obama could have done. He had eight years. He couldn't be bothered - couldn't bother to do that. And President Trump actually did that. Not - again-- CARLSON: Interesting. MURDOCK: --not the kind of behavior you'd expect to see out of a White supremacist. CARLSON: They're just saying what they think they have to say. It's just remarkable what hacks they are. It's really contemptible, I think. MURDOCK: And cruel, I mean-- CARLSON: Yes, and cruel. I totally agree. I've never-- MURDOCK: --cruel too, harsh people-- CARLSON: --look, I don't know anything about Kanye West. I'm, you know, I'm not having dinner with him. But it just it's mean, and I don't - it's too mean-- MURDOCK: Mean and nasty -- CARLSON: --even for me, and I'm a talk show host-- MURDOCK: Very - very, yes, very-- CARLSON: --it's too much. MURDOCK: --very mean for the Party of Tolerance, I'd say. CARLSON: Yes. I agree with that. Deroy, great to see you tonight. Thank you. MURDOCK: Great to see you, Tucker. Thank you. CARLSON: Well more on the Lefts campaign to silence public dissent, a campaign you should pay close attention to because at some point this can be aimed directly at you. That's after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEST: So, and that's a move. One of the moves that I love that Liberals try to do, the Liberal would try to control a Black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. So when I said \"I like Trump\" to, like, someone that's Liberal, they'll say, \"Oh, but he's racist.\" You think racism could control me? Oh, they don't stop me. That's an invisible wall. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I'm sorry. We should have put up a warning underneath that video you just saw. He's crazy. He's mentally ill. He shouldn't be allowed in public. He's obviously a White supremacist, you could tell by looking at him. And that was in the words of CNN, a minstrel show. So, pay no attention. Don't let those words penetrate your consciousness. Chris Hahn is an attorney, radio show host, and former staffer to Senator Chuck Schumer. He joins us tonight. Chris, great to see you. So, did that look like-- CHRIS HAHN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Great to see you. CARLSON: --did that look like a minstrel show led by a White supremacist Kanye West to you? HAHN: No. Look, I'm a fan of Kanye West. I do not think he looked extra fly in that spot last night. He did hit on a couple of points that I agree with. When he talked about stop and frisk, when he said let's take the \"Again\" off the hat because, you know, that is kind of the race-baiting that a lot of people see in it. CARLSON: Race-baiting? HAHN: He made some good points. He made some points-- CARLSON: What does race-baiting-- HAHN: -- I disagree with. CARLSON: OK. I'll let that - I'll let that pass because it's - it's so dumb I can't even-- HAHN: Well, you know, I mean, you know, you know, you - you're appealing to people who didn't-- CARLSON: --get that -- HAHN: --like the Black president, they want to make America great again by removing-- CARLSON: Got nothing with Obama being Black, come on now, please-- HAHN: --them and aiding to that so-- CARLSON: OK. But whatever-- HAHN: --well I need to get out -- CARLSON: --I don't need to debate that. I just want to-- HAHN: --it is -- CARLSON: --look, so I like your posture. OK? Then let me just throw you a compliment and say I'm not here to defend Kanye West. I'm here to defend always the free exchange of ideas, honest discourse, let's stop the lying-- HAHN: Me too. CARLSON: --the country's drowning in lying. Everyone lies all the time. HAHN: Yes. CARLSON: It's driving me insane. Why do you think there has been, and we're not making it up, you saw the videos we played, this effort to destroy this guy as a man because he's saying things that are unhelpful to the Democratic Party? I mean do you want to live in a country where people do that? HAHN: You know, I don't think there's been an effort to destroy him as a man by Democrats across this country. I think there were some people who were particularly offended by it. I watched the entire Michael dust-- Dyson interview. I think that you pulled out some of the particularly harsh parts. But he was very kind to Kanye and his genius over years -- CARLSON: When - when - when he said he was a ventriloquist for White supremacism-- HAHN: --in his comments about Kanye. CARLSON: --I mean there's nothing kind about-- HAHN: Well, you know, look-- CARLSON: --that. It's an awful-- HAHN: --he - he - he made - he made some-- CARLSON: --thing to say. HAHN: --he made some harsh comments. And look, there's nothing President Trump wants more than to stand next to celebrities. But I will say this. When a celebrity comes out in favor of Trump, the Right goes crazy and they applaud. CARLSON: You're right. HAHN: When a - a Liberal celebrity makes a - a statement, they say \"Shut up and act. Shut up and sing.\" That is - that's a - that's the thing I'm seeing here. CARLSON: Look-- HAHN: I'm seeing conservatives rallying around-- CARLSON: Well, no, hold on, hold on, hold on-- HAHN: --with West and - and holding him up-- CARLSON: --you - you're-- HAHN: --and saying Liberal, you know, when a Liberal celebrity-- CARLSON: --but you're making a semi-- HAHN: --does it we're on it. CARLSON: --hold on, you're making a semi-fair point. Let me agree with you that there is this impulse to dismiss people. I've participated in it. I regret that. Every time I dismiss-- HAHN: Yes. CARLSON: --someone out of hand, I regret it. I think you should assess the substance of what they're saying. And I just read a long script that - that put the caveat and this guy's an entertainer. He's not like a policy expert. But what I really care about-- HAHN: Right. I heard you. CARLSON: --underneath all of this partisan nonsense is the fact this is a free country I was born into, and it's becoming less free because the Left does not acknowledge another side to the debate, and they're trying to squelch speech. And they're doing it in the Congress-- HAHN: Well-- CARLSON: --in HR departments, in the big tech world, they are hurting people who disagree with them. And I think as an old-fashioned Liberal, you want to stand up and say, \"No, you're allowed to say what you think. Sorry.\" HAHN: I - I - I - you are allowed to say what you think. And I - I think that includes protesters who show up on Capitol Hill to protest a Senate vote who the president or call - is calling an angry mob, and the Republicans are all campaigning-- CARLSON: They are an angry mob-- HAHN: --on that angry mob because they can't campaign-- CARLSON: Why wouldn't they? It's, look-- HAHN: --on ideas. If they had ideas to campaign on, they wouldn't have to try to scare-- CARLSON: Really? Look, I'm not here to defend, look-- HAHN: --their constituents to vote for them. CARLSON: --I think I'm not here to defend the Republican Congress, which totally ignored-- HAHN: Good. CARLSON: --the expressed will of voters in 2016, who said we want a border wall. We've got 22 million people here illegally, let's do something about it. No, said their donors so they ignored it. So look, I don't want to get sucked into a debate defending something I don't believe in. But I will say that it's not honest if you're claiming you don't know what I'm talking about that people are being fired across this country and savaged personally across this country for disagreeing with Liberal orthodoxy on social issues. HAHN: Well no, I don't think that's true. I think people are being fired-- CARLSON: You don't see - you don't know what I'm talking about? HAHN: --people are being fired and they're being removed for reasons other than that. They're being removed because they are in a workplace hurting people and making it hard for people to-- CARLSON: Oh hurting people? So - so - so - OK, so I get it, so-- HAHN: --head being there to work so-- CARLSON: --so, what you're doing is what they - they all do which is conflate speech with violence. But when there's actual violence, when a congresswoman gets shot at baseball practice or Ted Cruz gets pushed out of a restaurant-- HAHN: Right. We all condemn that. CARLSON: --no big deal? HAHN: I condemn that. I condemned what happened to -- CARLSON: Yes. Well I didn't hear a lot of other people condemn it? HAHN: --Ted Cruz. Look - look, I condemn people getting attacked when they're out to eat with their families. CARLSON: Good. Bless you. HAHN: But I do not condemn - I do not call it an angry mob when people show up at Congress and - and - and protest, which is what the President, what Mitch McConnell, and what other Republicans across this country are doing right now. CARLSON: Well it is an angry mob. You got all these people screaming-- HAHN: There is a right to protest and it's - and it's-- CARLSON: --OK. OK. So - so-- HAHN: --like you say Kanye has a right to go to the White House and say whatever he wants. There is a right for people to protest in this country-- CARLSON: But - but - but what they're saying - but hold on what-- HAHN: --and we all need to start respecting it and not demonizing the people doing it. CARLSON: It - it's a little much for me to take a lecture about free speech and freedom of assembly when it's under attack exclusively by the Left and I'm defending it every night. But let me just ask you, final question, you've heard from Don Lemon and that preacher guy, Eric Michael Dyson, who actually I think lives in my neighborhood, a rich White neighborhood, by the way, Mr. Man of the People, that he has an obligation, Kanye West, to take a certain position because he's Black. Do you think that's true? Should Black people be required to vote Democrat? That's - that seems to be the position of your whole party. HAHN: Look, I think it's been a long time since Kanye has had to split the buffet at KFC with anybody. I don't think it's a Black-White thing. I think it's a class thing right now for Kanye. And Kanye is making a lot of money on these tax cuts. Most Americans are not. That's the problem-- CARLSON: You're not - first of all, I can't - look, I'm not going to-- HAHN: --that's what we should be talking about. CARLSON: --I don't know if Kanye eats at \"KFC\" or not. But I - I will say that with those -- HAHN: That's a line from one of his song-- CARLSON: --the buffoons on - yes, I'm sure-- HAHN: --one of his best songs, you should look it up. CARLSON: --I'm not, whatever. But I'm not-- HAHN: So -- CARLSON: --I'm responding what people are saying right now which is Kanye West, as a Black man, is betraying Black people by voting Republican or being nice to Trump. Do you think that's true? HAHN: Look I don't - I don't know. I don't think - I don't want to speak for African-Americans across this country. CARLSON: What? HAHN: I do think that he's wrong and misguided by supporting this President because I think-- CARLSON: But are you allowed as a Black person to think differently from Eric Michael Dyson? HAHN: --I think that this President - I think that this President who stood up and said that they were firing people on both sides-- CARLSON: You're not going to answer it. HAHN: --of a White supremacist march-- CARLSON: Right. Yes, yes, Trump -- HAHN: --should not be supported by many people in this country who care about race relations. CARLSON: Yes. Right. Well I - I care about race relations-- HAHN: So -- CARLSON: --which is why I'm not spewing racism on my show-- HAHN: Well, there's room over here for you, Tucker. CARLSON: --unlike CNN does -- HAHN: Come on over. CARLSON: Right. It's the last place I'd go. But thank you, Chris. Across the country, the Left is relying on groups of angry screaming people, mobs, to push its agenda and to frighten its opposition. Even as they do, they accuse the Right of fetishizing violence. There's hypocrisy there. And, of course, we're on it like a dog. Plus, Kanye West and others are under attack because they expose, among other things, how totally empty the moral authority of our ruling class is. That is explained in great and riveting detail in a brand new book called Ship of Fools. Consider buying it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well knots of screaming progressives, increasingly, a fact of life across the country, certainly here in Washington, leaders on the Left are causing this. They're egging on their followers, and from restaurants to the steps of Supreme Court, the followers are responding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: If you see anybody from that Cabinet -- you get out and you create a crowd. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Whey they go low, we kick them. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: We believe survivors! UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Shut it down! (END VIDEO CLIPS) CARLSON: This has been going on for months now. Leaders of the Democratic Party has said virtually nothing about it. So, of course, it's getting worse. The headquarters of the Manhattan Republican Party was just vandalized in the Upper East Side after a week of getting harassing phone calls. Meanwhile, the Left continues to project that it is the Right that is fetishizing violence. Howard Dean, who once ran for president, despite intellectual disabilities, wrote this. \"Trump seems to like people who murder their opposition. Bet he'd like to do the same,\" said Howard Dean, former governor. Dan Bongino was a former Secret Service Officer, an NRA television contributor, and he joins us tonight. Dan, this does seem like projection here. So the - as the Left-- DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Yes. CARLSON: --gets more violent, they become more convinced that it's actually the Right getting violent. BONGINO: Yes. No, I don't - I don't believe for a second and I - I don't want to speak for you, Tucker, but I don't think you do either that the Left actually believes the Right-- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --is violent. And the reason I say that is they've had to fabricate stories to make the Right appear violent. Remember the famous episode up on the Hill during Obamacare where a number of congressmen alleged that they were - that racial slurs were hurled at them, and that they were spat on, and yet, numbers - multiple people said \"Listen, we'll give you $10,000 if you can produce a scintilla video evidence that this-- CARLSON: Yes. BONGINO: --actually happened.\" And they didn't. You know, we had the famous Sarah Palin, you know, bull's-eye pictogram which have been used repeatedly throughout history, and that was an indicator of violence. So, they're just making this up. But Tucker, I see two real problems here. Number one is, remember, the Left needs state power because they're takers. They're takers of your money, your liberty, your freedom, your healthcare. They need state power to do that. As they lose it, this is almost like an extinction burst of behavior for them to use a psychological term. But secondly, the real problem, Tucker, that I know you've been highlighting recently, is the media on the Left, their normalization of this chaos is deeply disturbing and it's an effort to cover for the Democrat Party, and that's what's troubling. CARLSON: I totally agree. We have - we just got late this afternoon a video, kind of an amazing exchange. So, on Capitol Hill, as you know, it's now very common for people to show up and start screaming at lawmakers, Republicans. Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana walking down the hallway this afternoon, I think this afternoon, and had this exchange. I want to put it up for our viewers to see it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Senator Cassidy, can you please apologize to my children for ruining their futures? SEN. BILL CASSIDY, R-LA.: Hey, guess what? If in the future somebody makes an - I know your parents are using you as tools-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, we're not using them as tools. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not using them as-- CASSIDY: But if in the future - in the future, if somebody makes an allegation-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --tools. CASSIDY: --against you and there's no proof for it-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But let me - but-- CASSIDY: --you will be OK. Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --let me -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you should hope that the-- (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I think I don't know Bill Cassidy. But I'm impressed by his calmness and clarity. Is that the answer to screaming mobs? Calmness? Clarity? BONGINO: Yes. It always is because and - and listen, Tucker, I don't think it's a big mystery that guy. I can - I can get feisty sometimes and my Queens personality comes out. But there's a reason this works. When I ran for office in Maryland, I'll never forget this, you're not speaking to the Liberal. The Liberal, in - in many of these cases, this irrational is already committed to the fact that you're an evil person that not just that you have evil ideas, right? What you're speaking to is the third-party listening. And in this case, the social media ecosystem because everything's on tape. People who see that are now going to say \"Wait. That lady cared so much about her children, why did she chase Bill Cassidy down the hall then and leave them there? Oh but who brings their children up to Capitol Hill to confront the United States Senator?\" CARLSON: Yes. BONGINO: I mean listen, I'm all for big our rights to free speech to protest, but I mean that seems kind of outrage. What do your kids know about Supreme Court policy-- CARLSON: Right. BONGINO: --or about the confirmation process? It's absurd. And it's just another way to make-- CARLSON: Well no normal parent would do that. BONGINO: --Republicans pure evil. CARLSON: To - to use your children as political props-- BONGINO: No, not. CARLSON: --and drag them into a political debate is disgusting. And I'm saying that as a parent. I'm free to make that judgment. It's I don't think any normal parent would do that. It's bizarre, actually. Dan-- BONGINO: I wouldn't either, Tucker. I have two girls myself that's precious. CARLSON: --of course, not. I mean I don't even talk politics with my adult children like please - thank you, Dan. BONGINO: You got it buddy. CARLSON: Well the Russia investigation has been out of the headlines for a while but it grinds on. We'll be joined by Jonathan Turley who says it could be time for Rod Rosenstein to recuse himself from that investigation. He'll tell us why after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Kind of a fascinating Fox News Alert for you. Hillary Clinton's security clearance has been revoked. This apparently occurred back in August. We only learned a short time ago from the Senate Judiciary Committee which got that information from the State Department. According to the Committee, Clinton surrendered her security clearance. She asked to surrender it. We're still trying to find out exactly why. Five of her aides also lost their security clearances. That raises the question, why did Hillary Clinton and five of her aides have security clearances a year after the election, more than a year? We don't know. We'll continue to follow this story. Maybe we'll find out. Well, the Russia investigation, the one that's been going on since fire and the wheel were invented, basically, has receded into the background of politics. But that doesn't mean it's over. It's not. Fusion GPS Co-Founder, Glenn Simpson, has announced he plans to plead the Fifth to avoid testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. Meanwhile, George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley says it is time for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to recuse himself from the entire Russia probe. Professor Turley joins us now to explain why. Professor, thanks for coming on. JONATHAN TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR: Thanks. CARLSON: Why should he recuse himself? TURLEY: Well he should have recused himself 14 months ago. You know, he was a critical player in this whole series of events leading up to Comey's firing and following it. He came in basically after the decision apparently was made to fire Comey, if you believe was some of the narratives put out there. But he was critical to that. His memo was cited by President Trump as a reason initially for firing Comey. CARLSON: Right. TURLEY: Then apparently, he became very upset. He had a confrontation with the White House. They walked that back. But he was clearly part of the discussions that certainly followed that firing, if not preceded it. Now, to make matters worse, new reports indicate that this issue was raised last year by high-ranking officials including former Acting FBI Director, McCabe, who asked why haven't you recused yourself? So this was being raised inside the Justice Department. People like myself are raising it outside the Justice Department, and he didn't do so. CARLSON: But what's so striking, I think you make such a good point. What's so striking though is that the Attorney General himself recused himself. He was on our show that night. I'll never forget it. And he did so because the permanent staff at DoJ, people like Rod Rosenstein told him he had to because he had some kind of conflict which seems less profound than the one that Rosenstein has. TURLEY: Well yes-- CARLSON: Am I missing something? TURLEY: --Rosenstein has a direct conflict. He's overseeing an individual who's investigating the obstruction claim that he is a critical witness to, if not the key witness, and that person has to report to him. Knowing that, Rosenstein determines how broad this investigation will be. So, if there's a serious investigation of obstruction, Rosenstein is well outside the ethical navigational beacons. There is one other possibility, which is treating -- CARLSON: The ethical navigational beacons. I love - I think they're on the fritz here in D.C. just -- TURLEY: But there is one other - there is one other possibility, and that is that Mueller decided early on that it - it's not a serious allegation of obstruction, something that some of us reach that conclusion earlier that doesn't fit very well with the criminal code. And if that's the case then he may have told Rosenstein this is not going to be an issue. The conflict's not going to be a problem because we think this might be a dry well. But either way, quite frankly, this is not someone who should be reporting to Rosenstein. CARLSON: So, we've got about a minute left in this segment and I want to reserve that time for informed speculation, if we could. When are we going to see the fruits of this Independent Counsel investigation, do you think? TURLEY: Well it's very telling that Mueller seems to be asking primarily about collusion, not obstruction. So, if that's the case, if he's now drilling down on collusion there may not be a lot left to do. But at the end of the day, you're going to have to wonder what all this time has been spent for. We'll have to look at that report because most of these criminal charges are about false statements to the FBI or totally unrelated crimes. And so, Mueller is going to have that accounting himself as to why we pursued this for so long if there was so little there. CARLSON: But that accounting would take place only in the court of public opinion since he's above all other authority, right? TURLEY: Well I'm hoping that this report will be made public. I - I think that-- CARLSON: I hope so. Soon-- TURLEY: Yes. CARLSON: --soon. Professor Turley, thank you very much. TURLEY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: It was great to see you. Well Brett Kavanaugh, he's on the Supreme Court. The Left has a plan to stop him from continuing this work of Supreme Court Justice. It's - it's an unbelievable plan, actually, so unbelievable that only Cathy Areu, our Liberal Sherpa, can explain what it is. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well Brett Kavanaugh went through a lot to get on the Supreme Court, including bogus charges of gang-rape. But he's there and there for life or that's what you thought. The question now is, is Kavanaugh's powerful legal mind strong enough to withstand the forces of witchcraft? It's a real question now. A coven of self-described witches in New York is planning a rally next week to put a hex on Justice Kavanaugh. You can buy a ticket to attend this Hexing ceremony for 10 bucks, a quarter of that goes to Planned Parenthood to help them continue to fund their human sacrifice rituals. Cathy Areu is the Founder of Catalina magazine. She's our Liberal Sherpa, leading us to the snowy peaks of American progressive thought. And she joins us tonight. The rarefied air, I'm feeling dizzy up here, Cathy. CATHERINE AREU, CATALINA MAGAZINE: Yes. CARLSON: Tell us, hexing-- AREU: Yes. CARLSON: --this would be kind of the latest tool in the progressive toolbox for positive social change? AREU: The latest tool it's - it's going back - it's going backwards to witchcraft. We're going all the way back in our society to the days of hexing and - and witchcraft and yes, and spells and potions and Santeria. CARLSON: Santeria. So, I mean that's not too surprising the - the party that conducts witch-hunts would also conduct witchcraft, right? AREU: Well it's a group, actually, in Brooklyn. I have the information. It's going to be next week, October 20th in case any of your viewers wanted to go. It's going to be from 7:00 to 10:00 P.M., and everyone's welcome. It's open to the public. And if you don't have the $10, you're still welcome to go. So, they're hoping that people who come to this hexing will then become activists and march and go to D.C., and have their voices heard. So, they're hoping it's a-- CARLSON: Isn't it-- AREU: --stepping stone. CARLSON: Well it's - well it certainly is. It's a stepping stone-- AREU: Yes. CARLSON: --to some pretty dark stuff. AREU: Yes. CARLSON: Isn't it unfair though, I mean if you want to change the public's mind on a question, shouldn't you make your case? Is it fair to engage in witchcraft against them? AREU: It seems that they have this Trump Anxiety Disorder that we talk so much about that people are really kind of losing their minds, as Kavanaugh confirmation has caused people to now have to resort to witchcraft. And I - I think they truly believe, this group truly believes, that this will work, and it's against rapists also in the United States. It's not just against Kavanaugh. It's against men who they consider rapists. And they've had three hexes against Trump and they feel they were successful. They feel that the presidency isn't going as well. So, they're hoping that-- CARLSON: Doesn't this say something -- AREU: --this will settle matters. CARLSON: --I mean we used to laugh at less-developed nations where people practice witchcraft and witches were killed, human sacrifice took place, cannibalism. What does it tell you that in the very heart of Brooklyn, hipster HQ, people are doing what they do in, you know, the - the most primitive places in the world? AREU: I'm hoping - I'm hoping it's a 5K run type of thing. I'm hoping it's for awareness. I'm hoping that it's so extreme that they're doing it as a sign of just awareness and getting their thoughts out there and letting it be known that they don't support Kavanaugh. I - I can't imagine they believe that this hex will work. But perhaps some of them do believe in it. CARLSON: But what - I mean a - a serious question and I'm, you know-- AREU: Yes. CARLSON: --I'm hardly a theologian or an expert-- AREU: Right. CARLSON: --in this stuff. AREU: Yes. CARLSON: But what if - what if it's true that not, you know, everything that's real we can see and there actually are spiritual forces, and you're sitting around with a bunch of other dumb people summoning up dark forces like would - would you want to be in the same room as something like that? Would you want to participate in that? AREU: If they're like-minded people, and if I'm sitting with like-minded people and these are like-minded people, and they truly do not agree with Kavanaugh being in our Supreme Court, and yes I want to summon the dark forces, then I can go to an event. I mean it's America. There's an event for everyone. CARLSON: Oh, no, right-- AREU: So here it is. CARLSON: So but why wouldn't a hex be an act of violence against somebody? AREU: I - I don't know if it necessarily works. It's a - it's a hex. I don't think they're necessarily going to send a - something hurtful to him. I - it's not hurtful. It's a peaceful gathering, from what I understand from what-- CARLSON: It's a peaceful hex? AREU: --from what I understand, it's a peaceful hex. It hasn't bad intentions but they're like-minded people causing no one harm, wishing them harm-- CARLSON: Causing no one harm-- AREU: --wishing harm-- CARLSON: --I love that just hexing people-- AREU: --but causing no harm. CARLSON: --no problem at all, turning people into zombies, summoning Satan to - to - to work his dark magic on people they don't like. AREU: Yes. CARLSON: Not a big deal. AREU: No. CARLSON: Hardly I get it. Are you going, by the way? AREU: I'm - I - I don't think I'm going to go but if your viewers would like to go, we did share the information. I - I don't think I can make it. CARLSON: I hope we didn't. I think it's the creepiest thing I've ever heard. And, by the way, what if it's real? I'm serious, like what if this is real? You want to be around that stuff? I'd run the other way. Run. AREU: Well, it's against rapists. So, I mean if it's against bad guys and it's real then it's a good thing, but against Kavanaugh, nothing was proven against him. CARLSON: Yes. We could -- AREU: So, I hope that's not real. CARLSON: Cathy Areu, thank you very much-- AREU: Thank you. CARLSON: --for that tour really of the dankest recesses of progressive America. Americans, by the way, all of them, of all political parties seem to be hopelessly addicted to their iPhones, their tablets, social media, to technology. How do we start to break free from all that? All of us know it's bad for us and especially for our children. Jedediah Bila began the process of getting rid of all that garbage and she joins us next to tell us what happened. Plus, we do wish we could blame America's problems on witchcraft. But the causes are much more mundane than that, a ruling class that has come to despise the very country that created it. That is detailed - it is the thesis of a new book called Ship of Fools. It's available everywhere. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: With breathtaking speeds, smartphones, another new technology, have gone from conveniences to necessities. Most people now carry a pocket computer, a smartphone at all times. That's making it much harder than it ever has been to get away from work. It's also creating new bad habits, more and more people addicted to it to texting, and social media, and the other trappings of a modern digital existence. What is it doing to us as people? Well Jedediah Bila decided to find out. She's the former co-host of \"The View.\" She's written a brand new book, \"#DoNotDisturb: How I Ghosted My Cell Phone to Take Back My Life,\" making her a folk hero to many of us. And she joins us tonight. So, Jedediah, you did what the rest of us dream about, which is return to a state of clear thinking-- JEDEDIAH BILA, AUTHOR: I'm on my way to-- CARLSON: --without a smartphone at your side. BILA: Yes. I'm on my way back to sanity, it's unbelievable. This was-- CARLSON: So what - so tell us what happened? BILA: --this was my personal responsibility manifesto for the tech age. And basically, I found that I was completely addicted to my devices. I had what I coin as OCTD, which is Obsessive Compulsive Tech Disorder. And I went from someone who loved conversations face-to-face, who was engaged in real life moments, to someone who was always staring down at a cellphone and iPads-- CARLSON: Yes. BILA: --social media, and I started to realize it was affecting my sleep, it was making me more anxious, and I wanted to find out why is this happening, and what is it doing to our kids? If you're a parent and you're concerned that your kids don't play outside enough or they're at a family event or a holiday and you can't pull them away from your phone, you need to get this book because these companies in Silicon Valley are programming these devices to get us addicted. They are hoping that we follow a compulsion loop-- CARLSON: Yes. BILA: --and they are studying behavioral psychology and behavioral science to get us addicted. And this is my call to arms for people who care about personal responsibility. Just because something is designed to get you addicted does not mean you have to follow suit. You are still - I follow a We the People philosophy, you are still able to decide what role you want these things to play in your life, and that's what I did. I didn't throw away my phone. I didn't throw away my social media. But I said, you know what, the way I'm using these things doesn't make me feel good. It's not bringing out the best in me. So, I'm going to-- CARLSON: Right. BILA: --modify it. I'm going to change the way I use them to - to make it a - just a healthier means for - for myself - for myself and my life. CARLSON: So, I believe everything you're saying and I believe in personal responsibility. But having gotten off camels after many years, I know that it's hard to stop doing something that you're addicted to. What were the consequences? I - I - I can imagine what the upside was. BILA: Right. CARLSON: I bet you felt a lot better. But what was the downside of it? BILA: Well initially, I felt very anxious especially being in this business because this is a business where you're rewarded for being plugged in all the time. So, I had people telling me, you know, \"Oh you're not going to be plugged in enough. You're not - you're going to become irrelevant,\" all that sorts of stuff plus just the feeling of anxiety that came over me. You'd be surprised that phone, that iPad becomes a security blanket for you. And you feel like-- CARLSON: Yes. BILA: --well that's how I'm connected to everyone all the time, my family, my friends, my emails, my work. Is my work going to suffer because anyone-- CARLSON: Yes. BILA: --with any job out there now no longer has the end of a workday because your workday goes all day. So initially, it was the anxiety of \"Am I doing something wrong? Am I hurting myself, my career? Am I hurting my relationships with friends? Am I hurting,\" then ultimately I had to sit with that, and I had to do it, Tucker, step by step. I couldn't just ghost my phone one day and say, \"You know what, I'm unplugged. That's the end of it,\" because we're all human beings-- CARLSON: Right. BILA: --and that's not how we operate. So, I had to take little steps. And one of the first things I did was take the phone out of the bedroom. When I decide that it's time for rest and sleep-- CARLSON: Smart. BILA: --I leave my phone in the other room. I charge it in a docking station. That was the best way for me to get my sleep back because now when I get up and go on a bathroom break, I'm not sitting and saying, \"Wait a minute, let - maybe just one email. Let me see what's happening on Twitter.\" Especially during times like what's going on with Kavanaugh and the hearings, you were plugged in so much that the temptation would be, \"You know what? If I have this troll saying something to me on social media, let me answer them at 3 o'clock in the morning.\" That's not good for me. So I decided, \"You know what? I'm going to take these little steps and I'm going to make my life better.\" And I give prescriptions for what people can do. Turn your - your notifications off on your phone. That doesn't mean you can't go and look at Twitter or you can't go and look at your email. But you're not constantly being back into those places on a constant basis with a buzzing cell phone. It's very different because you own your life if you make those changes. CARLSON: Jedediah Bila, you are inspiring to all of us and I-- BILA: Yes. CARLSON: --having known you a long time, there is a calmness and a joy radiating from you that I attribute to your ghosting your phone, so congratulations and thank you. BILA: Thank you so much. CARLSON: Put down your phone and live your life. Love the people around you, listen to them, breathe deeply, advice we should all take. Thanks for a great week. We'll be back Monday 8 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink which is everywhere. We'll see you Monday. In the meantime, Sean Hannity.

            "article_content": "Disturbing allegations against Eric Schneiderman, one of President Trump's fiercest critics and outspoken voice for women's rights; Trace Gallagher reports. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office late Monday said it was opening a probe into former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman after an explosive New Yorker article that alleged assault leveled by four women, The New York Post reported. Schneiderman, who had taken on high-profile roles as an advocate for women\u2019s issues and an antagonist to the policies of President Donald Trump, announced his resignation late Monday just hours after four women he was romantically involved with or had romantic interactions with accused him of physical violence in the report. Schneiderman has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement. He filed a lawsuit in February against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the Weinstein Co. following an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, saying the company broke New York law by failing to protect employees from \u201cpervasive sexual harassment, intimidation and discrimination.\u201d He launched a civil rights probe into the New York City-based company in October after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed allegations of sexual assault and harassment spanning decades. The company later fired Weinstein. The women accusing him said seeing him speak out on sexual misconduct issues was part of the impetus in them coming forward. \u201cThis is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly,\u201d\u00a0Tanya Selvaratnam, one of the women, said. \u201cBut he abuses them privately. He needs to be called out.\u201d Schneiderman, who had been running for re-election, said he contested the women\u2019s accounts, but \u201cwhile these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office\u2019s work at this critical time.\u201d He said he would resign at the close of business on Tuesday. Two women spoke to The New Yorker on the record, saying Schneiderman repeatedly hit them during the course of their relationships with him in recent years, and never with their consent. Neither woman filed any police complaints, but both said they sought out medical attention and confided in people close to them about the abuse. A third woman who also was involved with him told her story to the other two women, but said she was too frightened to come forward. A fourth woman said Schneiderman slapped her when she rebuffed him during an intimate encounter, but also asked to remain unidentified. The New Yorker said it vetted the third woman\u2019s allegations, and saw a photo of what the fourth woman said was her injury. The accusations led Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to call for an investigation and for Schneiderman to immediately resign. The attorney general\u2019s announcement came soon after. The two women who spoke on the record, Michelle Manning Barish and Selvaratnam, both said the physical abuse escalated over time, including choking and hitting, and that Schneiderman also was a heavy drinker. The Associated Press is identifying the women because they agreed to tell their stories publicly. On Twitter, after the story was published, Manning Barish said, \u201cAfter the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not...\u201d Manning Barish said she was involved with Schneiderman from mid-2013 through the end of 2014; Selvaratnam said she was involved with him from the summer of 2016 until fall 2017. Manning Barish said Schneiderman started getting violent a few weeks after they began dating, slapping her one night after an evening out and escalating to choking her. She said she confided in friends, including novelist Salman Rushdie. Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, said Schneiderman started calling her his \u201cbrown slave\u201d and made her say that she was \u201chis property.\u201d \u201cAfter I found out that other women had been abused by Attorney General Schneiderman in a similar manner many years before me, I wondered, who\u2019s next, and knew something needed to be done,\u201d Selvaratnam said in a statement to the AP. \u201cSo I chose to come forward both to protect women who might enter into a relationship with him in the future but also to raise awareness around the issue of intimate partner violence.\u201d Schneiderman, a Democrat, had issued a statement to The New Yorker saying, \u201cIn the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\u201d His representatives sent the same statement to The Associated Press when asked about the accusations. They also sent a statement from his ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, who said, \u201cI\u2019ve known Eric for nearly 35 years as a husband, father and friend. These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values and a loving father. I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.\u201d Cuomo in his statement said, \u201cNo one is above the law, including New York\u2019s top legal officer. I will be asking an appropriate New York District Attorney(s) to commence an immediate investigation, and proceed as the facts merits.\u201d Schneiderman, who won a state Senate seat representing a Manhattan district in 1998, became attorney general in 2010 and had been running for re-election this year. Under the state Constitution, a vacancy in the office is filled by the state Legislature. Schneiderman has a history of recognition for activism on behalf of women\u2019s causes, including reproductive rights. The 63-year-old also has been a longtime critic of Trump, and has been part of several efforts to push back against some of his actions in the White House, like the rescinding of protection for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Last month, he urged state lawmakers to close a loophole that he said could be used to fight state charges by anyone who has received a federal pardon for similar federal charges. On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. offered pointed commentary. He showcased one of Schneiderman\u2019s tweets from last year saying that he would remind President Trump that no one was above the law, with Trump Jr. adding, \u201cYou were saying???\u201d A Republican opponent, Manny Alicandro, had just officially launched his candidacy on Monday. After The New Yorker report, Alicandro said, \u201cIf true, he is a disgrace and wholly unfit for the role of New York state\u2019s chief legal officer. I believe the accusers.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The former Democratic presidential nominee urges non-political appointees to stay in government as long as they can to fight for 'facts and evidence and our values.' The messages convey a sense of urgency, and are coming with increasing frequency. They are short, focused reactions to the latest \u201coutrage\u201d committed by President Trump. Some end by asking for money, some urge participation in protests. All read as if they are sent from the official headquarters of the resistance. Hillary Clinton is up to something. Five times in the last month alone, she sent e-mails touting her super PAC\u2019s role in combating President Trump. Most seized on headline events, such as the\u00a0family-separation issue at the southern border. Under the message line, \u201chorrific,\u201d she wrote June 18: \u201cThis is a moral and humanitarian crisis. Everyone of us who has ever held a child in their arms, and every human being with a sense of compassion and decency should be outraged.\u201d She said she warned about Trump\u2019s immigration policies during the 2016 campaign. Three days later, she was back again, saying that her group, Onward Together, raised $1 million and would split it among organizations working to change border policy, including the American Civil Liberties Union and a gaggle of immigrant, refugee, Latino and women\u2019s groups. And the day after\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, Clinton introduced a newly minted resistance partner. Called Demand Justice, it promises to protect \u201creproductive rights, voting rights and access to health care\u201d by keeping Senate Democrats united in opposing any conservative Trump nominee. The instant, in-house nature of Demand Justice was reflected by the name of its executive director: Brian Fallon, Clinton\u2019s campaign press secretary. In truth, Fallon\u2019s role doesn\u2019t tell us something we didn\u2019t know. Onward Together, formed in May of 2017, is a Clinton 2020 campaign vehicle in waiting. Its homepage says the group \u201cis dedicated to advancing the vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election.\u201d Advancing the vision? More like advancing the candidate who collected those votes despite not having a vision. With the Democratic Party locked in a battle between its far left wing and its far, far left wing, no single leader has emerged to unite it. Clinton is trying to play that role by being a mother hen to the fledgling activists drawn to politics by their hatred of Trump. With the Democratic Party locked in a battle between its far left wing and its far, far left wing, no single leader has emerged to unite it. Clinton is trying to play that role by being a mother hen to the fledgling activists drawn to politics by their hatred of Trump. If they were active in 2016, most probably supported Bernie Sanders in his primary challenge to Clinton. But by helping to fund them now, she is putting them in her debt for later. Ah, but will she need their support later? Is she really going to make a third run for the White House? Not long ago, I told a group of friends, all liberal Dems, that I believed she was keeping open the possibility of a rematch against Trump, and might already have decided to run. It was unanimous \u2014 they were horrified. \u201cI would not give her a single cent,\u201d one man, formerly a big donor to Clinton, said emphatically. Their reasons are no surprise: Her moment has passed, she was a terrible candidate and her endless claims of victimhood are tiring rather than inspiring. It\u2019s time to find new blood. Those assessments are unassailable, and certainly are shared by the 20 or so Dems lining up to take their shot at the nomination. Moreover, there isn\u2019t any clamoring for another Clinton run in Hollywood or other leftist hotbeds. They want a new blockbuster, not a sequel to failure. So she\u2019s toast, right? Maybe. On the other hand, the odds are zero that she is playing community organizer just to be a kingmaker. When it comes to money and power, the Clintons assume charity begins at home. The odds are zero that she is playing community organizer just to be a kingmaker. When it comes to money and power, the Clintons assume charity begins at home. Here\u2019s how I believe she sees the playing field, and why she can\u2019t be ignored. First, because there\u2019s no clear front-runner for the nomination 18 months into Trump\u2019s presidency, Clinton remains the closest thing to an incumbent. She\u2019s also got numerous advantages, from name recognition to campaign experience to an off-the-shelf Cabinet, that could give her a head start. Second, a crowded, diverse field diminishes the chances of anyone knocking her off. Recall how Trump outlasted 16 GOP rivals by having a committed core of supporters that grew as the field shrunk. Clinton could be in a similar position \u2014 unpopular among many, but also unbeatable by a single opponent. Recall how Trump outlasted 16 GOP rivals by having a committed core of supporters that grew as the field shrunk. Clinton could be in a similar position \u2014 unpopular among many, but also unbeatable by a single opponent. Third, looking ahead to the 2020 primaries, she sees no reason to fear the favorite daughters and sons in key blue states. She would almost certainly beat Sen. Kamala Harris in California, Sen. Cory Booker in New Jersey and Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York. And please \u2014 forget Sanders and Joe Biden. Sanders is already 76 and Biden, at 75, has never been a viable candidate for president and still isn\u2019t. Fourth, money is not an issue. Some donors will resist Clinton at first, but any Dem nominee can count on all the money in the world to run against Trump. To be clear, there are scenarios where Clinton doesn\u2019t run. Health reasons, for example, or a younger rival could rocket to the top of the pack and become the party\u2019s next Barack Obama. Either way, recurring nightmares of two previous defeats would send her back to wandering through the Chappaqua woods. For now, I am convinced Clinton wants to go for it. Doubters should recall the line about pols who get the presidential itch: There are only two cures \u2014 election or death. Besides, the third time could be the charm.",

Ten women from Vermont participated in the \u201cGrab Them By The Ballot\u201d shoot titled after President Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab them by the p----\u201d comment that resurfaced during the 2016 presidential election. All of the women \u2013 who came in all sizes, races, and sexualities \u2013 posed with nothing but a ballot placed on their private parts in an homage to the #MeToo movement. \u201cWith the #Metoo and #Wetoo movements and recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh there is much at stake in the upcoming elections,\u201d said the group in its mission statement. \u201cWe are here to show the country these recent events have served to strengthen our resolve to bring about change within the system through exercising our right to vote. We aim to encourage voter turnout in the upcoming November elections,\u201d the group added. Harvard Law-educated attorney Dawn Robertson, who organized the shoot, told The Sun that the project was aimed at encouraging people to vote for Democratic candidates and oppose the Republicans. \u201cWhat the Republicans are doing to transgender rights, the way they are attacking women's reproductive rights and the collective trauma means that women are really coming to the forefront now,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that the pictures encourage women and marginalized communities to vote. I want them to know that their voice matters.\u201d A Jewish transgender woman, who goes by the initial Z, took part in the shoot to point out how the transgender community suffered under the rule of Republicans. \u201cDonald Trump's administration is aggressively trying to define transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people out of existence,\u201d she told the Daily Mail. \u201cI'm optimistic that this photoshoot will serve as a starting point for more women to claim their bodies.\" The Trump administration recently came under scrutiny\u00a0amid reports it is considering a roll back of Obama-era recognitions and protections that broadened the definition of gender. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is reportedly looking into establishing the legal definition of sex under Title IX as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth. If the change goes ahead, around 1.5 million Americans who identify as transgender could lose some legal protections. The Midterm elections will take part next week on Tuesday, with pollsters indicating that Democrats have a considerable chance to retake the House, though Republicans are likely to increase their Senate majority.",

            "article_content": "In this July, 9, 2018, file photo, plaintiff DeWayne Johnson looks up during a brief break as the Monsanto trial in San Francisco. (AP) A long-awaited jury decision last week has put new attention on the potential health risks of a popular weed killer \u2014 and the debate over those risks. Researchers say the jury is still out on whether the popular weed killer Roundup poses risks to the average consumer. However, scientists are piecing together a picture that shows the chemicals in the weed killer are becoming increasingly common in humans. DeWayne Johnson is an extreme example of exposure to\u00a0glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup and related products sold by agricultural biotech giant Monsanto. The California school groundskeeper sprayed a high-concentration version of the product around school property between 20 and 30 times a year over the course of about four years. Twice, he accidentally got drenched in the herbicide, he testified during his trial. Two years into his time as groundskeeper, he was diagnosed with\u00a0non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\u00a0and, later, with a more aggressive form of the cancer. A San Francisco Superior Court jury\u00a0decided\u00a0the cancer was caused by the exposure to glyphosate and ordered Monsanto to pay $289 million in damages. The company is appealing the decision, but if it stands it could set a precedent for the hundreds of other cases in the United States brought against Monsanto by people with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Johnson sprayed the herbicide out of 50-gallon drums as part of his job. Farmers also use it in high quantities. But the more typical consumer might take a spray bottle of Roundup out to the backyard a couple of times a month to combat annoying weeds. For most of them, there\u2019s much less risk of significant harm from Roundup products \u2014 but exactly how much less is still unclear. \u201cThere is consensus, among non-industry scientists, that there is no safe level of exposure to glyphosate. That is, no level established that comes with no possible harm,\u201d said Paul Mills, a public health professor at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) who has studied the prevalence of glyphosate exposure in humans. The World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was a\u00a0probable cause of cancer\u00a0in humans. California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has concluded it\u2019s\u00a0known to cause cancer. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that it\u2019s\u00a0not likely to cause cancer\u00a0in humans, as has\u00a0the UN\u2019s pesticide review group\u00a0and\u00a0the European Food Safety Authority. In court in San Francisco, Monsanto pointed to the latter findings. The plaintiff\u2019s lawyers pointed to the former. But how concerned should the average consumer be? One of the many problems in determining health effects on humans is that experiments measuring the effects of different exposure levels can\u2019t be conducted on people, said Ariena van Bruggen, a plant disease epidemiologist at the University of Florida\u2019s Emerging Pathogens Institute who has studied the environmental and health effects of glyphosate. But van Bruggen told Healthline that studies have found correlations between exposure to glyphosate and various diseases. She pointed to studies showing sugar cane cutters exposed to the chemical were\u00a0found to suffer renal damage\u00a0and that women in rural communities where crop-dusting planes dropped the herbicide have later experienced\u00a0shortened pregnancies. \u201cAs circumstantial, correlational evidence accumulates and points in the same direction, together, these observations can become corroborating evidence,\u201d van Bruggen said. She added that these studies have often been dismissed by politicians and scientists, although she noted some of these critics have documented ties to Monsanto. A\u00a0paper\u00a0published last year found that the \u201cacute toxic effects\u201d of glyphosate are low but that there\u2019s data \u201craising the possibility of health effects associated with chronic, ultra-low doses.\u201d J. Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute, told Healthline the compound may affect our intestinal flora and may be tied to reproductive impacts and health problems. However, he said, the data is \u201call very soft\u201d and needs more and longer-term studies before anything can be determined with certainty. What we do already know is that for most of us, exposure to glyphosate comes more through eating foods that have been exposed to it in the fields. Exposure from accumulation in drinking water is also an issue in rural, farming areas. And we know that a significant proportion of the population has low levels of glyphosate in their bodies, that concentrations of the chemical accumulate over time, that those exposure levels have been growing, and that they\u2019re likely to continue to increase since glyphosate is being used in greater quantities in farming. Crops such as soybeans are often genetically modified to not be affected by Roundup, which allows the herbicide to be sprayed on fields and kill weeds without killing the crop. But since Roundup gets sprayed on everything in the field, some glyphosate residue remains on the food we eat. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found \u2014 and others have found \u2014 is when you screen urine samples of people, a third to a half will have fairly low levels of glyphosate,\u201d said Morris. \u201cSo we\u2019re probably seeing fairly constant exposure, primarily through foodstuff.\u201d A\u00a0paper\u00a0that UC San Diego\u2019s Mills co-authored last year found that 70 of the 100 people they studied outside San Diego had detectable levels of glyphosate in their urine. The average levels in urine had more than doubled in two decades, from 0.203 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L) in 1993-1996 to 0.449 \u00b5g/L in 2014-2016. (Genetically modified crops that are resistant to Roundup were introduced in the U.S. in 1994.) \u201cThe concentrations are often higher in the urine of farmers, but not that much higher, indicating that indirect chronic exposure through water or food is perhaps as important as direct exposure,\u201d van Bruggen said. She added that the amounts of glyphosate recommended for spraying by homeowners is low and that only accidentally high exposures \u201cwould lead to noticeable direct toxicity.\u201d But, she said, \u201csuch high exposures do occur, for example when applicators are not protected properly, as might be common for homeowners.\u201d Asked for comment, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society said it \u201cdoes not comment on active litigation, but is aware of the lawsuits related to glyphosate and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. We are closely monitoring ongoing large epidemiologic studies that we expect will provide additional insights.\u201d The American Cancer Society said it relies on the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and National Toxicology Program to determine carcinogenicity. They directed Healthline to a\u00a0page on its website\u00a0that lists the groups\u2019 findings, including IARC\u2019s that glyphosate probably causes cancer. The NTP is re-evaluating the chemical and\u00a0expects to issue a report\u00a0next year. Given how much is still unknown, Morris said to not worry too much about what you\u2019re eating for now. He said he might \u201chesitate slightly before going for a GMO product\u201d but that \u201cthere isn\u2019t enough to make me change any eating habits right now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s reasonably safe,\u201d Morris said, \u201cand to get up to the level to cause illness it takes a whole lot of it. So you\u2019re not going to get that through food.\u201d But there\u2019s still some cause for concern. Part of the reason long-term studies are still so needed despite Roundup being around for decades is that the way it\u2019s used, and thus our exposure to it, is always changing. Over the years, weed species develop tolerances to glyphosate as the most resistant individuals survive and pass on their resistance to future generations. This resistance means that farmers have to use more Roundup to kill weeds. That, combined with the fact that more farms are using it each year, means that more glyphosate may be finding its way into our bodies, Morris said. It\u2019s possible the same logic might apply to homeowners, van Bruggen said. \u201cIt is not known how often homeowners spray, but they may spray repeatedly because the effect of glyphosate on plants is not immediate but takes a few days. Homeowners may spray again just to be sure.\u201d What effect prolonged but low-level exposure could have is still largely an open question, as is whether those effects might vary widely from person to person. \u201cThat is the golden question: What are the actual health consequences from the chronic exposure over the past 20-plus years?\u201d Mills told Healthline. \u201cSurprisingly, little human clinical or epidemiological research has been done on this.\u201d It does appear that some people should be more cautious than others. Someone with a weaker liver might be more susceptible to glyphosate\u2019s observed impacts on the liver, for example, van Bruggen said. Small children and immune-deficient adults may also be more susceptible to impacts, she added. The state of California has tried to warn people who might come into contact with potentially carcinogenic compounds through its Proposition 65, which requires warning labels on products found to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. But a week after the Johnson ruling, a judge in Sacramento ruled that California couldn\u2019t require a label on glyphosate products because of what he saw as a \u201cheavy weight of evidence\u201d showing the herbicide was safe. Some experts disagree with that finding. \u201cI think that warning labels are appropriate because there is sufficient evidence of potential carcinogenicity and reproductive harm,\u201d said van Bruggen. She would even like to take it a step further. \u201cI also think that there is no need for glyphosate to be available to the general public,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers often spray too much and too frequently, which is dangerous for their health in the long run.\u201d But significant gaps remain in our knowledge, and long-term studies are still needed. Mills said UC San Diego is currently working to fill some of those gaps, and the initial findings are \u201csuggestive of a relationship\u201d between prolonged glyphosate exposure and non-cancer illnesses. For now, though, the evidence is still accumulating. \u201cHow do you convey the idea that [there] may be a risk but don\u2019t worry about it?\u201d asked Morris.

            "article_content": "Does Judge Bret Kavanaugh have enough votes in the senate to get a seat on the Supreme Court? Here\u2019s a look at some of the undecided senators who could decide his fate. The Senate\u2019s final verdict on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 whose high-stakes, high-wire confirmation hearing begins Tuesday \u2013 will hinge on the views of just a handful of lawmakers. As it stands, Republicans hold a razor-thin, 50-49 majority with one vacancy. Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey will soon appoint a successor to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., but even then the GOP majority can suffer few defections. These are the senators to watch: Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska\u00a0These senators can be mavericks in their own right. Further, they fret about how health care issues and access to reproductive assistance are challenging in their sprawling, rural states. Both Collins and Murkowski are moderates. A defection by either or both of these senators could spell problems for the confirmation of Kavanaugh. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Paul, too, sometimes bucks his party and can be unpredictable on how he will cast his ballot. But the Kentucky Republican announced he will support Kavanaugh. In the past, Paul has flashed his libertarian streak, especially voicing concern over privacy and the use of government surveillance. If Kavanaugh can avoid setting off those Paul alarm bells in the hearing, he is likely to preserve that key support. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev. Heller is likely the most-endangered Republican this cycle, representing a battleground state where Democrats performed well in 2016. That said, he has signaled likely support for President Trump\u2019s pick. \u201cHis legal career combined with his educational credentials make him an exceptionally qualified nominee to fill the upcoming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. At this point, I have no reservations in confidently supporting Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation,\u201d Heller said. Then, there is the unknown senator. It\u2019s believed Ducey will appoint someone to fill McCain\u2019s seat soon. However, he may not. Appointment battles for coveted Senate seats sometimes spill off the rails, take longer than anticipated or stumble into previously unanticipated political potholes. (See Blagojevich, Rod and Burris, Roland.) Moreover, the political disposition of that new senator is unknown. Arizona law does require Ducey to appoint a Republican since McCain was a Republican. It\u2019s possible the appointee\u2019s view on Kavanaugh could serve as a litmus test. Things are fuzzier on the Democratic side of the aisle. It\u2019s believed three to five Democrats could ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh. The reason? There are lots of conservative Democrats up in GOP or swing states: Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. These are the big three to watch on the Democratic side. That trio voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in April 2017. Those Democratic \u201cdefections\u201d could be enough to confirm Kavanaugh even if Republicans lose a vote or two.\u00a0All three also face stiff competition in the November midterm elections and are eager to prove their independent streak \u2013 but also mindful of the views of their own party\u2019s voters. Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla. Likewise, the three senators in the next tier are in tough re-election battles. None have committed to vote one way or the other. Something to keep in mind: it\u2019s not as though a yea vote on Kavanaugh necessarily helps these Democrats win election. Republicans will not call off the dogs, simply because they voted to confirm Anthony Kennedy\u2019s successor. Going along with Kavanaugh simply inoculates these vulnerable Democratic senators from criticism that they opposed Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. Jones is the wild card \u2013 because his disposition is an unknown quantity. Jones won a special election to succeed Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Senate in December. Thus, Jones never cast a ballot on Gorsuch. Kavanaugh is his first rodeo. Jones is a conservative Democrat in a major red state. And, unlike the other Democratic senators listed above, Jones isn\u2019t up for re-election this fall. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to vote for a conservative justice,\u201d Jones said in an interview with Fox News. \u201cThe question is whether I\u2019m prepared to vote for this justice.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Will an allegation of sexual misconduct impact the confirmation of President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court? Republican Sen. John Kennedy weighs in. Sen. John Kennedy called the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh \u201can intergalactic freak show\u201d and said he was embarrassed for Congress by the accusations of sexual misconduct leveled at the Supreme Court nominee. \u201cSo far, it\u2019s pretty much been an intergalactic freak show,\u201d Kennedy, R-La., told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cMost Americans are looking at this \u2013 most mainstream Americans \u2013 and they\u2019re thinking that Congress has hit rock bottom and started to dig.\u201d Kennedy added: \u201cI have been embarrassed by the whole process and, frankly, I\u2019m \u2013 no disrespect to Senator Feinstein or to Stanford Law School \u2013 but I\u2019m a little bit offended. I sit on Judiciary Committee. They\u2019ve had this stuff for three months. If they were serious about it, they should\u2019ve told us about it.\u201d The Louisiana lawmaker was referencing a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last week. A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday. The letter was relayed to lawmakers by 51-year-old research psychologist\u00a0Christine Blasey Ford and concerns an alleged incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and her while they were in high school.\u00a0The Washington Post first reported\u00a0that Ford was the letter's author. In a statement released by the White House Friday, Kavanaugh said: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\" Senate Republicans insist Kavanaugh's confirmation remains on track for a committee vote this upcoming Thursday. But the allegation has inflamed an already intense political battle over President Trump's nominee. It also pushes the #MeToo movement into the court fight, less than two months before congressional elections that have seen a surge of female Democratic candidates. The New Yorker magazine reported that the alleged incident took place at a party when Kavanaugh, now 53, was attending Georgetown Preparatory School. The woman making the allegation attended a nearby school. The accusations against Kavanaugh resurfaced similar ones leveled against Associate Justice Clarence Thomas during his own confirmation hearings in 1991. Anita Hill accused Thomas, who was her supervisor at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, of sexually harassing her. Thomas denied those allegations and was confirmed. Hill, who is now a professor at Brandeis University, urged the Senate to put in place a process for people to come forward. \"Even in the #MeToo era, it remains incredibly difficult to report harassment, abuse or assault by people in power,\" she said. The eleventh-hour revelations drew sharp criticism not only from Feinstein\u2019s Republican colleagues in the Senate, but from the media in her home state of California, with the San Francisco Chronicle calling the allegations \u201cunfair all around.\u201d \"Feinstein\u2019s treatment of a more than three-decades-old sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was unfair all around,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s editorial board noted on Sunday. \u201cIt was unfair to Kavanaugh, unfair to his accuser and unfair to Feinstein\u2019s colleagues \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201d The editorial continued: \u201cFeinstein\u2026 took the worst possible course by waiting until almost a week after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing was completed to ominously announce that she had turned over \u2018information from an individual\u2019 about Kavanaugh to the FBI, and adding that she would be honoring the person\u2019s 'strongly requested' confidentiality.\u201d While Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court seems likely, it is not guaranteed and he will certainly not be a unanimous pick. Feinstein penned an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times over the weekend, explaining that she strongly opposes Kavanaugh's nomination because of his stance on issues ranging from reproductive rights to judicial deference. \u201cSupreme Court justices should not be an extension of the Republican Party,\u201d Feinstein wrote. \u201cThey must also have unquestionable character and integrity, and serious questions remain about Judge Kavanaugh in this regard, as indicated in information I referred to the FBI. For these and other reasons detailed below, I strongly oppose Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.\u201d Kennedy told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he believes it will be a close vote for Kavanaugh, but in the end the judge will join the Supreme Court. \u201cI think the vote will be 11-10 Wallace,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cStraight party line vote. I think the nomination will come to the floor; that\u2019ll be up to Senator (Mitch) McConnell (a Republican from Kentucky). I think every Republican will vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I think at least two and probably more Democrats will.\u201d Fox News' Chris Wallace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(BMJ Case Reports 2018) A patient in Singapore is reported to be in good health after doctors removed a 61-pound uterine fibroid that was affecting her ability to breathe. The 53-year-old woman, who was not named in The BMJ Case Report, underwent a complete hysterectomy on an undisclosed date to remove the 26-inch fibroid. Dr. Ph Ting Lim, an OB-GYN resident at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Singapore, said that the fibroid was taking up the woman\u2019s entire abdominal and pelvic cavity and had extended to the bottom of her breastbone, according to Live Science.

MOMENT ULTRA-MARATHONER BREASTFEEDS BABY 16 HOURS INTO 107-MILE RACE Lim told Live Science that it\u2019s unclear as to how long the fibroid had been growing in the woman\u2019s body, but that a fear of surgery may have prevented her from having it examined. He said she may have avoided typical symptoms of bowel issues and abdominal discomfort due to the slow growth of the fibroid, which allowed her body to adjust to its size. The patient did however struggle with movement and shortness of breath, and was largely bed-ridden before having it removed. Fibroids are typically common in women of reproductive age, with about 70 percent of women developing growths by the time they reach 50, according to Live Science. However, Lim said that due to the slow growth rate of fibroids, patients typically have them removed before they ever reach the size that his patient\u2019s had. According to Live Science, the largest fibroid ever removed in a living patient weighed 100 pounds.",

In a shocking scientific development, an 11-year old stingray has given birth to a healthy offspring, despite having had no male contact in over nine years. Freckle, an Eagle Ray that lives at the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium in Australia, gave birth to an offspring the staff has named Ani (short for Anakin Skywalker, better known as Darth Vader) through a scientific phenomenon known as parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis (which means virgin origin in Latin) has been seen in similar species, but it is uncommon, the Aquarium said in a statement. In the Netherlands, five Eagle Rays were born because of parthenogenesis, but none survived. MONSTER SQUID GOES VIRAL AFTER IT WASHED UP IN NEW ZEALAND Ani, however, seems to be doing just fine. She was born on July 26 and the team at the aquarium says she is in \"good health, swimming, eating and demonstrating the habits of a happy and healthy baby Eagle Ray\u00a0\u2014 who loves eating mussels and pilchard fillets.\" \"Parthenogenesis is a very rare reproductive strategy where an embryo develops without fertilization,\" Adam Stow, associate professor of genetics and marine conservation at Macquarie University, said in a statement. \"It is a rare occurrence among vertebrates such as Eagle Rays\u00a0\u2014 so this is a very special arrival for Sea Life Sydney Aquarium.\u201d The team first noticed that Freckle might be pregnant more than a month prior to Ani being born, when Libby Eyre, a senior aquarist and ray trainer at the aquarium, noticed her belly getting bigger. \u201cWe noticed something going on with Freckle in early June when her belly was noticeably larger,\" Eyre said in the statement. \"We initially dismissed pregnancy as there are no male eagle rays in the tank. As time went on we knew Freckle was indeed a mum-to-be.\" (Credit: Sea Life Sydney Aquarium) Eyre continued: \"This experience has helped expand our already extensive knowledge of this species and will assist us in their ongoing husbandry. As well as being a little miracle, we think Ani demonstrates that we have top care of this species and what a fantastic job the team is doing.\u201d Ani is not yet on display at the aquarium, with the team actively monitoring her progress. Those interested in following her journey can get updates on the aquarium\u2019s Facebook and Instagram pages. GRAPHIC IMAGES: SHARK ATTACKS SEAL, TURNS WATER RED Although parthenogenesis is a rare and exciting scientific occurrence, it is not the \"normal\" course of reproduction for these animals and can be quite dangerous for their future. It reduces genetic diversity in offspring and makes them \"less robust to the challenges of the world,\" the aquarium added. Freckle, who lives in a tank with other female Eagle Rays, two Leopard Sharks, a White-Spotted Guitarfish (also a ray) and other various \"bony\" fish, has had no contact with a male since early 2009. Parthenogenesis has been seen in other species, including snakes, lizards and some birds. It's even been seen in sharks and rays that are in the care of humans, including sawfish, blacktip sharks, leopard sharks and several other types. SCIENCE OF 'THE MEG': HOW SCIENTISTS KNOW THE WORLD'S LARGEST SHARK IS GONE FOREVER In February, a new type of crayfish was discovered, born from parthenogenesis. In 2012, a study showed the phenomenon may be more common in the wild than previously thought, citing examples such as komodo dragons and various types of snakes.

            "article_content": "Businesses owners concerned that the policy would create a staffing crisis. New York lawmakers have approved a bill that would give employees in the Empire State three months paid bereavement leave to mourn the loss of a loved one \u2013 in turn, spurring concerns among business owners that the policy would create a staffing crisis. The expansive bill would cover the death of a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, in-law, grandparent or grandchild. It was passed by the state Senate and Assembly at the end of the legislative session in June and now awaits the signature of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The state\u2019s current Paid Family Leave law gives employees paid time off to bond with a new child or care for a sick relative. But the new legislation significantly expands leave policies, allowing grieving employees to collect 50 to 67 percent of the average weekly wage for up to 12 weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced the pain of losing a child. The grief can be unpredictable and overwhelming,\u201d Richard Funke, a Republican state senator representing parts of Monroe and Ontario counties, said in a statement. \u201cNo employee should have to fear losing their job in order to take the time they need to mourn.\u201d Funke and the bill\u2019s cosponsor, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, a Democrat from Rochester, have both lost adult children. Business owners and groups representing their interests, though, contend that the change would put an unnecessary strain on their companies. \u201cFor a small business, I don\u2019t know how anybody could survive with anything like that,\u201d Tom Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, told the New York Post. \u201cAt the end of the day, New York City and New York state are among the most expensive places to do business in the country. This just puts another burden on small businesses.\u201d The Business Council of New York State also opposes the paid bereavement. \u201cWho this really affects are the small employers who are being hit with another burden that\u2019s difficult to manage,\u201d group spokesman Zach Hutchins told the newspaper. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (Reuters) Cuomo supported the Paid Family Leave policy that starting this year gives\u00a0paid time off to new parents, people caring for a loved one with a serious health condition and those facing family pressures when a loved one is called to active military service abroad. A spokeswoman for Cuomo, Dani Lever, said they plan to review the bereavement leave bill.",

(iStock) In her soon-to-be-released memoir, former First Lady Michelle Obama revealed she and former President Barack Obama used in vitro fertilization\u00a0(IVF) to conceive their two daughters, Malia, 20, and Sasha, 17. The 54-year-old revealed that she had a miscarriage\u00a0prior to conceiving Malia, an experience\u00a0she said\u00a0\u201cleft her physically uncomfortable and cratered any optimism we felt.\" \"I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them,\" the former first lady said in an interview broadcast Friday on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" ''We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken.\" More than 8 million babies have been born from IVF worldwide since 1978, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology estimated in July. Read on to learn more about IVF. IVF is a process where a woman\u2019s eggs are extracted and then combined with sperm in a laboratory dish, according to the American Pregnancy Association. From there, the fertilized egg (or sometimes multiple eggs) are placed in a woman\u2019s uterus. One IVF cycle \u2014 which includes \u201covulation induction,\u201d \u201cegg retrieval,\u201d \u201csperm retrieval,\u201d \u201cfertilization\u201d and finally the transfer of the embryo into the uterus, according to the Mayo Clinic \u2014 takes roughly two weeks, though it's possible another cycle will be necessary. CONJOINED TWINS SUCCESSFULLY SEPARATED IN 6-HOUR SURGERY Donated eggs, sperm, and embryos are sometimes used during IVF, depending on the individual\u2019s or couple\u2019s needs. Women over 40 years of age are typically offered IVF as a \"primary treatment,\" the Mayo Clinic says. Patients may choose IVF if they or their partner has a certain medical condition. For instance, IVF may be an option for women who have fallopian tube damage or blockage, an ovulation disorder, endometriosis\u00a0or premature ovulation failure, among other conditions, according to the Mayo Clinic. IVF may also be an option for men who have impaired sperm production or function. The process, which the American Pregnancy Association notes is an \u201cassisted reproductive technology (ART),\u201d is the \u201cmost effective form\u201d of ART, according to the Mayo Clinic. But the success of IVF depends on multiple factors, such as a woman\u2019s age and cause of infertility. Women under the age of 35 who use\u00a0\u201cfresh embryos from non-donor eggs\u201d have a 21.3 percent chance of having a \u201cfull term, normal birth weight and singleton live birth per ART cycle,\u201d according to Penn Medicine, which cited a 2015 U.S. Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology report. After 35 years of age, a woman\u2019s chances continue to decrease. According to the Mayo Clinic, IVF increases the risk of \u201cmultiple births if more than one embryo is implanted in your uterus,\u201d and a \u201cpregnancy with multiple fetuses carry a higher risk of early labor and low birth weight than pregnancy with a single fetus does.\u201d IVF can slightly increase the chance of delivering a baby prematurely, while the chance of miscarriage increases by a small amount if a woman uses a frozen embryo and not a fresh embryo. MOM LOOKING TO SWAP GIRL EMBRYO FOR A BOY GETS OFFERS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE Birth defects and ectopic pregnancy \u2014 when a fertilized egg attaches outside of the uterus \u2014 are also risks. The Mayo Clinic states roughly 2 to 5 percent of women using IVF have an ectopic pregnancy. You can learn more about potential uncertainties here and side effects of IVF here. IVF can be costly \u2014 typically costing thousands of dollars\u00a0for every \"cycle,\" and many couples require more than one attempt. Penn Medicine estimated the average cost of \u201ca single IVF cycle\u201d ranges between $10,000 and $15,000, though the price is \u201cdependent upon insurance coverage, patient characteristics and the treatment center.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Getty Images) The United Kingdom is dealing with an exponential increase in bed bug infestations this summer due to the brutal heat, according to experts. During higher temperatures, the reproductive cycles of the bugs shortens from 18-21 days to eight or nine days, a bed bug exterminator told\u00a0the Guardian. \u201cThe problem has been spreading globally since the late 1990s, and there is literally no country on the face of the planet that hasn\u2019t had a bed bug problem,\u201d David Cain, of Bed Bugs Limited, told the British newspaper. Reluctance to seek help because of the social stigma attached to bed bugs contributes to the problem, as well, and since many people won\u2019t have a physical reaction, they may not realize there\u2019s been an infestation, according to the paper. Bed bugs are parasitic insects that feed on blood and tend to be most active at night. Bed bug bites can cause skin rashes and allergic symptoms and have a psychological effect. SPRAWLING GALAXY CLUSTER DISCOVERED 'HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT' Tony Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said the persistent bed bug presence in the U.K. was made worse in the summer by higher temperatures and people returning from holiday with bed bugs in their luggage. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019ve been staying in a five-star hotel or a dingy B&B, the chances of encountering bedbugs are equal,\u201d he said. Although bed bugs were common in the United Kingdom 100 years ago, they were mostly eradicated by the use of insecticides. Now, bed bugs have developed resistance to some chemical treatments. \u201cThis insect has developed to be the most efficient and adaptive hunter of human beings that we\u2019ve probably ever had,\u201d said Cain. \u201cIf people are fearful of sharks, the answer is to stay out of the water. When it comes to bedbugs, the answer is to be permanently on guard.\u201d A London woman had been scratching her arms and legs for about a month before she sought professional help, according to the paper. Bed bugs can cause irritating bites. (Getty Images) \u201cI was waking up every morning with bites which I thought were from mosquitoes, although no one else was suffering. My boyfriend mentioned bedbugs, but I completely dismissed it.

She is now in the middle of a 14-day program of eradication and monitoring, which involves washing bedding and clothes at 60 degrees, and a deep clean of the bedroom. Her partner\u2019s office has been identified as a potential source. Cain explained: \u201cBed bugs can happen to anyone. ... Lots of people equate bed bugs with dirt, but dirt has nothing to do with it.\u201d The insects have been found in hotels worldwide, including in high-end spots like the\u00a0Waldorf Astoria\u00a0in Manhattan.\u00a0Air India\u00a0had to ground two of its planes in July after passengers reported being covered in gruesome bed bug bites after their flights.",

            "article_content": "At least 19 Kemp's Ridley sea turtles -- the most endangered of the species -- have been found on the southwest Florida beaches. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Nearly 100 sea turtles \u2014 many of which are endangered\u00a0\u2014 have washed up on southwestern Florida beaches since October. More than half of that number were dead. Marine scientists are now blaming the mass mortality on the current red tide bloom, which has been the longest, continuous bloom in more than a decade, officials said this week. In total, 91 sea turtles have washed up on\u00a0Sanibel and Captiva beaches since October 2017, 58 of which were dead, according to the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation. And 50 of the 91 have been found on beaches in June and July alone. That\u2019s compared to the yearly average of 30 to 35, Kelly Sloan, a sea turtle researcher at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation on Sanibel, told the News-Press. \u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening,\u201d she added. The deaths could be a blow to a population of animals that have been fighting to make a comeback in the area, scientists warned, as many of the dead turtles have been mature adults. (Only one in 1,000 sea turtle hatchlings survive long enough to reach age 25, which is the start of reproductive maturity, according to the foundation). FLORIDA BEACH LITTERED WITH 'HUNDREDS' OF DEAD FISH, MARINE LIFE The Kemp's Ridley sea turtle\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the most endangered of all sea turtles\u00a0\u2014 represented 19 of the 91 turtles found on the beaches, according to the foundation. \"I fear this event will have an impact for years to come.\" Research scientists with the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, such as Dr. Richard Bartleson, are blaming the mass mortality on the red tide bloom, a harmful algal bloom (HAB) that occurs when \u201ccolonies of algae \u2014 simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater \u2014 grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds,\u201d according to the National Ocean Service. Bartleson is one of many scientists that has worked to collect tissue and gut samples from sea turtles that have been stranded in recent months. The samples will be tested for brevetoxins, a group of neurotoxins that can impact both humans and animals alike. In humans, the toxins from these blooms, which are released into the air as waves crash on the beach, can have effects on the respiratory system, causing coughing and sneezing (in fact, one sea turtle expert from Collier County told the paper her voice became raspy after she was exposed to the outbreak). For sea life, the toxin \u201caffects the nervous system and red blood cells,\u201d Bartleson told Fox News on Thursday. Some sea creatures\u00a0\u2014 such as fish and sharks\u00a0\u2014 are impacted by toxins through their gills. When an animal breathes in, the toxins enter the body, eventually reaching the bloodstream. Sea turtles, on the other hand, do not have gills but are similarly affected through their mucus membranes or when ingesting the red tide bloom, Bartleson said. A red tide. (iStock) The turtles and other sea creatures, such as fish, likey don't sense the toxins when ingesting the bloom. GEORGIA HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS FIND SEA TURTLE HATCHLINGS IN TRASH CAN, POLICE SAY Swimming in circles, lack of coordination, head bobbing and muscle twitching are all symptoms a sea turtle has been exposed to the red tide Karenia brevis organism, which produces the brevetoxins, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. While the red tide does occur naturally, Bartleson noted it has been made worse, and has been prolonged by human activities such as farming, development and manufacturing. Over the past number of years, the build up of chemicals\u00a0\u2014 such as phosphorus and nitrogen, among other elements typically found in fertilizer\u00a0\u2014 have provided \u201cthe perfect nutrients\u201d to worsen the bloom, Bartleson said. These chemicals reach the ocean through surface runoffs, which occur after a rainstorm, tropical storm or hurricane. Bartleson said the current red tide is partly due to the surface runoffs caused by Hurricane Irma, while the red tide that affected much of the state\u2019s central-west coast in 2005 and 2006 were worsened by the state\u2019s active hurricane season in 2004. In response, Bartleson, along with other scientists, have advocated for the use of the state\u2019s wetlands to redirect the surface runoff, as the wetlands act as a natural filter. WORLD TURTLE DAY 2018: 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE SHELLED SPECIES As for the sea turtles, \u201cI fear this event will have an impact for years to come,\u201d Heather Barron with the Center for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife veterinarian hospital on Sanibel, told the News-Press.

            "article_content": "Pythons as long as SUV\u2019s are tightening their grip on the Florida Everglades and with no natural predators in the state, the snakes native to Southeast Asia have quickly risen to the top of the food chain. A new study in the journal \u201cEcology and Evolution\u201d suggests the python problem could slither beyond just the swamp FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2013 With no natural predators in the Sunshine State, pythons native to Southeast Asia have taken over the Florida Everglades. The slithering creatures killed off a large swath of native habitat when they became king of the Everglades, wreaking havoc on the system\u2019s sensitive ecosystem. But now experts say the python problem has slithered beyond the swamp and could impact ecosystems all across Florida. It\u2019s unclear how far north the reptiles can go \u2013 the only conditions they seem to be susceptible to are colder climates \u2013 but experts worry they could easily adapt and invade other parts of the state. \u201cWe set out to investigate the Burmese python in the Everglades to help provide information for management and conservation agencies\u2026we found 13 of the 400 snakes that we analyzed had portions of Indian python within their genome,\u201d said Margaret Hunter, a USGS geneticist and the lead author of a study by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the journal\u00a0Ecology and Evolution, which concluded the snakes will become a growing problem in the U.S. Unlike the marsh-loving Burmese python, the Indian python prefers a high, drier habitat. \u201cThis might allow this population to expand into drier environments\u2026maybe further to the north or outside of the Everglades\u2026where the population is right now,\u201d Hunter said. She said more research needs to be done to determine when the hybridization of the two python species occurred, but there are three likely scenarios: they could have crossed in their native Southeast Asia, in the pet trade or after arriving in the Everglades. Researchers say it is difficult to determine whether python sightings north of the Florida Everglades are a result of migration or pet releases. (Fox News) But no matter how the species developed, one thing is certain: If the pythons expand beyond the Everglades, it would upend the state\u2019s entire ecosystem. \u201cThere has been evidence of severe small mammal declines linked to the Burmese python invasion in South Florida,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cPresumably, this trend could continue if the python population expands to the north.\u201d Experts are hoping that the animals would not survive colder climates, but the adaptability of the snakes has them concerned. \u201cThe only thing we can hope for is to have cold snaps come through, that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s been shown to throw the population back, but it also kills a ton of our native animals,\u201d said Chris Gillette, an animal expert at Everglades Holiday Park in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cAs you go north, there are also a lot more burrowing animals like gopher tortoises and armadillos and the pythons will utilize their burrows to avoid the cold. So, as they continue expanding north, it\u2019s going to be real interesting to see how this plays out.\u201d Python hatchlings were first found in Everglades National Park in the 1980s. Today, they\u2019ve turned into what scientists consider Florida\u2019s largest invasive species, killing off huge numbers of animal life native to the Everglades. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that these pythons can remove 90 percent or greater of the mammals throughout the Everglades,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re quite concerned about the populations of these animals in South Florida potentially leading to local extinctions of these populations.\u201d \u201cMarsh rabbits are the first to go, rats, cotton tail rabbits, raccoons, possums\u2026,\u201d said python hunter Tom Rahill. The South Florida Water Management District's Python Elimination Program has brought in over one thousand snakes. The largest recorded was a whopping 18 feet long. (Associated Press) Even deer and alligators have been found in the stomach of the silent predator. According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, approximately 99,000 Burmese pythons were imported to the U.S. between 1996 and 2006. In 2012, all constrictor snakes were banned from importation into the U.S. and interstate commerce of the animals was also made illegal. Up to 100,000 pythons are believed to be creeping through Florida\u2019s wetlands, most of them descendants of pets illegally released into the wild after getting too big and dangerous for their owners. A Burmese python can reach an impressive 23 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, growing from a 20-inch hatchling into an eight-foot predator in just one year. Because of their wide dietary preferences, long lifespan of 15 to 25 years, high reproductive output, and impressive swimming abilities, the snakes have been able to thrive in South Florida, using the region\u2019s widespread and elaborate canal systems to spread across the state. State and federal wildlife managers have tried all available options to combat the problem: tracking the snakes with dogs, using traps, fitting snakes with radio trackers, public hunting contests and even using what scientists call \u201cJudas snakes\u201d to lead them to other pythons. Last year, the South Florida Water Management District created the Python Elimination Program, hiring 25 licensed contractors to hunt and kill the invasive predators known to be so cryptic, you could be \u201cstanding right on top of one and not even know it,\u201d said Rahill, who founded a non-profit called \u201cSwamp Apes\u201d and takes war veterans out python hunting with him to help them cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The wranglers are paid $8 per hour to drive, hike and probe through the hot and humid Everglades looking for the well-camouflaged constrictors, receiving $50 for every snake killed and an extra $25 for every foot longer than four. A pregnant python rakes in an additional $100. \u201cOnce you make contact, it\u2019s game on\u2026it\u2019s an incredibly invigorating adrenaline-pumping experience,\u201d said Rahill. \u201cThese will never be eliminated, unfortunately, but the pythons have to be managed.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Two fishermen in Oklahoma came across the alligator snapping turtle while fishing with a trotline. (Oklahoma Game Warden) Two fishermen in southeast Oklahoma unexpectedly caught a 4-foot long, roughly 100-pound alligator snapping turtle earlier this month. Fishing with a trotline on Saturday morning, Jonathan Van Fleet and Anthony Dover came across the turtle which, according to the Oklahoma Game Warden, \u201cfound itself in a rather peculiar situation by munching on one of the sunfish used as bait.\u201d Van Fleet and Dover removed the \u201cbehemoth\u201d turtle from the tangled trotline before taking the hook out of its mouth. PICS: FLORIDA FISHERMEN REEL IN MASSIVE 800-POUND MARLIN Afterward, Van Fleet called local game warden Mark Hannah, who helped the men measure the turtle, which appeared to be healthy, before returning it to Little River. It is illegal to keep an alligator snapping turtle in the state, according to the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (DFW). \"Because of its rarity and low reproductive rate, the Alligator Snapping Turtle is classified as a species of special concern and a year-round closed season prohibits the trapping, possession or killing of these turtles,\" the Oklahoma DFW explained on its website. It's unclear exactly how old this particular turtle is, but alligator snapping turtles usually live to the ages of between 80 and 120. VID SHOWS FISHERMAN DRAGGING SHARK BACK INTO THE OCEAN The Oklahoma Game Warden posted pictures of the incredible find on Facebook, garnering nearly 2,000 shares as of Thursday afternoon. Though it's an impressive catch\u00a0\u2014 with a shell measuring 24 inches wide \u2014 wildlife officials warned the creatures can be rather dangerous if not handled properly. \u201cIt is advised that you use caution when dealing with them. The bite from a turtle this large can easily remove a finger, or even your hand,\u201d the Oklahoma Game Warden said.",

            "article_content": "Gubernatorial candidate David Garcia touts borderless agenda. The political director of Arizona's Democratic candidate for governor plagiarized significant portions of his campaign website when he ran for U.S. Congress, blaming an outside consultant for the copying and pasting, Fox News can reveal. Billy Kovacs, the newly-appointed political director for David Garcia\u2019s campaign, unsuccessfully ran for Congress earlier this year, finishing fifth out of seven Democrats in the party\u2019s primary in August with less than 5,000 votes. Garcia, who will face off against Governor Doug Ducey in November,\u00a0celebrated the appointment of Kovacs, who touted himself as an \u201cauthentic, genuine\u201d candidate, saying \u201chis youth, energy, and passion for Arizona was felt throughout his campaign, and he will be a great addition as we fight to turn Arizona blue.\u201d But Fox News can reveal that Kovacs\u2019 campaign website plagiarized comments at least 14 times from former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, other lawmakers, and media outlets. \u201cAs a small business owner I see firsthand that small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstone of our communities,\u201d Kovacs wrote\u00a0on his campaign website. The line is plagiarized from Obama\u2019s 2010 remarks. \u201cWe should be doing everything we can to make voting easier \u2013 not harder,\u201d the campaign website stated. The exact sentence was previously uttered\u00a0by Clinton in 2015. Kovacs\u2019 liberal borrowing of phrases also includes an exact comment from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said the Internet \u201cbelongs to the people, and we must keep it free, open, and equally accessible for all.\u201d David Garcia's political director plagiarized comments by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer In an interview with Fox News, Kovacs admitted his responsibility for the error in using the exact lines from others, but said an outside consultant provided the lines to the campaign to allign his campaign with the mainstream Democratic Party messaging. \u201cAt the start of my campaign, we were provided messaging documents from an outside consultant. I used these documents regularly in the course of my campaign for various purposes and used the suggested messaging language for social media, as that was the intent. I did not know it was verbatim copy that others had used but it was given to me for the express purpose of aligning my campaign with national messaging,\" he said in a statement. Fox News has also identified at least four instances of Kovacs\u2019 campaign website plagiarizing Mike Levin, a Democratic candidate in California running to unseat an incumbent Republican. \u201cI will always stand for women\u2019s health issues, including access to contraception and the right to make one\u2019s own reproductive choices. I believe that only a woman, her family, and her doctor should be able to decide what is best for her health,\u201d read Garcia\u2019s political director\u2019s website in 2018, plagiarizing\u00a0the exact phrasing from Levin\u2019s website in 2017. \u201cWe cannot allow our seniors to go without health care or fall into poverty and homelessness,\u201d Kovacs\u2019 site read, borrowing from Levin\u2019s campaign website that stated \u201cOur great nation cannot allow its seniors to go without healthcare or fall into poverty and homelessness.\u201d Kovacs\u2019 website also features a few instances of plagiarism from media outlets, including plagiarizing an Atlantic magazine article in 2015. \u201cIn today's economy, a high school degree no longer guarantees a middle-class income, so Obama properly wants to update the country's social contract to make two years of college, not just high school, something students receive at public expense,\u201d wrote\u00a0Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. On the campaign website, Kovacs stated the following: \u201cWe need to properly update our country\u2019s social contract to make two years of college, not just high school, something students receive at public expense.\u201d The Garcia campaign has been embarrassed by campaign staffers previously,\u00a0despite claims that every new hire is being carefully vetted. \"The slow motion train wreck that is David Garcia's campaign takes another disastrous turn. First he had to fire a staffer for tweeting hateful rhetoric toward law enforcement and America. Now this? It shows Garcia is completely incapable of running even a small-scale campaign, let alone be governor,\" said Arizona Republican Party Spokeswoman Ayshia Connors. Connors was referring to\u00a0Xenia Orona, the campaign\u2019s former digital director until last August, who was ousted from the campaign after her offensive social media posts resurfaced. She reportedly called the U.S. a \u201csh\u2014hole country\u201d and threw her support behind the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d movement. Garcia's email marketing team is also getting flak for repeated typos, bad grammar, incorrect facts like stating Garcia will be the first Latino elected \u201cto high office in Arizona\u201d and sending out a fundraiser email titled \u201cDavid Garcia for Congress\u201d despite running for the state\u2019s governorship.",

            "article_content": "File photo: A koala joey hangs on its mother Goonderrah, the Aboriginal name for fighter, following a weighing procedure at the zoo in the western German city of Duisburg June 11, 2010. (REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay) One of the leading killers of Australia's endearing koalas is a debilitating bacterial infection:\u00a0chlamydia. The idea of\u00a0koalas\u00a0with chlamydia \u2014 a common sexually transmitted infection in people \u2014 recently drew chuckles on HBO's \"Last Week Tonight,\" but the disease, which is affecting koalas in epidemic proportions, is hardly a laughing matter. Chlamydia-infected koalas made the news on Sunday (May 6) when the show's host, John Oliver, mentioned the dedication of a new koala ward at the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, called the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward, to treat the sick marsupials. But chlamydia is no joke to koalas. Surveys have shown that some wild populations demonstrate a 100 percent rate of infection, which frequently leads to blindness, severe bladder inflammation, infertility and death. And treatment with antibiotics could create further problems for the marsupials, upsetting their gut microbes and making it difficult for them to digest the eucalyptus leaves that are a staple of their diet, researchers recently discovered. [Marsupial Gallery: A Pouchful of Cute] Though chlamydia has sickened koalas for decades, it has long been unclear why they are so vulnerable to the infection. But scientists now suspect that a virus in the same family as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could be the culprit, according to a study published online in the March issue of the\u00a0Journal of Virology. Researchers learned that koalas infected with this virus, called koala retrovirus type B, were more likely to be infected with chlamydia, and were also more likely to develop severe symptoms, such as infections in their urinary and reproductive tracts, conjunctivitis and cancers. Adult koalas catch chlamydia just as people do \u2014 through sexual transmission \u2014 but young koalas can also become infected by eating pap, a nutritious type of feces, when it is excreted by infected mothers, according to a study published March 12 in the journal\u00a0Peer J. Diseased koalas are treated with antibiotics, but the koalas often lose weight and die even after receiving treatment, scientists discovered. In the Peer J study, the researchers questioned whether the drugs meant to save the koalas might be upsetting the balance of their gut diversity and interfering with their ability to digest their food. Eucalyptus leaves, which provide much of adult koalas' nutrition in the wild, contain a compound called tannin that can be highly toxic if it isn't broken down by certain types of gut bacteria, and if those microbes are absent, koalas might be unable to process their eucalyptus meals, the scientists wrote. They also found that there was \"a strong correlation\" between the composition of a koala's gut flora and its prognosis for survival after treatment with antibiotics. This was especially true for the microbe\u00a0Lonepinella koalarum,\u00a0which is known for its ability to break down tannin, according to the study. Over the past two decades, koala populations in parts of Australia have declined by as much as 80 percent, researchers reported in February 2017 in the journal\u00a0Scientific Reports. Surveys of records from treatment facilities found that chlamydia was the most lethal of all diseases affecting the animals, second only to injury from cars as the most frequent cause of koala death. While the new John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward will no doubt help some infected koalas, there is clearly much more work required to preserve a future for these iconic animals.
