            "article_content": "California city is allowing illegal immigrants to vote in a school board election. William La Jeunesse explains. The city of San Francisco this week began allowing non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, to register to vote in the November election for the city school board. The effort follows the city's passage of a 2016 ballot measure that gave the right to vote in school board elections to non-U.S. citizens over age 18 who live in San Francisco and have children under age 19, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The measure was approved by a majority of San Francisco's eligible voters, but after the first two attempts failed. \u201cThis is no-brainer legislation,\u201d Hillary Ronen, of the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors, told the publication. \u201cWhy would we not want our parents invested in the education of their children?\u201d \"This is no-brainer legislation. ... Why would we not want our parents invested in the education of their children?\" \u201cAs a parent myself and a former member of the SF Board of Education it is critical that the voices of all parents are at the table, particularly those that have historically been denied a voice in the process,\u201d Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer said. \u201cWe want to give immigrants the right to vote,\u201d Supervisor Norman Yee told KGO. A similar initiative of giving limited voting rights has also reportedly been approved in Chicago and multiple cities in Maryland and Massachusetts. But other San Francisco residents are expressing dismay with non-citizens becoming eligible to vote in certain elections. \u201cThe reason I voted against it is that I think the right to vote is something that goes along with citizenship -- and should be,\u201d said Harmeet Dhillon, a member of the Republican National Committee. \"The reason I voted against it is that I think the right to vote is something that goes along with citizenship -- and should be.\" Some supporters of the measure, though celebrating, also expressed reservations that it could be weaponized by the federal government to crack down on illegal immigrants. \"The victory is that San Franciscans voted for this. In the face of what's happening nationwide now, we stand strong. ... But there is also a risk. So we as San Franciscans have set aside a fund to make sure that these immigrant communities are fully educated on their rights, but also their risks in this time and place in our country,\" Fewer told the Chronicle. She said it\u2019s not clear whether non-citizens\u2019 voting registry could be hidden from the federal records, because voting records are considered public information. \"I think in this case in particular, what is very risky is that we don't know where this president will go,\" she added. \"Are there risks involved? Absolutely. But quite frankly, there are risks involved for all of us with the Trump administration.\u201d The measure granting non-citizens the right to vote will expire in 2022, but can be renewed by the Board of Supervisors, reports said.",

            "article_content": "Bret Baier examines another hot-button issue in November's elections: immigration. From legalizing marijuana to increasing minimum wage, voters nationwide won\u2019t just be deciding candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. A bevy of policy initiatives are slated to appear on ballots for the people to decide Tuesday. Read on for a look at 12 measures up for a vote this year across the country. MIDTERMS 2018 LIVE BLOG Three states have measures pertaining to abortion on the ballot this year \u2013 and they are all geared toward restricting access or public funding to the procedure. In Alabama, Amendment 2 would add to the state\u2019s constitution an affirmation of support for \u201cthe sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\u201d It would also include a clarification that the state \u201cdoes not protect the right to abortion or require the funding of an abortion using public funds.\u201d West Virginia\u2019s Amendment 1 would also specify its state constitution does not \u201csecure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of an abortion.\u201d While these measures wouldn\u2019t immediately impact state policy when it comes to abortion, it would solidify concrete language in the states\u2019 constitutions should\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0ever be overturned. In Oregon, Measure 106 would prohibit the use of public funds for an abortion unless deemed \u201cmedically necessary\u201d by a licensed doctor if passed. Voters in four states will have the opportunity to decide whether marijuana \u2013 recreational or medicinal \u2013 should be legalized this year. Michigan and North Dakota both have measures on the ballot that would legalize recreational marijuana use for its residents who are at least 21 years old. Missouri has three ballot initiatives for voters to choose from if they support legalizing medicinal marijuana. The differences between the measures are mostly in how much the marijuana would be taxed and what that money would go toward. Proposals include veterans\u2019 services, drug treatment and medical research. Voters in Utah, too, will consider a measure legalizing medical marijuana for those suffering from specific illnesses. Oklahoma voters already approved legalizing medical marijuana earlier this year. Tamar Todd,\u00a0senior director with the Drug Policy Alliance, said the country has \u201creached a tipping point\u201d when it comes to broad and bipartisan public support for marijuana legalization \u2013 particularly since people have \u201chad time to see how it played out\u201d in states that have legalized it, like Colorado and Washington. And with Canada set to legalize marijuana nationwide before November, votes in the border states of Michigan and North Dakota could be especially interesting to watch, Todd said. An initiative to repeal Oregon\u2019s so-called sanctuary state status \u2013 which regulates just how much law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities \u2013 is on the November ballot as Measure 105. Oregon has been a sanctuary state since 1987, making\u00a0the law\u00a0the oldest in the nation. It\u00a0prohibits law enforcement agencies from using \u201cagency monies, equipment or personnel for the purpose of detecting or apprehending persons whose only violation of law is\u201d that they are in \u201cviolation of federal immigration laws.\u201d The Trump administration has been particularly critical of sanctuary policies \u2013 whether at the city or state level. Alabama voters will get to decide whether to allow the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property, including schools, with Amendment 1. If approved, state funds could not be used to erect these displays, but private money would be used. Critics argue allowing the religious display would violate the separation of church and state. However, proponents said the Founding Fathers were able to express their Christian beliefs, and the amendment would be a reaffirmation of religious liberty. Although slavery was technically abolished with the 13th Amendment more than 150 years ago, Colorado\u2019s state constitution still includes a provision that technically permits a person to be sentenced to slavery or indentured servitude if convicted of a crime. As of now, Section 26 of Article II of the state\u2019s constitution states: \u201cThere shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\u201d Voters in November will have the opportunity to shorten the section by omitting the part beginning with \u201cexcept\u201d if Amendment A passes. A similar initiative was defeated in 2016 due to apparent confusion over the wording of the measure. Offshore oil and gas drilling and e-cigarette use might not seem like they have much in common, but the ban of both is the topic of a single Florida ballot measure this year. If passed, Amendment 9 would ban vaping in enclosed, indoor workplaces and offshore drilling for oil and gas in state waters. Pushed by Republicans and some Democrats, an effort to repeal California\u2019s controversial gas tax hike will be on the ballot in November. If passed, Proposition 6 would reverse California Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s 12-cent gas tax increase and transportation improvement fee that has resulted in a gallon of gasoline in the state costing about 80 cents higher than the national average. Supporters of the tax, such as California Association of Highway Patrolmen Doug Villars, has said the money is needed to fix the state\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure. But critics have said it places even more financial burdens on motorists in the state. If it\u2019s passed, more than 1.5 million Florida residents convicted of felonies could see their voting rights restored as early as 2020 as long as they have served their time and paid any required restitution. Amendment 4 would not apply to murderers or sex offenders. \u201cThis would move Florida out of being an outlier and more into the mainstream,\u201d Myrna P\u00e9rez, deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program, told Fox News. \u201cThis follows the general trend we have seen in recent years.\u201d If passed, Proposition 12 in California would significantly impact farmers. It would ban the sale of eggs in the state that come\u00a0from hens raised in small cages. The proposal would require hens have at least one square foot of usable floor space by the end of 2019 and be completely cage-free by the end of 2021. They would also need to be provided nests, perches and scratching posts. Cage-free eggs can also cost as much as two times the amount of regular eggs, stoking concerns among consumers. The measure would also require farmers to give calves raised for veal 43 square feet of usable floor space; breeding pigs would require at least 24 square feet. It would\u00a0ban the sale of any meat in California that does not meet these standards. North Carolinians will get to decide whether the hunting and fishing should be rights guaranteed in the state\u2019s constitution. The measure wouldn\u2019t actually change any current hunting regulations in the state. But it could ward off any future legal challenges to the hunting of specific animals or hunting methods. A proposed measure in Massachusetts would restrict the number of patients assigned to registered nurses in the state. The number of patients allowed to be assigned would depend on the emergency room, anesthesia, maternity and pediatric care services in the facility if Question #1 passes. Two states have ballot measures this year that would increase the minimum wage if passed: Arkansas and Missouri Issue Five would raise the minimum wage from $8.50 per hour to $9.25 per hour by January 2019. Then it would increase to $10 per hour in January 2020 and $11 per hour in January 2021. In Missouri, Proposition B would increase the minimum wage by 85 cents every year until 2023. Then, the minimum wage would be $12 per hour. If Proposition B passes, government employers would be exempt from the increase. Now, the minimum wage is $7.85.

While the conservative version was expected to fail, House leaders were hoping the separate compromise measure might have a chance. But tensions are running high over the debate on family separations at the border. President Trump's sudden executive action over the border crisis stemmed some of the urgency for Congress to act. But House GOP leaders still were pulling out the stops to bring reluctant Republicans on board in hopes of resolving broader immigration issues ahead of the November midterm election. That vote is now set for Friday. Passage of the bill was always a long shot, but failure may now come at a steeper price as Republicans -- and Trump -- have raised expectations that, as the party in control of Congress and the White House, they can fix the nation's long-standing immigration problems. \u2018This is a bill that has consensus. This is a bill that the president supports. It's a bill that could become law,\u2019 said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\u201d Ryan ruptures with Freedom Caucus -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cA House immigration bill meticulously negotiated by Republicans appeared to be on the brink of failure ahead of a planned Thursday vote after House Speaker\u00a0Paul D. Ryan\u00a0(R-Wis.) and a top conservative leader engaged in an unusually heated floor confrontation Wednesday. Rep.\u00a0Mark Meadows\u00a0(R-N.C.) argued with Ryan in plain view of lawmakers, aides and reporters during a Wednesday afternoon vote \u2014 a dispute that Meadows later confirmed surrounded the immigration votes scheduled for Thursday. The typically mild-mannered Meadows could be seen repeating \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 as Ryan spoke to him, and he walked away from Ryan at one point only to return and continue arguing. Speaking to reporters afterward, Meadows accused Ryan and other House leaders of a bait-and-switch \u2014 agreeing to a deal on what would be contained in the compromise legislation only to leave key provisions out of the final text.\u201d Trump continued to blame Democrats during cabinet meeting - CBS News: \u201cPresident Trump continued to blame Democrats for not wanting to solve the nation's outstanding immigration problems, in light of his executive order changing the policy on separating children from immigrant families who cross the southern border illegally. \u2026 He added that Democrats are responsible for a \u2018massive child-smuggling industry\u2019 and are not providing enough resources to combat the issue of housing migrant children. \u2026 Meanwhile, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney announced during the meeting that the administration would be spearheading a massive reorganization of the federal government. Mulvaney said the move fulfills the president's promise to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 in Washington. \u2018It's been almost 100 years since anybody has reorganized the government on this scale,\u2019 Mulvaney said.\u00a0 He used food metaphors to slam the \u2018byzantine\u2019 nature of the way the government currently regulates, calling the process \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018makes no sense.\u2019 Melania visits child detention center in Texas\u00a0-\u00a0Fox\u00a0News: \u201cFirst lady Melania Trump on Thursday visited a child detention center in Texas that houses minors who entered the country illegally -- in the wake of her husband\u2019s executive order that ended the practice of separating families. Mrs. Trump visited the Upbring New Hope Children\u2019s Center, after she was reported to have been a force in getting the president to act in the wake of a days-long controversy surrounding the effects of the Department of Justice\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy. The first lady said earlier through her spokeswoman that she \u2018hates\u2019 to see families separated at the border. \u2018We all know they are here without their families and I want to thank you for your hard work, compassion and kindness you are giving them in these difficult times,\u2019 Mrs. Trump told a roundtable of workers at the Texas center.\u201d THE RULEBOOK: AND SEE HOW THAT TURNED OUT\u00a0\u201cThe Congress which conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous body than their successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor responsible to, their fellow citizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and recallable at pleasure, they were generally continued for three years, and prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a still longer term.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u00a0or\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 55 TIME OUT: BEYOND THE PAGE\u00a0Atlantic:\u00a0\u201cWhy do some books make us want to know an author personally, identifying so thoroughly with the public work that we try to lay claim to the private self?

The RNC had $47.4 million in cash on hand, records show. The Democratic National Committee raised $5.6 million in May for a total of $97.8 million for the cycle.

Golden will now challenge two-term Republican Rep.\u00a0Bruce Poliquin\u00a0in November in a traditionally Democratic district that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. Golden finished first in last week\u2019s three-way primary with 47 percent of the vote, falling short of the majority needed to avoid a so-called instant runoff. Conservationist\u00a0Lucas St. Clair\u00a0was second with 39 percent. \u2026 With no one getting a majority, the third-place finisher, Islesboro bookstore owner\u00a0Craig Olson, was eliminated and his votes were distributed to his supporters\u2019 second choices.

It took eight days for the winner to be declared by Secretary of State\u00a0Matt Dunlap\u2019s office after the voting method approved by Maine voters in 2016 was used in a statewide election for the first time in U.S. history in four different races. While Republicans picked businessman Shawn Moody\u00a0for governor in a landslide on Election Day, Democrats had to wait for Mills of Farmington to be declared the winner over Cote of Sanford, lobbyist Betsy Sweet\u00a0of Hallowell, former House Speaker\u00a0Mark Eves\u00a0of North Berwick and three others.\u201d Dems divided over who should face Walker -\u00a0Marquette University:\u00a0\u201cA new Marquette Law School Poll finds one in three Wisconsin voters remains undecided on August primary candidates in each party.

The procedural vote to tee up President Donald Trump\u2019s $15 billion cutbacks package for floor consideration failed 48-50 Wednesday afternoon. Sen.\u00a0Susan Collins\u00a0(R-Maine), who opposed the procedural vote, had made clear for weeks that she had objections to the package. But the surprise GOP defection came from Sen.\u00a0Richard Burr\u00a0(R-N.C.), who had been fighting behind the scenes on the land and water conservation cuts in the rescissions package. Burr ultimately broke with the GOP because he wasn\u2019t guaranteed a vote on his amendment to protect that funding, according to a Senate GOP aide. Senate GOP leaders have until Friday to pass the so-called rescissions measure with a simple majority, before their special procedural powers expire and a 60-vote threshold sets in. So the failed vote could be the Senate\u2019s first and only shot at advancing the White House\u2019s much-heralded, deficit-reduction bill.\u201d THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: FIRST DUTIESThis week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0asks whether the FBI can be independent: \u201cOn the one hand, the FBI is an investigative entity only. It does not decide whom or what to charge; it merely reports its findings to federal prosecutors in conjunction with their presentation of evidence to grand juries. As such, the FBI is subject to the DOJ prosecutors for whom it works, and the DOJ, of course, works for the president. On the other hand, because both the DOJ and the FBI are guided by the ethical rules that govern lawyers and by the values of the rule of law implicit in American culture and recognized by the courts, the DOJ enjoys some independence from the president, and the FBI enjoys some independence from the DOJ. Principles such as equal protection under the law and due process of law protect life, liberty and property and trump instructions of the president to the DOJ and instructions of the DOJ to the FBI.\u201d More\u00a0here.

There are certainly some things, like undoing the direct election of senators and restoring regular order in the House, that I think would be worth doing first, but I am sympathetic to the idea of limits, to say the least. I think it would also be helpful if we started judging people on their ideas and their records rather than arbitrarily abjuring those with experience.

But I am afraid that you may have been misinformed. The complaint of the current administration is that low-cost good from other countries where things are cheaper to make harms American manufacturing. We may be at full employment, but the current administration wants to reshape the kinds of jobs in which Americans work to return to a mid-20th\u00a0century manufacturing model. To serve that goal, they are going to make goods from other countries more expensive so American producers get an advantage. This will mean higher costs for consumers, but proponents say it is the price of planning an economy in the model they seek. The larger risk, though, is that other countries will do the same in retaliation and shut off markets for American goods, particularly agricultural products and high-end finished goods like aircraft. We don\u2019t know how the president\u2019s game of chicken is going to play out, but the point here isn\u2019t about helping Americans sell more overseas, it\u2019s about remaking the domestic economy.]\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love the quotes from Charles Krauthammer you are using.\u00a0 I\u2019ve missed his wisdom and wit since he became ill.\u00a0 His book is a jewel to read.\u201d \u2013\u00a0David Zlotnick, Santa Fe, N.M.[Ed. note: It truly, truly is.

            "article_content": "Five October surprises that could change everything before midterm election day From the growing caravan of migrants making its way toward America's southern border to a pledge of new tax cuts for middle-income Americans, the midterm season could yet hold a few twists and turns between now and Election Day. The Nov. 6 elections are widely seen as a referendum on the Trump administration and Republican policies pushed in the past two years. Democrats hope to take control of the House and Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow lead. But a series of developments could tilt the final outcome. Thousands of migrants are heading to the U.S. border seeking asylum, tensions with multiple foreign nations seem ready to boil over and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is nearing a close. Read on for a look at five potential October surprises. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election appears to be wrapping up as he reportedly is readying his team's findings. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election has continued for more than a year \u2014 and he's reportedly close to delivering his core findings. This is likely to happen after the midterms.\u00a0A pair of anonymous U.S. officials told Bloomberg\u00a0that Mueller is getting ready to\u00a0answer the two questions on everyone\u2019s minds: whether Trump actually obstructed justice, and if he or his campaign colluded with Russia to win the White House. But while the final product is not expected until after the elections,\u00a0any hints about the findings or additional charges could invigorate Democrats -- or even rally Republicans convinced the probe is a \"witch hunt.\" Meanwhile, if Democrats take the House of Representatives in November, party leaders are expected to re-open the probe\u00a0into alleged collusion between Russian officials and the 2016 Trump campaign, calling back key witnesses, looking into Twitter messages between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks and allowing public hearings with top Trump officials. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS So far, Mueller\u2019s team has secured six guilty pleas\u00a0and verdicts, including from four former Trump campaign advisers, and one jury conviction. He has pending indictments against more than two dozen others and three Russian companies. Central American migrants walking to the U.S. start their day departing Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, Sunday, Oct. 21, 2018. Despite Mexican efforts to stop them at the border, about 5,000 Central American migrants resumed their advance toward the U.S. border early Sunday in southern Mexico. (AP Photo/Moises Castillo) As thousands of migrants continue their trek through Mexico toward the U.S. border, Trump has threatened to call in the military for reinforcement and slash aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The confrontation could escalate in the days ahead. Trump has made illegal immigration a rallying cry for his Republican base throughout the midterm elections, and the thousands of Central Americans traveling toward the border have become a highly visible example. He\u2019s heaped the blame for illegal immigration and the caravan, specifically, on Democrats. \u201cEvery time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cRemember the Midterms!\u201d DEMOCRATS AVOID SPARRING WITH TRUMP ON CARAVAN AS MIDTERM NEARS While Trump\u2019s continued focus on the caravan \u2014\u00a0particularly on social media \u2014 could rouse Republican voters, it could also do the opposite, boosting turnout among Democrats who seem more sympathetic toward the many migrants who have said they are fleeing widespread violence, poverty and corruption in their home countries. \u201cI think you run the risk of angering minority voters across the board, Latino, black and Asian-Americans and also alienating and distancing from whites, including conservatives and moderates now that they see what\u2019s happening with the family separations,\u201d Matt Barreto, co-founder of the research firm Latino Decision, told The Associated Press. If the past is any indicator, the caravan is likely to disperse some as it continues through Mexico, with groups traveling at different rates and some choosing to seek asylum in Mexico. Ahead of the midterm elections, Trump just promised a new round of tax cuts for \u201cmiddle-income people.\u201d With Congress not in session until after the elections, Trump has conceded there wouldn\u2019t be a vote until after Nov. 6. But the plan is clearly aimed at middle-class voters, and Trump said Monday he's looking at a 10 percent cut, with plans to unveil a new measure within the next two weeks. Trump said the package will be a \u201cmajor tax cut for middle-income people,\u201d and unlike the 2017 tax overheal, won\u2019t focus on businesses. He said his administration, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady, the Republican chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, are all \u201cworking on it.\u201d The possibility of Democrats gaining control of the House after the election would give them an opportunity to launch impeachment proceedings. And there have been increasing whispers about that scenario. Still, in several key races, Democrats\u00a0want to distance themselves from the idea in order not to alienate moderate and conservative voters. Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who faces incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz in a fierce battle, has found a way to dance around the topic. He said while he would vote for impeaching Trump, he\u2019s not in favor of actually initiating the proceedings at the moment. TRUMP WARNS \u2018MARKET WOULD CRASH\u2019 IF DEMOCRATS IMPEACH HIM But a more open embrace of impeachment by Democratic leaders and candidates could boost GOP turnout. Republicans have used the possibility of impeachment as fodder in their campaigns. During a debate between Florida gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis, the former Republican congressman accused his opponent of not being able to work with Trump to get things done for the state if he\u2019s elected. \u201cYou need to be able to work with the president,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cAndrew can\u2019t do that. He wants to impeach Trump, he\u2019s always saying bad things about him.\u201d An escalation of tensions with a foreign nation could also impact the upcoming elections \u2014 as multiple relationships hang in the balance. From trade with China to the pullout from an arms control treaty with Russia to Saudi Arabia\u2019s inconsistent and widely challenged responses to the death of an activist, Trump\u2019s response is pivotal. What exactly happened to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whom Saudi authorities claim died in a fistfight with officials in the consulate in Turkey, has rolled into the midterm elections. Candidates have sparred over criticisms of the administration\u2019s response to Saudi Arabia\u2019s inconsistencies\u00a0and defense of the United States\u2019 relationship with the Gulf nation. TRUMP NOT SATISFIED WITH EXPLANATION OF KHASHOGGI\u2019S KILLING In a debate with her GOP challenger, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said the country needs a stronger response to Saudi Arabia and charged Trump \u201cis showing he is not capable.\u201d But Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl said it\u2019s imperative to \u201ccontinue to have a relationship\u201d with Saudi Arabia, pointing to the many businesses in Massachusetts that do business in the kingdom. Additionally, ties between the U.S. and China are continuing down a path of acrimony amid a trade policy kerfuffle and accusations the communist nation plans to influence upcoming elections. Vice President Mike Pence has accused China of launching an \u201cunprecedented effort\u201d to influence the 2018 and 2020 elections to unseat Trump, warning the communist nation is responding to the president\u2019s tough trade policies. He pointed to Trump\u2019s tough line on Beijing, particularly Trump\u2019s decision to impose $250 billion in tariffs on goods coming from the country. He said in response, Beijing is using its power \u201cto interfere in the domestic policies of this country and to interfere in the politics of the United States.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Greg Norman, Samuel Chamberlain, Gregg Re, Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "City opens registration to select non-citizens for local elections. In San Francisco, immigrants who are in the country illegally are now eligible to register and vote in school board elections. Of course, this is clearly illegal under the California Constitution. Article II, Section 2 of the California Constitution says: \u201cA United States citizen 18 years of age and resident in this State may vote.\u201d However, the pro-illegal immigration, sanctuary state-supporting Democratic majority in the state Legislature has no interest in enforcing the law when it\u2019s being ignored by fellow Democrats. After all, the long-range plans Democrats have for a ruling majority depend on continuous law- breaking to get enough non-Americans to vote. The Californians who don\u2019t support the radical views of Democrats can simply be eclipsed by non-citizen voters supporting the Democrats. The long-range plans Democrats have for a ruling majority depend on continuous law- breaking to get enough non-Americans to vote. The Californians who don\u2019t support the radical views of Democrats can simply be eclipsed by non-citizen voters supporting the Democrats. As the San Francisco ABC News affiliate reported, the county\u2019s District 7 Elections Supervisor Norman Yee said: \u201dWe want to give immigrants the right to vote.\u201d Cal Thomas captured what is going on in a column last week headlined: \u201cThe Illegal Immigrant Vote. The name of the game: votes for Democrats.\u201d As Thomas points out, this is only the beginning of a much larger strategy. Thomas writes: \u201cWho doubts this is the first step by the left and Democrats toward full voting rights in state and eventually in federal elections? The claim by lawyers will be that it is discriminatory to allow undocumented immigrants to vote in local and state elections and not for members of Congress and for president. At bottom this is what the entire immigration debate is about.\u201d Thomas concludes: \u201cFor Democrats, it\u2019s a perfect cover for their ultimate goal: importing votes.\u201d With a broader critique than Thomas, Investor\u2019s Business Daily published an editorial last week headlined: \u201cYes, Democrats Are Now The Party Of Open Borders.\u201d The editorial pointed out that only 18 Democrats voted in favor of a recent congressional resolution voicing support for our U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and the many federal and state officers who assist them. In fact, 35 Democrats voted against the bill and 133 voted \u201cpresent\u201d to avoid putting a solid opinion on record. At the same time, the editorial noted that most congressional Democrats are standing idly by as eight of their members have sponsored a bill to abolish ICE, and many others are supporting a bill that would make it nearly impossible for ICE to do its job. As the editorial put it: \u201cDemocrats want to neuter the one agency responsible for enforcing border security. They want to make it easy for illegals who cross to stay in the country. And they want to give them the right to vote. Leading Democrats also adamantly oppose building a secure border wall. They support \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 that actively protect illegals from deportation. And they want to grant every illegal in the country amnesty.\u201d The editorial continued: \u201c...the Democratic Party has been driving to the far left on a wide range of issues for many years. The only difference now is that its veneer of moderation has eroded to the point where Democrats can't hide their extremism any longer.\u201d As I wrote in my New York Times best-selling book \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback,\u201d the U.S. immigration system is indeed troubled. But it will never be fixed until we re-establish security at the borders and refocus on immigrants who want to come here legally \u2013 so they can actually become American. A sound immediate step would be for Congress to pass a law reaffirming that you must be an American citizen to vote in all American elections. Let\u2019s see how many Democrats would oppose this simple requirement.",

            "article_content": "Reaction on 'Hannity' after Oakland mayor warns illegal immigrants about upcoming ICE raids. Controversial Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, Calif., is touting her opposition to President Trump\u2019s policies against illegal immigration -- while mayoral challengers criticize her for the city's homelessness problem and its high cost of living. Schaaf, a Democrat who captured headlines earlier this year after tipping off local illegal immigrants to a planned raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, is facing challenges from three other candidates as she seeks re-election Nov. 6. \u201cI also am proud when we stood up to Donald Trump when he came for people in our community,\u201d Schaaf said, drawing applause, as she debated her election rivals Wednesday, according to the Bay Area's\u00a0FOX 2. \"I also am proud when we stood up to Donald Trump when he came for people in our community.\" She boasted that her anti-Trump record and opposition to federal immigration policies made her a target of the administration. The mayor was widely praised by progressives in February when she posted a warning on her social media page, saying that she \u201clearned from multiple credible sources\u201d about an incoming raid by federal immigration authorities and urged \u201cnot to panic our residents but to protect them.\u201d The mayor said she didn\u2019t know further details of the ICE operation, but claimed she felt it was her \u201cduty and moral obligation as Mayor to give those families fair warning when that threat appears imminent.\u201d OAKLAND MAYOR WARNS OF IMPENDING ICE RAID, RAMPING UP SANCTUARY-CITY TENSION But other mayoral candidates decided to focus instead on issues of greater concern to residents of California's eighth-largest city, with about 417,000 residents. \u201cThe Oakland that we knew will not be here in two years. We will not survive another two years under Mayor Libby Schaaf,\u201d candidate and civil rights lawyer Pamela Price told the crowd. \u201cWe cannot afford to have development that is not balanced, that does not leave behind and destroy the fabric of this community,\u201d she added on the topic of the technology industry\u2019s domination in the city. Candidate Marchon Tatman slammed Schaaf for the city\u2019s homelessness problem fueled by unaffordable rents, which he says doubled in the last four years. \u201cEverything doubled in the past four years except wages,\u201d he said. HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS INCREASINGLY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA TRAIN TRAFFIC Oakland activist Cat Brooks, meanwhile, slammed Schaaf from the left, saying the city was \u201cbroken\u201d and that Schaaf \u201cdisrespects and disregards the voices of our most impacted Oakland community members.\u201d Schaaf also was accused of ignoring the needs of people in poor neighborhoods when it comes to illegal dumping. \u201cIf we can do it in the hills, we can do it in the flats,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our mayor's neighborhood there was not mattresses and piles of garbage and dead rats and needles.\u201d \"If we can do it in the hills, we can do it in the flats. In our mayor's neighborhood there was not mattresses and piles of garbage and dead rats and needles.\" Schaaf defended her record, saying Oakland was one of the most violent cities in America and lacked basic investment, but under her watch the city improved. \u201cOakland was ranked as the second most violent city in America and there was not a single construction crane,\" she said. \u201cI am ready to finish the work that I have started and deliver a thriving, equitable city.\u201d",

Michael McCaul supports Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and discusses lawmakers' push to force a House vote on immigration bills on 'Sunday Morning Futures.' This is a rush transcript from \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" May 12, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome and good Sunday morning everybody. Happy Mother's Day to all my heroes, mothers everywhere. President Trump takes charge of foreign policy dumping one nuclear deal with Iran while looking to craft another with North Korea. Two powerful GOP Congressman with us this morning coming face to face with officials at the Justice Department. Then some red-state Democrats are feeling the heat to support the President ahead of the midterms. Good morning everyone, thanks for joining us. This is 'Sunday Morning Futures.' President Trump pulls out of the Iran Nuclear Deal ahead of a historic summit with Kim Jong Un. This as many tension flare up and terror strikes again in Paris. What are the biggest threats to U.S. national security right now? We will hear from former Vice President Dick Cheney in my exclusive interview this morning. Plus House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and Israel's ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon is with us this morning. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes meanwhile and Trey Gowdy headed to the Department of Justice for information about a top secret intelligence source involved in the Mueller probe. They didn't necessarily get what they wanted but still called the discussion productive. Congressman Darrell Issa will react. And Senator Joe Donnelly becomes the second Democrat to support Gina Haspel's nomination to be CIA director. But did he really have a choice in a state Trump won by a landslide? Our panel will discuss that as we look ahead this morning on 'Sunday Morning Futures.' President Trump calling out Tehran over its military budget and pointing to it as proof it never meant to hold up its end of the bargain regarding the Iran nuclear deal. The president yesterday tweeted that Iran has boosted its military budget by more than 40 percent since signing the deal which he says is an indication the country never intended to curve its nuclear ambitions. The president withdrew from the 2015 agreement last week but says that he wants to make a new and improved deal that will benefit both sides. Meanwhile, the decision is sparking outrage in Iran with one official saying that the country will prepare for industrial-scale production of nuclear fuel now. Joining me right now is the House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul. He's also member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And Mr. Chairman, it's good to have you on the program this morning. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, R\u2014TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE: Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. You're reaction to the president pulling out and also what we could see as retaliation from Iran? Should we be worried? MCCAUL: If I could first say Happy Mother's Day to my 90-year-old mother and wife, mother of five beautiful kids. BARTIROMO: Beautiful. MCCAUL: And so, now, this is a very intense time. I think the president made a very bold foreign policy move here. The deal with John Kerry was flawed from the beginning. It did not deal with inspections particularly military side. They had ballistic missile capability and sunset provisions so essentially guaranty the nuclear Iran. These are the three issues that the president tried to initiate with France, Germany, and Britain. I think France came along when Macron spoke at the state of the union and then I think the Brits were with us. This deal, by pulling out puts marginal pressure on Iran but also Europe within the 90 to 180 day timeframe window to cut that deal so we have a bitter deal to ensure that we never have nuclear Iran ever. The whole point of these sanctions by Congress was to get to the point where we would insure they would never have nuclear weapon capability. BARTIROMO: And you know, Dick Cheney told me as well that the Iranians have increased their military budget by40 percent. This is what the president has tweeted out this morning basically saying, look, look what they've done with the money. We've already given them all of this money. Are you expecting any retaliation, anything that we should be worried about in the homeland given that they're not happy, they're chanting death to America? MCCAUL: Death to America, death to Israel. $150 billion went to buy the sanctions, 40 percent ramping up their military. When I was in Israel with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he talked about the Shia crescent of Iran going Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. We know they fired missiles into to Golden Heights, a very intense situation. I do anticipate there'll probably some sort of retaliation by Iran, also in cyberspace. We saw after the sanctions in 2011, major cyber-attacks on the financial sector. But again, I think the president is doing something very unconventional and bold. At the end of the day just like what's happening with North Korea, could produce very positive result. BARTIROMO: Yes, connect the dots. Do North and -- North Korea and Iran work together on nuclear ambitions? This is pretty significant what has taken place in terms of North Korea and the president was able to put the pressure campaign even on China to get involved and help North Korea come to the table. MCCAUL: It -- I think it was a great act of diplomacy by Mike Pompeo. He's a good friend of mine. We traveled overseas quite a bit. You know, AQ and Pakistan pull for aide to Iran and then North Korea in Iran exchange technology. So you know, that's a pure fact. And I think you know, the fact is these prisoners came home from North Korea after maximum pressure was applied as you mentioned by China as well. We didn't see that happen when the Obama administration was trying to negotiate with Iran. In fact, I introduced a bill last week to provide sanctions on Iran because they have still have five American hostages that have never been released. BARTIROMO: Wow. And we know that the last time we saw any hostages coming home, there was an exchange of money to Iran. MCCAUL: Yes, cash on -- BARTIROMO: Exactly. BARTIROMO: So what should we think about the Europeans right now. Will they follow -- and during this 180 day period, people and companies and countries have to decide if I'll do business with the United States or with Iran. MCCAUL: I think that is fundamental choice. Do I do business with the United States or Iran, they're going to pick the United States. That's why we have the ultimate leverage on Iran. BARTIROMO: So you think the Europeans change course. You think for example Macron, Angela Merkel say we have to pull out of this deal as well. I mean, will we see new information coming out of this? MCCAUL: I think Macron was willing to negotiate on those three points there can be inspections. Remember we can't inspect their military sites. Where else are they going to build their nuclear capability, right? The ICBM ballistic missile capability and then the sunset which means we're guaranteeing a nuclear Iran. So we have to get those three issues resolved. I think what the President has done as a good deal maker has put maximum pressure now on Europe and Iran to get this done so we get a better deal. This was not a good deal that was negotiated by John Kerry and President Obama. BARTIROMO: Yes, meanwhile John Kerry is running around trying to salvage this deal somehow in the last month which was incredible. Let me move on to immigration Mr. Chairman because a lot of frustration obviously on the part of the president recently that were are not clamping down more. What can Congress do? Apparently, there was a meeting last week where the president was upset with his Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Where you at that meeting? MCCAUL: No, I was not. That was a cabinet meeting. I've heard about the meeting. Quite honestly, I see the frustration on both the president and secretary's part. This is Congress' role to act. Congress has the authority under the Constitution. I have a border security bill that will secure the border. We have to close the legal loopholes so when that caravan comes in that we saw, we can't just detain them and let them go, catch and release. BARTIROMO: That's catch and release. Exactly. MCCAUL: We have to deport them. BARTIROMO: So -- because what stops anybody from taking another caravan in just bringing hundreds of people right in knowing that we have to catch and release. MCCAUL: Yes, if you have a criminal come in your house and break in and yet, you can't -- you can't arrest them or report them, absolutely insane. The American people don't understand this. Congress can change this. BARTIROMO: Can Congress change this over the near term? MCCAUL: If we have my border security bill, the slim version of interior that really focuses on closing legal loopholes. That being you know, asylum changing the 2008 laws that allows them to stay in the country. Change those two things and then deal with the DACA issue. But Maria, it's paramount we do this soon because the longer we wait, the longer -- if go into July, we have to get them by July because after that it's about campaign. I worry that the Democrats wouldn't prefer to make DACA a campaign issue and not a legitimate policy issue. BARTIROMO: Yes, you are right. And it feels like that's where they're going with this, by the way, take it all the way to the midterms. Before you go, any thoughts on NAFTA and whether or not we're going to see a deal sooner rather than later. The president apparently is putting a soft deadline of May 18th and May 19th to try and get a deal done so that Congress can deal with it before the Mexican elections and then, of course, we've got the midterm elections. MCCAUL: Well, I always have (INAUDIBLE) U.S.-Mexico congressional delegations, but we have to fix it and update it not scrap it. My home state of Texas, Mexico is our largest trading partner. So this is economic for us. I think the administration is getting there to modernize the agreement, bring energy under the umbrella and also the country of words and principles that are so important. But I -- I'm optimistic. I believe we have to do this. I think to scrap NAFTA altogether would be a serious mistake. BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. And that's why -- is it even realistic to think we could have something on the table this upcoming week? I mean, this is the soft deadline he put in place. MCCAUL: No -- he's been you know, he's been dealing with this right now. He's -- I think they are getting close. BARTIROMO: OK. MCCAUL: And I know Congress will take a look at it. We've been urging them again not to kill it but make it better and modernize it. BARTIROMO: Right. Sure. And of course, Texas is right there with the Mexico trade. Let me your thoughts on what took place this morning overnight in Paris, another terrorist attack. Obviously poorest borders there. What's your take on this and how do you stop something like that in America? MCCAUL: They're in a far worse position than the United States. They have so many foreign fighters from the battlefield in Europe. They have neighborhoods in Paris before the Brussels attack. We warned them about these enclaves of radicalized Muslims but they can't do anything about it. I would argues United States is very different. I bet with the NYPD pretty much all weekend talking about this. Sheikh Adnani, the ISIS spokesman says kill wherever you are by any means necessary. And this is what their relegated too, this knife attacks and vehicle assaults. They've been a bit demoralized since the cause of the caliphate, the aviation sector is still a concern mine. But this particular attack, you get to see more and more of this. You'll probably see this in the United States, but it's not below the lines of a 9/11 style attack. BARTIROMO: It's pretty incredible how vulnerable Paris has been, really. Mr. Chairman, it's always a pleasure to see you. MCCAUL: Thanks, Maria. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Chairman Michael McCaul joining us there. Up next, former Vice President Dick Cheney sits down for an exclusive interview with me. What he had to say on a wide range of issues including our biggest foreign policy threat and what America's should be on the Middle East. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, let us know what you'd like to hear from the rest of the program as we continue right here on 'Sunday Morning Futures.' Back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. This week on \"Mornings with Maria\" on the Fox Business Network, I had an exclusive sit down interview with former Vice President Dick Cheney. We talked about a wide range of issues on the domestic and international front. And I begin by asking the Vice President what the number one foreign policy concern is today for the United States. Watch his answer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES: I think the Chinese long-term are the most serious and have the most capability and made some phenomenal gains economically which they're now converting to better military capability and so forth. The Russians are still governed by Putin, makes a big difference whether Gorbachev is in town on Putin. Putin obviously is I think looking for opportunities to create more problems in Eastern Europe. He's currently acting now in the Middle East. BARTIROMO: And you've studied the Middle East more so and watched the developments more closely than most people. Is Iran the most significant perpetrator because even when I was speaking with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, he said it's Iran who is trying to overtake the Middle East. What is the right move to pull out of the Iran deal? CHENEY: Well, I think the Iranians have moved to that posture. Part of it I can remember the debate in Saudi Arabia back during Desert Storm and that period dealing with the senior Saudi leaders, they were very concern about Iran. There was partly a religious proposition between the Shias in Iran and the Sunni in Saudi Arabia. And I actually had the King of Saudi Arabia at one point tell me that he was absolutely convinced the Iranians had their eye on coming to Saudi Arabia and taking control of the two holy mosques. It was a big, huge deal in that part of the world and with respect to the Sunni and Shia. They have been troublesome but now when they clearly are actively involved in Syria with Russians, when they're trying to promote and finance the spread of nuclear technology from South Korea to Syria -- BARTIROMO: But you're comfortable what has taken place coming out of this deal? CHENEY: I think that I fundamentally opposed it when it was entered into. I didn't like all that crash that was going to back to Iran. And I really felt based in part on my relationships with go back many, many years with the Saudi's and the Emirates and the Egyptians, that the United States is turning its back on our traditional friends and choosing that of the Iranians and that's not a course of action we could sustain overtime. BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. And when I interviewed MBS, the Crown Prince, he told me last November, look, the hijackers of 9/11 were trained by Iran. And he was trying to say we want to live like normal people. We want a relationship with the United States. Do you believe in this corruption crackdown that is taking place in Saudi Arabia? CHENEY: I do. When he was in Washington recently, I had dinner with him. I sat right next to the Crown Price. BARTIROMO: I saw the picture. CHENEY: On my left was Bandar, an old friend when he was the Ambassador from Saudi Arabia. He worked very closely with the Desert Storm and so on. It's a great to spend time with both of them. And one of the things that's struck me about it, we were talking about the reforms the Crown Prince was pursuing and the way he's I think asserted himself trying to make some fundamental changes in which I wholeheartedly endorsed. BARTIROMO: A lot of people saying if were to pull out of Syria, then that just strengthen ISIS, that much more. It creates a vacuum that we saw created in Iraq. CHENEY: I am a firm believer and it's not a popular position to take, everybody thinks we've been there everybody thinks we've been there 17 years we need to get out kind of thing. That's not the way I look at it. I think we have to be president in that part of the world. You look at 9/11, 9/11 coming on well. You had Osama bin Laden operating in that part of the world ultimately putting his team together in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is important to us who controls Afghanistan. It's important to us how those other nations fall out there and we can't afford to turn our back and walk away and say well it's a nasty business we're not going to be involved anymore. I think that's a dead end for us and I think we cannot afford given the importance of the United States the importance of that part of the world. We have to be engaged, we have to be involved. We have to know who our friends and allies are (END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: Much more of my exclusive interview with former vice president Dick Cheney. Next up he gives us his take on Gina Haspel, the Nominee for CIA Director and waterboarding. Just as another Democratic Senator announces his support for Haspel. We're looking ahead right now on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES. Back in one minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now to the nomination of the first woman to head the CIA Gina Haspel faced some pretty tough questioning last -- this last week during her confirmation hearings but now a second Democrat breaking ranks and saying that he will support Haspel. Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly joining West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin in backing the nominee which means she will likely get confirmed. In my exclusive interview with Dick Cheney, I asked the former vice president about his opinion on Haspel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHENEY: I think she'd be a great CIA Director. I don't know her personally. I hear good things about her and the people at the agency and I think she's done a great job in terms of the career she's built and people I know at the agency are very enthusiastic about having one of their own so to speak in the in the driver's seat at CIA. Aside from that, she's got a distinguished career in the clandestine service. She's done difficult jobs and done them very well. I think the Democrats are trying to find some way to vote against her but it's hard. And in the end, I think she'll be confirmed. BARTIROMO: We've had 17 years now to digest what took place after 9/11 and of course much has been made about the torture programs and the interrogation programs. You've been vocal about this that at the time this was the right thing to do, correct? CHENEY: Yes. I've been very vocal about it I believed in it. I was heavily involved in getting it set up and getting the opinion out of the Justice Department on how far we could go. I'm not one of those people who calls it torture and awful lot of people do but it wasn't. It was set up in a way that what we did was, in fact, consistent with our fundamental statutes and agreements that were in place and it worked. We were able -- waterboarding was applied actually to only three individuals. One of those was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind of 9/11 and later on the agency produced a study and the title of it, I think the study itself is still classified but the title was KSM Khalid Sheikh Mohammed preeminent source on Al Qaeda. He's the guy who got waterboarded more than anybody else. I think what we did to help ultimately produce the intelligence we needed to be able to get bin Laden and so I supported it wholeheartedly. I still do to this day prepared to defend it and debate it and argue it. This was a period of time when we had been attacked, lost 3,000 people. We lost more people on 9/11 than we lost at Pearl Harbor. BARTIROMO: Is it the right move to discontinue those programs today? CHENEY: If it were my call, I would not discontinue those programs. I'd have them active and ready to go and I'd go back and study them and learn. The agencies in a difficult position, the Congress has acted, they have changed the law and the agency has to and will operate by that statute. But you know there are a lot of Monday morning quarterbacks in the terrorism business and people who they really had to make the decision if it was their call if you know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the mastermind behind all of this, if you know he is number two to bin Laden in terms of the attack, if you know he's probably the guy who knows more than anybody else except bin Laden, what's next? What's their next target? How many people are they going to kill and how are they going to do it? And then you tell me that the only a method we have is please, please, pretty please tell us what you know. Well, I don't buy that and I think the techniques were used were not tortured. It's -- a lot of people try to call it that but it wasn't deemed torture at the time. The techniques we use are techniques we used on our own people in training. We didn't go out and make them up some place. The president signed off, I signed off and after Security Council signed off, they did a good job. They got the intelligence they needed and we were safe from any further mass casualty attacks on the seven and a half years on our watch. So now people might have go back and try to rewrite history but if it were my call, I'd do it again. BARTIROMO: Scooter Libby, of course, was pardoned, your reaction. CHENEY: Scooter was my chief of staff and worked for me in the Pentagon as well as at the White House, a great guy, fantastic attorney, just all- around prince. He was charged under phony circumstances by a special prosecutor who was brought in by James Comey and charged with having leaked the identity of a CIA employee and the fact of the matter was he didn't. That in fact, Rich Armitage at State was the leaker of the identity of Valerie Plame. And Valerie Plame was not covered by the statute that made it unlawful to reveal the name of the CIA employee. And that was the situation. Then the special prosecutor wasn't willing to stand up and say there's no crime here. They went to work trying to drum up charge finally brought charges against Scooter. Ultimately they went to Scooter's attorneys and told them that if Scooter would testify against me, they'd drop all charges against Scooter. Was that bad a deal? BARTIROMO: That's incredible. CHENEY: In the end, Scooter was convicted unlawfully so. A total trumped up charge. He's now been pardoned by President Bush community sentence and President Trump now has pardoned him. He was a totally innocent man and I want to thank the President for having done that. It's a good move and a lot of us who from over the case who know on love Scooter Libby really appreciate the fact that he's now been deemed innocent and that's what should have happened. It was all a phony deal from the very beginning. (END VIDEOTAPE) BARTIROMO: My thanks to Vice President Dick Cheney. Could there be a possible truce between the Justice Department and House Intel Chairman Devin Nunez over requested documents in the Robert Muller investigation? We're talking about that next. Plus, why one Senator is calling out Jim Comey over comments former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn made to the FBI? Congressman Darrell Issa sits on the House Oversight Committee, he joins me next as we look ahead on 'Sunday Morning Futures' back in a moment (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New developments this morning in a request by Republicans for classified information about Special Counsel Robert Muller's Russia investigation. In a joint statement, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunez and House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy said that they had a productive discussion with Senior Justice FBI and intelligence officials last week following the subpoena that was issued by Nunez for documents that would reportedly reveal a top-secret intelligence source for the investigation. The two Congressmen also say that they plan to hold further discussions this week. I want to bring in California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa right now, former Chairman and now Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He also sits on both the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committee. Sir, it's good to see you, Congressman. Thanks so much for joining us. REP. DARRELL ISSA, R\u2014CALIF., HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE: Good to see you Maria and -- BARTIROMO: Where -- yes -- ISSA: Go ahead. BARTIROMO: Please. ISSA: I was just saying that you know I've been in their shoes of having to sit at the table and have those good meetings with justice and then trying to turn it into actual production of documents. BARTIROMO: And it's not so. It's easier said than done I think is your point there right? ISSA: Well, I once sat in the Capitol with Eric Holder as he told me there were only 200 and some documents and he would give us those documents in an unprecedented way if we would agree that that would end the investigation of Fast and Furious, tens of thousands of additional documents, some of them showing his actual interference with the discovery process and we're still not done with all of it so it is very, very, very much a tradition at Department of Justice to come in, tell Congress what they need to hear, lie to them if necessary and then hope they don't get caught on their watch. Well maybe, but there was an op-ed in the journal on Friday maybe you saw it about the history of the FBI and the DOJ and that when for example Louis Freeh was running the FBI, Congress was respected. And when Congress came in and said we need these documents, we want this in terms of our oversight, it was delivered. But here you have a lot of stonewalling going on. I don't think that's even a question anymore. You know, these chairmen that we're talking about Goodlatte, Gowdy, and Nunez, have asked for specific documents a year ago, 1.2 million documents to be exact and what number are we up to? I mean, there was $3,000. ISSA: 9,000. BARTIROMO: Now we're at 9,000 according to you and Jim Jordan. So -- ISSA: And the best ones come last. BARTIROMO: Well, that's another thing because so much of this is rejected and oftentimes when we unredacted the redactions we see well it wasn't actually national security at all. It was something that would have been an embarrassment to the FBI. So it's hard to trust that this is actually going forward in an honest way. Do you think you are getting honest answers from the FBI and the DOJ? ISSA: No I don't. I believe they're lying through their teeth. Look, if you want to tell the truth, you -- what you do is the same thing you do in front of a federal judge which by the way is another branch just as Congress is and you allow a full in camera review. You know I'm not there at the negotiating table. This is now Trey Gowdy's watch, but when I was there, we would most often say if you say it's too voluminous and you say it's going to take too long, great. We'll sit side by side with your people, we'll search, we'll look and then we'll narrow down things we don't need. But to do that we need to see them completely unredacted. If they want to get to the truth that's what they do is they make all the documents available unredacted, give our investigators who have clearances the opportunity to sift through but this is exactly what they didn't do in Fast and Furious. They didn't do it in the Benghazi. They didn't do it in the IRS and it took I.G.'s and subpoenas and FOIA and judges and we still don't have the whole truth in each of those cases particularly Benghazi and Fast and Furious. BARTIROMO: And now with the the investigation around the FBI's handling of the 2016 election, we're circling around this so-called FBI source. Kim Strassel at the Journal wrote about this last week and she asks did the bureau engage in outright spying against the 2016 Trump campaign in her op-ed. You look at the Washington Post and they know all sorts of things about this FBI source that the FBI says we can't reveal. Well, how come the Washington Post knows all the details then? They're leaking it when it works for them but not when it doesn't. ISSA: Well, this is this is -- this is very common in Washington, is each side has a tendency to not hold material the way they should when they need material to prove their point and the administration under -- particularly under President Obama did that regularly. They gave half stories, sometimes even giving it to Elijah Cummings and the Democrats before we even saw it on our subpoena. But Maria, I think the important thing is it is very clear that we are being asked to trust the Department of Justice who we know did, in fact, use a law that allows them to spy but lied to get the warrant, lied to a federal judge under the FISA Act. So this is one of the challenges. Make no bones about it. A FISA warrant is, in fact, a license to spy. Now the question is did you lie, cheat or steal in order to do that? And very clearly with the information presented, you know behind closed doors to the federal judge, the fact is they did mislead the judge, get a warrant multiple you know, ability to spy and now we're asked to believe that you can trust the very people not the management for a moment, but the very people who know this and are covering it up. Most of those people haven't retired, some of them knew about it when they broke the law or misled a federal judge and they don't want us to know it. And it's not about Republican or Democrat, it's about the fact we have another election coming up, why in the world would we think it's not happening again? BARTIROMO: Right. And not only that, but we also know that they redid that FISA warrant three additional time. So four times they got the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign and they used it, and they got the FISA warrant by this dossier by saying that this dossier was actually some kind of important piece of work and it was all unverified. Rod Rosenstein signed off on the fourth time when they wanted that next FISA warrant and now Devin Nunez is saying, well, he's conflicted he should be nowhere near any of this since he signed off on the warrant. Do you agree with that? ISSA: Well, exactly. This is where the Attorney General in an abundance of caution recused himself and now the very man he gave responsibilities who won't do the same thing when it's obvious that he has a conflict. You know, to be honest, the Deputy needs to recuse himself. We need to have a level of transparency. Probably not one person but multiple people who in fact oversee this to make sure that the American people get what they deserve. Let's remember the FBI has tremendous power and the Department of Justice hand-in-hand with them and whether it was the left or the right when they were going after Martin Luther King and bugging him and trying to get dirt on him or even all the way back with Goldwater, the FBI doesn't have clean hands, the Department of Justice as their partners don't have clean hands, and so we as the oversight if you will of that branch cannot and should not trust them. We should demand the transparency that we're entitled to and we need to be in front of a federal judge so that we have two against one because it's clear we're not getting where we need to go fast enough. And you know these chairmen are doing their job, Goodlatte, Nunez, and Gowdy but the reality is they're being slow-walked until after the election in the hopes that the Democrats will take over the House or the Senate and then the investigations will be covered up. No question in my mind that this would be something that would just go away if we lose the gavel. BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right and I think the American people are on to this at this point. We've got a forthcoming I.G. report out. We are expecting Michael Horowitz, the Inspector General to come out with his report this month. What are you expecting there and if we were to see criminal charges recommended the way we saw that for Andrew McCabe, the number-two guy at the FBI, will we see actual accountability here? Are we going to see justice, sir? ISSA: Well, I think you'll see justice. I want to lower everyone's expectations that look, Michael Horowitz, is a careful person, he's not going to ask for anything more than what he can fully prove and substantiate. So there won't be -- the best case, what there will be is someone who methodically goes through and takes on his bosses. You know, under Eric Holder, he testified before Congress about the way they were, in fact, covering up sexual harassment and other misconduct by Department of Justice lawyers in the name of it was off-limits. He came, he said it, he did not get what he wanted, but he's always been open and transparent with the Congress when it comes to doing his job and so he is probably the I.G.'s I.G. And if you were going to pick somebody that you weren't going to get the left or the right happy but you were going to get the truth, it's going to be Michael Horowitz. BARTIROMO: All right, well, we'll we for that I.G. report out in the next couple of weeks. Anybody one either side of the aisle, Congressman, should be upset by oversight getting blown off. Let's face it. You're trying to get to the truth. Congressman, it's good to see you, sir. Thanks so much. ISSA: See you again, Maria. Thank you so much for joining us, Darryl Issa there. President Trump accusing Iran of entering the nuclear agreement under false pretense and violent clashes intensify along the Israeli-Gaza border ahead of tomorrow's opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Big day tomorrow, we'll talk with Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon coming up next about both topics. We're looking ahead on 'Sunday Morning Futures' right now (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump speaking out on the Iran Nuclear Deal this weekend calling attention to Tehran's military budget as evidence that it never planned to abide by the 2015 accord because the military budget is up 40 percent. Joining me right now is the Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the U.N. It's great to see you, Ambassador. Thanks so much for joining us. DANNY DANON, ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Thank you for having me. BARTIROMO: First off, your reaction to the President pulling out of the Iran Deal. DANON: Bold decision. Another bold, if you know the President. That was the right thing to do. It was a bad agreement for the beginning. We said it years ago. And let me tell you a few examples about why it is a bad agreement. You cannot inspect the facilities. You have to let them know in advance if you want to come to inspect the military facilities. It's a joke. They continue with a ballistic missile program. Prime Minister Netanyahu exposed documents that we found in Tehran and we showed it to the world that they're continuing with their ballistic missile program. Third, is the issue of the expiration date. What will happen in five, six, seven years and the most important the President has talk about it is the funding. Today they have a lot of funding and they put into their military and sponsoring their proxies in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen. They're using that money that they're getting from the Europeans to sponsor terrorism all over the world. BARTIROMO: And let's not forget, ever since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when hardliners came to power those leaders in Iran have called for Israel's elimination. DANON: Even in the U.S. BARTIROMO: And this weekend they were chanting death to America, death to Israel. Nothing changed. We have a small Satan, and then you see the Great Satan and they're calling for our destruction. Can you imagine if they will have a nuclear capability? What they will say then? What they will do then? We should take it very seriously especially when we see them building their presence in Syria next to our border, they're bringing weapons, funds, and militants. They are paying Afghans, Pakistanis to come to fight in Syria against Israel. That's why we are very worried. That why Prime Minister Netanyahu said we have a red line. We will not allow them to build up their forces next to our border. BARTIROMO: Are things getting even more dangerous right now between Iran and Israel? DANON: Because they are using their proxies, it's not a direct conflict. They're using their proxies in Lebanon which (INAUDIBLE) in Syria with the militants. That's what they are doing for us it is a challenge not to allow them to take over Syria. Look what happened to Lebanon. Today, thousand Lebanon died of the control of the Iranian regime. We cannot allow Syria to be the same. BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, you've got the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia actually saying we want peace. We want to live the way we used to live before 1979. Are you seeing a new relationship between the Saudis and the Israelis? DANON: Yes. I speak with many Arab ambassadors here at New York in the U.N. and they also welcome the bold decision of President Trump because we know Iran is a threat not to Israel it is a threat to the Middle East, is a threat to the world. BARTIROMO: Yes. New friendships, that's for sure. It's quite extraordinary. Another bold move, the embassy is now moving to Jerusalem tomorrow will be the big move and of course a ceremony around it. How important was this for you? DANON: That is a historic moment. We need to celebrate it and we intend to celebrate it. We are grateful for President Trump for finally, many presidents promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem. He's delivering, he's doing it and we will celebrate it. We will -- we'll do it tomorrow with a Jared and Ivanka Kushner with Secretary Mnuchin. For us, it's a great moment because many other countries will follow the U.S. The President of Guatemala will come this week to open his embassy. The president of Paraguay will follow him. We will see more countries moving their embassies to Jerusalem which has been our capital for 3,000 years from the date of King David. We are very proud of that moment. BARTIROMO: Are you expecting any retaliation from the skeptics here, the Iranians for example? DANON: Well, we expect the Palestinians there to demonstrate. They're already getting ready to do that. I hope they will not send their kids to the fence to use them as human shields. We want to have a peaceful ceremony to celebrate it but we're getting ready for scenarios. BARTIROMO: All right, we will be there watching. Congratulations. It's good to see you, Ambassador. DANON: Thank you very much, Maria. Thank you. BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Ambassador Danny Danon, joining us there. A second Democratic Senator, one who is also facing re-election in the state President Trump overwhelmingly won now comes on board to support Gina Haspel as the CIA director. Will others follow suit? Our panel is on deck next as we look ahead on 'Sunday Morning Futures' back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BARTIROMO: As you heard earlier in the program, former Vice President Dick Cheney in that exclusive interview told me his thoughts about the CIA director nominee Gina Haspel. Meanwhile, we're learning that a second Democrat Senator Joe Donnelly from Indiana will now support her nomination. Let's bring in the panel on that note. Ed Rollins is former Campaign Manager for Reagan-Bush '84 and Fox News Contributor. Lee Carter is the President and Partner at Maslansky Partners and it is good to see you both. Thank you so much for joining us. Does she get confirmed, Ed? ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I think she does. I think -- I think it depends breaking the tie. I mean, it'll be -- I think these two Democrats have come out are both trying to be Republicans because obviously they're challenged races and I think you may get one more and if not even if you don't, I think the Republicans at old and I think you get in there. BARTIROMO: I was reading something earlier that all of this slow walking, Lee, it takes on average 84 days for any of the President's nominees to get confirmed. They are slow-walking this. What does this mean going into the midterm elections? Where do you stand now on November? LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY PARTNERS: Well, I think that all of us talk about a blue wave with much ado about nothing because we're watching the poll numbers shrink. It was 16 points, the Democrat advantaged two months ago, six last month and only three today. And so you're looking at a very, very different landscape. I think this message have resist at all costs is one that has not worked and we're starting to see Democrats right now really start shift more to the middle. We've got in Indiana, the Democrat is talking about how he's voted with the President 62 percent of the time. We've got people who are now supporting the President's initiatives. We've got two Democrats now coming forward saying I'm going to support -- I'm going to support the CIA director and I think that this is a really important moment. And if the Democrats start to realize that they've got to move to the middle, that they've got to start focusing on the issues that matter most to the American people, then maybe they'll have a shot. But if they don't, I think the Republicans could still hold tight even though there are some reasons to be concerned. BARTIROMO: I think so too, because look the president, Ed, is making some bold decisions and it's hard to resist when you've got the Embassy in Jerusalem, Iran deal he pulled out, in North Korea he's about to meet, first president to meet with the head of North Korea, and then there's the economic issues, economic growth. Atlanta feds talking about -- ROLLINS: I think the President has done a superb job of doing the things he said he would do. Promises, made promises kept. The dilemma we face is we have 40 Republicans who aren't running for re-election in the House. It's the largest number since 1930. So that basically puts a lot of seats in play that normally wouldn't be. We have about 65 seats that will be competitive out of the 435. 58, 59 of those are ours so we've got to win everywhere and we can win everywhere. The president's approval numbers are 45 percent now which what Reagan's were and what Obama's were. The critical thing here is the Senate and these two Democrats who obviously are the voting for these candidates because they're challenged, you don't want them to become too Republican. We have to win those two seats, plus a couple of more. We have about five seats in the Senate that are really in play. BARTIROMO: Meanwhile Nancy Pelosi is out saying look, if the Democrats win the House, we will raise your taxes. ROLLINS: Well, the -- BARTIROMO: She's actually saying that. ROLLINS: There's not any Democrats running around saying that behind her though and I think the reality, she's in a very safe district and I think every Republican needs to make that the case. And the most telling thing is so far to date 71,000 of the commercials have been run -- have been positive. Trump, 28,000 of negative Trump. So the reality is it's not anti-Trump. BARTIROMO: All right, great to see you both. CARTER: Great to be with you. BARTIROMO: Ed Rogers -- listen to me, Ed Rollins and Lee Carter, good to see you. Thank you so much I'll see you tomorrow at Fox Business Network, 6:00 a.m. on FBN. Have a good Sunday. Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "What happened to the Democratic Party since 2006? In a word, politics. Voters continue to support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, although support has declined since February.\u00a0 And while majorities remain concerned about certain issues linked with illegal immigration, voters are becoming increasingly less worried about them, according to the latest Fox News Poll. The top concern voters have regarding illegal immigration is the possible drain on Uncle Sam:\u00a0 69 percent are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned it will overburden government programs.\u00a0 That\u2019s down from 79 percent in July 2015 and a high of 87 percent in April 2006.\u00a0 Other concerns include the possibility illegal immigration will lead to increases in crime (59 percent) and terrorism (55 percent), and take jobs away from citizens (50 percent), but each of those problems saw double-digit decreases since 2015 as well. \u201cChanging the culture of the country\u201d was the least of voters\u2019 worries with 47 percent \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned, relatively unchanged from 46 percent in 2015. READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS. In addition, almost six-in-ten voters (58 percent) favor allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the country and eventually qualifying for citizenship (32 percent oppose).\u00a0 While that\u2019s down from a record 65 percent who felt that way in February, it\u2019s still a significant change from the split recorded in October 2014 (46 percent favor vs. 44 percent oppose). The biggest changes in support since February come from black voters (-14), Southerners (-12), and Democrats (-10). President Trump\u2019s approval rating on immigration remains in negative territory (39 percent approve vs. 57 percent disapprove).\u00a0 That matches his record low, recorded in September 2017.\u00a0 Last month, it was 43-55 percent. Trump does better on handling of border security: 44 percent approve, while 51 percent disapprove. 2018 Midterms Immigration is an important issue for voters in the 2018 elections, but not the most important issue.\u00a0 While 47 percent say immigration is \u201cextremely\u201d important to their vote, it trails health care (56 percent extremely important), which party controls the House (54 percent), the economy (53 percent), and President Trump (48 percent). And when asked to pick the \u201cmost\u201d important issue to their vote, just 10 percent say immigration.\u00a0 The economy (18 percent), health care (18 percent), which party controls the house (14 percent), and President Trump (13 percent) rank higher. Border security comes in last place on both measures: 42 percent say it\u2019s \u201cextremely\u201d important to their vote and just 5 percent say it will be the \u201cmost\u201d important when casting their vote this November. Voters who prioritize immigration are more likely to back the Republican candidate in their congressional district this fall by 22 points, while health care voters prefer the Democratic candidate by 42. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,009 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from August 19-21, 2018.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Insight from Kevin McCullough, radio talk show host for Salem Media, and Doug Schoen, former pollster for former President Bill Clinton. A sprawling, compromise GOP immigration bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants while directing $25 billion for the construction of President Trump\u2019s border wall failed in the House on Wednesday, despite encouragement from the president for Republicans to support it. The bill was overwhelmingly rejected 301-121, in part because some Republicans are reluctant to vote for any bill they worry could be portrayed as \u201camnesty.\u201d More than 100 Republicans voted against the legislation. Earlier Wednesday, the president called for Republicans to pass the \u201cstrong but fair immigration bill,\u201d saying that \u201cpassage will show that we want strong borders & security while the Dems want open borders.\u201d PROPOSED DACA PATHWAY COMPLICATES BORDER WALL FUNDING After months of trying to bridge the chasm between moderates and conservatives and two postponed votes, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., labeled the legislation \"a great consensus bill\" and tried putting the best face on the likely outcome. House majority whip speaks out on the political divide over the legislation. \"What we have here is the seeds of consensus that will be gotten to, hopefully now but if not, later,\" he told reporters Tuesday. But on Friday, Trump initially suggested he was giving up trying to get a bill approved before the election, saying\u00a0a \"red wave\" is needed to pass an immigration bill in Congress. \u201cRepublicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\u201d Wednesday's vote caps months of futile GOP efforts to pass wide-ranging legislation on an issue that could color scores of congressional races in this fall's contest for House and perhaps Senate control. The Senate rejected three proposals in February, including one reflecting Trump's hardline policies and two bipartisan plans. The Republican compromise voted on Wednesday would have provided a shot at citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children. It would provide $25 billion for Trump to build his coveted wall with Mexico, restrict family-based immigration and bar the Homeland Security Department from taking migrant children from parents seized crossing into the country without authorization. Leaders had been adding eleventh-hour provisions aimed at winning votes. One would make it easier for migrant farmworkers to stay longer in the country, the other would gradually require companies to use an electronic database to verify their employees' U.S. citizenship. But those amendments didn't remove the key stumbling block -- the reluctance by conservatives to back legislation helping people who arrived illegally become citizens. Many Republicans deride that plan as amnesty for lawbreakers, a potential attack line their next primary challenger could wield against them.

            "article_content": "Group of thousands of migrants from Central America on journey to U.S. ahead of midterm elections. President Trump tweeted on Sunday that border security officials continued their \"full efforts ... to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens\" attempting to travel to the U.S. southern border via a large migrant caravan \u2014\u00a0while also describing such caravans as \"a disgrace to the Democrat Party.\" \"People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away,\" Trump tweeted. \"The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!\" The caravan of Central American migrants has anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people \u2014 mainly from Honduras \u2014 according to estimates. In a follow-up tweet, Trump stated: \"The Caravans are a disgrace to the Democrat Party. Change the immigration laws NOW!\" At his campaign rally in Montana Thursday night, Trump told the crowd the upcoming midterm elections will be \"an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense. ... Remember, it's gonna be an election of the caravan.\" The president, without elaborating further, blamed the Democrats for the caravan on Twitter last week, blaming them for \"weak laws.\" U.S. and Mexican officials agreed upon a plan to handle the approaching caravan, a senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday. The plan includes Mexico requesting that the United Nations\u00a0High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) establish shelters along its southern border with Central America, the official said. UNHCR spokesman Chris McGrath confirmed Saturday the agency has \u201cdeployed teams to the Mexican border with Guatemala where they are working closely with Mexican officials . . . so all individuals can be processed and provided with essential services, including access to health services, food and shelter.\u201d MIGRANT CARAVAN GRABS FOR AMERICAN DREAM, AS IMMIGRANTS FORGE UNIQUE CHALLENGE FOR US, MEXICO Mexico is currently processing the caravan in small groups, and said some 640 asylum claims have been processed since Friday. The country deployed some 700 federal police to the border\u00a0and has said it will police the border against rogue caravan members who try to cross illegally. Jonathan Wachtel, former Director of Communications and spokesperson at the United States Mission to the United Nations joins Fox Report to discuss the migrant caravan en route to the U.S. The asylum process can take from 45 to 90 days. Those who are approved will be eligible for relocation in a third country, potentially Mexico or the United States, but there are no guarantees. During the lengthy asylum process, applicants are supposed to remain near an immigration station and sign in each week. Once granted, they can move freely in Mexico. Last year, roughly 9,000 Central Americans received asylum in Mexico but the system is severely backlogged. If their asylum claim is denied, Mexico says they will be deported.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" June 18, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right, got it. Good evening from LA, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\"0 We're just over 100 miles from the border where a crisis is raging and tonight we're going to bring you the inside story on the red hot topic that everybody's talking about. Most people are getting it wrong, of course. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is here exclusively to respond to the controversy surrounding illegal immigrant kids, separated from their parents. Plus Ben Shapiro tell us how Democrats are really the ones exploiting the children as political pawns in this battle over immigration. Also Senators grill the inspector general for what some are saying, white washing rampant bias at the top of the FBI, against the president. And why would the Washington Post, by the way, run a story that blows up the Russian collusion narrative? Roger Stone tells us why. But first faux liberal outrage in the destruction of the rule of law, that's the focus of tonight's angle. Every country has an obligation to protect its borders and its citizens, particularly one as expansive and as generous as the United States. Now for too long, immigration law was ignored, frankly, and basically unenforced. Obama tried to enforce it in an adhoc fashion, but its policies, which we are going to get to in a moment, only ended up exacerbating our problems at the border. So today we have a full on crisis, 160 percent increase in the number of people illegally entering the United States from just last year. Well the President is responding with a zero tolerance message which he reiterated today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The United States will not be a migrant camp. And it will not be a refugee holding facility, it won't be. You look at what's happening in Europe, you look at what's happening in other places, we can't allow that to happen to the United States, not on my watch. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now the President is now doing what we should have been doing all along, prosecuting all border crashers. So if you enter the country illegally, you're breaking the law. The United States is not a repatriation center where any indigent person in the world feels free to just walk in and assume that all of us will take care of all of them and their families. There's a process and it has to be respected. Homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen said this today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: We are a compassionate country that has taken in millions of refugees. Since 1975, the United States has welcomed in more than three million refugees from all over the world, and each year, typically admit nearly two thirds of the world's settled refugees. That is more than all other countries combined. We will not apologize for the job we do or the job law enforcement does for doing the job that the American people expect us to do. Illegal actions have and must have consequences. No more free passes, no more get out of jail free cards. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well consistent with American law, when a party is arrested, your children are either sent to relatives or they become wards of the state. So since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border, more kids are being separated from their parents and temporarily housed in what are essentially summer camps or as the San Diego Union Tribune described them today, is looking like, basically, boarding schools. Having lost the argument and frankly, the last election, Liberals have seized on the separated children and turned the entire image into a political weapon, attempting to emotionally manipulate he public perception of immigration enforcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: I've read that you said the separation, in your words, is nothing less than government sanctioned child abuse. Do you really think that this amounts to child abuse? DR COLLEEN KRAFT, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS: This does amount to child abuse. GAIL KING, CBS ANCHOR: And all I can say after talking with the people, watching the people, listening to the people is the statue of liberty is weeping right now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have effectively orphaned thousands of children, taking them from their parents. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: I'm heartbroken by what's happening and I wonder what this means for the fabric of our country. (END VIDEO CLIPS) INGRAHAM: Now why are all their hearts breaking in unison now? Why no tears for the victims of illegal immigrant crimes? Like the 14 year old girl raped by Anastacio Eugenio Lopez Fabian, just last month? Or did their heart break when another 14 year old was left to die at the scene of a hit and run by Miguel Ibarra Cerda, a 21 year old Mexican national? My friends, here's what you're not haring. The government has very good reasons for separating children from their family unit. The first being they may not be the child's family at all. Children have been kidnapped, trafficked and used by individuals who can then more easily slip into the country. The Obama administration's catch and release policy allowed people with children to enter the United States with only a promise to show up for a later hearing. A lot of them didn't show up of course. The human traffickers and the drug cartels quickly seized on the weakness and exploited it, routinely trafficking people across the border using children, at times, as camouflage. Then when Obama announced his DACA policy in 2012, it became yet another lure for illegal immigrants. \u2018The number of unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, surged between 2012 and 2014 by, check this out, by more than 400 percent'. The number of unaccompanied children referred to the office of refugee resettlement tripled between 2012 and 2017 from 13,625 to 40,810 according to the government's statistics. From these immigrants come fresh recruits for MS13 and other gangs that terrorize Americans cities from Maryland to California. We've talked to the officials who told us the stories. And in June of 2014, even the Washington Post had to admit that the unaccompanied minor surge was \u2018Driven in large Part by the perception that they will be allowed to stay under the Obama administration's immigration policies'. Astoundingly, in the fiscal year 2104, the border patrol apprehended 68,445 \u2018family units'. Few, of course, were deported. Now you throw in Sanctuary Cities, a lax amnesty program, and it's a wonder more illegals haven't come. So the Trump administration in now trying to pick up the pieces of this lawless immigration system after decades of governmental neglect. They are also trying to respectfully protect children in the government's care. Here are the circumstances where they temporarily take custody of children. Number one. When DHS is unable to verify the relationship between the adult and the child. Number two, when DHS determines that a child may be at risk with the parent or the legal guardian. And three, when the parent or legal guardian is referred for criminal prosecution. Now, you enter into a normal port of entry rather than coming across the border illegally and the chances are you're not going to be separated from your families. But most of these people are coming straight across the border as illegal immigrants and claiming some type of status or asylum request. And this all goes back to a 1997 court ruling we've talked about before on the show called the Flora Settlement which forbade the government from holding unaccompanied children for more than 20 days, did also those travelling with family units. So unless you have a hearing within 20 days, they have to be released into the country. Okay unless you've been swayed by the media reports that children are housed in concentration camps or cages, the truth is the US tax payer is paying a lot on the care of these children, nearly $35,000 per year, per child. They actually have a higher standard of living than the 13 million American children today, currently living below the poverty line, which is about $24,000 per household. And as for the conditions of the facilities that the immigrants children are house in? They live a lot better than some inner city kids, or say 11,472 homeless veterans living here in California. (BEHIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC HOST: Anything we've seen the government has provided, this doesn't feel like we're in the United States. JACOB SOBOROFF, MSNBC HOST: Department of Health and Human Services invited us inside because I think they wanted to show us, relatively speaking, how good the conditions are, I guess you could say. I mean there are licensed professionals in there that are taking care of the children. There are not cages, there are not fences. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: It's just ridiculous, I mean the bottom line is these kids should be united with their parents, reunited with their parents, back in their home countries. They should not be burdens to the United States tax payer or thrown into a system of foster care with parents who think coming across the border with children will just assure them eventual legalized status. The President wants the separation to end as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNY GENERAL: President Trump has said this lawlessness cannot continue. We do not want to separate parents from their children, you can be sure of that. If we build a law, we pass some legislation, we close some loopholes, we will face these terrible choices. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And rather than trying to score political points, Democrats and Republicans, like Sessions is indicating, should come together. They should do what's best for the country, for the American citizen and the American workers and these immigrant children. The law should be changed so that the border control can turn away individuals and family units at the border, if necessary. Today, only Mexicans who cross the border illegally can be turned back, that's absurd. Our border patrol doesn't exist as a wave in facilitator for any group of supposed family members who mouth the script given to them by lawyers, non- governmental institutions or other people in their home countries, that they mouth for asylum. The American people are footing a really big bill for what is tantamount to a slow rolling invasion of the United States. And we can no longer permit Central American countries to export their poverty and their desperation to our nation. Our own children black, white, Asian and Latino, need help too. In Detroit, here in LA, in Hartford, in Miami and in Chicago. So why don't the Bushes and the Obamas and all these left wing reporters emoting today at the White House and all these pro-amnesty Democrats and Republicans, why don't they ever write op-eds or cry for those kids? You know why? Because they think this over-the-top coverage in a misrepresentation of what's going on will hurt the man that they could not beat in November 2016, Donald Trump. And that's the Angle. Joining us now for reaction is Art Del Cuerto, President of Border Patrol Unit in Tuscan and radio show host here with me in the studio in LA, Ethan Bearman. All right Ethan, you heard what I just said, throw it at me, where did I get it wrong? ETHAN BEARMAN, KGO RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Well I would say this, there are a lot of different issues that you addressed there. First of with the overarching issue that we've never addressed in immigration overall and how we deal with people who are in this country. But most importantly we got to get to the root issue that we're talking about today which is separating children from their families. Yes, the President does have the power right this very minute with a five-minute phone call to say stop doing this. Let's keep them together until we resolve the asylum issue, the immigration issue-- INGRAHAM: Okay so that was said and resaid and restated today. Let's say the President called up HHS or border control and said, okay, kids stay with the parents, they can all stay in this summer camp kind of facility, there are several of them nearby where we are, 100 miles. Then they have to be released in 20 days. So you're going to go to the American people who are already burdened with taxes, overcrowded classrooms, all of the stuff that kids in this city of LA are dealing with, and you're staying to them, okay the thousands upon thousands of family units that crossed the border should then be released into the country, is that what you're saying? BEARMAN: Yeah because we're short on immigration judges right now and I think-- INGRAHAM: Okay so I just to know that you're saying that that's okay because you know then, Ethan, that they never come back for their hearings. The lion share of people abscond and then later on they say amnesty. BEARMAN: But don't separate the families the way you're separating them right now, or the way the President and the border patrol and customs and immigration are doing this-- INGRAHAM: Are criminals separated from children? BEARMAN: After in felony cases, so this is a misdemeanor to cross into the United States illegally. So if you get pulled over because-- INGRAHAM: So does that mean anything? BEARMAN: Of course it means something. It means we need to fix our immigration system which means these people are coming here because our employers are hiring them. There are jobs waiting for them, jobs that Americans are fully employed for- INGRAHAM: Let me tell you about some of the jobs that are being done by illegal laborers and want you to try and let in on this. This is a story that is still being litigated. In December of 2017, a federal jury in Ohio, handed down a Fifth Amendment in a child labor human trafficking case where they had under aged children, under the age of 18, some as young as 14, who were brought up from Central America to work in this egg farm. Now this is not an isolated incident by the way, but they were trafficking these kids up since 2012 when President Obama pushed DACA through. And so there are jobs, yeah there a lot of jobs that unscrupulous businesses want to pay kids to do child labor. That's the kind of thing that will be stopped if we have a zero tolerance policy at the border. These countries exporting their own desperation are shameless, but Art, the images are bad. I mean Ethan saying look these images, these are terrible. That's not who we are as a country. We want families to be together, we're all for families, we love families. So how is this good for the Trump administration and the rule of law? These are the images that the press is focused on. ART DEL CUERTO, VP NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: The reality Laura is, during the Obama administration, the kids that were taken away from their families were pretty much put in bird cages, that's what they were. They are being held in better facilities similar to boarding schools, so there are much better facilities than what they were held in during the past administration. Now I understand people are arguing that we separated these kids and you can bring up during felonies or non-felony crimes. The reality is what we see day in, day out. Now no one's going to tell me that we're not doing the right thing when we're chasing away a group through the desert when they're bring their child, a minor through this desert. And when they see border patrol units show up, they drop their child and they run. They literally drop the child and run. They literally just drop these kids, they just drop them on the ground. So you are going to tell me that these are good people, these are good parents? They need to be with their kids? They're exposing their kids to criminal elements. We've seen many, many times where these individuals grab their children, they them in a trunk of a car, they hand them over to coyotes, they hand them over to smugglers, people that obviously have some kind of criminal record and they either walk through the desert or they go through a different car. Anybody in the United States, as a parent, should be sickened by those things. I would never hand over any of my children to somebody with a criminal past, much less allow them to put them in the trunk of a car to come through the desert. That is just despicable. INGRAHAM: I think people think that it's always parents, just parents who come all the way from El Salvador are just walking up to the border. A lot of times kids are coming up to the border and they're hooking up with adults on the way because they know, as long as I'm a child with an adult, before the family unit, like Ethan wants, could stay for a while 20 days then get released into society. That's why they're coming with children because they could get a fast pass to release. Now Ethan I want to play for you Obama and Hillary both responding to the other big border crisis which was in 2014, what they said about the unaccompanied minors, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have to send a clear message. Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: Our message absolutely is don't send your children unaccompanied on trains or through a bunch of smugglers. That is our direct message to the families in Central America. Do not send your children to the borders, if they do make it, then they'll get sent back. (END VIDEO CLIPS) INGRAHAM: Guess what, they weren't sent back. Almost none of them were sent back. And they heard that perhaps, even you know that they weren't sent back, and so people came with their children. BEARMAN: Right. INGRAHAM: Is this good? They said the kids are going to go back, they never went back, now they're tax payer burdens, someone followed them. BEARMAN: A lot of them are actually productive members of our society. INGRAHAM: Oh really? From 2014, they're like 13 years old, they're productive members of our society? What are you talking about, they're in public schools. BREAMAN: How many documents do you have? Some of them have become very successful members of society. INGRAHAM: What documents? These are people just from a couple of years ago. BEARMAN: And they'll become successful once integrated-- INGRAHAM: They're always valedictorians in your eyes aren't they? BEARMAN: Not always but we've been productive in so many ways. This is why we want to keep families together. They're fleeing desperate situations. We are so blessed and fortunate in this country that we don't experience that on a day to day basis so we want to keep them together and bring them in. INGRAHAM: Oh you might not experience that on a day to day basis, but there are a lot of Americans, 13.2 million children living below the poverty line, 18 or younger, $24,000 per household. These kids, $35,000 a year, that's what it costs the American tax payers to take care of them. Those facilities are a lot nicer than the way some of these kids are living in inner-city America today and I don't think that should ever be allowed to happen. Great to have you on Ethan, always great to see when I'm in town. And but the way, you want to know the truth about the administration's policy on kids crossing the border? Well stay right there my exclusive interview with attorney general Jeff Sessions, going to ask him the tough questions, coming up. Democrats have launched a blitz accusing the Trump administration of separating children from their parents and housing in, literally, concentration camps along the border. Leftist politicians from senators to Hillary Clinton took their best shot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JEFF MERKLEY, D-ORE.: It is unacceptable in my mind. I think in the minds and hearts of any American that someone can justify a policy of deliberate harm to children to gain legislative leverage. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, D-MD.: In fact what he's doing his holding these kids and their parents hostage to a whole set of other immigration issues. CLINTON: Separating families is not mandated by law at all. That is an outright lie and its incumbent on all of us, journalists and citizens alike, to call it just that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Okay well she should know something about lying right? Well the emotions running this hot, so is this a PR battle the administration can win, let's discuss all this with the head of the justice department. We are pleased to welcome the attorney general Jeff Sessions, first time on the Ingraham Angle, General Sessions, thank you so much for being with us. There's a lot to get to tonight. But you heard what Mrs Clinton said that this is a lie, this is not caused by the Obama administration, this doesn't have to be done. The President could pick up the phone tonight and stop this policy of separating children from their parents. What's the real truth there, General Sessions? SESSIONS: I guess what she is saying is the President could just issue a directive that everybody that enters the country unlawfully be released into the country and never be apprehended or stopped or prosecuted for their illegal entry. We have watched what happened with the Obama polices and over the years we went from 15,000 illegal entries to 75,000. This is a huge loophole in our system that's attracting more and more people, as more and more people understand that on the previous policies, if they entered the country unlawfully, nothing ever happened. We're doing the right thing, we're taking care of these children, they are not being abused, the Health and Human services holds them in good conditions, they work hard on it. We spent a billion dollars last year, Health and Human Services did, in taking care of children who'd entered the country unlawfully. And Laura one more thing, that vast majority of those children still tend to be the unaccompanied minors but we've had a big surge in families bringing children or some adults bringing children with them. INGRAHAM: At one of the shelters not too far from the border, has 90 percent of the kids who are unaccompanied minors, 10 percent were separated from their families. Just so my viewers understand this, General Sessions, what happens when a family unit, you see them all on the bridges, which I think is just absurd that they just stand the bridges near the ports of entry near San Diego. Now when they get processed in, and it's slow, and they get processed in and it's a woman says this is my child or two children then what happens? Are they separated if they claim asylum, say \"I want to claim asylum\", what happens to the mother and the children at that point? SESSIONS: If they enter the country at a point of entry, and there are many of those along the border, they are not violating the law. The mother of father in that circumstance would not be prosecuted and the families are stayed together. Presumably they're claiming an asylum and they would not be prosecuted and not be separated. But if they go out in the desert, they cross a fence or a barrier, offices have to identify them, follow them, apprehend them, they're violating the law and they need to be prosecuted for that. We simply cannot condone that kind of activity. We want to end this process of children being brought across dangerous territory, placing those children at risk. If they want to claim asylum, let them go through the port of entry. That's the way it should be done. INGRAHAM: Yeah I think most people aren't understanding this. I think most people think that if you come even through the what, 25 ports of entry, you'd have your family separated. That's not how it's working. It's a rare circumstance where the border patrol people know that this person is not related to this other person and they can figure it out pretty quickly in those circumstances. I just think it was important to have the people understand that. This is how your opponents, General Sessions are demagoguing this issue, let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHEAL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I walked down that railroad citing where the families were separated and that's why I sued that picture. Now look, I know we're not Nazi Germany all right, but there is a commonality there. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF.: This is the United States of America, it isn't Nazi Germany, and there's a difference, and we don't take children from their parents until now. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Nazi Germany, concentration camps, human rights violations. Laura Bush's had weighed in, Michelle Obama, Rosalynn Carter, all the former first ladies going back to Eleanor Roosevelt, she's apparently weighed in as well. General Sessions what's going on here? SESSIONS: Well it's a real exaggeration because in Nazi Germany they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country. But this is a serious matter, we need to think it through, be rational and thoughtful about it. We want to allow asylum for people who qualify for it, but people who want economic migration for their personal financial benefit and what they think is their family's benefit is not a basis for a claim of asylum. But they can make that claim, we will process it and review the situation and make a decision. Those children, if the parent brings them across the border in an unlawful area and the parent is deported, they will take the children home with them. That is true, if the parent claimed asylum and was allowed to stay here, then the children stay here also and they're kept in health and human services custody. INGRAHAM: Yeah. General Sessions is this policy, in part, used as a deterrent? Are you trying to deter people from bringing children or minors across this dangerous journey? Is that what this separation is about? SESSIONS: Fundamentally we are enforcing the law. If you break into a country in an unlawful-- INGRAHAM: But is it a deterrent sir? Are you considering this a deterrent? SESSIONS: Well I see the fact the no one was being prosecuted for this as a factor in a five-fold increase in the four years in this kind of illegal immigration so yes, hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break across the border unlawfully. INGRAHAM: And let me get your quick thoughts, Sir, if you would on this looming showdown with Congressional investigators, they're trying to get those documents as you know from your department. And Trey Gowdy, Oversight Chair, he said yesterday that officials will be held in contempt of Congress if the DOJ and FBI do not comply with the subpoenas. What are your thoughts on that? SESSIONS: Well, we've gone a long way in dealing with that. The FBI has worked hard on that I think. An agreement was signed with Mr. Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte, both chairmen, to have 12 of their staffers at the Department of Justice, at the FBI looking at these records. And so I think that's moving along pretty well. Hopefully -- INGRAHAM: But they are out of patience. General Sessions, I hate to interrupt. They're out of patience. They feel like they've been asking for these documents, some of these documents end up showing up in the I.G. report that Congress asked for months and months and months ago. You were in Congress. You know what it's like to try to do oversight. It's really frustrating. And they are going to hold Rosenstein in contempt. They're going to hold him in contempt of Congress. Then what? SESSIONS: Well, we have a responsibility to respond to Congress. We intend to be responsive to Congress. If we are running behind in production, we'll take efforts to step it up. And we have a responsibility to produce the documents that are properly disclosable, and we intend to do so. That's my direction to the department. INGRAHAM: Senator Sessions, Attorney General Sessions, just one more question. Are you involved at all in discussions about a possible recusal of Rod Rosenstein from overseeing Mueller given the fact that he signed up FISA warrants, a big controversy in this case? SESSIONS: I am not involved in that. He is the acting attorney general for that matter, and he has to make his own decision, as I had to make my decision. INGRAHAM: Got it. Got it. General Sessions, thank you so much for spending time with us tonight. Such important issues at the border. We really appreciate it, and we'll talk to you soon. And today by the way, on Capitol Hill, the FBI director got an earful over the double standard on the investigations into Hillary and Trump. That's not all. We are going to tell you why Jim Comey may be in serious hot water for his own private email use, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley wants investigators to find out if former FBI chief, Jim Comey, discussed classified info in his personal emails. This is just one of the key developments in a hearing today over the inspector general's report on the Clinton email investigation. DOJ Inspector General Mike Horowitz and FBI chief Chris Wray testified, but Comey declined to appear. Let's discuss with Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and Matt Schlapp, chairman of the America Conservative Union, along with Peter Schweizer, author of The New York Times bestseller \"Clinton Cash.\" All right, let's start with you, Peter. I haven't seen you for a while. What's your take on how this went down today with Horowitz appearing on Capitol Hill? It's amazing that Comey, you see them on Twitter in Iowa cornfields and he's at various national parks, but no time to come to Capitol Hill. PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, \"CLINTON CASH\": Comey's strategy on this is to hope that this going to blow over, that it's going to go away, that Washington will forget about it. I think the opposite has to happen. I think we have to think about it this way, Laura. Think about when we have cases of police misconduct or prosecutorial misconduct in the criminal realm. A cop is found having planted evidence or hiding evidence. We go and look at previous cases that that police officer handled. We want to drill down and find out how bad the problem was. And I think we need to do the same thing here. So the I.G. report as far as I'm concerned is the beginning. It's not the end of this investigation. INGRAHAM: Let's go to Chris Hahn. Chris, Senator Kennedy at one point was, he seemed bemused by the idea that no bias was found in the report, and he was questioning Horowitz on this issue. Watch. I think we have the sound bite. If we don't have the sound bite. We have it, don't have it. He said you honestly believe that the American people are going to look at this report and believe, look at those emails that there was no bias, that people weren't acting on bias? And Horwitz essentially said that's why we found out that it impacts the credibility of the handling of the investigation. We laid out all the facts are. So it was interesting when he said that, Chris, because he seemed to say welcome we laid out the facts and we said it affects the credibility, but they couldn't conclude that it affected the ultimate outcome of deciding to charge Mrs. Clinton or not. Kind of splitting hairs there. He seemed to indicate the bias was a factor in the credibility of the investigation. CHRIS HAHN, RADIO HOST: If anybody was biased against in 2016 by the FBI's action, it was Hillary Clinton and her campaign. And men will say just about anything they need to say in the middle of the night to try to impress a woman, and I think that's what was going on there. And whether or not there was evidence of bias, I don't know. I don't think Strzok should be involved with any investigations that touch the political system at all. But I think the results of 2016 were very clear. Nobody knew about the investigation going on into Russians meddling in the Trump campaign and everybody knew about the Clinton email scandal, and that was what decided the election. INGRAHAM: Matt Schlapp? MATT SCHLAPP, CONTRIBUTOR, \"THE HILL\": Yes, I mean, please. So look, it's very obvious in 2016 that Donald Trump was going to get the nomination, and then Lisa Page is emailing her boyfriend Mr. Strzok saying oh, my God, what are we going to do. And he says we're going to stop them. And we learned that seven days before he was put in charge of a counterintelligence investigation, this whole Russia-Trump collusion thing. It was all done, Laura, it wasn't done to stop Russians from colluding in our election. It was all done to stop Trump. That's why this message to stop him wasn't given to Congress, was removed from servers. The I.G. had to use it through a special means using DOD technology to find this message. It is a smoking gun. It was to stop Trump. HAHN: Matt, please. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Hold on, hold on. Let's get back to Peter. We'll get back to you in a second, Chris. So Peter, you heard General Sessions on the show just now. He is not going to wade in much to the document dispute between Congress and the executive branch. But it is a whopper. When you have the Congress now, they are about to hold DOJ in contempt of Congress. They are going to subpoena these documents. These things aren't turned over in short order, then it's just another administration official just like Eric Holder during fast and furious. He was held in contempt of Congress, and he goes down, I guess as one of the great attorney generals of all time. It's insane. SCHWEIZER: You're right, Laura. The old adage in Washington I think is true. If you're hiding something, it's usually because you have something to hide. And that is what is so troubling. They have had to drag information out, whether it's from the FBI or DOJ, as it relates to the Hillary Clinton investigation to the Russian investigation. You name it, they've had to drag it out of the DOJ and the FBI. Why is that? It's not similar because they are trying to protect sources. That stuff is redacted. It's taken away. It's deeply embarrassing to this institution. And by the way, the comment that the FBI was biased against Hillary Clinton is laughable. To have the FBI director stand up in front of the country and absolve Hillary Clinton of her crimes is not his role, is not his responsibility. And it was the FBI putting the seal of approval essentially on her conduct for a legal standpoint. That's unprecedented, unprecedented. HAHN: And the letter that they send 11 days before the election reopening the investigation. That had nothing to do with any bias against Hillary Clinton. OK, Peter, I've got you. Let me go back to Matt's point. SCHLAPP: Chris, I get to talk. INGRAHAM: One at a time, guys. HAHN: Wait, I've been waiting for three minutes. Let me go back to your point, Matt. You are seizing on a very minute thing in the I.G. report. The I.G. report was very critical of Comey in the way he treated Clinton. It was critical of a lot of things. Strzok and Page were definitely doing things they shouldn't of been doing, but let me tell you, I'm sure all three of us have said things to a woman that we could not do to try to impress them. SCHLAPP: Chris, would you stop saying that? INGRAHAM: Chris, hold on Matt. If this were happening to Hillary Clinton, if this were happening to Hillary Clinton, we had to Trump people, or two people burrowed in who despise the Clintons, were laughing at the Clintons. And then they said we're going to stop this. We need an insurance policy. You would be going nuts. All the Democrats would be going nuts. You know why, because it would be smart to go nuts because it's outrageous that our Justice Department can be used by individuals with a political animus to try to take down a candidate. That's wrong. I don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat. I love you all, but that's -- we can't do that in our country. It kills our faith in these institutions. It really does. Again, Republican, Democrat, can't do it. Matt Schlapp, close it out. SCHLAPP: Real quickly, that's why the timing of when he said he would stop it matters. That's when the Russian investigation started. The reason why the Comey letter went out so close to Election Day is because Comey was dragging his feet. It was the New York U.S. attorney's office for 30 days who was pushing -- HAHN: It was highly inappropriate. SCHLAPP: He dragged his heels. And that's what -- HAHN: He was inappropriate and biased towards Trump. INGRAHAM: Guys, we've to go. Fantastic panel by fantastic men. Not even in the studio with me. Thank you so much. And by the way, the \"Washington Post\" may have gotten it's wires crossed. It actually ran a story showing how a Trump associate chose not to collude with the Russians. Roger Stone explains next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: When the media haven't been freaking out about separating kids from their families and going into shelters and calling them concentration camps, over the weekend they were freaking out about what they thought was going to be another nail in the coffin of Donald Trump, another instance of Russian collusion. Whoops. Except It wasn't. so let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just more questions about potentially another Russian having meetings certainly was someone that's associated with the campaign. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Specifically in this case, Roger Stone and Donald Trump being so close for so long raises additional questions about what the president, the now president and then candidate, may have known about these Russian contacts. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is my ninth presidential campaign, and there's never been anything like this. The level of contacts between one campaign and one for national, it goes over and over again. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: OK, we're laughing here in the studio. Joining us to explain is the man himself, Roger Stone. Roger, I had to treat you with that montage because I'm watching it. Not one of them say the guy was an FBI informant, not one of them. Tell us the real story. ROGER STONE, INFORMAL TRUMP ADVISER: It's extraordinary. In May of 2016, Michael Caputo, who appeared earlier with Sean Hannity, contacted me because a man using the name Henry Greenberg, turns out to be a paid FBI informant, said he had information that would be useful to the Trump campaign. He did not in fact promised in the run-up to this meeting dirt on Hillary Clinton, as reported by Shelby Holliday of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" classic case of fake news. In any event, I reluctantly took this meeting which lasted about 20 minutes. It turns out that Henry Greenberg is not his real name, that he is an FBI informant for over 17 years, was deported from the country in 2000, has a 10-year prison record for violent crime, is associated with Russian organized crime. But more importantly, is in the country on a visa sponsored by the Miami office of the FBI because he is providing, quote, a public benefit. He's an informant. At this very brief meeting, Mr. Greenberg, not his real name, the FBI informant, first shows up wearing a MAGA hat and Trump t-shirt. Shows me photographs on his phone of he and a woman at various Trump rallies, and then lays it on me that he has information damaging Hillary Clinton, and he only wants $2 million for it. I reject his request for $2 million, and he laughs and says it's not your money I want. It's Donald Trump's money. And there it is giving up the game. This is an attempt to entrap me but to compromise Donald Trump. Even Greenberg or whatever his real name, the Russian FBI informant, tells the \"Washington Post\" that I reject his effort. INGRAHAM: But does he speak like this, Roger? does he say I have very good information on Hillary Clinton? Did he sound like Boris in the Rocky the squirrel cartoon. (LAUGHTER) STONE: You sound more like Boris Badenov. The real question here is why I didn't remember a meeting that has no legal consequences, because -- INGRAHAM: Why didn't you remember? You said -- I want to play -- Roger, I've got to be really tough on you because April 19th of last year, you said this. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STONE: I didn't talk to anybody who was identifiably Russian during the two-year run-up to this campaign. I'm not sure I did previously either. I very definitely can't think of anybody who might have been a Russian without my knowledge. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: So that's what everybody is hitting on today. STONE: That's fine. But the question is not why I forgot a meeting which is inconsequential in which nothing improper or illegal happens. The question is, why does James Comey's FBI run unknown informant who is in the country on a visa through the graces of the Miami FBI office for public benefit in on me? He gave away the game when he said I don't want your money. I want Trump's money. This was an effort to entrap Donald Trump. INGRAHAM: Roger, we need the documents on this, though, and I know you're going to be pursuing that because we need the documents. I want to know when. STONE: If you go to DemocratDossier.org, you can see his extensive criminal background and all of the evidence that he was an FBI informant. I have -- INGRAHAM: Got it, thank you. We've got to roll. But thank you so much. Fantastic interview. In moments, Ben Shapiro joins me on such breakdown the rank hypocrisy, the media's hysterical coverage of the illegal immigration kids. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Lost in all the hysterical coverage over illegal immigrant children separated from their parents is a key point -- what about the thousands of homeless veterans or the plight of kids in urban America? Where's the outcry, the tears, the press conferences about their plight? Let's discuss this with radio host, editor in chief at The Daily Wire Ben Shapiro, who joins us here on set in L.A. Great to see you. How are you doing? BEN SHAPIRO, THE DAILY WIRE: Good to see you. INGRAHAM: So I know you have been through this racket before with how they are playing this border issue, but what is the truth about how illegal immigration has affected this state, this city, this community? SHAPIRO: The cost to the state are just enormous. We're talking billions of dollars. It certainly has affected the city itself. It's affected the level of criminality in the city. It's affected the budget of the city. And it's affected pretty much every aspect of the city including how the city itself is run. So while Eric Garcetti who is the mayor of city and now wants to run for president on the Democratic ticket ignores the 55,000 homeless people. INGRAHAM: And 11,000 homeless veterans in the state. SHAPIRO: And 55,000 homeless people will fill Dodger stadium just in this city alone, he wants to run for president. But meanwhile he's going to virtue signal about immigration because it's a political winner in this particular state. INGRAHAM: And for the Democrats to run down of the border, I'm going to down there tomorrow, they're running down to the border. They're like oh, we're inhumane. This is an inhumane series of actions by Donald Trump. You pointed out during the break how President Obama viewed the deportation issue. SHAPIRO: In 2014, Jeh Johnson who was then Homeland Security secretary, he explicitly said that we are taking the measures we taking to deport entire families of people as a deterrent. That was his language, deterrent language. And now when the Trump administration uses similar language with regard to separating families, I don't think they should necessarily use that language, but that language is not unprecedented. And the fact is that basically what the left is saying now is that President Trump has a choice. Either he should release everyone into mainstream society or they are going to yell and scream, because the law itself says, the ninth circuit court of appeals has made this very clear that if you arrest the parents you have to release the kids. And that means you have to separate the kids from their parents. There is no option to get the parents in custody with the children. This is just not an option under the law as written by leftists on the ninth circuit court of appeals. INGRAHAM: When kids are put into sponsorships across the country, when they come in unaccompanied, sometimes they are brought in by traffickers, they are sent to sponsors. And do you realize, and I'm sure our viewers, some of them don't know this, some of those sponsors themselves are illegal immigrants. HHS regulations do not discount the possibility of illegal immigrants being sponsored because it's only one factor. It is more your financial ability to care for the people. So now illegal immigrants are sponsoring illegal immigrants in the United States of America. Close it out. SHAPIRO: The ninth circuit court of appeals has actually suggested that perhaps the best policy would be to take one of the parents and release them alongside the children so we can actually start releasing more people in society. It's pretty clear what the left wants here. And talking about the delays in how long kids should be in custody, the fact is unless the left released everyone, unless Trump released everyone, the left will be equally unhappy. INGRAHAM: Ben Shapiro, great to see you. SHAPIRO: Great to see you. INGRAHAM: We'll be right back to close this out. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Apparently there are a lot of people very upset because we referred to some of the detention facilities tonight as essentially like summer camps. The San Diego Union Tribune today described the facilities as essentially like what you would expect at a boarding school. So I will stick to there are some of them like boarding schools. And I suggest that a lot of the folks who are worried about that spend more time in Central America. I have. And we should make adoption easier for American couples who want to adopt these kids.

            "article_content": "Massive public outcry\u00a0has built over children being separated from their parents as they attempt to cross into the U.S. illegally. After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy in dealing with migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families during a six-week period in April and May. Read on for a look at what\u2019s happening to children at the border \u2013 and what the law actually says. Immigrant children play outside a former Job Corps site that now houses them in Homestead, Fla. It is not known if the children crossed the border as unaccompanied minors or were separated from family members. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) There is no law that dictates children must be separated from their parents when caught crossing into the country illegally, and there was a time when ICE policy didn\u2019t call for detaining all families. There are, however, laws against entering the U.S. illegally, and a decree regarding how long children can be held in immigration detention. A 2008 anti-trafficking statute\u00a0dictates that certain minors must be taken out of immigration detention within 72 hours. ICE is, by law, prohibited from detaining unaccompanied children, DHS says. Once a parent or guardian has been apprehended and charged for illegally entering the U.S., the children are then transported to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is \u201cresponsible for their care and is required by law to place unaccompanied minors in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.\u201d This generally means the child can be placed in the care of a relative already in the U.S.; however, a minor can also be put into foster care or a temporary detention center. According to DHS, children in HHS ORR care are given medical and mental health attention, if needed, as well as educational programs. They are \u201cnormally held in a temporary shelter or hosted by an appropriate family,\u201d DHS said. While in custody, according to DHS, officials look for a \u201csponsor\u201d for the minor. Sponsors can include a relative that \u201cmeets criteria for the safety of the child and continuation of any immigration proceedings.\u201d Parents, too, can ask to sponsor his or her child after being released. Minors are only allowed to be detained for 20 days, thanks to the 1997 Flores settlement agreement. The White House said this agreement has \u201champered the government\u2019s ability to detain and promptly remove any Unaccompanied Alien Children and family unites.\u201d The Trump administration isn\u2019t the first to separate adults and children at the border \u2013 but it did up the ante with the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy, what the Justice Department called a \u201cnew\u201d plan to curtail illegal immigration in April. \u201cIf you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law,\u201d Sessions said in May. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, families were rarely detained before the early 2000s. Instead, they were released and given an immigration court hearing they were required to attend. Former President George W. Bush, too, had a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy for illegal immigration \u2013 but under his administration, officials generally exempted family units and minors from the \u201cOperation Streamline\u201d process where migrants were quickly prosecuted and deported, according to The New York Times. In 2008, Bush signed a law unanimously passed by Congress that called unaccompanied minors to be released into the \u201cleast restrictive setting.\u201d Under the Obama administration, families were often detained together in administrative ICE custody, The Times reported. However, in 2013, the Obama administration was criticized as ICE deported more than 72,000 parents who had at least one U.S.-born child, according to HuffPost. Some of those children were able to remain in the U.S. with relatives, while others were put in foster care, HuffPost reported. Nicole Hernandez, of the Mexican state of Guerrero, holds on to her mother as they wait with other families to request political asylum in the United States, across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. The family has been waiting for about a week in this border city hoping for a chance to escape widespread violence in their home state. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Children under 18 who arrive at the border alone are considered to be an \u201cunaccompanied alien child,\u201d or unaccompanied minor. However, children with a parent or guardian are considered to be part of a \u201cfamily unit.\u201d According to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the number of people attempting to cross the southern border illegally has increased to more than 50,000 people per month. She said in June\u00a0there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied children coming to the border since the previous year, and a 435 percent increase in families entering the U.S. illegally. The White House has suggested the influx of unaccompanied minors coming across the U.S. border is being used by gangs, such as MS-13, to recruit new members. According to the White House, more than one-third of already arrested MS-13 members and associates came into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor. The separation of children from their parents at the border has brought widespread and bipartisan condemnation of the act, from politicians to activists and from celebrities to parents. All of the living first ladies, including Melania Trump, have expressed opposition to the policy. In a rare public statement, Mrs. Trump said she \u201chates\u201d to see families separated at the border. Her spokeswoman said the first lady \u201cbelieves we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u201d Hillary Clinton, also a former secretary of state and presidential nominee, said the policy is a \u201cmoral humanitarian crisis.\u201d In a tweet, she said, \u201cEvery parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged.\u201d \u201cI live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel,\u201d Laura Bush said. \u201cIt is immoral. And it breaks my heart.\u201d Multiple governors, including Republicans, have announced they will not send National Guard troops to the border until the separation policy is stopped. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said he ordered the four troops already deployed to return home, and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker reportedly canceled the deployment of his state\u2019s National Guard troops. The Trump administration has attempted to distance itself from the policy, with the president\u00a0falsely\u00a0repeatedly blaming Democrats, claiming they \u201care the problem\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t care about crime.\u201d \"#CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security,\" Trump said in a June 19 tweet. But Democrats have similarly\u00a0pointed fingers at Trump, saying he has the power to change things. \"Stop using the suffering of these little children as some barbaric bargaining chip. You started this and can end it right now. #FamiliesBelongTogether,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0D-Calif., replied to Trump's tweet.

            "article_content": "In an attempt to motivate the Republican base, President Trump is laying blame for the caravan on the Democrats for refusing to reform immigration laws. John Roberts reports for 'Special Report.' Democrats appear to be remaining silent on the issue of the caravan of thousands of immigrants on the march from Central America and unwilling to get into a public debate with President Trump since the midterms are just weeks away. Trump and his allies are urging to elect more Republicans, saying the caravan shows an immigration crisis that was exacerbated by the Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to support tougher border measures, as proposed by Republicans and the White House. \"Every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws!\" Trump wrote in a tweet. \"Remember the midterms!\" Yet Democrats, while previously outspoken regarding Trump\u2019s immigration policies, are staying largely silent on the issue, preferring not to engage on the topic. The reluctance to tackle Trump on his core issue may also be influenced by the concern that just two weeks before the midterms such a fight may energize his Republican supporters with little effect on their own voters. EARLY VOTING POINTS TO MASSIVE TURNOUT, POTENTIAL WARNING SIGNS FOR GOP The Democrats\u2019 plans to retake the U.S. Senate also involve both winning and retaining seats in the red states that overwhelmingly voted for Trump, a difficult task considering Democratic candidates are already struggling there. In North Dakota, for instance, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is now trailing her Republican challenger Rep. Kevin Cramer by 16 points, according to a recent poll. In Arizona, embattled Democratic Senate hopeful Kyrsten Sinema, who\u2019s under fire for saying \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d if people go and fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan, is fighting for her political life against Republican Martha McSally. Sinema is now trailing McSally by two percentage points, though just last summer she was beating her opponent by as much as double digits. \u201cDemocratic opposition to strong immigration security has been a very effective issue for us in Senate races this year,\u201d Steven Law, head of the Senate Leadership Fund, told the Washington Post. \u201cI don\u2019t see how the spectacle of a massive horde trying to bust our borders on the brink of a national election remotely helps Democrats.\u201d \"Democratic opposition to strong immigration security has been a very effective issue for us in Senate races this year. I don\u2019t see how the spectacle of a massive horde trying to bust our borders on the brink of a national election remotely helps Democrats.\" Trump on Monday doubled-down on the issue, promising that there was no limit to the number of troops he\u2019s prepared to send to defend the border from the caravan of thousands of immigrants. TRUMP VOWS TO SEND AS MANY TROOPS 'AS NECESSARY' TO KEEP GROWING MIGRANT CARAVAN OUT His remarks came just days after a shocking footage surfaced showing the caravan defying the warnings, smashing a border fence and entering Mexico despite the presence of the riot police. \u201cSadly, it looks like Mexico\u2019s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergency. Must change laws!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. The Democrats instead remain focused on tackling the GOP on issues like healthcare, believing it\u2019s the winning issue this election cycle in the wake of the Republican plans to repeal the last remaining aspects of the Obamacare if they win the midterm election. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the country, slammed Trump in a statement regarding the caravan of migrants, saying he\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d to change the conversation because \u201chealth care is the number one issue Americans care about.\u201d TRUMP ON MIGRANT CARAVAN: 'ONSLAUGHT OF ILLEGAL ALIENS' REPRESENTS 'DISGRACE' TO THE DEMS According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last week, which surveyed people since the beginning of the caravan earlier this month, the issue of immigration isn\u2019t the top concern for voters. It ranks below health care, which has consistently been the most important issue in this election, the economy, jobs\u00a0and is as important as policies concerning gun rights. But the issue of health care is significantly less important to Republicans, who put immigration and the economy as way more important issues, suggesting the GOP efforts to highlight the caravan controversy is aimed at increasing the turnout of their base in the upcoming election. The strategy might be working as Republican-affiliated early voters are surpassing Democratic-affiliated ones in early voting in several states with key elections, according to the Hill. The Republican early voters are reportedly exceeding Democratic early voters in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee and Texas.",

            "article_content": "An undocumented immigrant faces a murder charge for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of Mollie Tibbetts The killing of Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts, allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant, has placed a spotlight on the state's Democratic party, which this summer denounced federal immigration laws and called for local officials not to enforce them. But Iowa Democratic party officials on Wednesday would not say whether they stood by their immigration platform, and instead characterized the matter as a \"partisan fight.\" \"The Iowa Democratic Party is going to honor the wishes of the Tibbetts family to let them grieve in private and will not turn this senseless tragedy into a partisan fight,\" Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price told Fox News. The national uproar over Tibbetts' slaying also threatens to upend two key House races underway in the state, which are considered potentially pivotal to Democrats' chances of retaking the House in November's midterm elections. The 2018\u00a0Iowa Democratic Party platform, in a section entitled \"Statement of Issues,\"\u00a0reads: \"We oppose: detaining undocumented minors, immigrant detention/deportation quotas, locally enforcing federal immigration laws, mass raids/related enforcement practices, religious exclusion, 'papers please,' unnecessary travel-bans, abrogating birthright-citizenship, separating minor children from their parents when they are trying to enter the country, internment and concentration camps.\" The platform was adopted at a state convention in June. It goes on in a \"Statement of Principles\" to \"affirm the Democratic Party\u2019s contributions to our nation\u2019s heritage, accomplishments, and diversity.\" Asked directly whether Iowa officials still did not want local police to enforce federal immigration law, Price did not respond. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, the two candidates Democrats have nominated to take on vulnerable Republican congressmen in the state, did not immediately respond to Fox News' inquiries as to their positions on the party platform. FARM THAT HIRED SUSPECT TIBBETTS KILLING DIDN'T USE E-VERIFY, OFFICIAL SAYS On Wednesday, an Iowa judge ordered Cristhian Rivera, the 24-year-old illegal immigrant accused of killing Tibbetts, held on $5 million cash-only bond.\u00a0Rivera was mostly stoic and looked straight ahead in the courtroom. He wore headphones and used an interpreter when the judge spoke, only answering \"Yes\" when asked if he understood the proceeding. A body believed to be Tibbetts was\u00a0discovered Tuesday hidden in a corn field beneath several corn stalks after Rivera led authorities to the location. Tibbetts' killing has\u00a0fueled Republican calls to strengthen border security, while raising questions as to how Rivera was able to enter and remain in the country. Rivera worked at a dairy farm, Yarrabee Farms, for the past four years -- less than three miles from where the 20-year-old University of Iowa student was staying the night she vanished in July. The company said he was in good standing as a worker and was shocked to learn of his alleged involvement in Tibbetts' disappearance and murder. The suspect told law enforcement he approached Tibbetts while she was running, according to authorities. He claimed to have blacked out and realized later that he had put Tibbetts in his trunk. Investigators said they believed Rivera had been in the area for four to seven years. WHAT MURDER SUSPECT CRISTHIAN RIVERA TOLD COPS ABOUT TIBBETTS' SLAYING On Wednesday night, President Trump cited Tibbetts' case to call for changes to the country's immigration laws. \"Molly Tibbetts, an incredible young woman, is now permanently separated from her family.\u00a0 A person came in from Mexico Illegally and killed her.\u00a0 We need the wall, we need our immigration laws changed. We need our border laws changed. We need Republicans to do it because the Democrats aren\u2019t going to do it. This is one instance of many,\" the president said in a video posted to Twitter. Democrats are aggressively trying to flip the House seats of two Republicans in Iowa in November, Reps. David Young in the 3rd Congressional District and Rod Blum in the 1st Congressional District. Both races are toss-ups, and are considered key contests as Democrats try to retake the House in the midterms. That would require Democrats winning a total of 24 currently GOP-held seats. Immigration had played a significant role in two campaigns even before Tibbetts' disappearance. Democrats have nominated Finkenauer and Axne to take on Blum and Young, respectively. Both\u00a0Finkenauer and Axne are seeking to the first women to represent Iowa in the House. Axne has vowed to\u00a0a provide a \"full path to citizenship for Dreamers and undocumented immigrants who don't have a criminal background,\" referring to\u00a0illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. The progressive\u00a0Finkenauer also has come out in support of immigration reform. Neither Axne nor Finkenauer responded to Fox News' requests for comments on the Tibbetts case. On the Republican side, Young had taken a moderate approach to the issue, saying he wanted border security but also a path to citizenship for Dreamers,\u00a0the\u00a0Des Moines Register\u00a0reported. Blum, for his part, has called for an end to family separations at the border in the wake of the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy on arresting all illegal border crossers, but\u00a0stressed that media coverage of the issue has been unfair. PHILADELPHIA TERMINATES ICE CONTRACT AFTER ACTIVISTS STORM CITY HALL The Tibbetts case also could have national political ramifications.\u00a0The once-fringe call to abolish ICE in recent months has been picked up by top 2020 Democratic prospects, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. There are signs not all Democrats are ready to take the idea mainstream, though. In July, House Republicans\u00a0passed a nonbinding resolution expressing support for ICE, effectively daring Democrats to oppose the measure on record. Only 35 Democrats voted against the bill, with 133 voting present. Fox News' Chad Pergram, Adam Shaw, Cody Derespina, Bret Baier and Guerin Hays contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Justice Department's criminal complaint says Elena Khusyaynova worked for the same Russian social media troll farm that was indicted in February by special counsel Robert Mueller; chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge reports from Capitol Hill. A Russian national has been charged with interfering in the U.S. political system, including next month\u2019s midterm elections, the Department of Justice revealed Friday. Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, was the chief accountant of a Russian operation called \"Project Lakhta,\" which was \"funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and two companies he controls, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering,\" a\u00a0news release said. \"Project Lakhta includes multiple components, some involving domestic audiences within the Russian Federation and others targeting foreign audiences in the United States, members of the European Union, and Ukraine, among others,\" according to the DOJ. As part of her role in the operation, Khusyaynova allegedly oversaw its finances, \"including foreign influence activities directed at the United States,\" the DOJ said. Among the records she allegedly managed were \"detailed expenses for activities in the United States, such as expenditures for activists, advertisements on social media platforms, registration of domain names, the purchase of proxy servers, and 'promoting news postings on social networks,'\" the news release said. \u201cToday\u2019s charges allege that Russian national Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova conspired with others who were part of a Russian influence campaign to interfere with U.S. democracy,\u201d\u00a0the news release said. \u201cOur nation is built upon a hard-fought and unwavering commitment to democracy. Americans disagree in good faith on all manner of issues, and we will protect their right to do so. Unlawful foreign interference with these debates debases their democratic integrity, and we will make every effort to disrupt it and hold those involved accountable.\u201d The FBI remains dedicated in its efforts to thwart \"unlawful influence operations\" with fellow law enforcement agencies, FBI Director Christopher Wray said in the news release, adding that the bureau takes \"all threats to our democracy very seriously.\" \u201cThis case serves as a stark reminder to all Americans: Our foreign adversaries continue their efforts to interfere in our democracy by creating social and political division, spreading distrust in our political system, and advocating for the support or defeat of particular political candidates,\u201d Wray said. Neither Khusyaynova nor the alleged conspiracy operation is accused of producing \"any effect\" on election results, the news release said. Khusyaynova is accused of taking part in the alleged conspiracy, which attempted to carry out \"what it called internally 'information warfare against the United States,'\" the DOJ said. \"This effort was not only designed to spread distrust towards candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system in general, but also to defraud the United States by impeding the lawful functions of government agencies in administering relevant federal requirements,\" the news release said. Those allegedly involved in the operation attempted to present themselves as Americans, the DOJ said. And, by using the \"thousands of social media and email accounts\" that were generated, they tried \"to create and amplify divisive social and political content targeting U.S. audiences.\" \"The conspirators allegedly took extraordinary steps to make it appear that they were ordinary American political activists. This included the use of virtual private networks and other means to disguise their activities and to obfuscate their Russian origin,\" the news release said.\u00a0\"These accounts also were used to advocate for the election or electoral defeat of particular candidates in the 2016 and 2018 U.S. elections. Some social media accounts posted tens of thousands of messages, and had tens of thousands of followers.\" An array of issues, such as immigration, gun control and the NFL national anthem debate, were allegedly brought up in online discussions by the conspirators, who were told \"to create 'political intensity through supporting radical groups' and to 'aggravate the conflict between minorities and the rest of the population,'\" the news release said. \"The actors also developed playbooks and strategic messaging documents that offered guidance on how to target particular social groups, including the timing of messages, the types of news outlets to use, and how to frame divisive messages,\" the DOJ said. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter provided \"exceptional cooperation\" as officials worked on their investigation, the DOJ said. Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Federal officials have subpoenaed more than 20 million documents related to voter records in North Carolina as part of an investigation into alleged fraud. (iStock) Federal immigration officials have subpoenaed more than 20 million documents related to voter records in North Carolina as part of an investigation into alleged fraud. The official request is \u201cthe most exhaustive on record\u201d for election officials, North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement (NCSBE) attorney Josh Lawson said to the assistant U.S. attorney named on the subpoena\u00a0in an email, which was provided to Fox News. The request comes just weeks after Justice Department officials charged 19 foreign nationals with illegal voting in North Carolina in the 2016 election. The cases are also being investigated by the Immigration and Custom Enforcements (ICE) agency. The defendants \u2013 from numerous countries, including Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nigeria and Germany \u2013 were accused of filing a false claim of citizenship in order to vote or illegal voting. The subpoena request, which state officials say impedes their efforts to get ready for November elections, asks for more than 15 million documents in North Carolina\u2019s voter registration database as well as more than 5.6 million individual ballots from 44 counties, according to data provided to Fox News by the NCSBE. Specifically, the subpoena requests of the counties: \u201cAny and all poll books, e-poll books, voting records, and/or voter authorization documents, and executive official ballots (including absentee official ballots), that were submitted to, filed by, received by, and/or maintained by the [specific county's board of elections] from August 30, 2013 through August 30, 2018.\u201d 19 FOREIGN NATIONALS CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL VOTING DURING 2016 ELECTION And of the state board of elections: \u201cAny and all voter registration applications and/or other documents, as identified below, that were submitted to, filed by, received by, or maintained by the North Carolina State Board of Elections from January 1, 2010 through August 30, 2018, within any of the counties in North Carolina.\u201d The state has a deadline of Sept. 25 to comply with the subpoena request, although Assistant U.S. Attorney Sebastian Kielmanovich indicated county board officials could apply for an extension. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the administrative drain on county boards of elections in order to comply with the extensive subpoenas immediately prior to a federal election, including the necessary reproduction of millions of documents (all ballots, etc.),\u201d Lawson said in his letter. A LOOK AT TRUMP\u2019S NOW-DISBANDED CONTROVERSIAL VOTER FRAUD COMMISSION \u201cResponding to the subpoena will impose an unreasonable burden upon the staff of each county subpoenaed, and it is difficult to believe that it will be possible to review the vast quantity of requested materials before the general election,\u201d Wake County Commissioner John D. Burns said in a letter to U.S. Attorney Robert Higdon. Higdon resides over the 44 counties specifically targeted in the subpoena, according to WRAL-TV. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina declined to comment on the subpoenas to Fox News on Thursday. Wake County Board of Elections Vice Chairman Greg Flynn told WRAL: \u201cI don\u2019t even know if they have the manpower to process all that. It\u2019s just so broad, and the number of documents you\u2019re talking about is just phenomenal.\u201d Burns also said the investigation \u201crisks being viewed by the public as a partisan effort to interfere with the vote\u201d in the upcoming general election. MEXICAN WOMAN CHARGED WITH VOTER FRAUD, ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY VOTING IN 2016 ELECTION In a joint statement, Democratic Reps. David Price and G.K. Butterfield, who represent the area, slammed the \"alarming and unprecedented request from President Trump's Department of Justice and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" \"This massive request of voter data seems clearly designed to disenfranchise and intimidate voters and to disrupt the administration of an impending election with major state and national implications,\" the congressmen said. There has been an intense debate in the country \u2013 particularly in North Carolina \u2013 over voter fraud and efforts by Republican lawmakers to impose stricter voter ID requirements. President Trump, too, has long claimed widespread voter fraud took place in the 2016 election, an assertion that has not been substantiated. But Democrats have argued voting fraud is not a widespread problem. Trump launched a voter fraud commission in his first year in office, but it disbanded after facing multiple legal challenges as it attempted a widespread collection of data.

            "article_content": "National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd supports a government shutdown over border security. Border security and illegal immigration continue to be among the most divisive issues our nation faces \u2013 and at times it seems like Democrats and Republicans will never agree on what to do. But in 2013 the U.S. Senate passed a bill that, though it died in the House, could serve as a model for effective immigration legislation that might pass and be signed into law \u2013 if all sides are willing to make reasonable compromises. The 2013 bipartisan bill would have provided $46 billion for border security improvements. That\u2019s nearly double the $25 billion President Trump is now pressing for to build the wall on our border with Mexico. \u201cBuild that wall, build that wall, build that wall,\u201d President Trump\u2019s ardent supporters chanted Saturday night at a campaign rally in Lewis Center, Ohio, where the president campaigned for a Republican U.S. House candidate running in a special election Tuesday. The president told the crowd that he will make sure the wall along our border with Mexico is built, to fulfill a promise he made repeatedly during his own campaign in the 2016 presidential race. He is clearly determined to get funding for the wall as one of his top priorities. Immigrants crossing our border with Mexico would have covered much of the expense of building the wall under the 2013 legislation because they would each be charged $2,000 in fines, paid gradually, to earn permanent legal status. But President Trump upset many of his fellow Republicans in Congress, who are generally supportive of his get-tough crackdown on illegal immigration, when he tweeted July 29: \u201cI would be willing to \u2018shut down\u2019 government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!\u201d The threat of a government shutdown is certainly something many Republican members of Congress would rather avoid, since they would likely be held politically responsible in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. But fortunately, if congressional Republicans and the president are willing to practice \u201cthe art of the deal,\u201d reviving the 2013 Senate bill would give them a proven way forward \u2013 one that would fund border security, end the diversity visa lottery, and shift to a merit-based immigration system with the support of a substantial number of Democratic votes in Congress. Immigrants crossing our border with Mexico \u2013 who comprise a slight majority of the roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully \u2013 would have covered much of the expense of building the wall under the 2013 legislation because they would each be charged $2,000 in fines, paid gradually, to earn permanent legal status. Far from the free grace of amnesty, the 2013 bill required those who had either crossed our border or overstayed a visa illegally to make amends. The legislation also provided protection for immigrants brought to the U.S. in violation of the law as children \u2013 the Dreamers, who President Trump has said include \u201csome absolutely incredible kids\u201d who should have a pathway to citizenship. And, of course, under the legislation any immigrant with serious criminal convictions would be denied any chance to stay here with legal status. The 2013 bill would have ended the diversity visa lottery altogether and terminated certain family reunification visas, including for siblings of U.S. citizens and for their married children older than 31. By eliminating these visas and significantly increasing the number of visas for immigrant workers who could meet key needs in the U.S. labor market, the legislation sought to dramatically shift the availability of visas toward the merit-based process President Trump has praised. Many in President Trump\u2019s evangelical base would support such a move. Most evangelicals tell pollsters they support a path to citizenship for the undocumented, paired with border security improvements. A mere 16 percent of evangelicals are opposed. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for this bill five years ago, joined by a significant number of Republicans. Certainly, many Democrats disliked particular elements of the bill, including what they viewed as unnecessary spending on border security and eliminating certain visa categories. But they were willing to accept these provisions in exchange for an earned legalization program. Some wonder if Democrats would take the same deal today, allowing President Trump to simultaneously fulfill several key campaign pledges to his base and accomplish something Latino voters have seen as a priority for decades, but which both President George W. Bush and President Obama failed to make happen. Indeed, when President Bush last pushed a similar immigration deal, some Senate Democrats inserted poison-pill amendments that helped kill a carefully crafted agreement, denying Bush a key legislative victory. It\u2019s possible such partisan brinksmanship would re-emerge if President Trump were to propose something along the lines of the Senate\u2019s 2013 bipartisan deal today \u2013 but he should at least call the Democrats\u2019 bluff. There is, however, significant evidence that the Democrats would be willing to agree to the compromise legislation they supported five years ago \u2013 but the president\u2019s best interests are continually sabotaged from within. All but three Senate Democrats already voted for $25 billion for a border wall last February in exchange for a path to citizenship for Dreamers. But the bill failed when congressional Republicans were scared away by a presidential veto threat, courtesy of White House Domestic Policy Adviser Stephen Miller. Miller, who advocates cutting legal immigration in half, urged President Trump to reject the deal because it did not include elimination of family reunification visas and the diversity visa lottery. If President Trump is personally committed to cutting legal immigration and deporting all undocumented immigrants, there is simply no deal to be had, at least with this Congress. But if he truly is opposed to a net reduction in legal immigrant visas \u2013 as he explicitly stated last year \u2013 he needs to take the reins and ignore the staffers who have torpedoed congressional negotiations. Many in President Trump\u2019s evangelical base would support such a move. Thousands of evangelical pastors have affirmed an Evangelical Statement of Principles for Immigration Reform very consistent with the 2013 Senate bill, and most evangelicals tell pollsters they support a path to citizenship for the undocumented, paired with border security improvements. A mere 16 percent of evangelicals are opposed. The president\u2019s fellow business leaders are on board as well. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supported the 2013 effort, because it would be enormously beneficial to the economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that, over the course of 20 years, the bill would reduce federal deficits by about $900 billion, raise Americans\u2019 wages by 0.5 percent and increase the nation\u2019s gross domestic product by more than 5 percent. We now have two options in front of us. If the president goes with the status quo, we\u2019ll see yet another federal government shutdown \u2013 a move that could cost President Trump the House and Senate majorities in the November elections that he needs to govern effectively. But if President Trump brings his famous deal-making skills into play, he can solve a problem that his predecessors have been unable to solve. That would give him something worth tweeting about.",

Developing now, Monday, July 2,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY - FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE - TRUMP ON SUPREME PICK, ROE V. WADE ...\u00a0AND PUTTING DEMS ON ICE:\u00a0President Trump expects his next Supreme Court pick \u201cto go very quickly\u201d and says he is unlikely to ask his nominee\u2019s position on the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion rights case ... In a wide-ranging interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\"\u00a0Trump said abortion rights \"could very well end up\" being determined on a state-by-state basis after a new Supreme Court justice is seated, but the president said he \"probably\" would not ask his pick to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy how they would vote on Roe v. Wade.\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m putting conservative people on,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0Trump predicted the new Supreme Court nominee, whom he has vowed to name on July 9, would be approved by the Senate \"very quickly,\" with \"a lot of support.\" In the interview,\u00a0Trump also predicted\u00a0Democrats will be \u201cbeaten so badly\u201d in the midterm elections if they campaign on the policy of abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) -- just as the once-fringe call to scrap the agency is going mainstream among the left. In New York, socialist primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocked the party\u2019s establishment by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. In the days afterward, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio added their support to the cause. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif has said that the U.S. should consider \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d while Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., announced\u00a0he would be introducing a bill on Monday\u00a0to abolish the agency. DIVIDED DEMS FALL: Democrats appear to be cracking under the pressure of opposing President Trump, and party infighting is going public months before the midterm elections ...\u00a0\u00a0Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said Sunday that she was \"surprised\" by criticism from Democratic leaders over her statement that people should \"push back\" against members of the Trump administration over its immigration policy. Waters attracted criticism from Republicans last weekend after she told rally-goers in her Los Angeles congressional district that members of the public should confront members of the Trump administration and \"tell them they're not welcome.\" Waters made the remarks after White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left a different restaurant after protesters began shouting at her.\u00a0House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi distanced herself from Waters' remarks.\u00a0Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0took to the Senate floor to say that harassment of political opponents was \"not right\" and \"not American.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday bucked calls by fellow high-profile Democrats to abolish ICE, putting a damper on the far-left proposal that has gained mainstream traction in recent days.\u00a0\"We are always going to need immigration enforcement,\" Klobuchar said on ABC's \"This Week.\" POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO:\u00a0A left-wing populist who railed against President Trump's immigration policies\u00a0won a historic\u00a0victory in Mexico's presidential election Sunday night, with both of his main rivals conceding before the first official results were announced.... A late-night official quick count from electoral authorities forecast that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would win with between 53 percent and 53.8 percent of the vote, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years. Lopez Obrador, known popularly by the acronym \"AMLO,\" has long been the consensus front-runner in the race, having promised a \"transformation\" of a country plagued by violence and political scandal. While Lopez Obrador has railed against Mexico's \"mafia of power,\" he's saved some of his strongest words for Trump. He launched his presidential campaign in the border city of Ciudad Juarez and vowed that Mexico would reassert itself as a \"free, sovereign and independent\" nation. He has vowed that Mexico \"will never be the pi\u00f1ata of any foreign government\" and\u00a0ripped the Trump administration's policy of separating families who cross the border illegally as \"arrogant, racist and inhuman.\" He's also promised to roll back some of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's policies toward Central American migrants who cross Mexico's own southern border, saying that his government would no longer do Trump's \"dirty work.\" L.A.-BRON GOES HOLLYWOOD:\u00a0LeBron James has agreed to a four-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, his agency says ...\u00a0Klutch Sports Group announced that the contract would pay James a fully guaranteed $154 million. ESPN reported that the fourth year of the deal was a player option that James can decline in order to become a free agent again after the 2020-21 season. This is the third time in eight years that James has changed teams via free agency. He left the Cleveland Cavaliers following the 2010 season to go to the Miami Heat. He returned to Cleveland following the 2014 season. James isn't planning any more comments and there won't be a welcoming press conference or celebration in Los Angeles, a person familiar with his plans told The Associated Press.

Immigrants say President Donald Trump's administration has become almost everything they feared, but while they rally across the United States on May Day, their focus is less on huge turnout Tuesday than on the first Tuesday in November. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Immigrants say President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has become almost everything they feared, but while they rally across the United States on May Day, their focus is less on huge turnout Tuesday than on the first Tuesday in November. People were marching and holding other demonstrations for labor and immigrant rights from New York to Georgia to California on International Workers\u2019 Day, amid similar actions worldwide. \u201cThe Trump administration has made very clear that they\u2019ve declared war on the immigrant community on all levels,\u201d said Javier Valdes, co-executive director of the advocacy group Make the Road New York. Immigrant rights groups have joined in May Day activities for more than a decade, initially to push back against harsh legislative proposals and later to clamor for reform and legal status for immigrants in the country illegally who were brought to the U.S. as children or overstayed their visas. Now, they want to drive turnout in the midterm elections. Advocates hope voters target lawmakers who have pushed for measures that hurt immigrants and replace them with immigrant-friendly policymakers, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. \u201cElections have consequences, and the consequences for our community have been dire, and if we do not change the balance of power, we question our ability to remain free in this country,\u201d she said. Protesters still are taking aim at policy changes under Trump, including a country-specific travel ban, the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, high-profile detention and deportation efforts, and proposals to cut back the overall numbers of people allowed to immigrate permanently. Trump and his supporters say the enforcement and policy changes are needed for national security and economic benefits. Some of the new policies have gotten tangled up in court, and Trump hasn\u2019t secured funding for his coveted border wall with Mexico. After the rallies, immigrant rights groups will join LGBTQ, African-American and women\u2019s organizations this summer to push for the election of new leaders, Salas said, adding that they hope to see more support from Americans who aren\u2019t immigrants. \u201cIt is really a fundamental question about what kind of a country we\u2019re going to be,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, the question of immigration is a question about race, and it is also a question about real equality in this country.\u201d",

President Trump said Friday that a \"red wave\" is needed to pass an immigration bill in Congress, as he accused Democrats of \u201cdoing nothing but obstructing.\u201d \u201cRepublicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cDems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\u201d Trump's call comes after GOP leaders pulled a major immigration bill from consideration late Thursday, pushing a vote into next week. HOUSE GOP ABRUPTLY SCRAPS PLANNED VOTE ON TROUBLED IMMIGRATION BILL, SAYING IT COULD PASS NEXT WEEK Congressional Republicans had earlier failed to pass a more conservative bill. The more moderate, compromise measure was expected to have a requirement that employers use E-Verify to check the legal status of employees. Leaders have sought to assuage both conservatives and moderates in their party, while also meeting the president\u2019s four pillars: a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, border security including a wall, an end to so-called \u201cchain migration\u201d and an end to the diversity lottery visa. A sticking point for conservatives is that while the compromise funds the wall, it also offers a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young illegal immigrants. The conservative bill offers only the 700,000 recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program the ability to apply for indefinite renewals of non-immigrant status. Democrats have rejected both bills. \"It is not a compromise,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters. \"It may be a compromise with the devil, but it is not a compromise with the Democrats.\u201d Trump on Wednesday extended an invitation to Democrats to the White House to discuss immigration and said \u201cit takes two to tango,\u201d although he had scathing words for what he called the \u201cextremist, open border\u201d lawmakers. \u201cThey don't care about the children...they don't care about the problems. They don't care about anything. All they do is say, 'Obstruct and let's see how we do\u2019 because they have no policies that are any good,\u201d he said ahead of a Cabinet meeting. TRUMP SLAMS 'OPEN BORDER' DEMOCRATS, BLASTS MEXICO ON HEELS OF EXEC ORDER On Thursday, he echoed that rhetoric, but without the invitation for Democrats to come to the table. \u201cDems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!\u201d he tweeted. He renewed his criticism of the filibuster in the Senate, which requires 60 votes to break. \u201cEven if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won\u2019t give votes for political reasons & because they don\u2019t care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R\u2019s!\u201d Trump's tweets come after a fiery week in which rhetoric on both sides has escalated on the question of the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which prosecutes all illegal border crossers. That in turn led to an increase in the number of children being separated from their parents. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday ending the practice and allowing families to be detained together, but Democrats have since pushed for ending what they described as \u201cindefinite detention\u201d of families at the border.

            "article_content": "Oprah Winfrey fires up supporters at a Georgia campaign rally for Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and denies that her appearance is linked to a future presidential run. Oprah Winfrey made her 2018 midterm campaign debut on Thursday, hitting the stump for Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia\u2019s heated gubernatorial contest \u2013 the latest celebrity or political heavyweight bringing their star power to the final stretch going into Election Day. To thunderous cheers redolent of those from her famously effusive studio audiences, Winfrey took the stage in Marietta, Ga., to back Abrams as the candidate who \u201ccares about the things that matter\u201d \u2013 ticking off her stances on Medicaid expansion, environmental protection and \u201ccommon-sense gun control.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to run. I\u2019m not trying to test any waters,\u201d she insisted, taking care to blunt any potential headlines on presidential ambitions (she claims to have none). \u201cI\u2019m here today because of Stacey Abrams.\u201d In striking terms, Winfrey urged Georgians to exercise their right to vote: \u201cI\u2019m here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed \u2026 for the right, for equality at the polls. \u2026 I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain.\u201d The media mogul and the gubernatorial nominee later embraced as Winfrey turned over the microphone to the candidate. The appearance is one of many aimed at turning up turnout going into Election Day. Abrams, who would be the first black female governor of any state, has generated a particular amount of star power in her race against Republican Brian Kemp. Comedian Will Ferrell also swung into Georgia this week to boost Abrams\u2019 candidacy. President Trump and former President Barack Obama, too, are planning to hit Georgia, to support their respective parties\u2019 nominees. And while Winfrey was campaigning for Abrams on Thursday, Vice President Pence was hitting the stump for Kemp. The blitz underscores the high stakes in one of the defining contests of next week\u2019s midterms, as Abrams vies to make history while Kemp tries to maintain the GOP\u2019s dominance in a state Democrats believe is on the cusp of becoming a presidential battleground. Trump\u2019s scheduled appearance Sunday sidelined the last debate scheduled between Kemp and Abrams. Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV confirmed late Wednesday that a long-planned matchup at 5 p.m. Sunday had been canceled and would not be rescheduled before polls open Tuesday. Obama will appear with Abrams on Friday at a cluster of historically black colleges near downtown Atlanta. Multiple polls show a statistical dead heat between Kemp and Abrams. Fox News\u2019 Power Rankings rates the race as a toss-up. CLICK FOR RACE RATINGS AND FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE Both candidates have run consistent appeals to their respective bases. Kemp has embraced Trump and echoed the president\u2019s hard-line policies on immigration, and he\u2019s focused much of his campaigning in the state\u2019s more conservative pockets beyond metro Atlanta. Meanwhile, former President Jimmy Carter, an Abrams supporter and former Georgia governor, garnered significant attention this week with a personal plea that Kemp resign as secretary of state, Georgia\u2019s chief elections official, to ensure public confidence in the results of what\u2019s expected to be a close race. Comedian Dave Chappelle also has made waves by campaigning for his longtime friend Ben Jealous, the former NAACP leader now running for governor in Maryland. Jealous trails in the race against GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, but Chappelle tried to boost the Democratic nominee at a University of Maryland event earlier this month. Trump and Obama, meanwhile, are both going on a spree of campaign appearances across the country. The sitting president will be in Missouri Thursday evening, where Republican Josh Hawley is facing Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in one of the season\u2019s tightest Senate contests. Trump later heads to West Virginia and Indiana, while Obama heads to Georgia and Florida, where he\u2019ll boost Sen. Bill Nelson and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum, who is running for governor. On Sunday, the former president will be in Gary, Indiana, for Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is among the most endangered Senate Democrats, and in his hometown of Chicago for J.B. Pritzker, who is the favorite in Illinois\u2019 race for governor. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Developing now, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - DEMS OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT WINNING THE HOUSE? - \u00a0As House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi confidently predicts Democratic victories in next week's midterms, at least one major political oddsmaker is giving her a boost: Cook Political Report now says Democrats could win as many as 40 seats in the House ... \u00a0Dave Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan report, tweeted this week that the unit is revising its outlook to reflect a Democratic gain of 30-40 seats, up from 25-35. He warned that the outlook could change again before Tuesday. FOX News\u2019 Power Rankings reflect a strong Democratic advantage in the race for the House, but not a lock. Even some Democrats are cautious about the pitfalls of overconfidence, as veteran operatives remind the party of curtain-measuring in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, which Donald Trump won. Talk show host Stephen Colbert said as much when Nancy Pelosi predicted on his show earlier this week, \"We will win.\" She is expected to seek the speakership again if she's right. The \"Trump Factor\" is undeniable. The president is expected to make final campaign pitches and give a boost to GOP candidates with rallies over the next three days in the following places : West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. On Thursday, President Trump was in Columbia, Mo., to support Republican Josh Hawley, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill. A FOX News poll published this week shows the pair deadlocked in support from likely voters. - Reported by Adam Shaw and Brooke Singman TRUMP VS. OPRAH: A highly anticipated showdown between President Trump and Oprah Winfrey will take place -- on the gubernatorial campaign trail in Georgia ... Winfrey -- who is a rumored potential 2020 presidential candidate, despite her denials -- joined Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Ga., on Thursday and urged voters to make history next Tuesday. Abrams is attempting to become the first black female governor in U.S. history, and is in a close race with Republican Brian Kemp. Winfrey praised Abrams as a \"changemaker\" and drew cheers when she said she's a registered independent who was not in Georgia at anyone's request. She knocked on doors with Abrams, to the delight of some starstruck residents. Winfrey's visit came the day before former President Barack Obama's scheduled rally for Abrams on Friday. Vice President Mike Pence made three campaign stops for Kemp on Thursday. President Trump, who has endorsed Kemp, will look to give him a boost in a rally in Macon, Ga., on Sunday. TROOP-READY AT THE BORDER: The first 100 active-duty troops have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border to provide support for Border Patrol agents as a caravan of migrants slowly makes its way northward from Central America, a Defense Department official told Fox News on Thursday evening ... The troops are doing initial assessments at the port of entry in McAllen, Texas. The official said there are about 2,600 troops now at staging bases, largely in Texas, with several thousand more expected to flow in through the weekend and move into California and Arizona. The Pentagon said more than 7,000 active-duty troops are being sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, with more possible. President Trump has said the number could reach 15,000. - Reported by Frank Miles TRUMP TARGETS FRAUDULENT ASYLUM-SEEKERS: President Trump, in response to what he called the \"crisis at our southern border\" and a surge of fraudulent asylum claims in recent years, announced on Thursday that his administration will soon require asylum-seekers to \"lawfully present themselves\" at a port of entry ... The move appeared designed to prevent many members of the leading Central American migrant caravan -- which now numbers approximately 4,000, down from a high of 7,200 -- from making asylum claims if and when they reach the U.S.-Mexico border. Asylum claims made by migrants caught crossing the border illegally would seemingly be summarily denied under Trump's proposal. The asylum clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives to the U.S. may apply for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution, and Trump's decision was likely to prompt immediate federal court challenges. In his remarks, Trump called the thousands of migrants in the approaching caravans from Central America \"not legitimate asylum-seekers\" because most of them have not decided to remain in Mexico and pursue asylum there. - Reported by Gregg Re (@gregg_re on Twitter) JOBS REPORT: GOP MIDTERM SECRET WEAPON? - With the midterm elections just days away and U.S. unemployment already at its lowest level in decades, forecasters expect another solid set of numbers when the U.S. jobs report for October is released Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET ... Businesses are advertising for a record number of job openings and several companies, including Amazon and Walmart, have hiked their minimum wages in a bid to lure and retain employees. The jobs report comes after U.S. stocks were hammered throughout the month of October. - Reported by FOX Business' Thomas Barrabi #GOOGLEWALKOUT: Thousands of Google employees walked out at company locations worldwide on Thursday to protest sexual harassment, pay inequality and a workplace culture that they say dismisses victims and tolerates abuse of power ...\u00a0\"We were disgusted by the details of the recent New York Times article, which provided the latest example of a culture of complicity, dismissiveness, and support for perpetrators in the face of sexual harassment, misconduct, and abuse of power,\" organizers of the #GoogleWalkout said in a statement to FOX News. \"Sadly, this is part of a longstanding problem, one further amplified by systemic racism. We know this culture well.\" In New York City, throngs of Google employees filled a nearby park to capacity, carrying signs that said \"Times Up Tech\" and \"Workers\u2019 Rights Are Women's Rights.\" The organizers, who received the support of CEO Sundar Pichai for their protest across 40-plus offices globally in an email late Tuesday, have a list of five demands. - Reported by Christopher Carbone (@christocarbone on Twitter) AS SEEN ON FOX NEWS HIGH STAKES IN THE MIDTERMS - \u00a0\"Enough is enough. We cannot turn any part of this government over to these radical, hardcore Democrats and their mouthpieces in the media. ... You sick of being called Nazis? You sick of being called racists? You sick of being called white supremacists? Then you need to vote.\" \u00a0\u2013 Mark Levin, host of \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" explaining on \"Hannity\" why the midterm elections on Tuesday are so important.

            "article_content": "The midterms were never going to be fought over Russia or Kavanaugh. This year, the three big issues are immigration, the economy and nationalism. Tuesday is the day, as you well know, of the midterm elections and the noise levels are becoming almost unbearable. Everyone is posturing and trying to bully you into voting for this or that candidate and it\u2019s all very loud. But pause for a second and consider what you are not hearing. What is missing from this cacophony? For starters, there is hardly\u00a0a word about Russia. Remember that dastardly Vladimir Putin and the collusion plot that hacked our democracy? Whatever happened to that? And while we are at it, what about Brett Kavanaugh? What about his high school yearbook and his purported teenage drinking problem and those gang rapes that he supposedly committed? What about those? Those were the biggest stories in the world not so long ago, 24/7 on the other cable channels and those stories will define this election and it defines\u00a0the entire historical era. Everyone on television told us that. Now, these are just fading memories. It turns out they were sideshows. The midterm elections were never going to be fought over Vladimir Putin or Brett Kavanaugh or just about anything else we spent most of our time talking about. This election, like all elections, was going to turn on issues that actually affect the life of the country. This year there are three big issues: immigration, the economy, and\u00a0nationalism. The first is the most obvious. Immigration determines who lives next door to you. It determines who works in your office and who chooses your leaders. There is nothing more fundamental in any country than the\u00a0question of citizenship. Whatever Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know, he definitely knows this. He\u2019s been talking about immigration for three years now. And all that time official Washington has been trying to make him stop. \"The way that Donald\u00a0Trump has been conducting this campaign, attacking brown people and making up stories about possibly George Soros funding caravans that are still 800 miles away to try to scare white voters,\" as heard on MSNBC. In other words, shut up, racist. But Trump will not shut up so they have changed tactics. The new line is, immigration doesn\u2019t really matter. The threat is hyped and only dumb people and bigots care about borders. By the way, parties of both sides seem to believe this. Paul Ryan's office, let it be known to Politico yesterday, that the Speaker of the House begged the president to stop yammering about the caravan from Central America and start talking about something important like Paul Ryan's tax bill. That\u2019s preemptive blame shifting obviously. If the Republicans lose on Tuesday, Paul Ryan can point the finger at Trump rather than accept responsibility for not funding the wall that voters said they wanted. But it\u2019s also a ludicrous position to take because it\u2019s untrue. Immigration does matter. If, for example, Arizona and Texas go to the Democrats today, immigration will be the reason. Those are Republican states until the population changed. So no matter how much you lie about it, immigration is inherently important and voters understand that. If you want people to stop worrying about the border, then you should secure the border and it won\u2019t be an issue. People are also worried about other things that Washington doesn\u2019t notice or think\u00a0is important. Here in Washington, the economy is synonymous with the stock market. Markets have boomed for 10 years and their entire cable channels are devoted to chronicling that boom. Here in Washington the assumption is the economy must also be booming but the truth is after a decade of stocks going higher, the effects, the positive ones are still not very obvious outside of select zip codes on the coast. In middle America people understand they will most certainly make less than their parents made which will be a reversal of the American dream. They know they won\u2019t be able to buy cars or buy houses, they are not getting married or having kids. Our current economic system makes it more difficult than ever than families to form. Washington should be absolutely panicked about this. It is the most basic sign of failure, their failure, but nobody in either party seems to care. Their answer is to import new families from other countries. So maybe it\u2019s not so surprising that young people say they like socialism? Because what we have now is not working for them, and unless we fix that we may get actual socialism which will be a disaster. And that leads to the third issue of this election which is nationalism. Despite what you are hearing day in and day out, nationalism is not a racial category. It has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. Nationalism is the belief that leaders ought to put the Interest of their own countries above those of other countries. It\u2019s very straightforward. The president himself declared himself the nationalist of the other night: \"They have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned. It\u2019s called a nationalist. And I said really, we are not supposed to use that word. You know what\u00a0I am? I\u2019m a nationalist.\" Trump is a nationalist so in normal times. The president of the United States announcing that his main goal is protecting the United States would not qualify as news because until about 10 minutes ago\u00a0about every nation-state throughout history has been a nationalist threat definition. Franklin Roosevelt was a nationalist and so was Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Yet suddenly it\u2019s an abomination. Nationalist. Use that word.\u00a0It\u2019s a favorite of the alt-right and It\u2019s loaded with undertones. And some use it as a slur against those in the administration often with anti-semitic overtones, which happens to make the president come right out and embrace nationalism openly. And claim that mantle. What has happened here? So nationalism is now\u00a0profanity. Twitter and Facebook will surely be banning that term if they haven\u2019t already. But why? What exactly is going on here? Why are they so intent on stamping out not just a concept but the very word? It\u2019s simple. What you are watching is people protecting their own prerogatives. Globalization which is the opposite of nationalism has caused an enormous transfer of wealth from the American middle class to what we used to call the third world to other countries. American\u00a0factories closed but the jobs didn't go away they just went to other countries. Now some Americans got very rich from this and others got poorer. Rather than admit what actually happened though, the people who got rich are trying to make the people who got poorer\u00a0shut up and stop complaining about it. A borderless world has been hugely profitable for them and that\u2019s why they support it. Nationalism is their kryptonite so they must stop it. They scream racism and hope that nationalism will go away. Will it go away? Probably not. Because the core idea is appealing to people, all people in all countries over all time. People want leaders who are, above all, on their side. They always have wanted that and they always will want that. That\u2019s what we know. What we don\u2019t know is what\u2019s going to happen in the elections Tuesday. We won\u2019t even guess, nothing would surprise us. We know what the real issues are because they are obvious.

            "article_content": "U.S. southern border officials said Wednesday that the number of people illegally trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico skyrocketed in May compared to one year ago. (iStock) The number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. could be double what the generally accepted estimate is, according to a study released Friday by researchers from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The U.S. government and most groups put the number of undocumented immigrants at around 11 million to 12 million, but researchers from Yale and MIT give a \u201cconservative\u201d number of 16. 7 million in 2016 and an average of 22 million, according to Yale Insights. Bloomberg reported\u00a0the study could validate claims made by President Trump that the real number on undocumented immigrants in the country is as high as 30 million and could offer ammunition for the president and immigration critics to take a\u00a0harder stance\u00a0on the issue. Researchers used data\u00a0on deportations, border apprehensions and visa overstays along with death rates and immigration rates to arrive at their conclusion. The estimate is based on data from 1990 to 2016. \u201cOur original idea was just to do a sanity check on the existing number,\u201d\u00a0said Yale\u2019s Edward Kaplan, who conducted the study with colleague Jonathan Feinstein\u00a0and MIT\u2019s Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi. \u201cInstead of a number which was smaller, we got a number that was 50 percent higher. That caused us to scratch our heads.\u201d \u201cOur original idea was just to do a sanity check on the existing number. Instead of a number which was smaller, we got a number that was 50 percent higher.\" \u201cThere\u2019s a number that everybody quotes,\" Feinstein said, \"but when you actually dig down and say, \u2018What is it based on?,\u2019 you find it\u2019s based on one very specific survey and possibly an approach that has some difficulties. So we went in and just took a very different approach.\u201d But Kaplan said the findings could undercut one of the most common arguments for restricting the flow of immigrants into the country: criminality. He said the data could suggest the crime rate for undocumented immigrants may be even lower than believed. \u201cYou have the same number of crimes but now spread over twice as many people as was believed before, which right away means that\u00a0the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is essentially half whatever was previously believed,\" he said. With respect to the notice that undocumented immigrants take jobs away from U.S. citizens, Kaplan said \u201cthe fact that there are actually more people here than we thought before might explain that, but you can also look at it the other way: Whatever job displacement there has been happened with twice as many undocumented immigrants as we thought. That causes you to rethink just how much pressure there is.\u201d The 11.3 million estimate widely cited is based on survey data, researchers wrote. \u201cThe 11.3 million number is extrapolated from the Census Bureau\u2019s annual\u00a0American Community Survey,\u201d MIT\u2019s Fazel-Zarandi said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the only method used for the last three decades.\u201d The findings could add fuel to the already hotly contested immigration debate. However, the researchers said their goal in sifting through the date was not political. \u201cOf course, our findings will get pulled and tugged in many ways, but our purpose is just to provide better information,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThis paper is not oriented towards politics or policy. I want to be very clear: This paper is about coming up with a better estimate of an important number.\u201d",

(Wichita Police/Dallas County Sheriff's Office) A woman who faked a pregnancy for several months was found guilty on Tuesday of killing her former co-worker and kidnapping the victim's newborn baby with the intent to raise the child as her own. Yesenia Sesmas, 36, an illegal immigrant who was living in Dallas at the time, drove to Wichita, Kan. to shoot 27-year-old Laura Abarca on Nov. 17, 2016, and kidnap 6-day-old Sophia Gonzales. The baby was found safe two days later in Sesmas' Dallas apartment and was returned to relatives. Jurors deliberated for less than three hours on Tuesday and found Sesmas guilty of first-degree premeditated and intentional murder, kidnapping and interference with parental custody. \u201cWe really wanted to go through this trial and have justice. And I think that happened today,\u201d Jose Abarca, the victim\u2019s older brother,\u00a0told the Wichita Eagle. During the trial, prosecutors said that Sesmas faked a pregnancy for months after suffering a miscarriage and, when she found out\u00a0Abarca had given birth, drove to Wichita to kill her and take the baby. The two women had worked together at a Wichita restaurant years earlier. Sesmas was in the country illegally and was arrested the summer before the killing for threatening another Wichita woman and trying to hold the woman\u2019s two daughters for ransom. But she was mistakenly released from custody because of a bureaucratic mix-up. WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING MOTHER AND STEALING HER BABY IS FIGHTING EXTRADITION U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said at the time it did not receive the July 25 list of arrests from the Sedgwick County sheriff's office showing Yesenia Sesmas' name on it until the following day, and by that time she had already been released from local custody, the\u00a0Associated Press reported at the time. The agency would have asked that she be detained if Sesmas, a Mexican national, had still been in jail, a spokesman told the AP at the time. During the six-day trial, prosecutors focused on the 36-year-old's intentions, including how during the faking of her pregnancy Sesmas prepared for a new baby. Sesmas even had a baby shower and had reached a point where she \"was either going to have to come home with a baby\" or explain her lies to those who knew her, according to the Eagle. \"When she walked into that apartment on Nov. 17, 2016, there were only two ways for this to end,\" Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said. Sesmas went back to Texas thinking \"she would wake up and raise that baby and her life would begin,\" he said. KANSAS KILLING, BABY ABDUCTION SUSPECT LIVING IN US ILLEGALLY In a jailhouse interview with\u00a0KUVN-TV, Sesmas said Abarca had agreed to hand over the baby to her, but during an apparent dispute she said she accidentally shot her. Public defender Jason Smartt called the killing \"unplanned and spontaneous,\" according to the Eagle. \"She didn't know that (the gun) was going to fire, and she was surprised when it did,\" he said. Sesmas faces life in prison plus the possibility of additional time when she is sentenced on July 13. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Back in June in Sandusky, Ohio, about 65 miles west of my home here in Cleveland, there was a huge federal raid involving about 200 agents on Corso\u2019s Flower and Garden Center. The combined ICE-led operation rounded up 114 undocumented immigrants workers; some of whom had been here on and off for decades. The raid lay bare the essential dilemma facing those attempting to enforce our immigration policy. It took a gigantic federal operation to round up and hold for deportation people who were working hard and attempting to do the right thing. No matter how you slice it, our massive, legitimate, law-enforcement operation punished good people trying to work and provide for their families. Bear the Corso raid in mind when you try to wrap your mind around the current crisis involving the Caravan of Migrants doggedly heading our way from Guatemala and Honduras, trudging through Mexico and causing great consternation and angry condemnation in Washington, D.C. It would be easy to support the deployment of the U.S. military and other draconian \u201csolutions\u201d to the migrant crisis generally, and the caravan specifically, if the marchers were gang bangers or ISIS recruits. Manifestly most are not, (unless ISIS or MS-13 is recruiting crying, hungry three-year olds). Even the most hardened anti-immigrant pundit cannot justify actions taken to stop the caravan by saying it is mostly about national security. It is not. It is, in my opinion, fear of our nation being over-run by poor, hungry, brown people in sufficient numbers to change our basic national character, which motivates most critics of this caravan and, more broadly, illegal immigration. What would the Army do against a caravan of civilians, many of them women and children, anyway? Shoot them? The president senses that most Americans are responding very negatively to the caravan, and even see it as an existential threat to the nation. He has even stated that he will, if necessary, use our military to stop the caravan from crossing over the southern border. In doing so he ignores the principle known as Posse Comitatus, which by law, prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws. What would the Army do against a caravan of civilians, many of them women and children, anyway? Shoot them? The Republicans see this caravan as the perfect issue to rally the base and insure a big, robust turnout for the mid-term elections now two weeks away. Democrats would like to pretend that the caravan is just a giant day-care center filled with needy children that the heartless president doesn\u2019t care about. This crisis calls for reason, patience, compassion and an immediate parlay among the affected nations in Central America, Mexico and the United States. In exchange for leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in this country--who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents--pro-immigration advocates, like me, should announce our support for President Trump\u2019s border wall. It will help restore order along the southern border, and mitigate the hysteria currently gripping the national immigration debate and tainting the mid-term elections. But neither building the president\u2019s border wall, nor compassion for the DREAMERS already here, will fully solve the crisis of immigration. We are the world\u2019s richest country. We are located adjacent to some of the world\u2019s poorest and most violent countries. As long as that imbalance exists, they will want to come here. And neither the Army nor the wall will stop them all.",

Saturday in the park with Hillary Clinton turned out to be a chance to listen to the former Democratic presidential nominee take aim, once again, at President Donald Trump. Clinton's appearance in New York City's Central Park came during OZY Fest 2018, a two-day music and culture event sponsored by Ozy, a digital media organization. In a live discussion in the park\u2019s Rumsey Playfield, Clinton sat down with Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs and founder of Emerson Collective, a nonprofit advocate of liberal causes that led the event, Business Insider reported. \"We have decades and decades of proof that absorbing immigrants, creating opportunities ... and opening the doors has been to our advantage. And to those who want to turn the clock back on that and say somehow that it has hurt America, then they're not walking around with their eyes open.\" Clinton lambasted Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policies as well as his widely criticized summit in Helsinki last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Decades of \u201cabsorbing immigrants\u201d and \u201copening the doors,\u201d Clinton suggested, \u201chas been to our advantage.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, right, speaks with Laurene Powell Jobs at OZY Fest in Central Park, New York City, July 21, 2018.

Nixon\u2019s proposal to \u201cabolish ICE\u201d has become a rallying cry for the far left, which has leveled sharp criticisms against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it carries out Trump administration policies.

For voters across America, this year's midterm elections represent something far greater than whatever Senate and House races appear on their ballots. It is a referendum on President Donald Trump and the venomous political culture that many blame for gridlock in Congress and a recent spate of hate crimes and politically motivated attacks. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File) LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2013 Michael Gregoire marched along a downtown sidewalk in the tense days before the midterm elections, waving a hand-painted sign at passing traffic: \"DEFEAT REPUBLICANS 2018.\" \"The survival of the country is going to depend on this election,\" he said as another man stopped for a moment to argue. The strangers faced each other from opposite edges of the great American divide, Democrat versus Republican, both convinced the election is among the most consequential in their lifetimes and that they must save the nation from the other side. \"I'm voting for Donald Trump,\" Stuart Kanter said. \"He's not on the ticket. But, in a way, actually he is.\" President Donald Trump looms large over Tuesday's election, which is expected to draw historic numbers to the polls and will determine which party controls Congress. For Gregoire and Kanter \u2014 and for voters across the country \u2014 the election represents something far greater than whatever Senate and House races appear on their ballots. It is a competition for the soul of America \u2014 a referendum on Trump and the venomous political culture that many blame for gridlock in Congress and a recent spate of hate crimes and politically motivated attacks. Less than two weeks ago in this city, a white man gunned down two African-American shoppers at a grocery store in what police described as a racially motivated attack. Days later, an avid Trump supporter was arrested for mailing pipe bombs to prominent critics of the president, all of whom Trump routinely derides as \"evil\" and \"un-American.\" The next day, another gunman opened fire in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, massacring 11 worshippers and telling police \"all these Jews need to die.\" Don Albrecht, a 75-year-old accountant and Republican who voted for Trump in 2016, lives blocks away from the Louisville grocery store where two people died. He'd pulled into the parking lot minutes after the gunfire erupted, saw the police cars and shaken employees, and felt like the country's poisonous political climate had landed in his backyard. He wishes he could take back his vote for Trump. \"He has diarrhea of the mouth and diarrhea of the brain. He's just so irresponsible,\" said Albrecht, who worries Trump's embrace of the far-right is remaking his party. \"I don't think the American public is going to put up with it. I think there's going to be a big backlash against Republicans because of this divisiveness.\" He's undecided going into Election Day. He can't remember ever voting for a Democrat but said he might this time in protest. Other Trump voters remain staunchly behind him, and plan to choose Republican candidates to help him make good on his pledges, including vows to implement more hardline immigration policies. \"I want to see the wall go up,\" said Joe Spirko, 57, as he peddled Trump flags outside of one of the president's rallies in Florida last week. \"Since Trump come along, I feel a lot better.\" Trump has stepped up his rhetoric on immigration ahead of the elections, focusing on a caravan of Central American migrants heading toward the United States. Trump and his backers have called it \"an invasion\" \u2014 though the group of a few thousand people, including mothers and children, remains hundreds of miles away \u2014 and suggested without proof that there are criminals and terrorists in the crowd of those fleeing violence and poverty. In a White House speech, the president said he would sign an order preventing border-crossers from claiming asylum, a legally questionable proposition, and said he'd told military troops he's mobilizing to the border to respond to thrown rocks like they were \"rifles.\" Julie Hoeppner, a 67-year-old psychologist in Indiana, voted early for Republican candidates, also citing illegal immigration as a primary concern. A friend recently sent Hoeppner a photo of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island with a note that said: \"For our ancestors, this is their caravan.\" Hoeppner didn't respond but thought to herself that her ancestors arrived legally. \"Which is a big difference,\" she said. \"They didn't come trying to storm the border.\" Pedro Panelo, the 21-year-old president of the College Republicans at Wheaton College in Illinois, is frustrated immigration became a last-minute political football, because the issue is more complex than what either Democrats or Republicans make it out to be. Panelo, the son of a Mexican immigrant, said migrants shouldn't be demonized, but he stopped short of criticizing the president, and plans to vote for Republican candidates who could help push Trump's agenda. \"When it comes to his actions, I'm not a huge fan of his tweets,\" Panelo said. \"But what I say is look what he's done for the country and not always what he's said on Twitter.\" He said he's felt an extraordinary level of enthusiasm for this election among his fellow students. Young people, who historically sit out of midterm elections, and women are both expected to be pivotal forces Tuesday. In Georgia, Democratic campaign volunteer Adrienne White said she struggled to recruit volunteers ahead of the 2016 presidential election but that it's been easy this year, especially among women. In Pittsburgh, where residents just finished burying those gunned down at the Tree of Life synagogue, some voters saw their Election Day decisions as a way to send a message that the country is headed down a dark and dangerous path. \"This is probably the most important election in the past 100 years. This will turn the tables,\" said Barbara Villa, 71, who with her husband planted a crop of \"Vote Blue\" signs outside their home. Rose Cathleen Bagin, 77, lives in the same neighborhood as the synagogue. She lashed a sign to her front porch reading \"VOTE FOR GUN CONTROL,\" and she is stunned every time she sees the crowd at Trump rallies on television cheering for his divisive language. \"I can't stand the terrible things he says and the terrible things he's doing,\" said Bagin, who plans to vote Democratic Tuesday. \"I'm terrified. We're going to a place I just don't understand.\" ___ Also contributing were AP reporters Allen G.

            "article_content": "City opens registration to select non-citizens for local elections. San Francisco is permitting \u201cundocumented immigrants,\u201d as political correctness demands we label them, to register to vote this November in local school board elections. Who doubts this is the first step by the left and Democrats toward full voting rights in state and eventually in federal elections? The claim by lawyers will be that it is discriminatory to allow undocumented immigrants to vote in local and state elections and not for members of Congress and for president. At bottom this is what the entire immigration debate is about. The former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was interviewed last week on Fox News. Thomas Homan had some important things to say about calls by the left to dismantle the agency. \u201cWhat's incredible,\u201d Homan said, \u201cis these politicians, members of the legislature, would much rather abolish a law enforcement agency than fix the law. ... ICE is enforcing the laws they enacted.\u201d That\u2019s because politicians, who often pass laws that exempt themselves, care more about their re-election than they do about having laws they passed enforced. Homan responded to the narrative promoted by Democrats and the major media that the overwhelming number of people arrested by ICE are innocents seeking a better life in America: \u201cWhat's incredible is these politicians, members of the legislature, would much rather abolish a law enforcement agency than fix the law. ... ICE is enforcing the laws they enacted.\u201d \u201cPeople want to ignore the data and the fact that ... 89 percent of everybody we arrested last year had a criminal history, either a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges,\u201d Homan said. \u201cWe are prioritizing against the criminals. And abolishing ICE, there are going to be (fewer) criminals locked up. Over 100,000 criminal aliens have been arrested this year walking the streets of this country. That wouldn\u2019t happen if ICE wasn\u2019t there.\u201d About a recent anti-ICE protest in Oregon, Homan said: \u201cI mean, to have protesters come and try to get in the middle of us doing our job, we had an office in Portland shut down for over a week. That means criminals weren\u2019t being arrested, child predators weren\u2019t being arrested, victims of child trafficking and sex trafficking weren\u2019t being rescued, drug traffickers weren't being arrested.\u201d Sounds like good material for a Republican campaign ad. The media and Democrats (and even some weak-kneed Republicans) have been focusing on children separated from their \u201cparents,\u201d though there are questions about their actual relationships. About that, Homan said: \u201cIf anybody wants to look to who to blame about child separations on the border, Congress needs to look in the mirror. I went up to (Capitol) Hill, along (with) the head of CBP and CIS, and told them loopholes need to be fixed. One of the loopholes is the Flores Settlement agreement, which would allow us to detain families together in a dorm setting until they see a judge. But they failed to repair it. They failed to address it. They don't want to do their job. It\u2019s much easier pointing the fingers at law enforcement.\u201d Here are some questions I would pose to the broadcast networks CNN and MSNBC: 1) Why have so few in the mainstream media spoken to Homan, and why aren\u2019t you overpaid journalists asking some of the questions he is asking? 2) Who are these demonstrators who show up at ICE offices, at the border with Mexico and in other places? How do they get there, and who pays for their signs, hotel rooms, transportation and food? Are any of them being paid? 3) Do they have jobs, and if they do, how do they get time off to demonstrate? How many bosses would allow that? Not only is Congress failing to do its job, the major media are failing to do theirs. For Democrats, it\u2019s a perfect cover for their ultimate goal: importing votes.",

            "article_content": "President Trump addresses illegal immigration and border security. President Trump announced in a lengthy speech\u00a0at the White House on Thursday afternoon that, in response to what he called\u00a0the \"crisis at our southern border\" and a surge of fraudulent asylum claims in recent years, his administration will soon require asylum-seekers\u00a0to \"lawfully present themselves\" at a port of entry. The move appeared designed to prevent many members of the leading Central American migrant caravan -- which now numbers approximately 4,000, down from a high of 7,200 -- from making asylum claims if and when they reach the U.S. border. Asylum claims made by migrants caught crossing the border illegally would seemingly be summarily denied under Trump's proposal. The asylum clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act says that anyone who arrives to the U.S. may apply for asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution, and\u00a0Trump's decision was likely to prompt immediate federal court challenges. In his remarks, Trump called the thousands of migrants in the approaching caravans from Central America\u00a0\"not legitimate asylum-seekers\" because most of them have not\u00a0decided to remain in Mexico and pursue\u00a0asylum\u00a0there. \"Asylum is not a program for people living in poverty,\" he said. The president also issued something of a warning to members of the caravan, including those who reportedly threw rocks at members of the Mexican police this week. \"We will consider that a firearm,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"We will consider that the maximum we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently. .... We're not going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.\" Asked by a reporter to clarify if U.S. troops might fire on the caravan, Trump responded, \"I hope not, I hope not -- but it's the military.\" \"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.\" The president's statement\u00a0marked his latest major policy pronouncement on illegal immigration with just days to go before the Nov. 6 midterm elections, following his decision to send\u00a0thousands of troops to the U.S. border and his push to end birthright citizenship, which he said could be accomplished by executive order. Trump said Thursday he would issue a \"comprehensive\" executive order next week on immigration matters, including his asylum plan. \"If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow -- and you see that's what's happening now,\" Trump said. SESSIONS SAYS 'VAST MAJORITY' OF ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE INVALID, ANNOUNCES NEW RULES TO CUT DOWN ON ASYLUM CLAIMS In a statement, Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, condemned the president's announcement. \"If he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry, that plan is illegal,\" Jadwat said. \"What is clear from the timing and vague nature of today\u2019s remarks is that he is simply trying to\u00a0inflame his base in the final run-up to the\u00a0midterms.\u201d Trump and other administration officials have long encouraged those seeking asylum to come through legal ports of entry. However, many migrants may be unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged. Immigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at ports of entry citing overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have grown especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people typically waiting five weeks to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time. A woman holding her baby hitches a ride on the fender of a tanker in Niltepec, Mexico, on Tuesday. (AP) Migrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked since 2010,\u00a0and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Detention facilities are also nearly at their maximum capacity; Trump on Thursday\u00a0said more are being constructed, and that illegal immigrants will be held in \"massive cities of tents.\" Administration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. On Thursday, Trump said human trafficking -- in which \"the lowest scum on Earth ... steal children\" -- has hit unprecedented levels, in part because of lax asylum\u00a0policies. \"We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally -- we won't allow it,\" Trump said. \"Mass uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful law-abiding immigrants already living here, who followed the rules and waited their turn.\" Once illegal immigrants apply for asylum, even if their claims are fraudulent, they previously have been allowed into the U.S. pending the adjudication of their asylum claims -- which require a credible fear of imminent persecution based on a limited number of factors, such as political or religious belief,\u00a0in order to be upheld. Most asylum claims often fail to meet this high legal standard after they are reviewed by aslyum judges,\u00a0and\u00a0only about 20 percent of applicants are approved. \"They never show up at the trials,\" Trump said, referring to people who claim asylum and then are released into the country. \"They never come back, they're never seen again.\" ASYLUM CLAIMS OVERWHELM U.S. SYSTEM -- A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS The president also emphasized that children were separated from their parents at the border under President Obama's administration -- although those separations occured with less frequency than they did under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which dramatically ramped up the criminal prosecutions for illegal border crossers that had legally necessitated the separations.\u00a0Trump has since signed an executive order to keep parents and children together after they're caught illegally crossing the border. Trump's comments came hours after the leading\u00a0caravan trying to make its way to the U.S. border\u00a0failed in its efforts to convince the Mexican government to offer dozens of buses to speed up their journey northward. On Thursday, Trump again characterized the caravan as\u00a0an \"invasion\" that has \"overrun the Mexican police -- and hurt, badly, Mexican soldiers. ... They're wasting their time. They should turn back now.\" The caravan initially totaled more than 7,000 people, but its numbers have dwindled as thousands have either applied for asylum in Mexico or returned to Honduras. A second, smaller group of 1,000 or so migrants is more than 200 miles back. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday. At a rally Wednesday in Fort Myers, Fla., Trump charged that the leading incoming caravan represents a security threat. \"They got\u00a0a lot of rough people in those caravans -- they are not angels. They are not,\" he said. Trump has said that\u00a0up to 15,000 U.S. troops\u00a0could be deployed to the border if the caravan continues its approach. The\u00a0Pentagon noted\u00a0Wednesday afternoon that its initial estimate was for 7,000 troops at the border. The president also has sparred with some in his own party, including outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., over Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship, which allows children of illegal immigrants to automatically become U.S. citizens if born within the country's borders. \"Illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,\" Trump said to applause at Wednesday's rally, to chants of \"U-S-A!\" That comment was significant because the 14th Amendment reads: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\" TED CRUZ: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP 'INCENTIVIZES' ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, NEEDS TO GO Some Republicans are advancing the theory that illegal immigrants are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the U.S. within the meaning of that provision, which would give Congress the legal daylight to pass a law codifying Trump's view, modifying the current Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) of 1952 and ending birthright citizenship. While an 1898 Supreme Court case appears contrary to that view,\u00a0the issue has not been tested in the courts in modern times, and Republicans are newly emboldened by the 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Still, Trump's suggestion that he could legally bypass Congress and simply issue a unilateral executive order to enact his proposed change was \"obviously\" incorrect, Ryan said this week. That prompted Trump to fire back on Twitter and charge that Ryan \"knows nothing about the issue.\" The president also said Ryan should \"focus on holding the Majority\" -- a nod to polls showing that Republicans face tough odds to retain control of the House after the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Trump also followed up with a clip of a 1993 speech from former Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, in which he claimed that \"no sane country\" would have birthright citizenship. Reid reversed his position in 1999, under pressure from union groups. Fox News' Greg Norman and The Associated Press\u00a0contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington Examiner Editorial Director Hugo Gurdon on President Trump's potential picks to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, Trump taking on Democrats and Democrats' push for impeachment. Liberal lawmakers and pundits, emboldened by bipartisan outrage over President Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, have kicked up calls to pursue impeachment -- indicating the issue could fast become the next litmus test for Democratic candidates. The discussion follows the recent political frenzy over calls to \"abolish\" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That effort briefly served as a similar litmus test in the wake of Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy, which led to family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border. The GOP-controlled House countered on Wednesday with\u00a0a vote on a resolution expressing support for ICE, effectively daring Democrats to go on the record with opposition to the agency. The measure passed, with a total of 133 Democratic representatives voting \"present\" -- amounting to a procedural refusal to take a position despite weeks of heated anti-ICE rhetoric from party leaders. 'ABOLISH ICE' MOVEMENT GOES MAINSTREAM AMONG TOP DEMOCRATS But where abolishing ICE fizzled for now as a progressive cause, the impeachment controversy could have sturdier legs. At the least, it has forced Democratic leaders to confront and carefully manage pressure from the base. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., on Tuesday charged that Trump's remarks in Helsinki, Finland, were \"nothing short of treason\" and marked a \"dark day\" in American history. Hoyer characterized impeachment, though, as a \"distraction,\" while still keeping the door open for the process in the future. \"There will be time enough to deal with other issues and oversight of the president\u2019s performance when we take back control of the House of Representatives,\" he said. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, toed the same line on Monday. \u201cI think that\u2019s premature at this point \u2014 we should do all we can to make sure that he\u2019s held accountable, that we\u00a0conduct the investigations the Republicans have been unwilling to do,\u201d Swalwell said in an interview with The Hill. WALMART PULLS 'IMPEACH 45' CLOTHING FROM WEBSITE AFTER MASSIVE BLOWBACK \u201cIf impeachment is the case,\" he added, \"it\u2019s because we found impenetrable evidence that we take to the American people and will be accepted by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Elsewhere, the calls are getting louder. Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan all but endorsed impeachment when he tweeted that \"Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of 'high crimes & misdemeanors'\" and was \"nothing short of treasonous.\" Ron Fein, with Free Speech for People, wrote in The Washington Post that while Trump's conduct might not rise to the level of treason, \"it might still be impeachment-worthy regardless.\" In perhaps the most dramatic sign that the impeachment fight may go mainstream, Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke -- he is running to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in November in the deep-red, pro-Trump state -- has both advocated impeaching Trump and downplayed the Democratic consequences of such an effort. \u201cImpeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said this week, \u201cand at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.\u201d Trump and his team have sought to manage and clean up after the Russia summit controversy. Trump sparked the biggest backlash for seeming to suggest he had accepted Putin's denial of U.S. election meddling. But he later said he backed the U.S. intelligence community's conclusions, insisting he'd misspoken during a joint press conference with the Russian leader. \"Impeachment ... shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed. ... and there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.\u201d For her part, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the Helsinki summit would increase calls for impeachment \u201cperhaps in the country\" -- but added that in Congress, \"we want to stay focused on honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution and our country.\" DEM FURY OVER TRUMP SUMMIT THREATENS TO EXPOSE PARTY DIVISIONS The momentum in some quarters suggests, though, that trying to remove Trump from office is no longer an effort relegated to the far-left fringes of the party. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., for example, has long advocated for Trump's impeachment, telling the California Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention in San Diego in Februrary that \"it's time to get ready for impeachment.\" Waters, who came under fire last month for openly advocating that anti-Trump protesters confront administration officials in public, had struggled to take the impeachment talk mainstream. However, there are signs that the impeachment litmus test -- like the ICE wedge before it -- might ultimately falter, as fractures in the party prevent a unified and effective front from forming. Rep. Linda S\u00e1nchez, D-Calif., vice chairperson of the House Democratic Caucus, warned that discussing impeachment is still premature. \"We don't know all the facts yet,\" Sanchez told Politico this week. \"And until the time that we do, we can't make a decision on whether or not impeachment is warranted.\" Freshman Rep.\u00a0Jacky Rosen, who is seeking Republican\u00a0Dean Heller's seat in the Senate in November, has treaded carefully on the subject, saying she wants to see where Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian political meddling ends up. Rosen issued a statement after the Helsinki summit calling Trump's performance \"embarrassing\" but stopping short of calling for his removal. In a statement to Fox News this week, Rosen campaign spokeswoman Molly Forgey said that \u201cJacky doesn\u2019t support an impeachment campaign and she believes the Mueller investigation must be able to continue without any political interference.\" In what could be a replay of the \"abolish ICE\" battle, Republicans have already shown a willingness to use that kind of measured, \"wait-and-see\" approach against Democrats who buck firebrands' calls for more decisive action. \u201cBeing afraid of losing an election is no excuse for Jacky Rosen to hide where she stands on impeachment,\u201d Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said in a statement last month, pre-summit. \u201cIf she supports impeaching President Trump, she needs to say it.\" Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "City opens registration to select non-citizens for local elections. Non-American citizens are increasingly found on voter rolls thanks to covert registration methods, with nothing actually stopping them from casting a ballot in an election. Elizaveta Shuvalova, a Russian citizen who became a U.S. citizen only last year, was registered as an eligible voter in 2012 and added to the San Francisco voter rolls, the Washington Times reported. She was perplexed to find herself in the voter rolls, saying she wasn\u2019t an American citizen and didn\u2019t even register to vote. \u201cI\u2019ve never registered for anything in my entire life,\u201d Shuvalova told the paper. \u201cThis is news to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never registered for anything in my entire life. This is news to me.\u201d The woman\u2019s voter log shows that she signed up as a Democrat in July 2012. In 2016, her registration was canceled after she informed election authorities that she wasn't eligible to vote because she wasn't yet a U.S. citizen. \u201cThis is definitely a shocker to me. It is like an identity fraud because this is not coming from my end,\u201d the woman, who identifies as a Democrat, said. \u201cLike I told you, I haven\u2019t even been a citizen during that time frame. So what can we do about it?\u201d NON-CITIZENS, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOW MAY REGISTER TO VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS But the case of Shuvalova is part of a larger concern some groups have when it comes integrity of elections. They claim that stories like hers are a common occurence in many parts of the country. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, found that non-Americans are being added to voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. The group says that a large portion of the non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections as well. For instance, in 2017, the group found that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections. \"Our voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront.\" \u201cOur voter registration system masks non-citizens and allows the opportunity to vote until they decide to self-report at their own peril. All of this could have been prevented if states actually verified citizen eligibility upfront,\u201d Logan Churchwell, communications and research director for the foundation, told the Times. Shuvalova could have been added on voter rolls after signing a 2013 petition for a ballot initiative concerning housing development in San Francisco. John Arntz, director of the San Francisco Department of Elections, told the Times that a signed registration card was submitted to the office to qualify the woman as a signer of the petition. He added that activists often distribute registration cards along with their petitions. Normally, election authorities should check the registration application with other databases such as the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles and the secretary of state\u2019s office to ensure the person is a citizen. In Shuvalova\u2019s case, however, she wasn\u2019t detected as a non-citizen and she began receiving voting ballots. She received nine of them, but never actually voted. She reportedly returned one ballot in 2016 but only to inform officials that she wasn't a citizen and therefore wasn't eligible to vote. The San Francisco election official said that Shuvalova could have easily gotten away with voting in elections before 2016 and she probably would have remained on the voter rolls as an eligible voter had she not informed officials. But Arntz told the Times that the woman\u2019s story isn\u2019t a reflection on whole the integrity of the election system. \u201cIf it was a problem, this would be an issue that comes up every election or something we would have experienced more through time. But it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first instance that I\u2019ve actually had a conversation like this,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, no, I don\u2019t think it is a problem. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many records out there like this.\u201d He added that nobody in San Francisco has yet been prosecuted for being a non-citizen on the voter rolls. \u201cI can\u2019t remember forwarding an allegation that someone was a non-citizen who registered to vote or did vote,\u201d Arntz said.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick and Republican Lea Marquez Peterson battle for voters in key midterm race TUCSON, Ariz. \u2013 As the migrant caravan makes its way to the U.S. border, stirring up a political frenzy days before the midterms, few races are feeling the impact of it more than Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional district. The district, which stretches from Tucson to the New Mexico border, includes a large swath of the U.S-Mexican border. Democrat Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick, who\u2019s running on a platform of protecting health care, veterans\u2019 services, and \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u2014 is running against Republican businesswoman Lea Marquez Peterson, who is pushing for term limits, border security, and a strong economy. It\u2019s a race that \u201ceverybody\u2019s going to be watching\u201d said University of Arizona political science professor Thomas Volgy. He called it one of the \u201cbellwether districts\u201d that swings back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. \u201cIf the Democrats carry this district, they have a good opportunity to reverse the House majority. If they lose this district, then it's maybe much more unlikely that there will be a blue wave in the House of Representatives,\u201d Volgy said. \u201cThey say the path for Democrats flipping the house runs through this district so it\u2019s a very, very key district nationally and we\u2019re getting a lot of national attention because of that,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. (Fox News) As the migrant caravan has become a flashpoint in the immigration debate, voters in the district said the issue is particularly important to them because of their proximity to the border. \u201cEspecially now that we have this caravan of I think 14,000 people coming here trying to enter the country illegally, I think it\u2019s a critical issue for our country that\u2019s going to be a critical issue for years to come, as well,\u201d said Mitch Chrismer, a Tucson voter. Esther Macias, a Tucson voter, also said she was closely monitoring the caravan. \u201cIt\u2019s very important because we\u2019re so close to the border, it\u2019s very important for us,\u201d Macias said. Both candidates recognize that the race is being closely watched and that the results are critical to the future of both parties. \u201cThey say the path for Democrats flipping the house runs through this district so it\u2019s a very, very key district nationally and we\u2019re getting a lot of national attention because of that,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cIt has been held by Democrats and Republicans and because voter registration is so even so it really depends on who works the hardest and who gets the voters out to vote\u2026I\u2019m ready to hit the ground running.\u201d Marquez Peterson said a win from her would help her party. \u201cThis seat is vitally important\u2014to keep our House majority, to keep the great progress we've had in the economy,\u201d Marquez Peterson said. \u201cI think people see that with the Tax and Jobs Act that passed, with consumer confidence being so high and small business confidence being so high, we need to keep this progress going and that\u2019s why it's so important to vote Republican, vote for someone who's locally from this community and in this upcoming race in CD-2.\u201d \u201cThis seat is vitally important\u2014to keep our House majority, to keep the great progress we've had in the economy,\u201d Marquez Peterson said. (Fox News) The latest Fox News\u2019 Power Rankings shows this seat as Lean Democrat. Voters here say they are closely looking at where the candidates stand on border issues. Kirkpatrick told Fox News she plans on having working groups to talk about issues that include immigration, while Marquez Peterson told Fox News an important issue in the region is border security that deals with drug smuggling and human trafficking. She has called for wall \u201cwhere it makes sense.\u201d Just like the candidates, voters here are split on the immigration debate and the caravan. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be a country without immigrants\u2026immigrants (are) the lifeblood of what makes the United States of America,\u201d said Tucson voter Robin Williams. \u201cTo somehow paint people who are coming here for an opportunity as being bad is absurd, it\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.\u201d Phoenix voter Darren Thompson, who was in Tucson on Wednesday, said members of the caravan should reassess their method of gaining entry. \u201cI understand their plight and I think I have a high level of sensitivity to that plight\u2014however, there's a specific way that things have to be done and I'm not sure that that is the right strategy in order to get the point across,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think that's going to end well for anyone.\u201d The district has 144,365 registered Democrat voters, 138,008 Republican voters, and 132,889 voters listed as \u2018other\u2019\u2014which could mean many of those are independent voters. So, winning that independent vote is key in these coming weeks. \u201cI've personally always run like I'm three points down and then we'll see what happens on Election Day,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cYou never know.\u201d Marquez Peterson said the race will be tight. \u201cIt is going to be a very close race,\u201d she said, \u201cit always has been through various folks that have run.\" \u201cI've personally always run like I'm three points down and then we'll see what happens on Election Day\u2026you never know,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cIt is going to be a very close race, it always has been through various folks that have run,\u201d Marquez Peterson said. The most recent poll meeting Fox News' standards shows Kirkpatrick leading 50% to Marquez Peterson's 39% and a remaining 10% undecided. (Siena College Poll in the New York Times) Volgy said most Republicans and Democrats are set on how they want to vote but that the Independent vote has always been important in this district. \u201cIt is also (the Independent vote) very important now\u2026Independents appear to be significantly negative about the president which gives the Democrats a significant advantage...whoever is on the side of the President does well, off-year elections it\u2019s the exact opposite, so we\u2019ll see this time,\u201d Volgy said.",

            "article_content": "This photo provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety shows Ramon Escobar. Escobar, who was deported from the United States six times was expected in court Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018, to face charges after police say he killed three people and injured four in attacks targeting sleeping homeless men in California. Investigators believe Escobar began attacking the men at random on Sept. 8, shortly after he arrived in California from Houston, where he's considered a person of interest in the disappearance of his uncle and aunt. (Texas Department of Public Safety via AP) LOS ANGELES \u2013 A man with a violent criminal history who was deported six times had no outstanding warrants when questioned last month about the disappearance of his aunt and so he was released, Houston police said Wednesday, when the man was charged in Los Angeles with the beating deaths of three men. Immigration records are generally not public, so it remained a mystery how Ramon Escobar, 47, won an appeal in immigration court in 2016 and why he remained free after a subsequent arrest for assault. The Aug. 30 encounter by Escobar with Houston police came two days after his aunt vanished and marked his last brush with the law before his arrest in California this week. Escobar was charged Wednesday in Los Angeles County with three counts of murder, five counts of attempted murder and four counts of second-degree robbery in attacks involving homeless men. It could not be immediately determined if he had an attorney. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Escobar was ordered removed from the country by an immigration judge in February 1988, and he was deported to El Salvador six times between 1997 and 2011. He had six felony convictions for burglary and illegal re-entry. The Board of Immigration Appeals granted his appeal in December 2016, and ICE released him a month later. Last November, Escobar was arrested on the misdemeanor assault charge by Harris County, Texas, authorities, according to Texas Department of Public Safety records. He was convicted in May. ICE spokeswoman Paige Hughes declined to comment on Escobar's case beyond a statement issued late Tuesday. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, did not provide information. Andrew Arthur, a retired immigration judge, said the Board of Immigration Appeals may have allowed Escobar to stay in the country and be released under ICE supervision by granting him asylum or some other form of relief, like \"withholding of removal\" or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. \"Even people with horrendous criminal records are able to access humanitarian relief to remain in the United States,\" said Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for restrictions on immigration. John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, said a serious criminal record can hurt an asylum claim but doesn't disqualify someone from withholding of removal. Unlike asylum, withholding of removal does not include a path to citizenship and is therefore considered less appealing. Escobar was questioned by Houston police on Aug. 30 in his aunt's disappearance but police spokesman Kese Smith said he was not a suspect at the time. Investigators spoke with him because he was one of the last people to see Dina Escobar, 60, before she vanished in late August. Her disappearance and that of her brother, Rogelio Escobar, 65, were considered missing-persons cases. \"We had no probable cause to arrest or book him,\" Smith said Wednesday afternoon. Immigration status is checked by Houston police only when a person is being booked into the city jail after being charged with a crime, Smith said. Late Wednesday night, however, all that changed when Smith announced that foul play was now suspected in the disappearances. Authorities say Escobar traveled to Los Angeles after the disappearances, of which he is now considered a person of interest. Escobar likely targeted victims to rob them, according to Los Angeles police. He is being held without bail. He is believed to be the man captured on surveillance video ransacking the pockets and belongings of some downtown Los Angeles victims. Detectives have seized a wooden baseball bat and bolt cutters that they believe were used to bludgeon men as they lay sleeping on the beach or on the street in Los Angeles and Santa Monica, police said. All but one of the men was homeless. Two homeless men sleeping on the beach were bludgeoned in the head early on Sept. 8 and Sept. 10, leaving one in critical condition, officials said. Another man who apparently was sleeping on the beach was found dead under the Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 20. Steven Ray Cruze Jr., 39, of San Gabriel, had been beaten to death. Authorities at first described him as homeless, but family and friends said the father of two, who loved to fish at the pier, worked boats in neighboring Marina del Rey and sometimes camped out under the pier to avoid the long commute home. ___ Spagat reported from San Diego.

Developing now, Wednesday, August 22,\u00a02018 THE LEAD STORY -\u00a0SEARCH FOR MOLLIE COMES TO TRAGIC END:\u00a0The suspect in the killing of Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts is a 24-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico who had been living in the area for up to seven years, officials revealed Tuesday ...\u00a0Cristhian Bahena Rivera\u00a0was arrested Tuesday\u00a0and charged with first-degree murder in the death of the 20-year-old Tibbetts, who was reported missing more than a month ago. Rivera is\u00a0scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday at 1 p.m. local time in\u00a0Montezuma, Iowa.\u00a0Tibbetts was last seen jogging July 18 near Brooklyn, Iowa\u00a0in Poweshiek County, where Rivera lives.\u00a0A body believed to be Mollie Tibbetts was discovered in\u00a0a cornfield,\u00a0and Rivera led authorities to the location, said\u00a0Rick Rahn, special agent in charge with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Tibbetts' alleged murder and the revelation that suspect\u00a0Cristhian Rivera is an illegal immigrant sparked almost immediate comparisons to the death of\u00a0Kate Steinle,\u00a0who was shot and killed on a San Francisco pier in 2015. Investigators said the suspect, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was in the U.S. illegally. A jury acquitted him of murder, manslaughter and assault last year but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm. PRESIDENT IN LEGAL PERIL? -\u00a0\u00a0Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney, admitted Tuesday to violating federal campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u201cat the direction\u201d of then-candidate Trump ...\u00a0\u00a0In entering the plea, Cohen did not specifically name the two women or even Trump, recounting instead that he worked with an \u201cunnamed candidate.\u201d But the amounts and the dates all lined up with the payments made to Daniels and McDougal. In total, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution.\u00a0The deal does not involve a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors.\u00a0Cohen is set to be sentenced Dec. 12. In a statement, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said: \u201cThere is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the President in the government\u2019s charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen\u2019s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.\u201d Cohen attorney Lanny Davis told FOX News that Cohen\u2019s involvement in the Trump-Russia investigation does not end with the plea deal, but in fact \"it is only the beginning.\" Scholars disagree over how much potential legal jeopardy Trump faces.\u00a0George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said on \"Special Report\" that President Donald Trump may end up an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" in the case. However, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that Cohen's\u00a0guilty pleas may cause some trouble for Trump, but that they are not \"lethal\" to his presidency. 'NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIAN COLLUSION': A federal jury in Virginia convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, making him the first campaign associate of President Trump found guilty by a jury as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe ...\u00a0But after four days of deliberations, the jury told Judge T.S. Ellis III on Tuesday afternoon that it could not come to a decision on 10 other counts related to financial crimes. A mistrial was declared on those counts. \u201cI feel very badly for Paul Manafort,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday evening after landing in West Virginia for a political rally.\u00a0\u201cIt has nothing to do with Russian collusion,\u201d Trump added, calling Mueller\u2019s probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The government has until Aug. 29 to decide whether it will move to retry the 10 deadlocked counts.\u00a0 Manafort is facing a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison. NO 'TRUMP BUMP' IN WYOMING:\u00a0Wyoming state treasurer Mark Gordon won a fiercely contested GOP primary to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Matt Mead on Tuesday, prevailing over a billionaire businessman who received a last-minute endorsement from President Trump ...\u00a0Foster Friess, the GOP megadonor who Trump tweeted would be \"Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment,\" is a major financial contributor to Christian causes, which analysts had predicted might help him secure Wyoming's religious votes in the race against Gordon and several other candidates. Trump, who has aggressively campaigned nationally for various state candidates ahead of November's midterm elections, won the state by more than 40 points in the 2016 presidential race. His endorsement has carried significant weight in several primary races this year, helping to oust Rep. Mark Sanford in South Carolina in a stunning upset and keeping Rep. Martha Roby's candidacy alive in Alabama.\u00a0But it wasn't enough Tuesday, as vote tallies showed Friess trailing Gordon by more than 6 percentage points with virtually all precincts reporting. Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso, a vocal supporter of President Trump, fended off a well-funded challenger in Wyoming's Republican primary Tuesday, soundly defeating Jackson Hole business investor Dave Dodson by more than 30 percentage points. In Alaska, former state Sen. Mike Dunleavy won the Republican nomination for governor, setting the stage for what's expected to be a three-way fight for the office this fall.\u00a0He topped a crowded field in Tuesday's GOP primary that included former Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, who had fashioned himself as the more experienced candidate.

The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 400,000 people who were attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border during the 2018 fiscal year, Trump administration officials revealed Tuesday, an increase of more than 90,000 from the prior year. The numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection show a 21 percent increase in unaccompanied minors attempting to cross the southern border and a 42 percent increase in families who were apprehended attempting to cross the border.\u00a0Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border were families and children \u2014 about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions. By comparison, 117,057 families and children were apprehended at the border in fiscal year 2017 out of 303,916 total apprehensions. Most of the unaccompanied minors and family units who were apprehended are from Guatemala. The numbers show a 104 percent increase in the number of apprehended family units from the Central American country, as well as a 51 percent increase in the number of unaccompanied minors. Children and families from Honduras accounted for the second largest increase -- as apprehensions of minors from that country were up 40 percent and apprehensions of family units increased by 76 percent. In all, a total of 521,090 people were either apprehended or deemed \"inadmissible\" after arriving at a port of entry, a 25 percent increase from the 415,517 who were apprehended or deemed inadmissible in fiscal year 2017. The numbers were released as President Trump sought to make immigration a key issue of next month's midterm elections. He has criticized Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping people from leaving their countries and said in a tweet on Monday that the U.S. would \"now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\" He has also threatened to use the military to close down the United States' southern border as a caravan of an estimated 7,000 people -- many of them Honduras -- has crossed into Mexico from Guatemala this week. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The White House tells Fox News that President Trump is willing to work across the aisle with the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. It was 9:31 in the east when Fox News, President Trump's favorite network, projected the outcome he wanted least: the Democrats would take control of the House. And that changes everything. It wasn't quite a blue wave, but enough districts turned blue to end the Republicans' total control of Washington, marking a turning point in the Trump presidency. And the media will cast Tuesday's outcome as a rejection of Trumpism, which will be the subject of endless cable segments and op-ed arguments. Trump was always going to own the midterm results, win or lose. The media were going to cast it as a referendum on his presidency regardless, and he embraced that notion, saying he was practically on the ballot, nationalizing the contests around such issues as immigration and spending the final weeks in a blitz of interviews and campaign rallies. It had been a surprisingly low-key evening until the Fox call, with no major upsets, other than Beto O'Rourke staying even with Ted Cruz before falling short. Even James Carville said his party was not in for as good a night as he had hoped. But the Democrats gradually picked up one House seat after another of the 23 they needed to take control. It would be nearly an hour until MSNBC would join in projecting a Republican loss of House control. The previously powerless Democrats now wield at least some power in the nation\u2019s capital, which could mean two years of gridlock, unless the president and opposition party decide it's in their self-interest to cooperate on certain issues. No amount of spin can soften the blow of losing the House to the Democrats. Indeed, there were reports that White House officials had told the president to brace himself for a very tough night. And even in the 8 p.m. hour, with many races too close or too early to call, some pundits were already talking about how Nancy Pelosi's troops could make life difficult for the administration with a blizzard of investigations and subpoenas. The Republicans held the Senate, and Trump was poised to take credit, though that was practically pre-ordained, given a map that mainly featured Democrats trying to hang on in red states, as North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp failed to do. But politics is a game of expectations, and all the media chatter about a blue tsunami came to seem premature. That may be because political races always tighten at the end, and in part because Trump succeeded in mobilizing his conservative base. The president's tactics \u2014 especially his focus on immigration, the caravan and birthright citizenship \u2014 were widely denounced by the media in the final stretch. Trump was accused in news stories of using fear-mongering and racially charged divisiveness to rile up his supporters. While the president's rhetoric did get uncomfortably hot at times, and several networks rejected an immigration ad as racist, many in the media also fueled the divisiveness with attacks on the president. But when the media sages said the president should tout the booming economy, he countered that the subject was unexciting when people were doing well and focused on the more emotional subject of illegal immigration. What happened to Trump in his first midterm is hardly unique. Barack Obama suffered the same fate in 2010 and 2014, and George W. Bush in 2006. Both took office with full party control of Congress and both lost it. Donald Trump remains the dominant figure in American politics. But for the first time since the early-morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016, the Democrats have something to cheer about.",

            "article_content": "Reynaldo Mora, 41, was arrested in April after he was accused of raping and impregnating a non-verbal 13-year-old girl in Maryland. (Montgomery County Police) An illegal immigrant in Maryland has been accused of raping a non-verbal special needs girl while he was supposed to be babysitting her at her home. Reynaldo Mora, 41, was arrested April 19 in Montgomery County and charged with sex abuse of a minor, in addition to two counts of second-degree rape, according to WJLA. MAN WHO TRIED TO SEDUCE TEEN BOY WITH SPRITE AND CHICKEN ALFREDO IS SENTENCED Mora was reportedly babysitting the 13-year-old girl in February at her home in Kensington, where he allegedly forced the victim into having sex with him. The girl, whom police said has the \"intellect of a first grader\" and can only communicate using \"gestures and writing,\" tested positive when she took a pregnancy test in April, the news outlet reported. Staff at a nearby medical center confirmed she was 11-weeks pregant. Portland mayor sides with anti-ICE protesters. Mora reportedly was held for seven weeks at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Clarksburg after a district court judge denied his bond. In May, his defense attorney filed a \"motion to reconsider bond,\" and on June 1, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Steven Salant granted Mora a personal recognizance bond, according to the station. The personal recognizance bond would've allowed Mora to leave jail without putting up money under a deal that he'd appear at future court appearances. However, due to a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), local law enforcement surrendered him to federal officials on June 6. MS-13 GANG MEMBERS, INCLUDING 10 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CHARGED IN DEATHS OF VIRGINIA TEENS Jose Campos, Mora's defense attorney, told WJLA his client is innocent, and said Mora \"willingly submitted to a DNA test and he is hopeful that this DNA test is going to clear everything.\" Results for a paternity test were still pending, according to the report. Mora is scheduled to appear in Montgomery County Circuit Court in October for a three-day trial. He reportedly faces up to 60 years in prison.",

            "article_content": "Employees at the biggest tech companies donate more money to Democrats than Republicans. President\u00a0Trump has repeatedly called out Google, Facebook and Twitter for liberal bias. Two weeks until the midterms, it would appear he may have had a point. Employees\u00a0of the tech giants have given\u00a0a total of $2.4 million to House and Senate candidates, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Of that, only $176,000 - less than\u00a08 percent - went to Republicans. By comparison, in the last midterms in 2014, Google, Facebook and Twitter workers gave a total of $838,000 to congressional candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive\u00a0Politics. Of that, $679,000 went to Democrats and $259,000 went to Republicans. In July, President Trump\u00a0accused Twitter of \u201cshadow banning\u201d prominent Republicans. \u201cNot good,\u201d he tweeted. He also accused Google in a series of tweets in August of playing up negative articles about him in search results. INSIDE FACEBOOK'S CYBERSECURITY 'WAR ROOM', SCIENTISTS FIGHT TO SAFEGUARD ELECTIONS The campaign donation\u00a0findings could provide Trump more ammunition that the big tech firms have a built-in bias that tilts left. \"It is interesting to see that employees of the tech world are giving substantially more donations to Democrats than Republicans but not shocking, given many of these employees likely reside in blue states and the nature of the industry's employees-educated, higher income --\u00a0and because many of these employees may be affected by policies that are in the news right now like immigration to education,\"\u00a0University of Arkansas political science professor Karen Sebold told Fox News. Additionally, said Sebold, whose specialty is campaign finance, donations for the 2018 midterms\u00a0are becoming increasingly\u00a0presidentialized, \u201cthus the votes/donations might be taken as a sign\u00a0of opposition toward President Trump.\" The leaders of Google, Facebook and Twitter have denied any bias. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted during congressional testimony that Silicon Valley was an \u201cextremely left-leaning place\u201d and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has conceded that his staff is primarily \u201cleft-leaning.\u201d The PACs of Facebook and Google are another story. Those\u00a0PACs favored Republicans\u00a0over Democrats\u00a0over the years, records show. In 2016, for instance, the PACs of these two firms gave a total of $1 million to Republicans and $878,000 to Democrats. The PACs did not contribute to presidential candidates. (The Twitter PAC in 2016 only donated $8,000 to Democrats and $7,500 to Republicans). In 2018, there has been a dramatic turn.\u00a0The Facebook and Google PACS have given nearly $607,000 to Democrats and $538,000 to Republicans. GOOGLE FACES PRIVACY BACKLASH OVER CHROME'S 'FORCED LOGIN' POLICY When it comes to employees' individual donations, however, there is a marked\u00a0tilt to the left. Google employees have given more than their counterparts at Facebook and Twitter in terms of political contributions, $1.7 million, records show. Of that, they favored Democrats by a decisive margin. Only $117,000 went to Republicans. The same holds true at Facebook. Facebook employees\u00a0donated nearly $549,000 to Democrats running for Congress. Only $58,000, just shy of\u00a010 percent, went to Republicans. Twitter employees have donated a total of $105,000 during the 2018 election cycle. None of that cash has gone to Republicans. Google vice president Jason Spero told CNBC in May that his political activism has grown since Trump was elected. \"I'd never been as aware, awake and active as I have been since that November,\" he said. The station reported that at that moment Spero and other employees at Google and across Silicon Valley had their sights set on the 2018 midterms and flipping the House in favor of Democrats. The FEC filings show that Spero and his colleagues have donated more than $93,000 to three California Democrats, seeking to turn three House seats blue -- Mike Levin, who\u2019s running for retiring GOP Congressman Darrel Issa\u2019s seat, Jessica Morse, who is trying to unseat GOP incumbent Tom McClintock, and Joshua Harder, who is challenging GOP incumbent Jeff Denham. TWITTER URGES USERS TO #BEAVOTER Google employees also have donated nearly $31,000 to Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is running against Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, the incumbent. Cruz has received one campaign contribution from a Google employee for $250. Two other Google workers have also donated a total of $1,350 to Trump in 2018, the filings show. O'Rourke was also a top recipient of campaign cash from Facebook employees, according to the FEC filings. The donations to Beto totaled more than $18,000. Other recipients include Josh Gottheimer, a freshman New Jersey Democrat who unseated Republican incumbent Scott Garrett in 2016. Facebook employees gave him $17,500. Five Twitter employees in equal amounts have donated nearly $10,000 each to three Democrats:\u00a0Jared Golden, running against Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine, Jessica King, running against Republican Rep. Lloyd Smucker in Pennsylvania and J.D. Scholten, running against Republican Rep. Steve King in Iowa. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is listed as a donor but not to any congressional candidate. Instead, the filings show he gave the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee each $33,900, the maximum contribution. Dorsey also hasn\u2019t donated any money to Democrats or Republicans in 2018, and neither has Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's only donations were two to the Facebook PAC for a total of $10,000. Emails to Google, Facebook and Twitter seeking comment were not immediately returned.",

Federal officers have accused authorities in Oregon of preventing them from taking a Mexican national into custody before he was released in a domestic violence case and went on to be charged with murder. Martin Gallo-Gallardo, who was in the U.S. illegally, posted bond in March and was released from jail in Portland when his wife and a daughter stopped cooperating with prosecutors and a grand jury declined to indict him, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Friday, Nov. 2, 2018. (Clackamas County Sheriff's Office via AP) PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 Federal officers have accused authorities in Oregon of preventing them from taking a Mexican national into custody before he was released in a domestic violence case and went on to be charged with murder. Martin Gallo-Gallardo, who was in the U.S. illegally, posted bond in March and was released from jail in Portland when his wife and a daughter stopped cooperating with prosecutors and a grand jury declined to indict him, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Friday. Authorities in nearby Clackamas County arrested and charged him this week with killing his wife and dumping her body in a ditch. His court-appointed attorney, Thomas Hanrahan, did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it placed a civil detainer on Gallo-Gallardo, 45, while he was still in custody in Portland and wanted to take him into federal custody for deportation, but the request wasn't recognized by the sheriff's office. The case spotlights Oregon's first-in-the nation immigrant sanctuary law just as voters will decide Tuesday whether to repeal it. Oregon adopted the law in 1987 to prevent law enforcement from detaining people who are in the U.S. illegally but have not broken other laws. \"It's unfortunate that law enforcement agencies like the Multnomah County jail refuse to work with ICE to promote public safety by holding criminals accountable and providing justice and closure for their victims,\" said Tanya J. Roman, a spokeswoman for the ICE regional office that covers Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Alaska. \"Sanctuary policies not only provide a refuge for illegal aliens, but they also shield criminal aliens who prey on people in their own and other communities.\" Multnomah County officials insisted Friday that they didn't get the request. They also pointed out that jails in Oregon can't recognize civil detainers because of a 2014 federal court decision that found Clackamas County violated a woman's rights by holding her beyond her release date while federal authorities investigated her immigration status. The county blasted ICE for putting the blame on them for the death of 38-year-old Coral Rodriguez Lorenzo when Gallo-Gallardo was free for six months. \"They had his name, address, and telephone number,\" said Sgt. Brandon White, a spokesman for the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. \"It is disingenuous to make this claim when they failed to follow the process for even entering the civil detainer information into any law enforcement database.\" Rodriguez Lorenzo was reported missing Tuesday, and authorities determined her body had been found a day earlier in rural suburbs of Portland. Investigators learned she was last seen with her husband arguing at a party, according to a probable cause affidavit. Detectives went to question Gallo-Gallardo at his job and he confessed to the killing, the affidavit said. An autopsy found Rodriguez Lorenzo died from blunt-force head trauma and multiple stab wounds. ICE has now placed a hold on the suspect with the Clackamas County jail where he's being held on the murder charge.",

Those who believe the elite left-wing \u201cblue wave\u201d theory for the 2018 elections should look at what happened in Texas on Tuesday In a special election runoff, Republican Pete Flores successfully flipped Texas State Senate District 19, which borders Mexico and had been in Democratic control for 139 years. Flores, a political newcomer competing against a seasoned former Democratic congressman, won in a district that is 73 percent Hispanic and African American \u2013 despite virtually all political analysts\u2019 expectations. I am studying this election for a future op-ed, but I have been told by many Texas Republicans that Flores was able to win because he ran a big choice campaign. Republicans everywhere should also study this Texas state special election and make the 2018 midterms a big choice election for all American voters. And with only 48 days left until November 6, they must act now. Candidates, consultants, campaign managers \u2013 Republicans at every level \u2013 must break out of the small-ball, district-by-district campaign model and create a national message that defines a set of big choices that contrast the Republican positions and those of the left. Otherwise, the Democrats are very likely to achieve the so-called blue wave the liberal media has been touting for months. I outlined the need for this kind of campaign (and provided an in-depth look at how to implement it) in my recently released political strategy paper called The Republican Choice for 2018: Win or Lose, which I have shared with a number of Republicans around the country and have made available for Kindle on Amazon. Big choice elections focus on big differences and describing magnets of a better future to attract the voter, while they simultaneously hammer home wedge issues to drive the opposition away from the voter. The paper is broken into four parts, but I\u2019d like to focus on the first, critical concept that I think can help Republicans design and execute the kind of campaign we need to win in 2018 \u2013 and again in 2020. Starting right now, Republicans need to develop a set of core big issues that create a clear vision for a better future for Americans \u2013 in completely personal terms, not platitudes. These issues (and the Republican position on them) must be broadly appealing to the vast majority of Americans. In the paper, I discuss a set of issues that Republicans could include in this big choice election narrative \u2013 such as favoring work over welfare, paychecks over food stamps, safe and orderly immigration over dangerous borderless chaos, personal health versus bureaucratic health, and others \u2013 but I will expand on those in a future piece. In the meantime, Republicans should think critically \u2013 and listen closely to their constituents \u2013 to develop and communicate a robust set of big choices to voters over the next few weeks. It\u2019s critical that each of these big choices is popular. When we developed the Contract with America in 1994 we polled every policy position to be included. Every pledge in the Contract had 70 percent support from Americans \u2013 some had 80 percent support. Issues that didn\u2019t have wide appeal, didn\u2019t make it into the Contract. It was that simple. Despite constant left-wing attacks and media bias, if Republicans put together a set of highly-supported, issues and policies, and contrast them vividly with the unpopular liberal Democratic positions, the American people will support Republicans. Contrasting the Republicans\u2019 better future with the Democrats\u2019 destructive future will make it easier to communicate the rest of the big choice campaign. However, it is not enough to attract support for our issues. We also must clearly express how the Democratic alternatives to our positions are personally bad for Americans. This will drive powerful wedges between the Democrats and the American people. As I explain in the paper: \u201cBig choice campaigns invariably describe a better future, a future worth voting and fighting for, in personal terms. (You will be better off. Your family will be better off. Your community will be better off.) At the same time, the emerging majority describes the threat that the other side presents to potentially make life worse, in similarly personal terms. These aren\u2019t campaigns about abstract philosophy or ideology. These are campaigns about two different ways of life, with two different impacts, at personal levels. They work very hard at finding the right words and images and picking the right fights. Attacking Nancy Pelosi personally seems tactically clever, but tying her to outrageous and unacceptable policies is strategically far more powerful. \u201cSmall choice campaigns look for petty, personal weaknesses. Big choice elections focus on big differences and describing magnets of a better future to attract the voter, while they simultaneously hammer home wedge issues to drive the opposition away from the voter. Too many Republican consultants and candidates have no faith in the American people. They run small choice campaigns because they think that voters can only understand small things. \u201cThe great leaders have all had faith that the American people can understand a lot if it is framed in clear, direct language. This is the job of a big choice campaign.\u201d Implementing this first key step of developing and contrasting the Republicans\u2019 better future with the Democrats\u2019 destructive future will make it easier to communicate the rest of the big choice campaign. Not only will developing a suite of popular, big choice positions attract the support of the American people, but it will also help Republicans grow support within the party, build a governing coalition, and strengthen their ability to find and nurture future leaders within the GOP. In doing so, it will be easier for Republicans to speak with the American people with one voice. This will have the added benefit of allowing us to be more effective in fighting against distortions from the elite media and assaults from the left. If Republicans are going to win in 2018, they must not fall into the old campaign habits of personal attacks, niche issues, relying on special interests, or skirmishing district-by-district. Furthermore, even though the Trump-Republican-led government has brought us an incredible economy, historically low unemployment, a slew of strong judicial appointments, and many other successes, we cannot take for granted that voters will be considering these things on Election Day. If Republicans want to continue to lead \u2013 and continue making America great for all Americans \u2013 they must give the voters big choice in November. The clock is ticking.",

            "article_content": "6 days until voters decide who controls Congress; reaction and analysis from 'The Five.' Listening to the pundits and prognosticators, you\u2019d think control of Congress has already been decided. But the fight for our nation\u2019s future is far from finished. It\u2019s happening this week when millions will take part in their civic responsibility on Election Day. Regardless of who wins and who loses, there are certain issues the next Congress will be forced to address. The cost of health care is not sustainable for many Americans. Most polls show this is the top issue for voters \u2013\u00a0and for good reason. Eight years after President Obama signed it into law, the Affordable Care Act has proved to be anything but affordable. It\u2019s time for Congress to enact reforms that help reduce health care costs while increasing coverage choices for everyone. The debate over immigration has once again been pushed into the public square, as a caravan of several thousand people makes its way through Mexico toward the United States. The president can\u2019t address this alone. Congress must act to secure America\u2019s borders. Unemployment is down across the board. That\u2019s good news for everybody, but we need to ensure the economy keeps growing. One of the best ways Congress can do that is making sure tax reform keeps putting money in your hands, not the government\u2019s. Making last year\u2019s tax cuts permanent for American families would almost certainly boost economic growth. And, if you thought Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings would end the angst over judicial appointments, think again. More than 100 judgeships on our federal circuit and district courts remain unfilled. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts classifies more than half of those vacancies as \u201cjudicial emergencies\u201d\u2014long-standing vacancies that push up the caseload of other judges. The result: justice denied. There is no shortage of nominees to fill these seats, but obstructionist tactics and foot-dragging in the Senate have left them in limbo. Clearly, our senators need to drop the partisan game-playing and get to work. But whether that happens will depend largely on who holds the committee gavel next year. And who holds the gavel depends entirely on you, and me, and our fellow citizens. We have the Founders of our nation to thank for that. President Ronald Reagan put it so eloquently in his 1989 farewell address to the American people: \"Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with [only] three little words: \u2018We the People.\u2019 \u2018We the People\u2019 tell the government what to do; it doesn\u2019t tell us.\" Nearly 250 years ago, brave colonials fought, and bled, and died, so that their generation \u2013\u00a0and generations yet to come \u2013\u00a0could tell their government what to do. So that they would be able to determine the laws by which they would be governed. Hundreds of thousands of brave Americans have given their lives to preserve this precious right for us. That\u2019s why voting is more than a right. It is a sacred obligation. And, as a newly appointed member of the Women\u2019s Suffrage Centennial Commission, it\u2019s also not lost on me that 100 years ago, as a woman, I would not have been able to cast a ballot in an election. Congress first considered a women\u2019s suffrage amendment in 1878, but it wasn\u2019t until August 18, 1920, that women finally gained the right to vote in America. I can assure you that this woman, this mother, this grandmother, this American, will be exercising that right on Tuesday because voting is one of the chief ways we determine what kind of nation we will be and what kind of country we will pass on to our children and grandchildren. There is much at stake in this election.\u00a0Too much to let others determine the outcome for you and yours. Do your part. Do your duty. Vote!",

            "article_content": "Liberty Farms Owner Martha Boneta discusses how President Trump railed against Canadian tariffs on American dairy products. The House of Representatives passed a sweeping, subsidy-packed farm bill on Thursday that tightens food stamp rules, in a major win for the House leadership after a day of setbacks and chaos on immigration. The House bill narrowly passed by a vote of 213-211 with 20 Republicans voting no. It sets up a certain clash in the Senate, which looks to make mostly modest adjustments to existing programs and doesn't pick a food stamps fight. The measure cuts federal food stamps benefits by some $9 billion over the next decade, and includes provisions strengthening work requirements for those who get the benefit. Nonpartisan congressional estimates say nearly 4 percent of SNAP recipients -- some 1.2 million people -- would lose the benefits under the new farm bill. But $6.7 billion of those savings would go to new work-training programs, which critics say are often ineffective, and nearly another $1 billion would be allocated to administrative costs. Currently, adults 18-59 are required to work part time to receive food stamps, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or agree to accept a job if they're offered one. Stricter rules apply to able-bodied adults 18-49, who are subject to a three-month limit of benefits unless they meet a work or job training requirement of 80 hours per month. Under the new farm bill, the tougher requirement would be expanded to apply to all adults on SNAP, with exceptions for seniors, pregnant women, caretakers of children under 6, or people with disabilities.\u00a0 Food stamp benefits average about $450 a month for a family of four. \u201cThis bill includes critical reforms to nutrition benefits that close the skills gap, better equip our workforce, and encourage people to move from welfare to work, so more Americans have the opportunity to tap into the economic prosperity we\u2019re seeing right now,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \"This bill includes critical reforms to ... encourage people to move from welfare to work.\" Democrats unanimously opposed the bill, saying it would toss too many people off government assistance. CHAOS, CONFUSION MARK HOUSE GOP VOTES ON IMMIGRATION BILLS The bill also includes major subsidies, particularly for soybean, wheat, cotton, rice, corn, and peanut farmers -- leading some critics to deride the legislation as little more than a substitution of food stamps with so-called \"corporate welfare.\" The House previously voted down the farm bill last month, with the conservative House Freedom Caucus withholding support without an agreement to hold a vote on an immigration bill. But on Thursday, after the House leadership acceded to the Freedom Caucus' demands and put a hard-right immigration proposal to a vote, the farm bill passed with strong Republican support. The conservative immigration measure was defeated 231-193, with 41 Republicans \u2014 mostly moderates \u2014 joining Democrats in voting against it. Those defections \u2014 nearly one in five GOP lawmakers \u2014 underscored the party's chasm over immigration and the election-year pressures Republicans face to stay true to districts that range from staunchly conservative to pro-immigrant. The failed immigration bill would have authorized -- but not fully appropriated -- $25 billion in border funding and provided nonimmigrant legal status to some 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. A vote is expected tomorrow on a compromise immigration bill that also faces long odds. It includes a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, and fully appropriates $25 billion for\u00a0 President Trump's border wall plan.

            "article_content": "Congress at an impasse on immigration reform as rhetoric heats up across the country. President Trump on Thursday renewed his call to overhaul the deportation system so that illegal border crossers are swiftly sent back to their home countries and not processed by the immigration courts, likening the situation to stopping an intruder \u201con your front lawn.\u201d \u201cTell the people \u2018OUT,\u2019 and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. Hiring thousands of \u2018judges\u2019 does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this!\u201d Trump tweeted. He followed up with a message to Congress: \"FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!\" It was the latest in a series of sometimes-conflicting messages from the president on how Congress should address illegal immigration. He suggested weeks ago that Republicans wait until after the November elections to take up the issue, but then urged the House to pass a sweeping Republican-authored immigration and border security overhaul. After it failed, Trump claimed over the weekend \u2013 on Twitter, the same social media forum he used to urge passage of the bill \u2013 that he \u201cnever pushed the Republicans in the House\u201d to vote for it because it couldn\u2019t pass in the Senate. He again called to elect more Republicans. On Thursday morning, he returned to calling on Congress to act in the near-term. \u201cCongress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now. Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our \u2026 Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial,\u201d he tweeted. The tweets reflect an ever-changing \u2013 and always-challenging \u2013 legislative landscape on immigration. Democrats have hammered the Trump administration over the practice of separating families caught crossing the border illegally, as a result of \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policies. Trump has moved to end that practice, but the controversy has complicated any chance of passing legislation. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly suggested as he did Thursday that the federal government should institute a practice of simply sending border crossers back instead of using immigration judges to process their cases. Such calls have led to accusations that this would be wrongly denying due process.",

Trump opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, who said: \u201cThis is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.\u201d However, that photo and other related images were published by The Arizona Republic in 2014, deep into Obama\u2019s second term. Favreau later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told \"Fox & Friends\" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon. \"They didn't really care about the story about the migrant children,\" she said. The photos were circulated amid a debate over the Justice Department\u2019s zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated. The Justice Department says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane. \u201cIf you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this month. \u201cIf you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you.

Josh Zepnick lost the Tuesday primary to Marisabel Cabrera, an immigration attorney who was endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List. Zepnick\u00a0was removed from legislative committees in December and was not allowed to meet privately with other Assembly Democrats after he was accused of kissing two women against their will at political events in 2011 and 2015. Both women claimed he was drunk when he kissed them without their consent. Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz called on him to resign. Instead, Zepnick ran for re-election. Zepnick, who was first elected in 2002, apologized for his behavior and blamed it on alcoholism, WISN-TV reported. He was also arrested for drunk driving in 2015. State Rep. Josh Zepnick was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2015. He's blamed alcohol on his behavior with women after two accused him of kissing them without permission at various political events.

Some protesters even showed up around Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster, N.J., where he is spending the weekend, waving signs bearing such sentiments as \u201cDo you know where our children are?\u201d and \u201cEven the Trump family belongs together.\u201d In Indianapolis, Scott Burns holds his daughter, Annelle, during a protest of the administration's approach to illegal border crossings and family separations at the border.

Some great legislation awaits - be smart!\u201d \"Cryin' Chuck\" was a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-.N.Y. The president\u2019s tweets echoed remarks he made\u00a0earlier this month, when he said the GOP needed to quit \u201cwasting their time\u201d on crafting immigration legislation \u201cuntil after we elect more Senators and Congressman/women in November.\u201d \u201cWe can pass great legislation after the Red Wave,\u201d he tweeted.

            "article_content": "Democrats target agency as debate heats up over hot-button issue. Some Democrats\u00a0have joined the call to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency \u2013 especially under President Trump\u2019s administration. ICE was created through the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in 2001. According to its website, ICE \u201cwas granted a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities to better protect national security and public safety in answer to the tragic events on 9/11.\u201d Housed within DHS, ICE is in charge of executing hundreds of federal immigration statutes. As more Democrats push back on the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies\u00a0\u2013 including the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy for illegal immigrants that resulted in thousands of children being separated from their families until the president signed an executive order\u00a0\u2013some are seemingly warming up to the idea that ICE should be eradicated or completely redone. While some Democrats see calling on ICE to end could be a winning way to rally the party\u2019s base in the 2020 presidential primaries, others have waffled on the idea or been unsupportive completely. Trump suggested that Democrats who continue to push for abolishing ICE will \u201cget beaten so badly\u201d in the 2018 midterm elections in an interview with Fox News. \u201cYou know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out because they\u2019re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou get rid of ICE, you\u2019re going to have a country that you\u2019re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.\u201d From lawmakers to congressional candidates, read on for a look at some Democrats who have begun to call for the abolition of ICE. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, seen as a potential 2020 contender, told CNN in late June that she believes ICE should be abolished. The New York Democrat said ICE has \u201cbecome a deportation force\u201d and said we \u201cshould get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.\u201d In a series of tweets, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said \u201cit is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d ICE and other agencies would need to be restructured, Sanders continued. \u201cCongress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system,\u201d Sanders said. Speaking at a rally in Boston on June 30, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., slammed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, saying he \u201cseems to think that the only way to have immigration rule is to rip parents from their family ... treat rape victims and refugees like terrorists and to put children in cages,\u201d according to Real Clear Politics. \u201cThe president\u2019s deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works,\u201d Warren said. While comparing ICE to broken phone app or computer program, Rep. Earl Blumenauer said of ICE to \u201cshut it down\u201d in a June 24 blog post. He noted that he voted against the creation of the agency in 2002. TOP DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BUCKS CALLS TO ABOLISH ICE: \u2018WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT\u2019 \u201cWe should abolish ICE and start over, focusing on our priorities to protect our families and our borders in a humane and thoughtful fashion,\u201d Blumenauer said. \u201cNow is the time for immigration reform that ensures people are treated with compassion and respect. Not only because it is the moral thing to do, but it\u2019s better policy and will cost less.\u201d \u201cTo regain the trust of the American people, it\u2019s time we abolish ICE,\u201d he added. Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., was one of three lawmakers who introduced legislation that would abolish the federal immigration agency. \u201cWe are pushing to bring an end to ICE as the agency has strayed too far from its original mission, intent and purpose,\u201d Espaillat said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cIn the era of President Trump, ICE has been granted an unlimited range to terrorize Latino communities around the country, regardless of citizenship or status. \u201cWe are witnessing a human rights crisis, and our bill would bring forward a new model and dismantle ICE once and for all,\u201d he said. The Democrats who brought the bill forth \u2013 which included Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \u2013 ultimately said they would not vote for it, accusing House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, of creating a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Democracy Now\u00a0she would \u201clove to see ICE go.\u201d And in an interview with The Hill, Jayapal said she supports calls \u201cto take a rogue agency and completely get rid of it and start over,\u201d adding that \u201cnobody\u2019s saying, \u2018Don\u2019t have the functions that are necessary for the enforcement of immigration laws.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe need to set up a commission that looks at the alternatives to ICE and really starts to understand how do we have these functions in a way that is accountable, transparent and humane,\u201d she said. On his re-election campaign website, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., says \u201cit\u2019s time to abolish ICE.\u201d \u201cWe need to start a fresh conversation. If there are elements that work, we can maintain and strengthen those aspects. Otherwise, we need to thoroughly re-evaluate and re-think immigration enforcement,\u201d he said. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., has done more than just call for eradicating ICE; he\u2019s written legislation that would do just that. WHAT TRUMP\u2019S \u2018ZERO-TOLERANCE\u2019 IMMIGRATION POLICY MEANS FOR CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM FAMILIES AT BORDER \u201cUnfortunately, the president has created this situation where ICE isn\u2019t doing what it was created to do. It\u2019s being used used as his own personal police force, and in those actions it\u2019s actually making us less safe because the critical functions of ICE can no longer happen when the president has them going after people in churches and workplaces,\u201d Pocan told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s just been made a mess.\u201d Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who represents New York\u2019s 7th congressional district, said getting rid of ICE would be \u201can important step.\u201d \u201cICE is being used to terrorize immigrant communities and carry out President Trump\u2019s immoral \u2018zero-tolerance\u2019 policy,\u201d Velazquez said in a statement. \u201cMoreover, the agency\u2019s almost myopic focus on harassing and targeting immigrants distracts from priorities most Americans actually share \u2013 like cracking down on transnational criminals and sex traffickers.\u201d \u201cAt this point, modest reforms at the margins of the agency are insufficient. The time has come to abolish ICE,\u201d she continued. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, echoed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0\u2013 a young congressional candidate who stunned the political world when she beat longtime incumbent Rep. Joe Crawley in New York\u2019s Democratic primary\u00a0\u2013 in calling for the eradication of ICE. He said while every nation needs a \u201csensible, transparent immigration regulation\u201d agency, ICE is not that for the U.S. \u201cICE\u2019s time has come and gone. It is broken,\u201d de Blasio told WNYC in an interview. \u201cICE has been sent on a very negative, divisive mission, and it cannot function the way it is. So I think that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is right. We should abolish ICE. We should create something better, something different.\u201d Even before he became the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Florida, Andrew Gillum expressed his desire to abolish ICE. Gillum, the progressive Tallahassee mayor, said he supports \u201ca comprehensive immigration overhaul that includes abolishment of ICE in its current form to be replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency that actually keeps us safer,\u201d the Orlando Sentinel reported. \u201cDonald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency \u2013 not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cA decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice; we can have them both, and I promise to fight for that as Governor.\u201d Gillum faces Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has been endorsed by Trump, in November. Former \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, has called ICE a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d in calling for it to be dissolved. \u201cICE has strayed so far away from its mission. It is supposed to be here to keep Americans safe, but what has turned into, frankly, is a terrorist organization of its own that is terrorizing people who are coming into this country,\u201d Nixon said during an event at a Manhattan church. \u2018ABOLISH ICE\u2019 GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS Previously, she told \u201cThe View\u201d that ICE should be abolished because it has \u201cstrayed so far from the interests of the American people and the interests of humanity.\u201d She said it wouldn\u2019t need to be replaced with anything else. Already in the primary, Nixon has been credited with pushing Cuomo to the left on some issues. Cuomo has said he doesn\u2019t support abolishing ICE but did call them a \"bunch of thugs\" during a gubernatorial debate. A Democrat running for outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s congressional seat in Wisconsin, Randy Bryce called for the abolishment of ICE. Bryce accused ICE of having \u201cgrown power hungry, sucking up more and more federal resources and directing them towards the deportation of children and families, who are otherwise completely law-abiding,\u201d on\u00a0his campaign website. WOMAN ESCORTED DOWN AFTER SCALING STATUE OF LIBERTY FOLLOWING ANTI-ICE PROTESTS \u201cAccordingly, Randy believes that ICE should be abolished, and Congress should explore which existing agency could best house immigration and customs enforcement, so that only those who pose a true threat to our country\u2019s security face deportation,\u201d his website said. Abolishing ICE is part of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s platform as she runs for Congress in New York. Ocasio-Cortez, who is only 28, beat the incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York\u2019s Democratic primary in June. \u201cAs overseen by the Trump administration, ICE operates with virtually no accountability, ripping apart families and holding our friends and neighbors indefinitely in inhumane detention centers scattered across the United States,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign website states. \u201cAlex believes that if we are to uphold civic justice, we must abolish ICE and see to it that our undocumented neighbors are treated with the dignity and respect owed to all people, regardless of citizenship status.\u201d According to the liberal Mother Jones magazine, Ocasio-Cortez was one of the first congressional candidates in 2018 who called for the eradication of ICE.

            "article_content": "President Trump on Friday held a rally in Arizona in hopes to support the Republican cause in the state and touched on a wide range of issues, ranging from immigration to the job market prior to next month's pivotal mid-term elections. \"Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs,\" he said, adding that the Democrats have become too extreme to be entrusted with power. He described them as an \"angry, unhinged mob.\" Trump welcomed Senate candidate Martha McSally to the stage during the event. McSally is facing off in the state against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. Trump called McSally \"a great veteran\" and \"a great fighter, a warrior.\" McSally was an\u00a0Air Force colonel and combat fighter pilot. Trump said the state needs a senator who will fight \"and never let you down.\" He described Sinema as a far-left extremist. The president also praised Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0on Friday. \u201cCongressman Andy Biggs is doing a great job for Arizona and our Country!\u201d Trump said\u00a0in response to a\u00a0tweet\u00a0from Biggs, who said it would \u201cbe an exciting day in Arizona with\u201d the president \u201cin town.\u201d During his speech, Trump touted the economy, prioritizing veterans and the military and Republican positions on immigration. He\u00a0accused\u00a0Democrats of supporting policies that would increase illegal immigration -- which he said would bring gangs, drugs and crime. He said America needs a border wall and a merit-based immigration system. He also referenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying that he could \"no longer\" refer to her as \"Pocahontas\" since \"she has no Indian blood.\"Earlier this week, the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts\u00a0released her DNA\u00a0test results to\u00a0The Boston Globe, and then to the public. The results revealed \"strong evidence\" Warren had a Native-American ancestor dating back six to 10 generations. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton, a favorite target for Republicans ahead of the midterms, saying it\u2019s pretty amazing that you can delete 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena \"and our justice department doesn\u2019t do anything about it.\" He briefly touched on the pulling the U.S. pulling out of the \"horrible\" North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Iran nuclear deal and the potential creation of a space force. NAFTA was recently replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Fox News\u2019 Matt Richardson, Alex Pappas, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former California GOP vice chair Harmeet Dhillon discusses the right to vote and citizenship. The Texas Democratic Party is under investigation after being accused of sending out voter-registration applications to non-citizens with the citizenship box already checked \u201cYes.\u201d The possible violation was first raised Thursday by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF), a nonprofit specializing in election integrity, which alerted both state and federal authorities. Following the reports of the alleged violation, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the issue is \u201cbeing investigated\u201d and \u201cthere will be serious consequences\u201d if confirmed. \u201cA complaint says the Texas Democratic Party asked noncitizens to register to vote, sending applications with citizenship box pre-checked. This is being investigated. If true there will be serious consequences,\u201d he wrote in a tweet. PILF said the applications were circulated around the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas sometime between late September and early October and some lawfully present non-citizens received the forms. The group published all the documents related to the election registration irregularity, including pictures of the applications where boxes asking whether the applicant is both 18 and a U.S. citizen were already checked in the \u201cYes\u201d field. The group also included a signed affidavit from David C. Kifuri Jr, who said his non-citizen relatives received the application form from the state Democratic Party. \u201cI know from previous work experience \u2026 that it is a crime to register to vote in Texas if you are a felon with an incomplete sentence or a non-U.S. citizen. I also understand that a non-U.S. citizen can face criminal and immigration jeopardy for misrepresenting citizenship status for the purpose of voter registration,\u201d Kifuri stated. Texas\u2019 Secretary of State Sam Taylor told the Washington Times that some non-citizens contacted his office asking whether there\u00a0were\u00a0any law changes that gave them the right to vote. He added that the state law prohibits encouraging anyone to lie in their voter application form, but it will be up to the investigators to decide if pre-checking a box claiming the applicant is a U.S. citizen is a violation of the law. Names of non-US citizens increasingly found on voter rolls PILF has previously warned about non-citizens increasingly found on voter rolls in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia. The group said some non-citizens even managed to cast their ballots in elections. For instance, in 2017, the group said that nearly 5,600 people on the voter rolls in Virginia were deemed as non-citizens, with a third of them voting in previous elections. But the case in Texas is different from other states, where a lot of non-citizens often get automatically registered, as it was a political party that urged people to register. \u201cThis is how the Texas Democratic Party is inviting foreign influence in an election in a federal election cycle,\u201d Logan Churchwell, spokesman for the PILF, told the Times.",

They happen upon an old fish who says \u201cMorning boys! How\u2019s the water today?\u201d A moment later one young fish turns to the other and says \u201cWhat\u2019s water?\u201d We share that one from time to time because much of the work in politics is managing to be aware of what really surrounds us \u2014 to know what we\u2019re really swimming in. So when it comes to the 2018 election, is Russia the water or a shiny lure jigging through it? Republicans have tended to generally underestimate the significance of Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election and specifically as it relates to how voters will behave this fall. Ostriches gonna ostrich. Democrats have tended to overestimate the matter, but only in fits and spurts. One day it\u2019s all \u201clet\u2019s really talk about health care because impeachment is too much\u201d and the next day it\u2019s \u201cIMPEACH!!!!!\u201d Now if that day happens to be the one in which the president delivers a singularly craven performance in front of Russia\u2019s ruler, one can understand why there might be some difference in tone. But the inconstancy in Democratic alarm levels isn\u2019t reserved just for big moments like President Trump\u2019s Finnish face plant. Democratic leaders have alternately raised the possibility that the sitting president is an actual Kremlin stooge and then suggested they\u2019d really rather talk about Medicaid funding. If they think our government is really being led by a Russian operative, maybe stay on topic, folks. The inconstancy, therefore, suggests insincerity. The president and his most ardent water carriers of the Hill are guilty of the same thing in the other direction. If Team Trump really believed that our Justice Department was the den of treasonous vipers it describes they wouldn\u2019t be so prone to distraction and misdirection. Cynicism abounds. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t the truly deranged among us. Poor John Brennan. One supposes he feels some guilt for not preventing the Russian hack as CIA director. But his response to President Trump\u2019s selfish bungling in Helsinki is the kind of hyperbole that makes it easier for the White House to resist real criticism. Or how about the crew in the House Freedom Caucus? They seem to have been backed down at the end, but these guys were going to introduce articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the day after Trump\u2019s ignominy. When it comes to running interference for the White House, some days are better than others. Whatever the excesses of the victims of Russia Derangement Syndrome on both sides, though, there\u2019s no question that the issue will be a motivator for both sets of base voters. If we have to choose, though, we\u2019d come down on the side that the energy and unity the issue provides for Democrats is greater in force and purpose than it is for Republicans. But what about persuadable voters? There are the reverberations from the base voters \u2014 concerns among moderates about either a messy impeachment or a president who might not be on the level as it relates to our chief foreign foe. More significant, though, is the degree to which no story can break through the usual rime of news coverage the way Russia does. Even Trump, master media manipulator, doesn\u2019t understand the megaton load of this subject. And in their approach to try to discredit the investigation rather than minimize it, the White House has only increased the size of the payload. There have been times for both sides that for days on end there is only Russia, stretched out like Siberia from the Urals to the Pacific. And we can be sure that for at least the next two months, there will be many more revelations.

Rep. Martha Roby is facing Democrat-turned-Trump Republican Bobby Bright on Tuesday, trying not to become the third congressional Republican to lose her job this primary season. From the outside, the race shouldn\u2019t be close. Roby is a four-term incumbent in deep-red Alabama. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have endorsed her. And her Republican opponent supported Nancy Pelosi when he served as a Democrat in Congress. But as is often the case in the Trump era, the conventional rules of politics do not apply. Roby\u2019s survival depends on whether voters are sufficiently convinced she\u2019s on board with Trump\u2019s agenda after criticizing him in 2016 when he was caught bragging about sexually predatory behavior in the infamous \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape.\u201d Poll shows Rohrabacher in tight race with challenger -\u00a0Monmouth University:\u00a0\u201cThe race for California\u2019s 48th Congressional District between Republican incumbent\u00a0Dana Rohrabacher\u00a0and Democratic challenger\u00a0Harley Rouda\u00a0is virtually tied according to the Monmouth University Poll. Although Republicans have a natural registration advantage in this Orange County district, higher Democratic enthusiasm and divided voter opinion on Rohrabacher are making this a competitive race. Democrats are slightly more satisfied than Republicans with the person who emerged from the June primary as their party\u2019s nominee. Rouda registers 46% support and Rohrabacher has the backing of 43% among all potential voters \u2013 that is voters who have participated in an election since 2010 or have newly registered to vote (a group that represents about 89% of all registered voters in the district). The state of the race does not change much when applying two different likely voter models.\u201d Rep. Khanna: The \u2018Democratic disrupter\u2019 -\u00a0National Review:\u00a0\u201cRep.\u00a0Ro Khanna represents Silicon Valley, so it stands to figure that in his first term he is becoming known as a Democratic disrupter. Khanna, 41, an uber-ambitious freshman, former tech lawyer, and Obama administration veteran, has received plaudits from his colleagues for his audacious jobs legislation and enterprising foreign policy ideas and has coauthored op-eds with everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Rep.\u00a0John Lewis. He has also been raising eyebrows all over Capitol Hill by committing the cardinal sin of American politics: Endorsing primary challengers over his own Democratic colleagues. Khanna himself earned his seat on his third primary attempt against entrenched incumbents. But his endorsement of Ferguson, Missouri activist Cori Bush\u00a0in the race against Rep.\u00a0William\u00a0Lacy Clay\u00a0only months into his first term was different.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez starts controversy with comments on Israeli \u2018occupation\u2019 -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic socialist who became a rising political star after her victory in New York\u2019s congressional primary last month, referred to Israel\u2019s \u2018occupation\u2019 of Palestine in an interview before admitting that she is \u201cnot the expert\u201d on the subject. During an interview on PBS\u2019s \u2018Firing Line\u2019 on Friday the congressional candidate raised eyebrows when she said, \u2018I also think that what people are starting to see-- at least in the occupation of Palestine-- is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian condition and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue.\u2019 \u2026 The Washington Examiner ran an opinion piece titled, \u2018Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Talks About the \u2018Occupation of Palestine\u2019 but She Doesn\u2019t Know What That Means.\u2019 \u2018Even with her degree in international relations, the lack of knowledge beyond buzzwords should not be surprising,\u2019 the magazine wrote.\u201d Illinois gubernatorial candidates give millions to their own campaigns - Chicago Tribune:\u00a0\u201cAnyone with a TV already knows that Republican Gov.\u00a0Bruce Rauner\u00a0and Democratic challenger\u00a0J.B. Pritzker\u00a0are both spending a bundle of cash on their campaigns, but records show Pritzker has spent far more in the last few months. Pritzker\u2019s campaign spent $20.1 million in the second quarter of the year, compared to $7.8 million by Rauner\u2019s campaign. And that\u2019s long before the traditional big push that begins after Labor Day. Both candidates should have plenty of money for the final sprint later this year. At the end of June, Pritzker still had $18.3 million in the bank, compared to $31.8 million for Rauner. The campaign finance reports released Monday evening also document where the campaigns are getting their money, but that hasn\u2019t been much of a secret. The governor gave his campaign $50 million back in late 2016, and hedge fund founder\u00a0Ken Griffin\u00a0chipped in $20 million last year. Pritzker has given his campaign more than $100 million already.\u201d Georgia governor endorses Cagle -\u00a0AJC:\u00a0\u201cGov.\u00a0Nathan Deal\u00a0endorsed Lt. Gov.\u00a0Casey Cagle\u00a0on Monday in the race to succeed him, giving the Republican candidate key support from a popular incumbent in his July 24 race against Secretary of State\u00a0Brian Kemp. The governor called Cagle the best candidate to continue his \u2018tradition\u2019 of conservative leadership, making the announcement during a question-and-answer session at the end of an unrelated press conference at the state Capitol. \u2018My point of view is not personal. I have known both of these candidates in our Republican runoff, and I think very highly of both of them,\u2019 Deal said. \u2018My concern is, let\u2019s not undo, or transform in a negative fashion, the good reforms that we\u2019ve put in place.\u2019\u201d DEM HOUSE CHALLENGERS OUTRAISE SENATE CANDIDATESRoll Call:\u00a0\u201cIt used to be normal for fundraising by Senate candidates to dwarf that of House candidates. Not this year. New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat trying to flip a longtime Republican stronghold, raised nearly $1.9 million during the second quarter of the year. That\u2019s more than at least one Democratic senator facing a competitive re-election and at least five Republicans running for Senate in competitive races this year. Sherrill, a first-time candidate, isn\u2019t the only Democratic House challenger who raised just as much or more than Senate hopefuls this year. At least 11 others have raised nearly $1.1 million or more. By comparison, West Virginia Democratic Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin III\u00a0raised just $1.5 million during the same period. And his GOP challenger, who had to spend money in a nasty May primary, raised even less. \u2026 But the enormous fundraising totals posted by some House challengers in traditionally red districts \u2014 and the fact that they nearly meet or exceed those of a handful of competitive Senate candidates \u2014 captures just how much energy there is among Democrats about winning the House in November.\u201d Schneider, a Blue Dog Dem, votes with GOP more -\u00a0Roll Call: \u201cBlue Dog Democrats tend to move to the right in election years, which is understandable given that they typically represent swing districts. And lately no district has swung more than Illinois\u2019 10th, in the affluent suburbs north of Chicago. Democratic Rep.\u00a0Brad Schneider\u00a0is currently serving his second, nonconsecutive term, having defeated Republican\u00a0Robert J. Dold\u00a0in 2016. \u2026 In 2017, Schneider was a relatively loyal Democrat, voting with his party on House votes that split a majority of Democrats from a majority of Republicans\u2026 But this year, he\u2019s tied with Texas\u2019\u00a0Henry Cueller\u00a0with the second-lowest CQ party unity score among Democrats as of the end of June\u2026\u201d HOUSE TO VOTE ON ICE RESOLUTION WEDNESDAY Roll Call: \u201cHouse Republicans have abandoned a plan to vote on a Democrat-sponsored bill to terminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency after the bill\u2019s authors said they and their colleagues would vote against it. But GOP leaders are still planning to hold a vote on a resolution by Louisiana GOP Rep.\u00a0Clay Higgins\u00a0expressing the House\u2019s support for all ICE officers and personnel and denouncing calls to completely abolish the agency. The vote on Higgins\u2019 resolution will occur Wednesday, House Majority Leader\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0said. It will be brought up under an expedited procedure known as suspension of the rules, which requires two-thirds support for passage. The other bill Republicans had been planning a vote on would have terminated ICE within a year of Congress enacting \u2018a humane immigration enforcement system\u2019 to be designed by a commission the legislation would establish. The measure was introduced Thursday by Progressive Caucus Co-Chairman\u00a0Mark Pocan\u00a0and members\u00a0Pramila Jayapal\u00a0and\u00a0Adriano Espaillat.\u201d As veterans spending dispute continues WH gets involved - Politico: \u201cInviting more stopgap spending, the White House has fired off an official warning against congressional efforts to blow through budget limits. Top Trump administration officials sent a letter Monday cautioning lawmakers against raising spending caps to accommodate shifts in funding for a popular veterans health program, though they stopped short of threatening a veto. Many Democrats \u2014 and some powerful Senate Republicans \u2014 are insisting billions of dollars be spent beyond the limit agreed upon in this year\u2019s grand budget deal. The White House\u2019s public stand draws battle lines in the first major showdown ahead of this fall\u2019s funding deadline, endangering congressional efforts to clear updated spending levels before fiscal 2018 cash runs out Sept. 30.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYMeadows, Jordan seek DOJ investigation into Rosenstein -\u00a0Roll Call Charlotte to host 2020 Republican National Convention -\u00a0Charlotte Observer U.S. Commerce Department denies request to exempt pipeline company from tariffs -\u00a0WSJ AUDIBLE: BUT PROBABLY NAH\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you want Americans to listen to my opinions could you just wait for a little bit?\u201d \u2013 An exasperated\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0as the Russian ruler faced the dogged questioning of Chris Wallace\u00a0in an interview Monday.

The two troopers were on patrol in a yellow Ford Mustang, an unmarked vehicle generally used to target aggressive drivers, DPS said. The troopers ran a check of Disbro\u2019s license plate, which revealed the car belonged to a private citizen and not a public agency, officials said. Shortly after, Disbro activated his flashing lights and attempted to pull the troopers over, DPS said in a news release. The troopers did not pull over, at which point Disbro drove alongside the troopers and yelled and waved his hand at them, DPS said.

            "article_content": "Protesters camped outside City Hall march in the street after a decision about ICE was made, Friday July 27, 2018, in Philadelphia. Mayor Jim Kenney announced Friday that Philadelphia will stop giving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) access to a real-time arrest database. (AP) Philadelphia has announced it will end a major information-sharing contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), bowing to intense pressure from activist groups and drawing immediate condemnation from federal officials. The move means that the city will not renew a decade-long arrangement to share real-time arrest information with ICE when it expires at the end of August. The information, contained in Philadelphia\u2019s\u00a0Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (PARS), alerts authorities when new arrests are made, and includes arrestee's full names, countries of origin, and Social Security numbers. While PARS does not indicate immigration status, Democrats charged that ICE nevertheless abused the database to investigate potential immigration violations. Anyone who interacts with law enforcement is entered into the database, including those who are arrested, victims and witnesses, with some limits on what ICE officers can view. \u201cI cannot in good conscience allow the agreement to continue,\u201d Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney told the Philadelphia Inquirer about Friday's announcement.\u00a0\"We're not going to provide them with information so they can go out and round people up.\" He added:\u00a0\"If I could abolish ICE, I would. But we can abolish this contract, and we are.\" The city's decision comes after \"Occupy ICE\" protesters established a tent-filled encampment outside city hall and staged weeks of raucous demonstrations. PORTLAND VOWS TO CLEAN UP 'DISGUSTING' OCCUPY ICE CAMP, CALLING IT A BIOHAZARD On Wednesday, more than a dozen activists\u00a0stormed city hall\u00a0and blockaded an internal stairwell for more than an hour after police rebuffed their attempt to rally directly outside the mayor's office. U.S. Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman called the decision irresponsible and said the city will end up \"harboring criminal aliens.\" \"Sanctuary-city policies make American communities like Philadelphia less safe by putting the rights of criminal aliens over the safety and security of American citizens,\" Waldman said. \"Despite the misguided action taken by Philadelphia today, DHS will continue to work to remove illegal aliens and uphold public safety.\" \"Sanctuary-city policies make American communities like Philadelphia less safe.\" Kenney claimed immigration officers are wrongly using the database to go to homes and workplaces of people who list foreign countries of origin and arresting other people who are in the country illegally but are otherwise not accused of any other crimes. But in a statement to Fox News, ICE officials reiterated that the agency had not breached its agreement with Philadelphia in any way, including by engaging in racial profiling or accessing information without the city's approval. They added that they were \"deeply disappointed\" in the city's decision, saying the city had not pointed to any specific instances of alleged misconduct by ICE. Two of three stakeholders in the contract \u2014 the city, the district attorney and the city courts \u2014 had to vote to end it. District Attorney Larry Krasner had said this month he would oppose the contract's renewal, saying it promotes oppressive practices. Kenney\u00a0said the federal agency's actions have created fear and distrust in the city's immigrant community. FEDERAL JUDGE DEALS SETBACK TO TRUMP'S CRACKDOWN ON SANCTUARY CITIES The Trump administration has long railed against sanctuary cities like Philadelphia, but its efforts to put words into practice have run into legal trouble. On Friday, a federal district court judge ruled that the administration cannot withhold public safety grants from Chicago to pressure the city to stop providing sanctuary to immigrants, saying the policy amounted to unconstitutional\u00a0coercion by the federal government. And last year, a federal judge issued an injunction against Trump's executive order denying federal funding to sanctuary cities on Tenth Amendment grounds. In Philadelphia, Kenney was videotaped last month dancing and singing, \"We're a sanctuary city!\" after a similar court win there. ICE has previously said it would focus on immediate deportation for people in the country illegally who had felony convictions or who were suspected of felonies. Calls to abolish the agency -- including some from top Democrats and presidential hopefuls Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- grew into a frenzy after the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" illegal immigration policy resulted in more separations of adults from accompanying minors at the border. Though Trump signed an executive order to end the separations, reuniting some families remains a work in progress. Still, efforts to get rid of ICE have fizzled since earlier this month, when\u00a0the GOP-controlled House\u00a0called a vote on a resolution expressing support\u00a0for the agency. The vote effectively dared Democrats to go on the record with opposition to the agency. The measure passed, with a total of 133 Democratic representatives voting \"present\" -- amounting to a procedural refusal to take a position despite weeks of heated anti-ICE rhetoric from party leaders. Northeastern University students in Boston protest the school's contract with ICE. (AP) WATCH:\u00a0PHILLY MAYOR DANCES, CELEBRATES CITY'S SANCTUARY CITY STATUS As a sanctuary city, Philadelphia had already limited cooperation with immigration enforcement. It won't release inmates to ICE without a judicial warrant. Philadelphia entered into the contract in 2008, city solicitor Marcel Pratt said, and revised it in 2009 to shield witness and victim information from the agency, as well as to eliminate immigration status. In a termination letter sent to ICE on Thursday, Pratt said the contract \"has created the false perception that the city is willing to be an extension of ICE.\" Several colleges with ties to ICE are also being pressured to split with the agency. Earlier this month, students and community activists marched at Northeastern University in Boston, demanding the school cancel a multimillion-dollar research contract with ICE. The school was hired by ICE to research U.S. technology exports. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President says a 'red wave' in November is needed to pass legislation over 'obstructing' Democrats; Doug McKelway reports from the 'White House.' President Trump threw in the towel Friday with a tweet telling Republicans in Congress to \"stop wasting their time\" on immigration legislation until after the November elections. He said that next year they should try again to overcome their internal disputes on the issue. The reason for the president\u2019s reversal was those elections. Polls show the GOP electorate is split on immigration. Even among Republicans over the age of 50, over 40 percent oppose President Trump\u2019s actions on family separation. Control of the House of Representatives will be determined by election results in suburban congressional districts with large numbers of highly educated voters that are now represented by Republicans. With some exceptions, such as in Minnesota, the key races that will determine which party wins a House majority will not be fought in the blue-collar, populist districts that swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in 2016. The generic vote for Congress is close.\u00a0A tough policy on immigration may bring out President Trump\u2019s base to vote, but the public relations disaster of family separations threatened to drive suburban voters \u2013 especially women \u2013 to the Democrats. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think that putting kids in cages is likely to go over very well with suburban moms,\u201d\u00a0Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, told The Atlantic magazine. Trump aides hope that by now combining tough rhetoric on issues such as sanctuary cities with ducking a bruising political battle in Congress, they will thread the needle and allow Republicans to keep the House. Two new polls indicate that immigration may not be quite the potent issue it was for Trump in 2016. Ironically, the surging economy has lowered the number of people trying to cross the border or overstay their visas. A new Gallup poll finds that only 29 percent of Americans think legal immigration should be reduced. A plurality of 39 percent think it should stay at current levels, while 28 percent want immigration increased. A large majority favor allowing \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the U.S. as children and are now protected by the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to remain in the country. Republicans have learned that without a fully thought out strategy, immigration can boomerang as an issue. President continues to blame Democrats for the situation at the border; Kevin Corke reports from the White House. In last year\u2019s Virginia governor\u2019s race, Republican Ed Gillespie backed President Trump and ran commercials in northern Virginia touting the need to crush MS-13, a gang with ties to Central America that had made inroads in the area. But the northern Virginia counties swung away from Gillespie, as suburban voters indicated they had other priorities. In Loudoun County, Gillespie won only 39 percent of the vote, barely edging Trump\u2019s 2016 showing. Only five years earlier, Mitt Romney had won 47 percent in Loudoun. President Trump makes some strong points on the need to restore the rule of law in our approach to border enforcement, especially given that many Democrats appear to have largely moved towards a position where they barely support the notion of a border at all. But sometimes it\u2019s best to live to fight another day. President Trump made a hash of his family separation policy in much the same way he mishandled the travel ban that he declared in his administration\u2019s first week in office. An understaffed White House came up with a family separation plan that wasn\u2019t fully thought through and wasn\u2019t run by relevant officials in the Cabinet departments. When it came under fire, the Trump White House ended up with a surreal 14 different explanations for its actions. It\u2019s no wonder that Rep. Mike Coffman, a conservative Republican representing the Denver suburbs, has tweeted: \u201cThe President should put a General, a respected retired CEO or some other senior leadership figure on the job of making sure each and every child is returned to their parents. ... This is a human rights mess. It is on the President to clean it up and fire the people responsible for making it.\u201d Indeed. Anything short of that would be both policy and political malpractice.",

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from the border area, absolutely. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We're coming to you live from the US Mexico border, just south of San Diego as Sean said. The Angle is here so that you can see for yourselves what is really going on here. And during this emotionally charged crisis over children, some of whom have been separated from their illegal immigrant parents, we're going to show you how the Trump administration is actually trying to protect these children and give you a look at their real living conditions. We'll also get the inside story from active border agents putting their lives on the line and cracking down on the human smugglers who are also putting these children in grave danger. And meanwhile, Democrats give away their game, this is great, by turning down legislate fixes, who would want to fix this after all, proving that they would rather hurt the President than help children. Plus Newt Gingrich taps into his vast historical knowledge and reveals why the left is so quick to jump to hysterical comparisons to the holocaust. And what about the tragedy, by the way, of separating American families? A father shares the agony of losing his own son, brutally gunned down a few months ago, here in California by an illegal. But first, protecting America, protecting the children, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. The President has described what we're seeing on the border as a crisis, and it is. Today he explained the legislative trick bag that he's in due to a tangle of at times, conflicting immigration laws that are on the books. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can either release all immigrant families and miners who show -- (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well let's remember there were family detention centers but a 2016 court ruling effectively shut them down. A decision cheered by international migration activist who consider all detainment to be a human rights violation. And due to the Flora settlement, that's a court settlement, a minor cannot be held in custody for more than 20 days. So the administration is left with few choices, it's either enforce the law and arrest the border crossers, separating those families, or just let everybody into the country, no questions asked. Now that also would include human traffickers, drug smugglers and others who are exploiting that they're travelling with. So do you see how irresponsible, and even cruel it would be for the administration to just wave all family units in without even vetting who these people are? Well predictably, Liberals have attempted to focus our attention on images of children, heartbreakings for sure, separated from their parents at the border. But I have a question, where were they just a few years ago when Barack Obama faced a similar surge at the border? I don't recall the same type of wall to wall media outrage then, or the nasty charges that Obama had opened concentration camps for illegal kids. As someone who has spent a lot of time myself, in Central America, I know how desperately hard it is for the children there and the terrible abuses that they endure both at home and in some cases when they come to the United States, that long trek, that entire way. And we're all really concerned about the wellbeing of children and keeping children with their parents, of course, is always the ideal. But the truth of the matter is, the Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielson said it right yesterday, of the 12,000 kids in US custody, its 2,000, not 12,000, but 2,000 of them have been separated from their parents. The rest basically were abandoned, they had not families. Lost in this easy scapegoating of Donald Trump, of course, is a Bush era law that got us into this crisis that we're seeing now at the border. So while its well intention, this flawed piece of legislation, was designed to curb human trafficking, it had a slew of unintended consequences. It was called the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008. That law does not allow the government to immediately deport minors from any country other than Canada and Mexico so no non-contiguous countries. And according to the New York Times, the legislation requires that they have an immigration hearing, an advocate and counsel. It also mandates that they are turned over to Health and Human Services and placed in \"the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child and to explore reuniting those children with family members\". Well that's exactly what the Trump administration is doing. These kids are placed in one of about 100 resettlement centers that are the \"least restrictive setting for the child\". Far from the caged kids canard that has been sold to us on television 24/7, this is footage that HHS had provided to a number of media outlets of a facility here in El Cajon called Casa San Diego. As you can see, they're perfectly clean classrooms, a medical clinic. Walls that are adorned with superheroes and religious cards and the kids, thankfully, are given hot meals every day and there's an outside area for the 65 children who are housed there to play and recreate. It's not ideal but it's not a concentration camp and don't say that. According to the staff at Casa San Diego, only 10% of the kids there were actually separated from their parents. 90% of those residents were trafficked, sent across the border alone. This house is similar to Casa Padre in Texas. It's the largest government contracted Youth Center in the nation. One of the dozens funded by you, the US taxpayers. Once a former Walmart, NPR witness boys at Casa Padre, \"shooting baskets, kicking soccer balls, playing video games, watching a movie, sitting in classrooms where they were taught about US government and they were even learning Thai Chi and they got a meal of chicken and vegetables. That's the NPR's description. Now do those centers look like Dachau to you, Auschwitz? As we reported last night, it costs the US taxpayer about $35,000 a year to keep each of these children housed and cared for in these facilities. But do not confuse the temporary central processing center in McAllen, Texas, completed with fencing and Mylar blankets with the HHS run refugee centers for young people. They are not the same thing but the media are maliciously trying to confuse the two and make people believe that children are being shuttled into cages to languish for month and months. The online virtue signalers, of course, want to keep the emotional heat on this story high, turn it up high so that they smudge the hard facts surrounding it. But the funny thing is that most of those claiming to have this upper hand and compassion towards those seeing a better life, they've never actually been to Central America, and they've never actually witnessed what really helps the kids there. I'll tell you what the best option is, not to lure them on a dangerous journey north with their families or alone. But to give them and their families assistance on the ground and support organizations, many of them faith based, and embedded among the people, that provide them with aid, self-sustainability and real development possibilities. I've seen it first hand, it's amazing, it's inspiring work, groups like Food for the Poor and others. And it certainly didn't come from the government. I've been with these people in remote villages in Guatemala and elsewhere and you know what? Most of them want to stay home and given the opportunity, they would. That said, Congress needs to change our laws so that immigrant families can remain together. Allow the reinstitution of family detention centers so genuine asylum seekers can await trial without being separated from their children. And at the same time, border agents should be allowed to turn back family units from all countries. We simply do not have the manpower, or the money or the resources to stay in the international foster care business. Investigating the relations of every child that enters the US illegally and housing them throughout that entire lengthy process. In the meantime, the President is in kind of an impossible situation. He has a moral obligation to protect the American people and these children now in our care, even as the current law puts those obligations sometimes in conflict. It's time for members of both parties to stop playing politics with the border, and the helicopters. Stop playing politics with the border and these immigrants and act, if you really care, do the right thing. And that's the Angle. Let's bring in our first guest joining me here at the border, Hector Garza is a border patrol agent and vice president of the National Border Patrol Counsel and border patrol agent Terry Shigg, he's the president of the local 1613 Chapter of the National Border Patrol Counsel. Good to see you Hector, hey Terry, how are you man. HECTOR GARZA, US BORDER PATROL AGENT: Good to see you. TERRY SHIGG, US BORDER CONTROL AGENT: Good to see you. INGRAHAM: So you heard what I just said. We've been hearing a lot of stories about how horrific it is for the families crossing the border and they cross illegally, it's a harrowing journey. But you guys are understaffed, overwhelmed ditto for the HHS folks trying to do their best here. GARZA: So we see on a daily basis Laura, we see these kids being abused on the Mexican side. We know when some of these female children come across, their parents send them with Plan B medication because they are expected to be raped along the journey when coming through Mexico, Central America and that's horrific. So our number one goal as border patrol agents is we have to take care of these people when they come into our custody and that's exactly what our agents do. We treat these people with dignity and respect and that's our job and of course we have to protect the border. But we need help from Congress, we need to change those laws that allowing these loopholes to continue. INGRAHAM: Terry you patrol this area, this part of the border, it goes right into the ocean, the border fence goes right into the ocean. Tell me how significant the burden here is for border control even with this pretty significant fencing. SHIGG: For us it's pretty significant. It takes away the resources that we have. We have a limited resources. There is a legitimate way to do it and that's what the ports of entries are there for. Any time someone crosses any area other than the port of entry, that's when we border patrol, we always say we work in the dirt. We don't in the clean, pristine ports of entry. And when you come into those areas, it takes those resources away and that's where the cartels, that's where they win. That's what they want us to do. They want to our resources away so that they ca get their billion dollar industry going to keep their product coming across the United States. INGRAHAM: Yeah Hector explain how it is that a 15 year old boy, from let's say from Honduras, manages to find his way to McAllen, Texas or Rio Grande or in one of the sectors that are east from here, from Imperial Beach? How do they get here? They get here with the help of cartels, right? GARZA: Well basically through the Mexican cartels. They're the ones that are basically orchestrating these activities and they're doing it for a reason. Because they want to tear up our resources because while we're catching these 15 year old kids, they're snuggling terrorists, dangerous weapons, dangerous narcotics, sentinel, cocaine, you name it. So that's all organized by the cartels and we have to a make sure that we stop that. We can't be tied up with that type of work. INGRAHAM: There has been a ten-fold increase in the number of credible fear claims among those who are entering the country, often times with children, but not always with children. It was one in a hundred, that was back in 2011 and now it's one out of ten. Is that an indication that you have, Terry, that people have the script? SHIGG: Oh absolutely, that's one of the blessings and curses of the internet. As soon as somebody gets across and they find out what works, what they do, they get on Facebook, they send an email, they get on their cellphone and talk to the people at home and tell them, \"Okay, that's trial and error, this is what worked, this is what we told them through the script that was gave to us, tell them these exact words\". And you know they'll stick to that exact script, no matter what you ask them, they'll go back to that script. We even have people, we found them with the script on their person -- INGRAHAM: And they actually have it printed out? SHIGG: They actually have it printed out. INGRAHAM: I mean it's pretty obvious, you can't have a ten-fold increase in a few years. A former border control agent Jen Budd had this to say about the job of separating children from their parents. She basically said that you should be literally, there's no excuse for these agents to not literally lay down their guns and badges to say that this is unlawful. She was a border agent for a number of years. She said you all should refuse to do this, lay down your arms, lay down your badges. GARZA: So what's unlawful Laura, is actually allowing these criminal cartels to use these children for their criminal activities. And the other thing is that these cartels will get these kids and pair them up with people that are not even related to those people-- INGRAHAM: How do you tell whose, this is what I'm saying, how do you tell who's who? If someone says, \"Well, this is my child\", I mean who are you to say it's not their child? I mean I don't even understand how you do your job in that regard? GARZA: So in those cases our agents have to conduct these extensive interviews of both parties. And sometimes it's very difficult but sometimes it's very easy. Sometimes you can really tell when someone is a family unit or not and that's when we see abuse of the immigration system. INGRAHAM: Terry do you ever see children who come here, who themselves are afraid of the adult they're with? SHIGG: Oh that's happened on many occasions and look, we are parents. A lot of our guys and gals are mothers and fathers, we have kids of our own. So our instinct is to protect that child, is to make sure that that child's safe and that's we are trying to do. Is it a bad situation? Maybe, but we're doing the best we can with what we have and our main objective is to make sure that that child is safe. INGRAHAM: Terry you were saying just before the show started, for people to understand the flavor of what happens here at the border. Mexico has a sewage pipe, I've been covering this issue of the sewage pipe for years, that pumps raw sewage right into the Pacific Ocean. It goes northward to the beaches, obviously up in La Hoya, Delmar, up the coast where the navy seals train as well, and you've seen this first hand too. Just an environmental disaster at the border. SHIGG: Yes and the news spin to that is what the Mackle-Dora's built and the companies going to Mexico. Now we have pesticides, toxins, heavy metals, all those things on top of the sewage that's coming across and that's what our agents are working in every single day. INGRAHAM: When you guys are dealing with this issue day in and day out, and then you hear people, mostly on the left but not always, claim that you guys are tantamount to Nazi concentration camp guards by \"shuttling these kids into cages\"? GARZA: That's very inaccurate. Our agents go out there every single day and try to treat people with respect and dignity, that's exactly what they do. We go out there, even if we have to take care of the kids while they are in our custody, we provide support for them, we're able to bring in some toys for them while they're in our custody. And these are all things that our agents do on their own. We don't have policies on how to bring toys to kids while you detain them. INGRAHAM: When you bring heart to it, and that's hard because like me you both are parents. Thank you for doing what you do for this country. We really appreciate it, thanks so much, and great stuff. Turning a blind eye to the law just encourages human smuggling that puts these kids into such terrible danger so let's expose the harsh realities of that seedy underworld, with the human trafficking expert and former ICE and INS agent Claude Arnold who has such vast experience in this. Claude you just heard from Terry and Hector. I mean it a heartbreaker because nobody wants to see this type of trafficking of children, it is a wide spread problem. It's not just children hopping on the train and having a nice ride up to the border, that's not how it works. From your perspective with all your years of experience, what is the gritty truth that the media refuses to reveal to the viewers about what really happens to the hands of these cartels? CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE AND INS AGENT: Well the fact is these are criminal organizations and it's driven by the drug trafficking organizations Laura. And these people to them, not just the children, they're commodities. They represent money, they represent revenue and as the border patrol agents pointed out, for the drug cartels it's a twofold thing. It helps them divert resources so they can engage their more lucrative drug trafficking operations. But at the side they also collect money by collecting fees for these people being smuggled through their approaches to the border. And so of course they don't really care about these people and they're willing to exploit the children. That's why they are doing things like paring children up with adults who are not their children. They're willing to stick them in tractor trailers and unsafe conditions. There have been several media counts of that recently. Again, they're just a commodity to them and it's no different with the children. INGRAHAM: Claude from your experience, what would be the most humane path for ending this thing with the kids at the border as much as we could end it? What would be the best path, given your experience? ARNOLD: Right well you need to close the loopholes in the law, of course, and that's got to be done. Let's not take the responsibility off the parents because I'm hearing a lot in the media, blaming US government, blaming border patrol, blaming ICE agents. But bottom line is these parents, they know that they're going to be arrested for illegal entry. They know that there's a zero tolerance policy just like they knew before that would just be admitted and they'd be able to escape later. They have that information. As the border patrol agents pointed out, it's on Facebook the next day. So they are the ones outing their children in this predicament. Subjecting their children to danger and subjecting their children to being separated from them, because they know they're going to be arrested. INGRAHAM: On of our border agents from Texas last night revealed that he's seen on many occasions that when border patrol approaches a \u2018family unit', the so-called parent, who ends up not being the parent, just drops the child runs. And he said we see that all the time. And so I think people have to remember that when the cartels are involved, they're all sorts of competing interests. The kids are caught in the cross hairs but we have to remember that these kids become prime targets for MS13 recruitment and I want to just reveal something to our viewers. More than a third of the 274 MS13 members and their affiliates from that Operation Matador were unaccompanied minors. So that's a third of the 200 plus that's not an insignificant number, they're prime targets for recruitment and another way that their lives are in peril because of these ridiculous governmental policies and irresponsible adults. Claude, thank you so much. ARNOLD: You're welcome. INGRAHAM: And stay right there we have just the man to analyze the real story behind this crisis, Newt Gingrich joins us in just a minute with his solution, don't go away. Welcome back to the Ingraham Angle coming to you tonight from the US Mexico border just south of San Diego. This border crisis touches on so many issues, the humane treatment of children and all border crossers, how much illegal immigration our country can sustain and how the ultimate and final idea, how can we figure this out? The solution will affect the midterm elections and our nation's future. To cover all these bases, we are joined by historian and former House speaker Newt Gingrich from Virginia tonight. Newt you're also the author of the just published, number one best seller on Amazon, \u2018Trump's America'. Congrats, the truth about our nation's great comeback. Newt Gingrich, it's terrific to have you on tonight. It is amazing to me a Newt, that with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, and the President willing to find a solution in all this, that we're still sitting here with this separating children from adults and all the predictable media hysteria surrounding the images that are indeed troubling. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPESKER OF THE HOUSE: Well look, I think it's clear that the President has two obligations and that's two and not one. It's an obligation to be humane towards the children who may be crossing the border illegally. He also has an obligation to the American people. And the people, for example, who have lost loved ones to gangs like MS13 and other people who have been illegal. So the President, I think, is trying to balance both of those obligations. The answer's pretty simple. The answer's a very narrow bill that provides for safety of the children and safety for the border. And it's pretty clear that the Democrats in the Senate are going to basically try to stop this. They've introduced a bill which verges literally on being crazy. Senator Feinstein introduced this bill written so badly that it would cover about 80% of the population of the United States would cover virtually every government official of any kind. It would cover Americans as well as people trying to come into the country illegally. I mean it's one of those things where three people want to do public relations sat down and banged up a bill and I think a number of Democrats are going to find it very hard to defend it when they get back home. But it's also clear that Senator Schumer would use this is an issue to attack Donald Trump than \u2018help children, so let's be clear where the phony, heartless policy is, it's in the Democratic caucus in the Senate. INGRAHAM: Yeah and Newt we just showed some images in McAllen, Texas where the immigrant processing center is. And yeah, there are fences and it looks like cages, but where HHS takes the kids, they do try to humanely take care of them, it's not an easy situation. You've got 12,000 kids, 10,000 of them coming by themselves or trafficked across the border, 2,000 separated from their parents. But they do offer them instruction, they offer them lessons, movies, sporting events, recreation outside. I mean they're trying to do their best but they're not kept in cages indefinitely. So I just want people to understand that. The processing centers are unpleasant and we need to move people through those quickly. Newt this is what some of the people, mostly on the left, have been saying about the, again, the images that you just saw. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC ANCHOR: The children are bring marched away to showers, I know they're being marched away to showers. Are being told they are just like the Nazis and said that they were taking people to showers and then they never came back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Increasingly Donald Trump is turning this nation into Nazi Germany and turning these into concentration camps UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can't find a solution to this problem without harming children, without putting them into concentration camps? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Nazis had it perfectly correct, the declared us an illegal people, that's how it began. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Newt, Dachau, Auschwitz, concentration camps and Casa Padre. GINGRICH: Let's be clear, there are people on the left who despise and hate the United States. They enjoy smearing the United States. They're happy for the entire world to listen to their despicable, dishonest and immoral statements, and there is zero comparison. And to anybody who has been to a movie that I filmed at Auschwitz and a movie we did about Pope John Paul the second, and anybody who has ever gone to one of these camps understands how utterly, totally outrageous it is that people on the left feel that they can smear America with terms like that. There is no comparison of any kind. On the other hand, what would they do? Have totally open borders? Have 100 million people come to the US next year? Wring their hands as American civilization drowned? The fact is, if you're going to have borders, you're going to have to police them. If you police them, you going to have to do something that people, who remember, are deliberately breaking the law. So part of this is not a question people who're victimless and magically show up, the drug cartels in Mexico actively recruit and send people north and do so partially to try to flood our system so that they can bring the drugs in easier. Partially to make money, they charge for doing this and for several of the cartels now have gotten into the people business as a major source of revenue. So I think it's really disturbing to have people on the left who hate their own country so much that they would use this kind of language smearing us all across the world in a way that is simply, absolutely false. INGRAHAM: Yes, $35,000 a year for the U.S. taxpayers per child who crosses the border illegally. And we take, I think, pretty good care of them considering the difficulties they've been through. Newt, this is a congresswoman, Mazie Hirono, who spoke earlier today with even more colorful language than we heard from Chuck Schumer. Watch? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MAZIE HIRONO, D-HAWAII: Mr. President, have a heart for a change. Take that -- pen of yours and do away with this horrendous, inhumane policy of yours that rips children from the arms of their parents. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I didn't mean to demote her to the House of Representatives. Obviously she's a senator. GINGRICH: First of all, if the president could do with it a single motion of the pen he would. There are two court decisions that block it. The law itself blocks it. But the president, I think, is prepared and eager to sign a very narrowly drawn bill. Let me be clear, what the left wants to do is get everybody emotionally upset and then pass the kind of bill which guarantees millions of people will come flooding into the United States. I think that that is a total disservice to every American who wants to live peacefully and wants to live with neighbors that they can trust. And I think, let's have a head-on debate about this. Those people favor totally open borders, make them explain what they would do when 100 million people show up, or as gallop survey two years ago, 165 million people said they'd like to come to the United States. That's over half our population. But second -- INGRAHAM: Newt -- GINGRICH: What she's saying is totally false. INGRAHAM: Newt, Newt, the hypocrisy and the selective moral indignation is beyond stunning. It's disgusting. Anyone with a brain can see it, it's transparent, and we really appreciate the historical perspective and your legislative expertise. Thank you so much. And what about the Americans permanently separated from their families? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Welcome back to \"The Ingraham Angle\" coming to you tonight from the U.S.-Mexico border just north of Tijuana. Dr. Jeffrey Mazin and his wife Penny know all too well what it's like to be separated from their son. Twenty-seven-year-old Alexander Mazin was shot and killed in February just miles from here. The suspect is illegal alienor Ernesto Castellanos Martinez who is still on the loose, thought to be perhaps in Mexico. Dr. Jeffrey Mazin now joins us to share his son's story. I just want to give you a hug. DR. JEFFREY MAZIN, SON WAS MURDERED: Thank you, bless you for the opportunity to be with you. INGRAHAM: Tell me about what happened to your son because we've been hearing about, we are like Dachau and Auschwitz, our country -- like Newt Gingrich said, a lot of people hate this country. And the pain of the families that have suffered at the hands of illegal immigrant cartels, criminals, hit-and-run, DUIS, is ignored by most of the left and most of the media. I refuse to ignore these stories. I want to hear about Alexander. MAZIN: Alexander was a very, very special individual. He was fitness oriented. He was a very religious young man. He loved his God, he loved his country. He was quite the patriot, quite the patriot. He was a small business man. He was a good heart, if you would. And this gentleman, the young man, Alexander, was everybody's model, if you would. He had been dating a lady for a few months, and he was working out at the gym on one beautiful sunny morning. He came out from the gym and there was a man waiting for him in the parking lot. Came behind him, shot him in the back. My son fell on the ground, face up. The man straddled him and pumped four more bullets into his chest. My son died there in the parking lot, like a rat in the street. Obviously every time I tell it, the emotion pours out of me. INGRAHAM: Did you ever hear from any of the major politicians in the state, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, any of the major figures, Jerry Brown? MAZIN: None, none. However, Kristin Gaspar, one of our local representatives, who is really awesome, took Alexander's story to the president directly, and presented it to President Trump. And President Trump's reaction was really amazing. He grimaced. He had tears coming down his face, shaking his head, upset. You could see the uncontrollable upset. INGRAHAM: Nancy Pelosi went to a border facility yesterday, gave a big speech afterward, telling President Trump how dare you, basically, do this to these kids. And, look, nobody wants children to be separated from the families. But you really have been separated from your son, from a lax border policy of an individual who was already deported once, voluntary deportation, and yet he came back again across, who knows? Maybe it was up the fence a way, we don't know. MAZIN: He also had a history of having murdered another man in Mexico. So this man is a serial killer, or a serial murderer. I call him a mass murder because he not only murdered by son, he murdered me, he murdered my wife, he murdered my other son, he murdered the family, murdered the community because the outpouring of upset from the community from our son's death has been overwhelming, really overwhelming. INGRAHAM: What do you have to say to the politicians who are spending an enormous amount of their political energy and emotional, I think a lot of it con injured up, politically convenient emotion, for the current situation of separating families. What message do you have for them tonight? MAZIN: Well, first of all, Laura, I wouldn't want to say it on-air. But I'll clean it up a bit. And if one of their loved ones were to have died like my son died, I wonder if their ideas and their ways of presenting things and thinking would be different. I just wonder. It's easy to sit back and say, oh, well, these poor children, this, that, and the other thing. How about we poor citizens and how about my poor son? Because he's been permanently separated from us. INGRAHAM: I know your wife couldn't come on tonight. She was just too overcome. I want to tell Penny and your family how much we really are so sorry for your loss. And I'm going to do everything in my power to help you and try to help this country and get through this thing because this can't keep going on. MAZIN: Well, I thank you for that, and bless you for that. INGRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you. God bless you. MAZIN: Thank you so much. INGRAHAM: And Chuck Schumer, ends up slipping up, gives away the Democrats' real agenda. I don't think Chuck Schumer called you either, Dr. Mazin, right? How concerned is he about the immigrant children separated from their parents? We're going to show you in just a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Welcome back to \"The Ingraham Angle\" coming to you tonight from the U.S.-Mexico border just south of San Diego. Earlier today Chuck Schumer let it slip that Democrats really aren't that concerned about separated immigrant kids. They prefer to keep the issue alive rather than work with the president to solve it. Couldn't give him credit for anything. Asked why Democrats are rejecting a GOP bill to fix the crisis, the senator said, quote, \"Legislation is not the way to go here when it's so easy for the president to sign it.\" What? Heaven forbid Democrats actually work with the GOP to fix the crisis without leaving the border wide open. We're going to debate immigration policy in just a moment. But first we want to get another update on the situation right here on the border from Rodney Scott, chief border patrol agent of the San Diego sector. Great today you, how are you, thanks for being with us. RODNEY SCOTT, SAN DIEGO SECTOR BORDER PATROL: Thank you for having me. And I hear there's a birthday wish that we should pass on. INGRAHAM: I decided to come celebrate with you guys. I have got to come celebrate the birthday with the border patrol. SCOTT: Thank you. INGRAHAM: Thank you so much. I was here in 1997. I used to work for another network, I was here covering option gatekeeper which was the Clinton-era double fencing that was actually really -- it really worked. It was really successful. Now it's 21 years later. What's changed? SCOTT: Well, coincidentally I was there as well. INGRAHAM: Maybe you showed me around all those years ago. SCOTT: I start my career right here literally in this park in 1992 and it was complete chaos. So systematically over the last 26 years I've watched the border, law and order really be restored on this border. And it's been a mix. It's been the technology, the infrastructure, the access, the roads, and effective prosecutions using the tools that we have available to us, the legal tools of the justice system as well. And you can see behind me, I would never have sat this close to the border with my back to it years and years ago. It's significantly safer than it was before. But we're not done yet. INGRAHAM: What about the media coverage that we've see especially over the last couple of weeks? We have this crush of family units, some of them posing as family units, then we have unaccompanied minors, a similar crush as we had in 2014, 2013. And the characterization of what you are doing and your men are doing and women are doing, it's just horrific. It is like you guys might as well be in Nazi Germany and members of the SS. SCOTT: The misinformation that's going out -- INGRAHAM: That's a nice way of putting it, by the way. SCOTT: I'm trying to be polite. It is actually very frustrating and it's extremely insulting. So a lot of it is just flat out lies. So the family separation being policy is a lie. We're leveraging the prosecution, the tools that we've had in place for years, we're leveraging them better than before. And that requires when someone goes to jail that they're separated from society to include their family. The allegations that we would actually put people in dog cages is a lie. INGRAHAM: So those images that we're seeing are the temporary processing facilities, right. When you processed in, that's a temporary thing. Because we keep seeing the cages, like in McAllen, Texas. Those are the cages. But those aren't the longterm holding facilities for children. That's a different scenario. People keep mixing up the images. It drives me crazy. SCOTT: I couldn't agree more. But even farther than that, they're looking at chain link fence, the same chain link fence that's around the school yards where most of your viewers probably send their kids to school, the same type of chain link fence that's around basketball courts, tennis courts, every play yard, and then they're referring to that as a dog cage. So where is the equitability in that? It's not a dog change. It's one of the most cost-effective ways that we can keep a visual of all of those kids, the families and everything to maximize their safety. If those walls were solid and I couldn't see through them it would require 20 times the agents to actually maintain safety and security in that area. That is the right tool at the right place, and those are processing centers. INGRAHAM: We've heard from other border patrol agents tonight that oftentimes people show up at the border with a pre-written script. Obviously many of them as has been reported many times are illiterate, obviously they don't speak English. But many of them have rudimentary education in their own language in their country, so they come with a script typed out, they know what to say, oftentimes with a sponsor name. Oftentimes the sponsor is an illegal immigrant. SCOTT: That's actually correct. So what gets lost in this conversation as well is we're dealing with very sophisticated, organized smuggling. So when these people arrive at the border they have a script. Sometimes they're actually provided a child that's not theirs to exploit loopholes in the system because traditionally based on American values, we bent over backwards to try to make sure that families were kept together, they were not incarcerated. No good deed goes unpunished, and the smugglers identified that like they watch everything we do and identify any other weakness and started leveraging that as a way to get their clients -- INGRAHAM: And 90 percent or 80 percent never show up for their immigration hearing. SCOTT: That's correct. INGRAHAM: Thank you so much for your perspective, really needed amidst all the misrepresentation. Thank you so much. SCOTT: Thank you for your time. INGRAHAM: And of course the current crisis is just part of a much bigger problem. Here to debate from just up the road, San Diego based immigration attorney Esther Valdes, and in Florida Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins. Michael, you've been watching this show tonight. Your perspective on this debate? I know we have Democrat and Republican, but let's just focus if we can on the facts, the laws that exist, the court decisions that have been handed down. I'm interested in your perspective. MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Absolutely. So I want to take the labels away and say that I think we're conflating two very different things. When the Trump administration put in their zero- tolerance policy, what they did was make it harder for people who were trying to claim asylum to cross the border legally. And so now what you are seeing is everyone who is crossing the border is crossing illegally, which messes up the status of what is going on, because what could have been a civil infraction is now going to be a criminal misdemeanor. INGRAHAM: Esther? ESTHER VALDES, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: Absolutely not. That's incorrect. I've been a practicing immigration attorney for 14 years here at the border. This is my hometown. I'm also the daughter of Mexican immigrants. What we're seeing is a twofold process that the Trump administration is highlighting why the laws don't work. Not only is there a loophole for mothers with children, but we have fake families being presented at the border. And also criminal prosecution, which that's how the la has read for approximately 20 years. There's nothing new under the sun but for the fact that we're saying mom and dad, if you come in we're going to prosecute you as a misdemeanor, or as a felony. And naturally, in America, we don't incarcerate families. What we do is we treat children humanely. We separate them. I have had the honor to visit children and represent children and win successfully asylum cases from Mexico in over seven states. Those detention centers are not caged. They're happy, and they'd rather avail themselves of what's going on in America than to stay in Mexico or Central where they're raped, pillaged, and trafficked. HOPKINS: Which is exactly why they're leaving their country. VALDES: That's exactly right, and that's why we treat them better, and they want to be detained here while they go through judicial process and due process. All of the women that I represent, which are mostly women and children, they rather avail themselves of American laws because they understand they will be protected to undergo the asylum process, which unfortunately, takes many years. And that's why Ted Cruz's legislation is wonderful because he's proposing making it more expeditious and making it more rapid so these families aren't detained and/or separated. HOPKINS: But Ted Cruz's legislation -- INGRAHAM: Michael, the frustrating thing here is -- HOPKINS: Sorry, go ahead. INGRAHAM: There's one thing. The frustrating thing here is that there were family detainment centers. However, they were delicensed by court order. So his is happening in Texas, and there were two major detention centers that were for family units. And border activists, these are international activists, I tweeted out one of the big activist groups today, they were celebrating the family detainment centers being closed because they want all of the families released in the American society. I understand that, but then don't complain when family units can't be held together because all of these places have been shut down. I guess we're just going to have to figure out a way to open them again I guess. Michael? VALDES: Recall that it's only 2,000 children that are being separated from their families. Again, they're from two to 10 years old, there's approximately only 2,000. The other 10,000 are with their families. The 2,000 that are separated most of them -- INGRAHAM: Michael, 10 seconds to close it out, I'm not being fair to you. Giving you time. HOPKINS: No problem. I just want to say we have prosecutorial discretion here, and we can decide whether to prosecute under civil or criminal penalties. And here what we need to make sure we're doing is not conflating criminals with people who are actually trying to seek asylum, because painting in broad strokes does not work. INGRAHAM: Guys, thank you. I got the point. Thank you so much. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Welcome back to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE coming to you tonight from the U.S.-Mexico border just north of Tijuana. When you think about it, there is a solution for a lot of the suffering unaccompanied immigrant minors. It's a really humane one. It's one I know a lot about. It's called adoption. Joining me now from Washington is Chuck Johnson, president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption and one of my favorite people. Chuck, it is great to have you on tonight. You and I have been so frustrated about what's happened in the adoption world over the last several years, specifically not only is it hard to adopt domestically, or harder because of abortion and all that, adopting internationally especially from Central America, Chuck, why has it become nearly impossible? Fifteen years ago we had about 2,380 or so children available for adoption. Last year, one. What's going on? CHUCK JOHNSON, CEO NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR ADOPTION: Yes, over the last 10 years we've seen a nearly 80 percent decline in the number of international adoptions happening in the U.S. And we believe that part of the reason for that is a bias against intercountry adoption by career employees in the Office of Children's Issues at the Department of State. INGRAHAM: And, Chuck, particularly annoying is the fact that international human rights advocates claim that intercountry adoption is bad for kids oftentimes. Sol people who want to help the kids, and I think they do, put up legal barriers for actual adoption. With Russia you have the problem with Putin, which is really annoying. But someone like Guatemala, my daughter is from Guatemala, I adopted her 10 year ago, it was really hard to adopt her, hard to get her out of the country. But so many American families were stuck in limbo. And of all of these children coming to the border every day, I bet we could find a lot of American families who would be willing to adopt them, legally adopt them, Chuck. You know them, and these are some of the kids and some of the villages that I have had the great privilege of getting to know over the years. And some of these kids still have their families, others are living with extended families, very little opportunities. But there is a way to do it. Chuck, your reaction to that? JOHNSON: There is a way, Laura, to do this. We have implemented the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption 10 years ago. It created a whole new process of checks and balances and oversight for intercountry adoption. But then we have created policies and other barriers that have not allowed us to use a much more better system. And so we're going to continue to see the decline in the number of international adoptions until we see significant change in the policies at the Department of State. And we're hopeful -- INGRAHAM: Why is this happening? Chuck, why is this happening? What does President Trump need to know? I want to break the logjam as best I can. I think it's really important, for all of these people who say they care about the kids, we need them to help on this issue of adoption, because we have tens of thousands of American families who would absolutely love to take in these children as legally part of their families. So what does President Trump need on do? Is there one particular person at the Department of State that we have to work on, or what? JOHNSON: Well, everything we know about the president, and things that he has said recently about adoption, if you look at the vice president, he has a strong record as a member of Congress supporting adoption. We need them, and we need the secretary of state to look at this bias that's happening at the Department of State. INGRAHAM: Well we're going to get to specifics and get a stay on this issue. Chuck, thank you so much. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Apparently tonight the DHS secretary was driven out of a Mexican restaurant. Protesters. Apparently she can't eat at a Mexican restaurant now, that's really nice. I hope this has been a clarifying hour for you tonight. It's a really important hour for me, for all of you, for our country, our sovereignty, the kids, all of it. Border security is a very complex issue. A lot of you think it's simple and easy to do, but you saw the great men and women tonight of the border patrol. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "If Republicans choose to unite behind the president's immigration policy the way they did in the kavanaugh fight, this will stoke voter enthusiasm even further ahead of an all too important midterm election for this country. As our cable competitors are devoting hours of coverage today to the president's tweets about Stormy Daniels, voters I think are just tuning it out. Why? Because the voters are smarter than the media thinks they are. Americans outside the leftist activist bubble are focused on issues that actually affect their daily lives \u2013 pocketbook issues. Like the fact that the stock market jumped 500 points today. That\u2019s good for your 401(k). The Labor Department reported that there are 7 million job openings currently in the United States.\u00a0And our industrial output is surging. This is all fantastic news. But Americans also see some trouble on the horizon, like lawlessness at the border that no advanced society should tolerate. We have another migrant caravan \u2013 as many as 4,000 people I\u2019m told \u2013 making its way from Honduras to the United States. President Trump has had just about enough.\u00a0At a weekend rally in Kentucky he told the crowd, \u201cWe have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we are getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes.\u201d I\u2019ll say. For many years voters have been telling politicians to enforce the border and close immigration loopholes. In fact, even on the issue of legal immigration, the country is not clamoring for big increases. According to a Gallup poll taken in June, only 28 percent of Americans want immigration levels increased. Twenty-nine percent of Americans want them decreased. A plurality (39 percent) want them to remain the same.Most politicians continue to just ignore the wishes of the people.\u00a0 They continue to expand things like distant-relative chain migration. They refuse to allocate money to the building of the entire wall at the southern border. And they refuse to pass legislation to allow for immediate border turn-backs of anyone crossing illegally.Democrats are against all tightening of the current rules for asylum. Donald Trump won the presidency in large part because he wouldn't accept the status quo on immigration. And as usual, he was five steps ahead of almost every Republican congressman on the issue.In July, Gallup found that Americans identified immigration as the top issue for them going into the midterms. Last month it was the second-most important issue tied with general economic problems. Democrats thought that a focus on the difficult issue of child separation \u2013 a \u00a0practice that the administration has now ended \u2013 would turn out voters and get Democrats and Latinos really excited. But I don't think it is working for them. Back in 2016, the Latino voter turnout rate did not increase amid Trump's push for the wall and stronger immigration enforcement. And of course Hispanic American neighborhoods and communities are disproportionately affected by the impact of illegal immigration. Ditto for black Americans. The good news is that as the drama surrounding this second migrant caravan unfolds, some establishment Republicans are waking up to the wisdom of Trump. Over the weekend Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, told \"Fox and Friends,\" \u201cIt makes the immigration debate more on Trump\u2019s terms. There is no right to come to America. We can have rules about who comes. And where is Mexico? Mexico needs to help us because the last time I checked you just can't walk from Guatemala to here without going through Mexico.\u201dPresident Trump warned the president of Honduras, tweeting \u201cThe United States has strongly informed the president of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!\u201d Vice President Pence had separately warned the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to tell their people not to make the dangerous trek to America, tweeting the \u201cU.S. will not tolerate this blatant disregard for our border and sovereignty.\u201dBy the way, Honduras is on track to receive $65.7 million in foreign aid from the U.S. in the upcoming 2019 fiscal year. But back to the midterms.\u00a0As frustrated as so many of us are with the Republicans and what they\u00a0have failed to do at the border, the cause may be totally lost if the open borders Democrats take the House. While the president is focused on important things like abolishing the illegal immigrant gang MS-13,\u00a0Democrats want to abolish ICE and ensure \u201csafe passage\u201d for illegal immigrants to the U.S.The choice could not be clearer for the midterm voters. There is so much on the line for America.Will Trump get the funding for his wall? Will the mass migration from other poor countries in Central America be stopped at all? Ever? Will travesties such as birthright citizenship finally be ended? Will we mandate E-verify to penalize businesses who game the system to keep American wages low?Of this my friends you can be sure: Your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly-amnestied citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants. However, if Republicans choose to unite behind the president\u2019s immigration policy, the way they just did in the Kavanaugh fight, it will stoke voter enthusiasm even further ahead of the all too important midterm elections.

            "article_content": "Howard Kurtz reacts to uproar over family separations at the border. In the blink of an eye, the uproar over immigration has become a major midterm election issue. And that's precisely the way President Trump wants it. With some prominent Republicans and conservative media outlets slamming the president's policy of separating migrant families at the border, you might have thought the White House would be looking to quickly defuse the controversy. That's not happening. In fact, Politico reports that Stephen Miller and other top administration officials are planning a further crackdown on legal and legal immigration, with the goal, according to a Republican close to the White House, being \"to arm Trump with enough data and statistics by early September to show voters that he fulfilled his immigration promises \u2014 even without a border wall or any other congressional measure.\" The GOP plan had been to run on tax cuts and a booming economy. But the president has apparently decided that he needs to motivate his base voters to show up in what is shaping up as a tough election. As Corey Lewandowski, who works for Mike Pence's PAC, told The New York Times: \"People don't turn out to say thank you. If you want to get people motivated, you've got to give them a reason to vote. Saying 'build the wall and stop illegals from coming in and killing American citizens' gives them an important issue.\" And the president stuck to his guns yesterday, saying that the problem is migrants who bring their kids to the border but that Congress can resolve the issue. Obviously, pounding away at illegal immigration\u2014from the day he came down the Trump Tower escalator\u2014worked well for the president in the last campaign. But just as obviously, the child separation issue makes the overall issue risky this time around, beyond the impact on the Hispanic vote. You can just imagine the 30-second ads, complete with audio now that ProPublica has put out the sounds of crying children being taken from their parents. That's not likely to play well with suburban moms. And that's why some Republican lawmakers, including Ted Cruz, are speaking out against the practice. (Trump yesterday rejected Cruz\u2019s bill to hire more immigration judges as a way of keeping detained families together.) GOP congressman Fred Upton said that \"it's time for this ugly and inhumane practice to end,\" according to the Washington Post. The press is aflame over this issue, which is drawing almost wall-to-wall coverage on cable news. White House reporters hammered Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday as she insisted the administration had no choice in the matter and was merely following the law. (A bunch of Democrats are urging her to resign.) And many on the right are offering harsh criticism. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, a Trump loyalist, said that family separation could become \"the Republicans' new Katrina.\" A Wall Street Journal editorial decried \"The GOP's Immigration Meltdown,\" saying \"restrictionists may cost Republicans their majorities in Congress.\" But other conservatives, including Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson, are backing the president\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach and saying the media aren\u2019t devoting enough attention to crime and other problems created by some illegal immigrants. Trump says he hates migrant kids being separated from parents but has no choice. (The media point out that's not true, but it's also true that conditions in the much-criticized warehousing facilities date to the Obama administration.) The president's wife says the administration must govern with \"heart.\" But while 66 percent in a Quinnipiac poll say they oppose the family separation policy, 55 percent of Republicans are backing Trump's stance. That's why an approach that is poison to a good chunk of the political and media world could be a bracing tonic for the president's supporters in the midterms.",

            "article_content": "City opens registration to select non-citizens for local elections. San Francisco reportedly spent $310,000 on a new registration system aimed at getting non-citizens to cast votes in school board elections. The program resulted in 49 new voters, which turned out to cost the city $6,326 each, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The paper called the effort \u201cpretty much a bust the first time out.\u201d Local officials suggest residents who might otherwise consider registering are worried the Trump administration would learn their identities. The voters are only able to vote in a school board race. John Arntz, the city elections chief, \u00a0In San Francisco, noncitizens who opt to vote will be listed on a separate roster from citizens and will get a ballot with just the school board contest, city elections chief John Arntz said. Robin Hvidston, the executive director of We the People Rising, group that calls for tougher immigration enforcement, told The Los Angeles Times that the program could ultimately\u00a0backfire with those who take a moderate stance on immigration. San Francisco is not the first place with such a measure. In Maryland, where an estimated 15 percent of residents are foreign-born, at least six cities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. In Massachusetts, the cities of Amherst, Cambridge, Newton and Brookline have advanced laws to allow noncitizen voting, but they cannot implement them because they need the approval of state lawmakers, who have not acted, said Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University who studies noncitizen voting laws. The Times said the San Francisco Unified School District does not have exact numbers on how many students in its system are noncitizens. The report, citing the district\u2019s website, said 29 percent of its 54,063 students are English-language learners. Shamann Walton, a district commissioner in the city\u2019s schools, told the paper that he wants families with children in these schools to have a voice. \u201cTrump will not always be president,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll have leaders who are inclusive and really believe that if you are a resident of this country, you should have the same rights as other people.

            "article_content": "President Trump threatens to cut off funding for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador as migrant caravan marches toward U.S.; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. Ever since President Trump came down a golden escalator in 2015\u00a0to announce his candidacy, the national conversation surrounding illegal immigration has never been the same. But what is often missed in his blunt talk and the hysteria it creates is that President Trump understands Americans\u2019 desire for law and order. He also understands their need to feel safe. The recent caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America who are seeking asylum in the United States underscores that point. While the media focuses solely on the humanitarian aspect of it, images and video of migrants lawlessly tearing down the gates into Mexico are a stark visual reminder of the need for increased border security. With only two weeks until Election Day, President Trump should hammer this point home. By labeling himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, Trump made immigration a winning issue for his 2016 campaign. Once again, Republicans are on the offense on the issue of immigration by focusing on sanctuary cities and liberals\u2019 calls to abolish ICE. A recent memo from the liberal think tank the Center for American Progress warns Democrat candidates in competitive races that Republicans\u2019 \u201csanctuary attacks pack a punch.\u201d They warn Democrats to pivot to other issues. Even when President Trump was getting hit the hardest from the media over his zero tolerance policy for families illegally crossing the border, Americans wanted law and order. In the midst of the debate, Harvard-Harris polling showed that 70 percent of Americans wanted stricter enforcement of our immigration laws and 61 percent believed our current border security is inadequate. A staggering 84 percent of Americans opposed sanctuary cities and 69 percent opposed abolishing ICE. President Trump has also changed the dynamics of the immigration debate by giving a face to those who have been negatively impacted by it. During his State of the Union address, he told the stories of two teenage girls - Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens - who were brutally murdered by MS-13. He also highlighted how their murderers took advantage of loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied minors. The migrant caravan represents everything that is wrong with our nation\u2019s immigration system. As the caravan approaches the United States, President Trump should once again talk about the ways our laws are being exploited. Since he ended his zero tolerance policy, there has been an 80 percent increase in families illegally crossing the border. In the month of September alone, U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested 16,658 family members - the highest one-month total on record. There will continue to be caravans of people heading to the United States because our immigration system is broken. The initial threshold for claiming asylum is so easy that 80 percent will pass their first interview with a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Asylum Officer, and will get released to appear in court. However, only 20 percent will be granted asylum in immigration court. That means that 80 percent of the claims are either frivolous or the individual never showed up to court. The individuals who are denied asylum are ordered to return to their home country but many will ignore the order and become immigration fugitives instead. President Trump should also use the caravan to call on Congress to make changes to our immigration laws. In particular, raising the bar for what qualifies as asylum, closing loopholes in a 2008 anti-human trafficking law, and making changes to the Flores decree. While Mexican unaccompanied minors can be quickly sent back to their home countries, Central American minors cannot because of a loophole in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The Flores decree limits the amount of time children can be detained with their parents to 20 days or less, which is not enough time to adjudicate these cases. With just two weeks until Election Day, the migrant caravan represents what is wrong with our nation\u2019s immigration system. President Trump and Republicans should welcome this political gift with open arms and use it to score electoral wins by focusing on immigration.",

            "article_content": "On 'Fox & Friends,' the Democrat lawmaker says it's time for everyone to move away from the rhetoric created by the president. Some Democrats are reportedly concerned that public appeals to \u201cabsolutely harass\u201d Trump administration officials will come back to hurt them in the polls and benefit Republicans. There have been several recent instances where Trump officials have been publically shamed, including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave by an owner of a restaurant in Virginia. On Saturday, Florida Attorney General \u2013 and ardent Trump supporter \u2013\u00a0Pam Bondi was confronted by a group of protesters outside the screening of a documentary about Mister Rogers in Tampa. A video of the confrontation shows the Florida AG leaving the theater as several people yell at her, with one woman seen shouting at her about Bondi\u2019s recent actions on health care policy and her stance on immigration. The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board wrote a column titled, \u201cLet the Trump team eat in peace.\u201d The paper identified the heightened state of \u201cpassions\u201d in the country, but saw no benefit in protesters interrupting dinners. Democrats warned that these public encounters could win sympathy for the Trump administration, The Los Angeles Times reported. Rep. Maxine Waters, in the meantime, is not backing down from her\u00a0weekend comments calling for people\u00a0to confront members of the Trump administration at gas stations and anywhere else they're seen in public. \u201cIf you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere,\u201d Waters said Saturday, later telling MSNBC that protesters are \u201cgoing to absolutely harass them.\u201d The comments were in response to Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy that led to families being separated at the U.S.- Mexico border. Waters argued her comments have been misconstrued, claiming she wasn\u2019t calling for protesters to actually \u201charm\u201d Cabinet members. \u201cTrump is the one who is creating lies,\u201d Waters said during a Monday afternoon news conference. \u201cTrying to have people believe that I talked about harming people. There\u2019s nowhere in my statement, anytime, anyplace that we talked about harm.\u201d Trump sought to cast Waters as a spokewoman for her party. \u201cCongresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,\u201d he tweeted on Monday. \u201cShe has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\u201d David Axelrod, the former Obama campaign strategist, urged calm. \u201cDisgusted with this admin\u2019s policies? Organize, donate, volunteer, VOTE! Rousting Cabinet members from restaurants is an empty and, ultimately, counter-productive gesture that won\u2019t change a thing,\u201d he said in a tweet, according to The Times. A spokesman for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was injured in the shooting at a congressional baseball practice just over a year ago, warned about the dangers of overheated rhetoric and protests. \u201cWhip Scalise knows firsthand the dangerous consequences that can result from making political differences personal and vitriolic,\u201d spokeswoman Lauren Fine said in a statement. \u00a0\u201cWe are lucky to live in a country where we have the right to freely debate our differences civilly. Harassment is never an acceptable method of disagreement.\u201d Even celebrities are getting into the trolling of the Trump administration, with \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host John Oliver requesting that his audience send obscene images to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and posting Sessions' email account on air. Actor Peter Fonda also was condemned for his Twitter call to \"rip Barron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles.\" The recent incidents prompted the DHS over the weekend to issue a memo about \u201ca heightened threat\" against their employees due to the furor over Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy. \"This assessment is based on specific and credible threats that have been levied against certain DHS employees and a sharp increase in the overall number of general threats against DHS employees -- although the veracity of each threat varies,\" the memo from acting deputy secretary of homeland security Claire M. Grady stated,\u00a0according to CBS News. \"In addition, over the last few days, thousands of employees have had their personally identifiable information publically [sic] released on social media.\" The memo reportedly recommends that employees take numerous safety precautions, including not displaying work badges in public, being careful with public conversations and using caution on all social networks.

(REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet? Click here.\n\u00a0\nDeveloping now, Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO CARAVAN CRISIS - Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Lee have urged Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to execute a \"safe third country agreement\" with the Mexican government, which would require members of the growing migrant caravan to stop and seek asylum there ... \u00a0The third-party agreement would require asylum seekers to make their claims in their first country of arrival. The senators noted the arrangement would also take some pressure off the overworked asylum system in the U.S., which has been increasingly inundated with claims that judges must adjudicate. Some Trump administration officials have argued that the \"vast majority\" asylum claims are fraudulent or legally dubious. IN OBAMA'S OWN WORDS: President Trump turned to an unlikely source Tuesday evening to find support for his hard-line immigration policies: his predecessor, Barack Obama ... Trump tweeted a 2005 video in which Obama, then a senator, made a statement against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment \"I agree with President Obama 100%\". \"We are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States,\" Obama says in the 31-second clip. \"But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.\" Obama is not the only Democrat cited by Trump and his supporters to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President Bill Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union address. PELOSI IN \u2018TRANSITION\u2019?: Nancy Pelosi, in an apparent bid to assuage concerns from younger rank-and-file Democrats, says she could commit to an abbreviated, \u201ctransitional\u201d term as speaker if her party wins the House majority next month ... But she has yet to provide details and still says she'd want to stay through 2020, leaving unclear when and if she'd be willing to hand off the gavel. The current House minority leader first floated the idea of a short-term speakership last week. \u201cI see myself as a transitional figure,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI have things to do. Books to write, places to go, grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\u201d Pelosi has long made clear she plans to run for speaker again if Democrats reclaim the majority. But many Democratic lawmakers and candidates have distanced themselves from her and current leadership this year, with some saying they'd oppose her for speaker. HOLDING SAUDIS 'ACCOUNTABLE': The U.S. is revoking visas of some of the Saudi Arabian officials involved in the murder of writer Jamal Khashoggi ... \u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a news conference Tuesday said the U.S. has identified people implicated in Khashoggi\u2019s death \u2014 \u201cincluding those in the intelligence services, the royal court, the foreign ministry and other Saudi ministries\u201d \u2014 and is working to hold them accountable. The State Department is revoking visas and taking other measures in the wake of the ordeal. \u201cWe\u2019re making very clear that the United States does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cNeither the president nor I am happy with this situation.\u201d ROSENSTEIN DELAY: The heads of two House committees announced Tuesday evening that a planned Wednesday interview of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had been postponed ... Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said in a joint statement that they were \"unable to ask all questions of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein within the time allotted for tomorrow\u2019s transcribed interview.\" They added that Rosenstein has indicated a willingness to testify \"in the coming weeks in either a transcribed interview or a public setting. Rosenstein was to have been interviewed by Goodlatte, Gowdy and the top Democrats on each committee in a secure room. Many of the questions were to focus on reported remarks by Rosenstein in which he suggested secretly recording President Trump and canvassing members of the Cabinet about the possibility of removing him from office. AND THE WINNING NUMBERS ARE ... The winning numbers have been drawn in Tuesday\u2019s Mega Millions lottery, worth an estimated $1.6 billion ... The winning numbers are 5, 28, 62, 65 and 70, with a Mega Ball number 5, according to the official Mega Millions website. The website of the South Carolina Education Lottery reported that a winning Mega Millions ticket had been sold in that state, Fox Carolina reported.

            "article_content": "Fox & Trends with Carley Shimkus. Democrats who drafted a bill to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] suddenly announced Thursday night that they would vote against it if the legislation went to the floor, after\u00a0House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News he intended to call their bluff. \"We know Speaker [Paul] Ryan is not serious about passing our 'Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act,' so members of Congress, advocacy groups, and impacted communities will not engage in this political stunt,\"\u00a0Reps. Mark Pocan\u00a0of Wisconsin, Pramila Jayapal\u00a0of Washington\u00a0and Adriano Espaillat\u00a0of New York\u00a0told The Hill\u00a0and other news outlets.\u00a0\"If Speaker Ryan puts our bill on the floor, we plan to vote no and will instead use the opportunity to force an urgently needed and long-overdue conversation on the House floor.\" McCarthy, R-Calif., said earlier Thursday he would place a bill to abolish ICE on the House floor later this month. Democrats have long pushed back on the administration\u2019s immigration policies but tensions have escalated in the past month over family separations at the border. Calls from some far-left lawmakers to abolish ICE have grown ahead of the November elections. Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., last week slammed the federal agency as being a part of a \u201ccruel, dysfunctional immigration system\u201d that needs \u201ccomprehensive\u201d reform. One of the\u00a0first senators to push for eradicating ICE\u00a0was Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who said last month that ICE \u201chas become a deportation force\u201d which should be abolished. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed Gillibrand, calling the agency \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cdivisive.\u201d \u201cIt should be abolished,\u201d he tweeted. As analysts point out, if Democrats vote against the proposal and kill it, it undermines their word. If they earn enough \"yes\" votes, Republicans could turn the issue and tie all Democrats to the crisis at the border. Perhaps sensing trouble ahead of the primaries, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California have called instead for the agency to be restructured.

            "article_content": "Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke has parlayed positive press into a $10 million fundraising advantage over Sen. Ted Cruz; Peter Doocy reports from Houston, Texas. Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke met Friday night at Southern Methodist University in Dallas in the first debate of three scheduled prior to the Nov. 6 vote over Cruz's seat. In a substantive but often contentious back-and-forth, the two men tackled a variety of issues ranging from immigration to the Supreme Court to their perspectives on working with President Trump. \u201cI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance and we\u2019ve delivered victories,\u201d Cruz, who lost the GOP presidential nomination to Trump in 2016, explained when asked about working with the president post-loss. \u201cTexans lives are better. I could have chosen to make it about myself but I think that would\u2019ve been not doing the job I\u2019ve been elected to.\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded by slamming Trump, specifying the president\u2019s criticisms of FBI and Justice Department officials. \u201cWhen the president attacks our institutions, that is our business,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe are still a nation of laws and not one of men.\u201d \u201cThis state needs a senator who will work with the president when he can and stand up to him when we must,\u201d O'Rourke stated. TEXAS SENATE SEAT COMPETITIVE BATTLE BETWEEN CRUZ, O'ROURKE: A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES Asked for their perspective on the immigration debate, both men provided pithy answers. \u201cMy views on immigration are simple,\u201d Cruz said, adding that it boiled down to four words: \u201cLegal, good. Illegal, bad.\u201d The senator argued for doing \u201ceverything possible to securing the border.\u201d \u201cWe can do all of that,\u201d he said, \u201cat the same time we are celebrating legal immigration.\u201d O\u2019Rourke, however, said that \u201cwe need to bring people out of the shadows.\u201d \u201cAnd yes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere should be an earned path to citizenship.\u201d Cruz and O\u2019Rourke later spoke about gun violence, with the former strongly reiterating his support for the Second Amendment. But, Cruz argued, recent school shootings were symptomatic of deeper issues. \u201cThere is something deeply wrong that we have these shootings,\u201d he said, pointing to the \u201cremoving of God from the public square\u201d and \u201closing the binds of community and family.\u201d O\u2019Rourke hit Cruz back forcefully, however, advocating for gun control. \u201cThoughts and prayers are just not going to cut it,\u201d he argued to jeers from those in attendance. Cruz on Friday night was also asked whether Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a youthful sexual assault, could say anything that might question his support. Cruz said \"absolutely,\" but didn't elaborate while calling the allegations serious. \"Dr. Ford's allegations should be investigated by the FBI \u2013 full stop,\" O'Rourke argued, adding that \"we need a Supreme Court justice that will decide in favor of people ... and in Brett Kavanaugh we do not have that.\" Broadening their arguments just weeks from Election Day, Cruz claimed that \"Congressman O'Rourke's positions are out of step with the people of Texas. If he's elected, he will fight to raise your taxes.\" But the congressman said Cruz is working for \"the special interests ... He's not working for the people of Texas.\" National attention in the race has grown as O'Rourke has raised more money than Cruz. And polls have suggested a tighter race than expected in a state where Republicans typically win handily. The next debate is scheduled for Sept. 30 at the University of Houston with the final encounter set for Oct. 16. Early voting in Texas runs from Oct. 22 to Nov. 2.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court reaches decision on the Trump administration's travel ban. The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld President Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban affecting several mostly Muslim countries, offering a limited endorsement of the president\u2019s executive authority on immigration in one of the hardest-fought battles of this term. The 5-4 ruling marks the first major high court decision on a Trump administration policy. It upholds the selective travel restrictions, which critics called a discriminatory \u201cMuslim ban\u201d but the administration argued was needed for security reasons. In a written statement, Trump called the ruling \"a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution.\" As critics continued to decry the policy as \"xenophobic,\" Trump described the court decision as \"a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country.\" At issue was whether the third and latest version of the administration's policies affecting visitors from five majority Muslim nations \u2013 known as travel ban 3.0\u00a0\u2013 discriminates on the basis of nationality and religion, in the government's issuance of immigrant visas. CLICK TO READ THE DECISION Chief Justice John Roberts, who authored the conservative majority opinion, wrote that the order was \u201csquarely within the scope of presidential authority\u201d under federal law. \u201cThe sole prerequisite set forth in [federal law] is that the president find that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The president has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here,\u201d he wrote. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor was among the court\u2019s four liberals that wrote a dissent. \u201cThis repackaging does little to cleanse [the policy] of the appearance of discrimination that the president\u2019s words have created,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the evidence in the record, a reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.\u201d She and Justice Stephen Breyer took the unusual step of reading their dissents from the bench. While the policy was upheld, the case was sent back to the lower courts, which were told to rely on the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of executive authority. It was the first significant legal test so far of Trump's policies and power and could lead to a precedent-setting expansion on the limits of presidential authority, especially within the immigration context. Federal appeals courts in Virginia and California in recent months had ruled against the administration. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court last December concluded Trump's proclamation, like the two previous executive orders, overstepped his powers to regulate the entry of immigrants and visitors. But the justices had allowed the current restrictions to be enforced at the Justice Department's request, at least until the case was fully litigated. The Trump administration also seemed to enjoy a favorable reception before the court during arguments in April. Associate Justice Samuel Alito, during those April arguments, noted that of the 50 or so mostly Muslim majority countries, only five were on the current banned list. The White House had framed the issue as a temporary move involving national security. A coalition of groups in opposition called the order blatant religious discrimination, since the countries involved have mostly Muslim populations: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Chad was recently removed from the list after the administration said that country had beefed up its information-sharing. A major sticking point for the justices was navigating how much discretion the president really has over immigration. Courts have historically been deferential in this area, and recent presidents from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have used it to deny entry to certain refugees and diplomats, including nations such as Iran, Cuba and North Korea. A 1952 federal law -- the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed in the midst of a Cold War fear over Communist influence -- historically gives the chief executive broad authority. It reads in part: \"Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\" The administration strongly denies this is a \"Muslim ban,\" but federal judges across the country cited statements by then-presidential candidate Trump and his advisers, including a December 2015 campaign press release calling for such restrictions and citing \"hatred\" by \"large segments of the Muslim population.\" The high court\u2019s majority downplayed Trump's campaign statements as a major factor in its decision. \"The issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,\" wrote Roberts. \"It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.\" Sixteen state leaders led by Texas were among a number of coalitions backing the Trump administration. But Hawaii officials, who filed the appeal contesting all of the president's orders, said the president's policies violate the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom: \"Any reasonable observer who heard the president's campaign promises, read his thinly justified orders banning overwhelmingly Muslim populations, and observed his administration's persistent statements linking the two, would view the order and each of its precursors as the fulfillment of the president's promise to prohibit Muslim immigration to the United States.\" Trump's first executive order was issued just a week after he took office, and was aimed at seven countries. It triggered chaos and protests across the U.S., as some travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and others detained at airports for hours. Trump modified the order after a federal appeals court refused to allow the ban to be enforced. \"This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\" the president said on Jan. 29, 2017. The next version, unveiled weeks later, dropped Iraq from the list of covered countries and made it clear the 90-day ban covering Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen didn't apply to those travelers who already had valid visas. It also got rid of language that would give priority to religious minorities. Critics said the changes did not erase the legal problems with the ban. When that second temporary travel ban expired in Sept. 24, it was replaced with Proclamation 9645 -- what the administration said was a country-by-country assessment of security and cooperation with the U.S. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Reuters) Nineteen foreign nationals have been charged with illegal voting in the 2016 election, the Justice Department said Friday. The defendants are from numerous countries, including Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nigeria and Germany. Some of them were charged in an indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Wilmington, N.C. They were accused of filing a false claim of citizenship in order to register, and then voting. Others were charged separately for illegally voting. The announcement comes amid an intense debate at the state level over voter fraud and efforts by Republican lawmakers to impose voter ID restrictions. President Trump has long claimed widespread voting fraud took place in the 2016 election, an assertion that has not been substantiated. But Democrats argue voting fraud is not a widespread problem. \"It's not a conspiracy theory, folks,\" Trump said in April, claiming millions voted illegally in 2016. Trump ordered the creation of a voting fraud commission after taking office, but disbanded it earlier this year after saying certain states refused to provide information. Those charged in the latest plots, according to the DOJ, include: The Justice Department said the grand jury also returned an indictment against a 20th person, 66-year-old Denslo Allen Paige, for allegedly aiding and abetting another defendant, Espinosa-Pena, in falsely claiming United States citizenship in order to register to vote. The cases are being investigated by a taskforce in North Carolina led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations, and assisted by Enforcement Removal Operations, and the Department of State - Diplomatic Security Service.",

A \u201cblue wave\u201d in the midterm elections will be fueled in part by undocumented immigrants, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams said at a campaign rally last week. \u201cBut the thing of it is, the blue wave is African-American. It\u2019s white, it\u2019s Latino, it\u2019s Asian Pacific Islander. It is disabled. It is differently abled. It is LGBTQ. It is law enforcement. It is veterans,\u201d Abrams said to cheers. \u201cIt is made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here ... those who are documented and undocumented.\u201d Abrams, running for governor in Georgia, made the comments at a rally on Tuesday with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., according to the Washington Free Beacon.\u00a0The remarks quickly made headlines, as they appeared to suggest illegal immigrant participation at the polls -- though Abrams may have simply been saying their interests would be represented. GOP nominee Brian Kemp told Fox News on Monday that Abrams \"wants illegals to vote in Georgia.\" FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTIONS HEADQUARTERS \"I think hard-working Georgians should decide who their governor is, not people here illegally like my opponent wants,\" Kemp said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams said the midterm elections' \"blue wave\" includes undocumented immigrants. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) Abrams, 44, is vying to be the first black female governor in America. She stood out in her bid to win the Democratic nomination as she insisted the way to dent the GOP\u2019s domination in Georgia wasn\u2019t by cautiously pursuing older white voters who have abandoned Democrats in recent decades. Instead, she is seeking to widen the electorate by attracting young, diverse voters who haven\u2019t been casting ballots. WHO IS STACEY ABRAMS, THE GEORGIA GOVERNOR HOPEFUL WHO COULD BECOME FIRST BLACK, FEMALE STATE LEADER? An award-winning romance novelist, Abrams is a former state representative and was endorsed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her gubernatorial bid. Ahead of the election, Abrams has ratcheted up her assertion Kemp is effectively suppressing\u00a0minority and female voters in his role as Georgia's secretary of state. At issue is Georgia's so-called \"exact match\" voter registration law, which Kemp helped lobby Georgia's GOP-run legislature to adopt. The law requires information on a voter's registration application to exactly match information on file with Georgia's driver's license agency of the Social Security Administration. Abrams\u00a0argues, for instance, that women who have changed or hyphenated their names after being married could be tripped up. Kemp called Abrams' accusations a \"smokescreen\" and \"distraction\" in an attempt to \"hide her radical views.\" Abrams\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Monday morning. Fox News has ranked the gubernatorial race between Abrams and Kemp a toss-up. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Just moments ago, Brett Kavanaugh was formally sworn into the Supreme Court of the United States. It happened in Washington. And it happened, as you know, after a full month of very bitter debate. Here is the President at the White House ceremony just minutes ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation. Not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception. What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process. Our country, a man or a woman, must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny were proven innocent. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: A remarkable moment. You wouldn't think our leaders would need to publicly defend the presumption of innocence, and that it would be controversial when they do, but that's where we are. Politically, of course, this whole thing turned out to be an unexpected debacle from Democrats. The lessons of their defeat are pretty clear. Creepy porn lawyers make bad national spokesmen. Screaming mobs of child activists scare normal people, who are watching at home. Wild allegations of gang-rape tend to be counterproductive. In other words, it is in fact possible to go too far, and they did. It's not a complicated message. And yet, none of it seems obvious tonight to Democrats. The activist Left has learned an entirely different set of lessons from the Kavanaugh experience. The Supreme Court is a sham. The Constitution is meaningless. The Electoral College must go. Only a country divided into warring tribes can be ruled effectively. If we can't control it, let's burn it down. That is the message they've internalized. Watch our activists gathered at the Supreme Court and reacted after the Kavanaugh vote on Saturday afternoon. Keep in mind as you watch this, this is not a clip from a zombie movie. It's Washington D.C. 2018. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROWD CHANTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: The children of affluence raging, and the rage continued on cable news and on social media. \"We've got to eliminate the Electoral College,\" they chirped in unison, \"White men are bad.\" Well the message was obviously coordinated. Important media figures seem to be saying exactly the same things at exactly the same time, and indeed, they were. They were repeating talking points from the Democratic Party whose interest they faithfully serve. For generations, conservatives called this the Liberal media. But that's not quite right. These are not Liberals. They're not people who believe in free speech or transparency or due process or challenging corporate power or any other recognizable Liberal value. These are party people. They are hacks and joiners and drones. They read the latest pronouncement from the Central Committee like they're scripture. They repeat whatever they are told. They are robots. Liberals used to defend the rights of the minority, and good for them. Watch now as Hillary Clinton explains how entire states should lose their political power because voters don't agree with the majority of rich kids in Brooklyn. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Do you think the Electoral College should be abolished? HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I said that in 2000 after what happened to the 2000 election with Al Gore. That an anachronism that was designed for another time no longer works if we've moved toward one-person one-vote. I think it needs to be eliminated. I'd like to see us move beyond it. Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: It isn't just the Electoral College either. In the past few days, many have been saying the Senate itself should be changed with different states having a different number of senators. All of a sudden, everybody on the Left seems to be saying things like this including supposedly unbiased reporters. \"Shut up, Wyoming, nobody cares what you think.\" That's the new message from the party that pretends to care about the powerless. But then the Left has never been big on self-awareness. Here's one especially amazing example of that. This is an onion piece waiting to be written. It comes from Tom Steyer. He's a finance billionaire who is one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors. People listen to Tom Steyer only because he sends them money. And yet, Steyer's latest crusade is against, and we want to prepare you now for a blast of hot irony, rich, entitled White men. Watch this and savor it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS STEYER, HEDGE FUND MANAGER: A group of very rich, very entitled White men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way. And if you don't like it, that is too darn bad. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Yes. That's what Tom Steyer's against, people like himself, who behave like he does. Let us know when you stop snickering and then think about what Tom Steyer is saying here. He's saying Brett Kavanaugh is not on the Supreme Court because the majority of the U.S. Senate voted for him as the Constitution prescribes. What's actually happening, says Tom Steyer, is that Kavanaugh was installed by a specific racial group in order to hurt and disempower every other racial group in America. This is tribal warfare posing as democracy and your tribe is losing. That's what Tom Steyer is telling you. Now, as a factual matter, this is insane. It's the kind of lunacy that would have gotten you booted off a cable channel five years ago. It's also a lie and it's dangerous. It's exactly the kind of thing that Hutu leaders in Rwanda were saying in the early 1990s. Responsible people do not talk like this. And yet, suddenly it is everywhere on the Left, and not just among the professional wackos pounding on the front door of the Supreme Court. The line between dangerous extremist and U.S. Senator is blurring all of a sudden on the Left. Watch noted race-hater Linda Sarsour explain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA SARSOUR, AMERICAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: I want to introduce to you another champion, another one of our people who works for us on the inside. Please give it up to the Senator from the greatest state in the United States of America, my state, New York, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Imagine a clan leader introducing a Republican senator at a public event this way. One of our people who works for us on the inside, that's the equivalent of what you just saw. Sarsour's embrace of Gillibrand though got basically no media coverage. It's normal now. The press just applaud it. How far can this go? Well spend an hour watching the other channels and see what you think. Here, for example, is a guy with a Harvard Law degree over on MSNBC explaining how Trump voters are actually Nazis. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIE MYSTAL, MANAGING EDITOR, ABOVE THE LAW REDLINE, EDITOR-AT-LARGE OF BREAKING MEDIA: Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most. He has delivered racism for these people. He has delivered misogyny for these people, and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people. We're going to see if this - if this reign that they now have control over all three branches of government, we're going to see if this reign lasts for 30 days, or two years, or a Thousand-Year Reich. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: All the other people in the panel nod, \"Ooh, yes. That's right.\" A Thousand-Year Reich. Keep in mind that hundreds of thousands of American men died to stop the Thousand-Year Reich, and an awful lot of their children and grandchildren grew up in this country to vote for Donald Trump only to be called Nazis for doing it. Not that Mr. Harvard Law School knows any of that. He probably couldn't tell you the year the Second World War ended. He doesn't care. History means nothing to revolutionaries, and that's why they keep repeating it. Heather Mac Donald is a Manhattan Institute Fellow, author of the book, the Diversity Delusion: How Race and Gender Pandering Corrupt the University and Undermined Our Culture. Peter Kirsanow is a United States Civil Rights Commissioner. They both join us now. Heather, first to you, since it's directly germane to your book title, into this Kavanaugh debate hasn't (ph) been inserted by force by the Left questions of race and gender, which are not - certainly race is not inherent to the story at all, it's part of a political tactic, what tactic is it that we're watching? HEATHER MAC DONALD, CITY JOURNAL: Well Tucker, as a close observer of academia, I thought I was inured to incoherence, I thought I was inured to ignorance, I thought I was inured to snarling narcissistic blind rage. And yet, I am stunned by the direction that this Kavanaugh episode keeps taking. We are seeing the worst of poisonous academic identity politics transformed into the real world with an extra boost from sheer political power grab. This incident had nothing to do with race. It had nothing to do with gender-- CARLSON: Yes. MAC DONALD: --it was about one thing, due process of the law and the presumption of innocence and whether a case had been made that Judge Kavanaugh was a rapist. That case was most decidedly not made. And yet, we see the academic inspired Democratic Left try to turn this into an issue of race. It is simply mind-boggling. It is incoherent. What we're seeing as well at play is a - is an idea that is prevalent on - on the academic circuit today, the idea of intersectionality, which is the description of a ruthlessly competitive totem pole of victimhood. And we're talking about a White - alleged White victim here, female. But now the Whiteness card is being played broadly, yet she was a White victim, it doesn't make sense. But it turns out-- CARLSON: No. It doesn't make any sense. MAC DONALD: --the only thing we know, he's a White male. That's all you need to know. He is the worst of the worst. He's the vilest of all creatures. CARLSON: So Peter Kirsanow, I've been watching carefully for the past few weeks trying to figure out what the message is, and I agree with Heather, it's incoherent. But it is intimidating to a lot of people. The second you start throwing terms like White supremacy around, people cower. What is the right response for reasonable people of all races when faced with an argument like this, which doesn't make sense but has emotional resonance and is scary, what do you say? PETER KIRSANOW, ATTORNEY: Well I think you have to point out what the facts are. Here, it is absurd, it is ridiculous, but it is also the only card that the progressive forces have. By engaging in identity politics, as Heather indicated, metastasizes up from K through 12 and colleges, now it's in our political discourse because we really haven't heard any meaningful policy prescriptions from progressives since who knows when but clearly since 2016. So everything is about race, everything is about gender because they have to pit one group against the other for their electoral advantage. Consider for a moment that if Democrats don't get at least 90 percent of the Black vote they go the way of the Whig party in this country. Despite the fact that they've gotten 90 percent plus of the Black vote, they have lost three of the last five presidential elections. So, regardless of what the facts are, regardless of what the issue is, they must make it about identity because they have no meaningful policy prescriptions. CARLSON: No, that's exactly right. Maybe the rest of us can point that out. I wish we had (ph) more time. Thank you both. I appreciate it. MAC DONALD: Thank you. KIRSANOW: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well we've laughed a lot at the creepy porn lawyer on this show. And our derision has been well deserved. But suddenly, he's a top Democratic presidential contender and he's also at the very heart of the Kavanaugh story. We'll investigate his links to basically everything that's going on on the Left right now. It's not hard to see how (ph) creepy porn lawyer can become a presidential candidate when you see his competition in the Democratic Party to get an idea of what he's up to. There's a new book about it. Check it out. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: Michael Avenatti is a beast. STEPHANIE LEIGH RUHLE, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, MSNBC LIVE: OK, that's true. GLAUDE: And he-- RUHLE: He's a beast. GLAUDE: --he's a beast. And he keeps popping Donald Trump and all of his folks in the mouth. Jon Meacham says he may be the savior of the republic. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He really is a master of the media cycle. RUHLE: I owe Michael Avenatti an apology. For the last couple of weeks, I've been saying, \"Enough, already, Michael, I've seen you everywhere. What do you have left to say?\" I was wrong, brother. You have a lot to say. The Democrats could learn something from (ph) you. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: The savior of the Republic. Who gives these people TV shows? For months, as you know, the press could not get enough of the world's creepiest porn lawyer. Hundreds of fawning media appearances propelled him to become a leading Democratic candidate for the presidency, which is where he is right now. But in the last two weeks, and entirely by accident, the creepy porn lawyer reminded the public about why evidence and the presumption of innocence still matter in the country and may have saved Brett Kavanaugh in the process. So now, his former benefactors are mad and they're turning on him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA BASH, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, ANCHORWOMAN, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Some of your Democratic colleagues have been saying that the Democrats, your fellow Democrats' case against Justice Kavanaugh was weakened by Michael Avenatti. CHARLES DAVID TODD, AMERICAN TELEVISION JOURNALIST, CURRENT MODERATOR OF NBC'S MEET THE PRESS, HOST OF MTP DAILY ON MSNBC, POLITICAL DIRECTOR, NBC NEWS: Michael Avenatti is probably the best thing to happen to Brett Kavanaugh. Isn't it? STEVE KORNACKI, AMERICAN POLITICAL JOURNALIST, WRITER, TELEVISION HOST, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR NBC NEWS: Yes. Yes. TODD: I mean all these Democrats that have been flirting with him they've got to really be embarrassed. KORNACKI: Look-- JOHN FREDERICK DICKERSON, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CO-HOST OF CBS THIS MORNING: A lot of Democrats are saying and are you hearing this that Avenatti took what was a sympathetic case with Ford and turned it into a circus losing them the high ground. NANCY CORDES, CBS NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. DICKERSON: Are you hearing that (ph)? KORNACKI: --the Michael Avenatti circus comes to town. CHARLIE SAVAGE, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Avenatti came in with the - the Swetnick allegations, the druggie gang-rape stuff that seems to have been much less taken as credible. Avenatti did a huge favor to the Trump White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: They're concerned that he might be hurting their beloved political party. David Brown is an attorney. He's Director of the Brunswick Group. He's a former advisor to Senator Patty Murray and he joins us tonight. David, thank you a lot for coming on. DAVID BROWN, ATTORNEY, DIRECTOR OF BRUNSWICK GROUP, FORMER ADVISOR TO SENATOR PATTY MURRAY: Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So, as it (ph) turn out that Stormy Daniels' former lawyer is not in the end the savior of the republic as MSNBC dubbed him? BROWN: Oh I think it - it gives - it gives Michael Avenatti a little too much credit to say that he really was the deciding factor in this. I think we - we know that - that now Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed because of a process that the Republicans ran and - and they were single-minded and determined in ensuring his nomination no matter the - the very serious incredible allegations that were raised against him. CARLSON: Would you and - but they weren't and I - I think you're right. And I'm not sure that he was decisive in this. They weren't the only single- minded determined parties though, I would say in this debate. The Democrats were those things too. And would you describe the allegation of his client that she attended 10 consecutive gang-rapes, didn't report any of this to police or tell any of her friends or relatives and that Judge Kavanaugh was present at some of these drugging, the punch, oh but wait, she says later, he wasn't, is that a credible allegation, do you think? BROWN: What - what strikes me about - about the allegation and - and I - I believe she swore under penalty of perjury - perjury, excuse me, in her declaration. So, you know, I think as a lawyer that - that says something to me. But it was striking to me that Senator Collins herself actually (ph)-- CARLSON: But - but - but hold on (ph), she contradicted it in a later interview-- BROWN: --yes, so - so my take away from that when Senator Collins said, I think it was October 2nd, Tucker, that she wanted-- CARLSON: Right. BROWN: --that allegation to be included in the - the scope of the FBI investigation, to me, that would have been the right way forward allowing for the FBI to fairly, impartially assess the credibility of - of her allegations by building a fact higher (ph) record-- CARLSON: And - and how - how would they go about doing that since-- BROWN: --the members who've looked at (ph)-- CARLSON: --the - since she, as you said, already gave-- BROWN: --this-- CARLSON: --her declaration under oath. She named no other person present other than people who already under oath denied that she was telling the truth. There was literally nobody to interview except her, and she was making claims that were so stupid that even Democratic senators were blush. I mean there weren't 10 gang-rapes in a row in Chevy Chase and no one heard about it. I mean that's just not true, and everyone knew it. So why wouldn't Democrats say-- BROWN: Yes. CARLSON: --to creepy porn lawyer, \"Come on now. You know, this is not helpful.\" BROWN: I - I mean I think - I think you did see some Members give far greater credence to Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony. I - I mean if anything, the focus on Dr. Ford's testimony was - was very powerful in part because she did come forward and she did testify, and Members had an opportunity to ask her questions but-- CARLSON: Right. BROWN: --you know, look the - the broader take away for me here is that unfortunately the FBI investigation was not comprehensive. In fact, Judge - Justice Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey Ford weren't even interviewed as part of that investigation. So, I think it was a missed opportunity for us to clear up a lot of the questions-- CARLSON: Wait, but - but are you saying but I just wanted to understand-- BROWN: --and a lot of the lingering doubts (ph). CARLSON: --OK, but I just want to (ph) understand what you're saying. Are you saying that because creepy porn lawyer's client, the one who claimed the 10 consecutive public gang-rapes that didn't happen, and you know it as well as I, the fact that she wasn't interviewed by the FBI means that he shouldn't have been confirmed. Is that - are you really saying that? BROWN: I - I just want to make sure you're referring to - to Mr. Avenatti when you're using that term. I - I don't watch your shows since I'm in New York (ph)-- CARLSON: I'm not - I'm not fully permit (ph)-- BROWN: --and I don't know (ph). CARLSON: --right. The - the lawyer who represented Stormy Daniels who's now a leading presidential candidate for the Democratic Party. BROWN: Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. CARLSON: The savior of the republic in the words of a (ph) best-selling author. BROWN: A leading - a leading candidate, well let's get to - let's get to that because I'm not sure he's a leading candidate. CARLSON: Yes, wait hold (ph) - hold on, hold on, wait, wait-- BROWN: I - I was curious when I heard you say that. CARLSON: --well I mean he's visiting though (ph). He's been invited by Democrats in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early primary states. But let me just say are you saying that because his client, the 10 gang-rape in a row client, she wasn't interviewed about her ludicrous claims that somehow Kavanaugh shouldn't have been confirmed. Is that what you're saying? BROWN: That's not what I said. I - I wish that she had been interviewed. And I wish that the FBI could have probed her story and then offered a more full - more complete record. I - I - that's what I'm saying. I think that we have a missed opportunity here because there are very serious questions that are still outstanding because the FBI investigation was not allowed to be as - as complete and holistic as - as I think many Members, certainly Democratic Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, you saw their statement, wish that it had been-- CARLSON: OK. BROWN: --and I suspect several Republicans won't (ph). CARLSON: So just if you could just quickly bottom-line it for me, just about the creepy porn lawyer, the CPL component of this, would you say you're happy to have him in your party and he should keep doing what he's doing because that's what Democrats stand for, or maybe he should go back to doing whatever it is he does? BROWN: I mean we're a big tent party. I'm happy for anyone who's - who's stepping forward and standing up for what they believe in. But look, it's going to be a-- CARLSON: Yes (ph). BROWN: --really crowded primary field in 2020. So-- CARLSON: Yes. BROWN: --I am not - not foolish enough to offer any kind of forecast as to who's going to be the nominee in 2020. CARLSON: Yes. Well I'm rooting for him. Look, I'm not even a Democrat but I'm just - I just want to tell you. I'm four-squaring (ph)-- BROWN: I'm sure he'll be very happy to hear that. CARLSON: --David, thank you for coming on tonight. BROWN: Thanks, Tucker. Appreciate it. CARLSON: I know he will be. Thank you. Well John Mayer, who some have described as a big-time womanizer, went on a rant about how men are bad in response to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. Was it just political or something else going on here? Are people attacking others for the things they might be criticized for? Ah! We'll explain it next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Singer and guitarist John Mayer is a very talented musician. He's also got some political feelings which he's sharing with the rest of us. He's unhappy about Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. So unhappy, in fact, that he interrupted a concert last night to go on a lengthy rant about something called toxic masculinity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN MAYER, AMERICAN SINGER-SONGWRITER, GUITARIST, RECORD PRODUCER: I don't want it to be the male contract. I'm telling you that's the contract and (ph) we have to tear the contract up. You do not possess the universal ability to have any woman that you see. I'm just going on record as revealing the trauma of men feeling like they've fallen short of a bullshit (ph) alpha-male contract that nobody can live up to. And until we get rid of that in men, we (ph) won't have the right that (ph) we all deserve. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: I'm going on record, says John Mayer that I'm against men behaving badly. John Mayer has been accused of behaving badly. Maybe this is a preemptive strike against further accusations. We don't know. But there is more evidence he's for (ph) women than there is for Brett Kavanaugh but that doesn't mean his rant was surprising. Harvey Weinstein, you'll remember, was a big defender of women too. Do we sense a theme here? I think we do. Anushay Hossain is a feminist and a columnist and game enough to join us tonight. Thanks a lot for coming on. ANUSHAY HOSSAIN, BANGLADESHI-AMERICAN OPINION COLUMNIST, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So look, I don't - I don't doubt anyone's sincerity, yours or John Mayer's, so I just want to - and I just want to restate, I think John Mayer's a really talented guy. But I remember his song, Your Body is a Wonderland. And in it, he's got this line, \"One pair of candy lips and your bubblegum tongue,\" I could go on. But I'm just wondering is that an example of toxic masculinity right there? HOSSAIN: No, it isn't. I mean it depends on what you think about toxic masculinity. And I actually agree with you, Tucker. I mean John Mayer, a couple years ago, I don't think I would have been agreeing with much of what he (ph) said. He used to be such a - such a dude. And he's said many offensive things. But I think it's a very good example, his recent statements about how men can evolve and - and change. And by the way, toxic masculinity isn't about saying your body is a wonderland. It's actually about men being violent towards women. And that song was written for his-- CARLSON: Well look everyone-- HOSSAIN: --girlfriend at the time. CARLSON: --everyone is against men being violent toward women. But I wonder-- HOSSAIN: Yes. CARLSON: --if the standard is indifferent (ph). If Brett Kavanaugh's calendar from 1982 had, you know, basketball with squee (ph) and then your body is a wonderland, and your bubblegum tongue, I mean you would have called for his arrest, right? HOSSAIN: Well yes, but John Mayer wasn't up for the Supreme Court, right? I mean you're talking about two different men-- CARLSON: Oh, so he wasn't in the way of Democrats assuming political power? HOSSAIN: No, it's just a-- CARLSON: I get it. I totally get it. HOSSAIN: --completely different. It's complete - it's not the same thing, Tucker. CARLSON: I'm looking for a universal statement (ph) yes, totally different. HOSSAIN: It's not the same thing at all. One man is a singer-- CARLSON: I'm - you should (ph)-- HOSSAIN: --and the other man was up for the United States Supreme Court and-- CARLSON: Yes, right and he's in the way of Democrats-- HOSSAIN: --very serious allegation-- CARLSON: --accumulating more power so (ph)-- HOSSAIN: --but a very serious allegation came up against Kavanaugh and that didn't happen with John Mayer. Has anybody ever accused John Mayer of sexual assault and testified? CARLSON: Look, and I - I - look, and I hope not. And I'm not attack - I'm not even attacking John Mayer at all. I just don't know what the standard-- HOSSAIN: Well, OK (ph). CARLSON: --is. Is there (ph) there's such a thing as toxic masculinity which is men being male? Is there such a thing as-- HOSSAIN: No. That is actually completely wrong. CARLSON: --toxic-- HOSSAIN: --that's not correct at all. CARLSON: --well there's no definite - there's not definition-- HOSSAIN: No, no, no, there is a definition. CARLSON: --this is like some made-up dumb feminist term. HOSSAIN: No, there isn't (ph) actually-- CARLSON: There's no real definition. Of course-- HOSSAIN: --there's actually been studies done on it. CARLSON: But-- HOSSAIN: It's an academic term-- CARLSON: Studies? HOSSAIN: --and it's about violence against-- CARLSON: Oh, it's an academic - now you further discredited it. HOSSAIN: --women. CARLSON: Uh huh? But let me ask you this. HOSSAIN: No, I haven't actually. Look it up, Tucker. CARLSON: Is there some (ph) such a thing-- HOSSAIN: Look it up. CARLSON: --look it up in some in academic journal (ph)-- HOSSAIN: --we're talking about violence against women and-- CARLSON: --maybe I'll get right on that. HOSSAIN: --we're talking about a pop star. Please do. CARLSON: Uh huh? Look, everybody is against violence against women. Let's be clear about that. HOSSAIN: OK. OK good. CARLSON: I want to know if there's such a thing in the academic-- HOSSAIN: That's what toxic masculinity is about-- CARLSON: --OK. That - that's your definition. Let me ask you-- HOSSAIN: That is the definition. CARLSON: --what is the definition of toxic femininity? HOSSAIN: I don't think there is a definition of toxic femininity and what-- CARLSON: There are ton of women-- HOSSAIN: --will you find (ph)-- CARLSON: --oh, there isn't? Oh there's not (ph)-- HOSSAIN: OK. What is it? What is it? Please tell me. CARLSON: --so there are a lot of women in prison for shooting. Well I - I have no idea. HOSSAIN: That's, OK-- CARLSON: Actually, you know, I'll be honest with you. I don't think that inherent qualities are ever toxic. I don't think there's such a thing as toxic homosexuality-- HOSSAIN: Gee (ph), I don't think-- CARLSON: --or toxic masculinity or toxic femininity. I think the whole idea is insane. People act in a way that's bad-- HOSSAIN: But you're - but you are not understanding what the-- CARLSON: --that behavior is bad. HOSSAIN: --definition is. And you're completely-- CARLSON: I understand precisely-- HOSSAIN: --confusing two - two different points. CARLSON: --what it is. HOSSAIN: No, you're not. Toxic masculinity is not inherent. CARLSON: Well then you tell me why can-- HOSSAIN: And not all men are violent and bad. Breaking news, Tucker, not all men are-- CARLSON: But why-- HOSSAIN: --violent and bad. And what's so controversial about what - what-- CARLSON: --that's not - not actually news to me as of Mayer (ph). HOSSAIN: --John Mayer said? What's so controversial about that? He's saying don't feel entitled to women. And we are talking, you know, this is coming on the heels of-- CARLSON: OK. But - but let me ask you, hold on, hold on, wait, hold on, can I ask you-- HOSSAIN: --a really intense time in this country (ph). CARLSON: --a serious - OK, OK-- HOSSAIN: Please do. CARLSON: --it is an intense time. But I think all of us as adults have an obligation to think (ph) as clearly as we can. HOSSAIN: That's why you shouldn't define toxic masculinity-- CARLSON: So, it is - it has been a common place-- HOSSAIN: --incorrectly. CARLSON: --there's no definition of it, as you know. It's a bunch of ludicrous-- HOSSAIN: There is. No, you're saying that. That's not correct-- CARLSON: --low IQ academics making up as they go along (ph)-- HOSSAIN: --Tucker. CARLSON: --and you know but it is true. HOSSAIN: No, it isn't. CARLSON: But let me ask you very quickly. Why not just say abuse is bad? Toxic - masculinity is a quality that is inherent in men. You're attacking inherent-- HOSSAIN: Masculinity but not toxic masculinity-- CARLSON: --quality. You know that perfectly well which is why you'll not concede-- HOSSAIN: --no, because you don't know what you're talking about-- CARLSON: --that there's such a thing as toxic femininity. HOSSAIN: --toxic masculinity-- CARLSON: It's attack (ph) against men. HOSSAIN: --is not inherent. CARLSON: Oh, I do too well. HOSSAIN: No, you don't because you're completely mis-defining it. CARLSON: OK. HOSSAIN: It's incorrect. CARLSON: Yes, OK, I need to read more academic journals. And I will. HOSSAIN: Please do. Or just do a quick-- CARLSON: Anushay Hossain, great to see you. Thank you. HOSSAIN: --Google search. Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Hilarious. Brett Kavanaugh can barely go outside now. Meanwhile, the Clintons are loud and proud and on tour, at a cost. Bill and Hillary are not rich enough so they'll be traveling across the United States. Will anyone notice? Well after the break (ph). And as bad as he can be, Bill Clinton, at least, understood voters and cared what they thought. His party has changed dramatically. They don't care at all. That process, the dramatic change in the Democratic and Republican Party's detailed in some detail in the book on your screen. We'll be right back. TEXT: TUCKER'S BOOK IS OUT NOW. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well Brett Kavanaugh made it onto the Supreme Court. He was sworn in today. And yet, the attacks on him which were without precedent have made it likely impossible for him or his family to lead a normal public life for some time, maybe ever. No such restrictions, you'll notice, exist for Bill Clinton though. He and his wife Hillary are going on tour. They're not rich enough. They would like to be much richer and they think you can help. They'll be visiting 13 cities in the next seven months to host a series of what they're calling \"Conversations,\" about what else? Themselves. You want to go and pay homage to them? Of course, you do. Tickets to the first event in Las Vegas cost a mere 70 - 72 bucks. That's the cheapest. Mark Steyn is an author and columnist. He'll be first in line for the Conversation tour. He joins us tonight. You going to this, Mark? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: I'm actually rather disturbed, Tucker, that a remarkable number of stops on this tour are Canadian cities. And I don't know whether that's a great insult to my native land. If they - they feel a bit like one of these superannuated Rock groups that are still big in Japan that it's - it's like that kind of thing. And I wonder - I wonder-- CARLSON: Grand Funk Railroad, yes. STEYN: --yes, something - something like that, still Grand Funk Railroad is still big in Taiwan and Germany. But it's - it's interesting after hearing these Democrats talk about toxic masculinity. This is actually the toxin in the former Bill Clinton going - I mean I don't know how you get the toxin in the masculinity for - for one thing. But I'm pretty sure that what - however you do it, Bill Clinton's in on the secret, and that would actually be something quite interesting to know about. But he won't be doing anything like that. It'll be bland, insipid Clinton Foundation type speeches-- CARLSON: Yes. STEYN: --except that they've run out of Saudi princes and Kazakh warlords willing to pony up the big bucks, so they got to take the act on the road. CARLSON: It'll be the blandest mush ever served. STEYN: Yes, yes. But it-- CARLSON: You spent your childhood being educated in an island nation that gave birth to this country, Britain. And so, I want to ask you about this story that emerged today. So the former astronaut, American, Scott Kelly learned the hard way how dangerous it is to praise anybody born before 1985. Yesterday, on Twitter, he posted this quote. \"One of the greatest leaders of modern times, Sir Winston Churchill said, \"In victory magnanimity.\" I guess those days are over.\" So, for the crime of praising Churchill he was inundated with criticism from users who denounced Churchill as an imperialist, racist, genocidal warmonger, whatever. He bowed to them and responded to \"Educate myself further on his atrocities and racist views.\" Whoa. He's been re-educated. What does this tell us, Mark? STEYN: Well I think it tells us the moronization (ph) that comes with living in a eternal present tense, Churchill-- CARLSON: Yes. STEYN: --it should hardly be necessary to say this. He was the indispensable man of the 20th Century. He presided over the Hinge moment of the 20th Century, which is the period between the fall of France in the spring of 1940 and the Germans' insane decision to invade the Soviet Union a late - a year later. CARLSON: Right. STEYN: That year when Britain and its empire stood alone determined the course of the 20th Century. And if it hadn't been Churchill, I mean I - I hate having to explain this. It's pathetic that one of the few men who's actually golly (ph) go up into orbit apparently left his brains out on Planet Zongo somewhere. There is no need to apologize for defending Churchill, sir. You live in the world Churchill made. And if some Twitter ignoramus trying to drive you to suicide because the only point of Twitter is to drive minor celebrities to suicide, if the Twitter mob doesn't know that, get off Twitter. Go back into space. You'll meet a less moronic class of person up on Planet Zongo. CARLSON: You live in the world Churchill created. So as someone who's clearly thought this through, really quick, for the edification of the rest of us, how do we respond when the Twitter mob goes after us for saying something that should be obvious? STEYN: I think you actually have to shove it down their throats. This guy, the - these guys are arguing that Churchill was no different from Hitler. No. Churchill was the guy who defeated Hitler when everybody else around him, like the other guy who would have been Prime Minister, Lord Halifax, wanted actually to make peace and accommodate with him (ph). We are living in an eternal present tense and-- CARLSON: That's right. STEYN: --in eternal present tense means you're eternally a child. You're Taylor Swift. You're Justin Bieber. And that's why you can't comprehend Winston Churchill because he wears long pants unlike Justin Bieber. CARLSON: I knew. I knew you'd be the best in that. Mark Steyn, great to see you. Thank you. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: Everything else in the news has disappeared for the last month. We're waking up to a brand new world. But news has still been happening. The Left is pushing an increasingly, in fact, radical agenda, amnesty for as many as 22 million people here illegally. That is their electoral strategy going forward. You need to know about it. We have the details after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well the month-long battle over Brett Kavanaugh consumed virtually all attention in Washington, virtually, all of our attention, and it distracted a lot of us from the issue of immigration. That issue has not gone away. In fact, we know more about it now than we did a month ago. Many Democratic candidates are still running on a platform of abolishing border enforcement, ending any kind of enforcement at the borders, and outright amnesty for the people already here illegally. That could be a bigger question than any of us knew. A new study by Yale University, two Yale professors, one from MIT, found that there are about 22 million illegal immigrants in the United States. That is double the conventional estimate. There could be more. Cesar Vargas is a lawyer and a former illegal immigrant and he joins us tonight. Cesar, thanks a lot for coming on. So, I think this is a - this is a meaningful study. And it's not done by a, you know, some politically minded group. I think it's probably done by Liberals. 22 million people is a lot of people. Are you still for giving them all citizenship? CESAR VARGAS, NATIONAL IMMIGRATION REFORM ADVOCATE, FORMER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT: Tucker, thank you so much for having me. Happy Indigenous Peoples' Day. CARLSON: Thank you. VARGAS: Before we get into the politics of the issue-- CARLSON: Don't pull into this show (ph) with that nonsense. VARGAS: --let's - let's get with those three-- CARLSON: It's Columbus Day, pal, come on. VARGAS: --let's get two, three points on that. CARLSON: OK. VARGAS: First, make - let's make sure that the researchers clearly said that this is not an assumption or implication that there's an outburst of undocumented immigrants here in the U.S. Second-- CARLSON: OK. VARGAS: --it's based on a very basic principle. They said that they take in consideration the initial population plus everyone who comes in plus everyone who leaves. This points directly to what they want to say, namely, that it's a shadowy (ph) population and obviously we're not going to count everyone, so there's definitely an undercount (ph). And three, most importantly, is simply that this was - this was a-- CARLSON: I'm sorry. I don't - look, I'd want to give you time to speak. I do that-- VARGAS: --study from 1990 (ph) to 2016. So, it could have been at any point-- CARLSON: --OK. But hold on, hold on, let's just - just stop this speech, just please answer my question-- VARGAS: --either 22 million, 9 million, 2 million, so let's understand the report first-- CARLSON: --OK, it's just OK, no it couldn't be 2 million (ph)-- VARGAS: --before we talk about the politics. CARLSON: --stop please. I - I - it's not even politics. I read this study. It's pretty clear they're the first people to look at this systematically and there are far more than 11 million people in this country illegally. The largest margin in the history of presidential elections in this country, 1984, was about 17 million, so there are more illegal aliens than there are voters who made the difference in the biggest blowout in American presidential history. You're following me here with the math. VARGAS: Well the-- CARLSON: This is definitive. So you're - I just want to know really quick if there are 22 million, 24 million, 20 million, you want to give all of them citizenship and voting rights? Are you still for that? You are always (ph) for that-- VARGAS: Oh, absolutely. No question. CARLSON: --are you still for it? VARGAS: Look at the economy. CARLSON: Right. VARGAS: We're doing pretty well. 3.7 unemployment rate, 4.2 economic growth, if we want to be able to do even better, look, if we had 22 million undocumented immigrants now-- CARLSON: Then let them vote (ph)-- VARGAS: --we're doing pretty well economically. So I say, path to citizenship, let them pay taxes-- CARLSON: Well I'm sure that you've said - so even (ph)-- VARGAS: --and we will have an even better economy. Let's just talk about now where we are-- CARLSON: --so they're not paying taxes. Wait, hold on (ph), slow down, slow down-- VARGAS: --at this moment. CARLSON: --so they're not paying - wait, hold on, you're conceding that they're not paying taxes now. I thought having talked to you many times, your argument always was they're paying into the system more than they're taking out, which is totally untrue. VARGAS: I said more taxes. We could pay more taxes-- CARLSON: --it's like absurd dumb talking (ph)-- VARGAS: --immigrants-- CARLSON: --well how do they pay (ph) wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait. Citizens don't pay more taxes. Everybody who works pays the taxes, pays their tax rate, so you're conceding that a lot of these people in addition to breaking our immigration law, or breaking our tax law, and they're using fake IDs-- VARGAS: I said that if there is more than the original 11 million undocumented immigrants-- CARLSON: --so you're admitting that now after all these years of talking to you? VARGAS: --let them pay taxes. The 11 million undocumented immigrants-- CARLSON: I thought they already paid taxes. VARGAS: --already paid taxes. I said more taxes. So if there is more-- CARLSON: Wait but why would they pay more taxes? VARGAS: --than what we originally planned-- CARLSON: Hold on-- VARGAS: --then less - let them pay more. If there is 11 million-- CARLSON: OK. I don't know if I can keep having you on this show because this-- VARGAS: --right we assume (ph)-- CARLSON: --doesn't even make any sense at all. I just want to-- VARGAS: Very simple math. If there's 11 million undocumented immigrants but there's 22-- CARLSON: --look, it's really simple. No, no, what you're saying-- VARGAS: --let - let the other 11 million pay taxes. CARLSON: --doesn't make any - right-- VARGAS: --no? Very simple math. I'm not saying anything complicated on this show. CARLSON: I don't even know what you're saying. Your point is that illegal aliens are great. They're better than us. They pay their full tax share. OK, you've always been - you've always said that. You said that 20 times in my show. VARGAS: Absolutely. CARLSON: And now you're saying well if we - if we give them the vote, they'll pay more taxes. What? That doesn't even make sense. Here's the bottom line. I just want our viewers to understand what the agenda of lunatics like you is. And I mean that with all respect and I like you personally. But you're saying 22 million brand-new voters in our electorate, OK, I don't know, were here illegally, now they all get to vote, they're 90 percent and we're (ph) going to vote for the Democrats. What you're saying is that one political party will have a hammerlock on national elections forever. What do you think the rest of us think about that who aren't Democrats-- VARGAS: Well I simply say-- CARLSON: --like how do you think I'm going to (ph) feel about that? VARGAS: --I simply say that. Why don't Republicans and Democrats actually compete for the vote and let people have their say. If Democrats want to - want to pass immigration for, Republicans want to pass immigration for, then let them give-- CARLSON: No (ph). Now we're getting - now we're getting into stuff I don't even understand. OK. VARGAS: --the power to vote and let's compete. This is what democracy is all about, right, Tucker? CARLSON: Yes. Letting foreigners invade your country and then take over your government. That definitely sounds like democracy to me. VARGAS: This is our country. This is your country. This is our country. CARLSON: Cesar, thank you so much. VARGAS: Have a good night. CARLSON: I hope people are freaked out by this. I am. Thank you. Today is Columbus Day. Not everyone's calling it that though. Some, like our previous guest, are calling it Indigenous Peoples' Day. What does that mean? You don't have a right to be here, neither did your ancestors. We hate you. You get the point. We'll unpack it in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Well government workers, students, and probably about a total of 10 private sector employees enjoyed the day off today. It's Columbus Day. But people are increasingly not grateful to Christopher Columbus for giving them the day off. Noted fake Native American activist Elizabeth Warren says today should be Indigenous People Day in honor of the ancestors she doesn't have. And more and more cities across the United States are renaming the holiday that. Most notably, Columbus, Ohio is ditching Columbus Day and celebrating Veterans Day instead. James Robbins is the author of Erasing America: Losing Our Future by Destroying Our Past. It's a brilliant book based on a brilliant and true concept. He joins us tonight. James, thanks a lot for coming on. So, this is part of a larger trend that you write about in some detail in your book, which I hope our viewers read. Tell us what that trend is. JAMES ROBBINS, COMMENTARY WRITER FOR USA TODAY, SENIOR FELLOW FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS ON THE AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COUNCIL, ERASING AMERICA AUTHOR: Tucker, well the trend is to assault the American narrative to make us all feel ashamed to be Americans, to look at every aspect of the American story and say, you know, the founders were bad, the Constitution is racist. And what better place to start than with Christopher Columbus, who is, really, patient zero of the European invasion of America? CARLSON: What is - I - I couldn't agree with you more. That's clearly the thread that ties all these stories together trying to delegitimize the country we live in. But what's the point of that? Why would they want to do that? ROBBINS: Well I think the point of it is if we feel bad about our country, if we feel bad about the past then they can rewrite any kind of future they want. I mean the progressives want to turn the United States into a socialist country. Well, in order to do that, if you say that, you know, the founders were all evil men and an evil document and everything in the past was bad, well then they can come up with a future that fits whatever they want to make it. CARLSON: Right. So, they're really telling the rest of us you don't have the right to defend yourself against our assault. You don't have the moral legitimacy to defend your own country. ROBBINS: Oh, definitely. I mean it's all about shame, it's all about blame, you know, the assault on Columbus. And by the way, as a Buckeye, I'm really sad about Columbus, Ohio-- CARLSON: I know. ROBBINS: --kind of ditching the holiday. I think they should change the name of the city if that's what they're thinking. But-- CARLSON: Yes, no, I agree with that too. Indigenous City, how's that? ROBBINS: --or Virtueville (ph), something like that. CARLSON: It's good (ph). So, are you seeing this not as - obviously, it's been going on in academia for quite some time. But it seems to have spread to, again, normal places like Columbus, Ohio which is a great town, actually, filled with normal people. How did it get to Columbus? ROBBINS: Well I think it's been insinuated into the American education system for decades. I mean starting in the 1970s, we've had this creep of revisionism in American history books until it kind of becomes the accepted narrative. I mean particularly with Columbus-- CARLSON: Right. ROBBINS: --he starts off, you know, chapter one in Howard Zinn's Revisionist History of America. So people have grown up saying-- CARLSON: Yes. ROBBINS: --oh, Columbus, yes, he's a bad guy. CARLSON: It's unbelievable. It was a great book and your explanation of it was crisp and super helpful. I appreciate you coming on. Thank you. ROBBINS: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, quick note for you. So, last Tuesday, we released a new book. It's called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Pushing America to the Brink of Revolution. On the cover of the book is a caricature of Jeff Bezos, and there's more about him inside. He's one of the people the book says has hurt this country by his behavior. Now, it turns out Bezos runs Amazon.com, which happens to have a virtual monopoly on book sales in America. It might not have been the best marketing decision, but we meant it sincerely, so we did it. So fast forward to this week and, maybe not so surprisingly, Amazon is now telling customers it cannot ship them this book for weeks. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Our publisher is baffled. They're not telling people trying to buy Bob Woodward's book that. We don't know what's going on. We'll let you guess. But in the meantime, you can still buy the book at Barnes & Noble or at your local bookstore, and we hope you will. Well that's about it for us tonight. You can tune in every weeknight at 8 P.M. Eastern to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink, which is omnipresent. We don't even notice it. But it's everywhere. And it's destroying our brains. We're against that. Hope you are too. Have a great night. Hannity's next. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" October 24, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, THE FIVE CO-HOST: I'm Jesse Watters along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five.\u00a0\nThis is a Fox News alert, the hunt is on to find out who's responsible for sending suspicious packages with suspected explosive devices to several prominent Democrats including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and also to CNN's New York City offices. We have team Fox coverage with John Roberts at the White House, and Bryan Llenas at Chappaqua, New York. First, let's go to Bryan near the Clinton's home in Westchester County with brand-new information on the FBI's involvement in this investigation. Bryan?\u00a0\nBRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Jesse, the FBI said the packages sent to former attorney general, Eric Holder, the Obamas, the Clintons, George Soros, and to CNN were all similar. They were all the same type of packaging. The potential explosive devices were packed into heavy manila envelopes with computer-generated headers, they all had six American postage stamps, and all of the packages had a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in Florida, and her name was misspelled. Now on Tuesday night, a package sent to the Clinton's was intercepted before it even reached their home here in Chappaqua, New York, a screening technician spotted it on an off-site facility where they checked all of the Clinton mail. Now, President Bill Clinton was at home at the time. Former secretary Hillary Clinton has been campaigning in Florida.\u00a0\nMeantime, this morning, this explosive device was mailed to CNN's headquarters in New York. It was address to former CIA Director John Brennan, who was a contributor at CNN. It contained wires and a black pipe, there's also an envelope filled with white powder. Now, the Time Warner Center was evacuated. The bomb was moved by a concrete truck, brought to a bomb squad facility to be examined and then safely detonated. Now here in Chappaqua, we're just 15 minutes away from the home of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and mega Democratic donor, and you will remember that on Monday a package was delivered to his mailbox. Now investigators are now looking at surveillance tape to determine whether or not that package, which had an explosive device, was hand delivered, put into the mailbox, and not brought there via the mailing system. Jesse?\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. Bryan, thanks very much. Let's now bring in John Roberts with the latest reaction from the White House. John?\u00a0\nJOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And the president saying earlier today in an east room event that he is angry, upset, and not satisfied at all with what has been going on here, the president also promising to bring the full weight of the federal government onto the investigation to get to the bottom of it and try to quickly find out who was responsible. When you tick off the list of names of people who got these devices, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Brennan, Eric Holder, Maxine Waters, George Soros, they count among the president's fiercest either political rivals or critics. So this afternoon when the president was talking about this he was very careful to stay away from politics. Listen here.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: In these times, we have to unify. We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts with threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nROBERTS: The president made those remarks at an event in the east room this afternoon to talk about progress being made in the war against opioid addiction. That is a particularly favorite issue of Melania Trump, the first lady, as part of her Be Best campaign. And to the surprise of a lot of people, she was introducing her husband this afternoon, and she weigh-in on these mailings. Listen here.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMELANIA TRUMP, U.S. FIRST LADY: We cannot tolerate those cowardly attacks, and I strongly condemn all who choose violence.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nROBERTS: The president will be leaving the White House very shortly heading for a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin. It's just south of Wausau. The president urging unity against political violence in that same east room event earlier today. However, when he gets on the campaign trail tonight, he's going to be in a highly competitive state, one where the Republican governor, Scott Walker, is in some difficulty. So I think any sense of political comity when it comes to actually defending these races may go out the window, but maybe there's a difference, Jesse, and I don't know between, you know, the harsh rhetoric that could lead to political violence and the rhetoric to try to win the seat. I'm not sure how you draw that line.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Tightrope he's got to walk tonight. John, thank you very much. And we just want to let the viewers know, Brennan works for MSNBC -- NBC News not CNN. All right, Dana, really sad day for the country, and saw the president looking very sad and somber at the White House. And now he's got a big rally tonight to turn out the base for the midterms. It's really tough situation for the country and for the president and both political parties.\u00a0\nDANA PERINO, THE FIVE CO-HOST: I saw sad. I saw conviction. And one of the things he said is my number one responsibility and priority is the safety of the American people.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Right.\u00a0\nPERINO: Whether you're Republican or Democrat, that's his number one priority. I also think that he was like -- this is big deal. And he had just had a briefing from the U.S. Secret Service, Department of Justice, FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. They're all coordinating with the alcohol, tobacco and firearms, and also the NYPD, Washington, D.C. This is something that they train for, they planned for. It is unfortunate. The good news for America is that the U.S. Secret Service, very good investigators. They have great leads. They have the ability to track this stuff down. Plus, thankfully, because none of these devices detonated, they have the evidence to be able to look through, find a fingerprint, cross-check it with possibly any social media posts. I'm not trying to downplay it. It is extremely serious. There could be more out there. But the full weight of the American justice system and our investigative capabilities makes it much more likely that this individual or this group will be caught sooner than later.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I, hopefully, as soon as possible. Greg, what do you think about the targets here, all high profile Democrats, former presidents, and very harsh critics of this president, just a series of mail bombings sent to these individuals, does this make any sense to you?\u00a0\nGREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE CO-HOST: You can draw a number of conclusions. You can say, well, this is somebody who doesn't like these people. That would be the obvious thing.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Right.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: But I would say that this is not a normal act, so don't act like it's a normal act by a normal person triggered by rhetoric. It's an act of terror by, likely, a deranged perpetrator or a group. But when I look at stuff like that, it looks almost always like it's a single person. But I'm a wait-and-see guy, so I don't want to make -- I think at times like this, you should have less speculation, not more speculation. The problem with cable news is you're required to fill time and speculate. But I realize that when it becomes to mass shootings and suspicious packages and certain events, the first conclusion is often -- the first conclusion on twitter is never the right one. The guy that comes out first usually ends up looking like an idiot. So you need, I think, less speculation is better.\u00a0\nBut I want to say this illustrates how easy it is to disrupt a free society simply with fear and panic. One person -- one person or a handful of people can have an impact of millions with boxes, pipes, and postage. And I think the upside to this is that it is so shocking because it's rare, and we have to remind ourselves it shocks us because it's rare. Because back in the 1970's, this wasn't rare. This was a common problem. They were actual terror groups, domestic terror groups, more than a handful of them, who were setting bombs, pipe bombs, trying to kill police officers, actually blowing up themselves. This was a regular thing after, you know, in the early '70s, mid '70s. So, this is a rare, disgusting event. It's an act of terror. But to go and try to speculate on anything without first having an arrest or suspect, I'd stay away from it.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I think, recently, Trump family members received white powder in the mail. And then some Trump cabinet officials, Juan, received ricin, but this looks like it's taken to a whole another level when you look at the level of Democratic, you know, officeholders, former presidents, former attorney generals, and George Soros is, you know, very, very influential person in the Democratic Party in terms of fund-raising and things like that. What do you make about today's event?\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE CO-HOST: Well, you know, when I listening to you guys talk about the rally tonight and how the president would have to walk a tightrope, what strikes me is that his rhetoric is quite incendiary at these events. And I don't think that this is representative of his supporters in anyway, but I do think that there are people out there who hear him very clearly when he says, oh, you know, those Democrats, lock up Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, he's not really an American. These people want to do away with ICE. They don't want borders. These are people who want to turn America into Venezuela -- I mean the rhetoric. And then, of course, he's the one who always said, go ahead and punch them. I'll pay your legal bills. The big problem around here is that we don't want to hurt anyone anymore. That kind of rhetoric, I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat, really does invite violence. And then you see these, today, and, of course, I think for people on the left, the instinct, and I think it's a mistake, would be to jump and say, I know exactly the source of this.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You just did.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I didn't\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You just said it's rhetoric.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No. I've said that -- what you see at those rallies, and I think you and Dana both spoke to this, at times he uses fear to stir his base.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So you're implying that caused this?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I'm implying that is the environment, Greg, that we live in today in the United States. And I think it's one that paints our political opponents as people who are not Americans, not patriots, not worthy, and, I think, then it invites the kind of lone actor, someone who may deranged, to engage in this very destructive behavior.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Emily, do you draw a line between the president's rhetoric and today's events?\u00a0\nEMILY COMPAGNO, THE FIVE CO-HOST: I do think -- with all due respect, Juan, that's a bit irresponsible to directly make that assumption, to make tie that that rhetoric caused this. Just recently we had a Democratic -- former Democratic staffer that was arrested, charged with multiple felonies for doxing three GOP senators. Certainly, you can't isolate -- not only the rhetoric, but also the actual act. And that brings to me to my next point which is that we shouldn't isolate this, or we should include a larger spectrum of what this act means. And by that -- so this was -- there was an explosive device. There was also powder, as you pointed out. That's kind of two different things. When I got my death threat as a federal acting director, I was able to call in an FPS, federal practice service, OPD -- I mean, they were at that guy doorstep within 30 minutes. And my point is that the resources, there's a whole spectrum of them dedicated to ensuring that nothing does fall within the cracks. And that they treat every threat -- you know the word credible threat, that's a misnomer. Every threat is credible. Nothing is isolated or ignored because all it takes is one, and that speaks to integrity of the secret service and -- as well as the FBI and the other agencies.\u00a0\nWATTERS: The secret service did an excellent job today and continue to do an excellent job. And we're going to be following the story. More breaking news on the suspicious packages ahead. But first, Democrats doing a major flip-flop on immigration, and we're going to show you the video next on The Five.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What happens when Democrats are in charge? Sometimes they grow up.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: Illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who enter the U.S. legally.\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.\u00a0\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Wow. Who are these bigots and why are they so mean to illegal immigrants? Actually, they were just being adults, because they were in charge once. Now, no longer in power, they depend on the Republicans to play grown-up and they be the kids, as thousands of migrants come our way. Fact is the Democrats need Republicans to be the bad guys, I.E., the adults. So the Democrat can hold dumb stances they don't even like. We've been watching the Dems offer emotionally lopsided views of the caravans, then, they smear you and me for bringing up any consequences. But imagine if there were no border constraints to stop the caravan. Imagine if we just hum John Lennon songs as we waved everyone through. Of course, you'd only launch a dozen new caravans, each filled with knowns and unknowns. It's obvious. Oh, wait, that's already happening. That's a consequence.\u00a0\nSo why aren't the Democrats worried? Because they know the Republicans and the U.S. border patrol will end up being the bad guys, we always are, and bail them out. It's perfect for Democrats because, really, it's all about looking good by feeling really bad about telling the migrants they can't stay. It's all theater. And in this theater the evil characters are anyone who thinks critically, and a hero, the progressive who pushes emotion without consequence, and he wins because he can fake empathy, still have a border, and an orange villain to blame it on. It's great being a kid. You can demand the dumbest things and secretly hope your parents aren't listening.\u00a0\nWhat do you think of my theory, Dana, that the Democrats actually need Republicans to be the bad guys because they know that they're going to -- they're going to pull the band aid off, they're going to ground the students, you know what I mean?\u00a0\nPERINO: I was thinking about a blind taste test, but a blind read test, so take away -- just take comments from Republicans and Democrats when they were in charge with Obama's two terms, and then Republicans with the George Bush term, and then President Obama. Blind test. Read them. And I think you would be hard-pressed to find any disagreement. That's what's so frustrating about this issue.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So my theory, Emily, is when you're out of power, you can say things that you really don't mean. And then when you get in power, suddenly you grow up and go, well, we've got to have a border.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Yeah, absolutely. Just to build on something that you said in your opening, I think that the left has framed this, the coverage and the conversation as either it's emotional and moral or you're totally devoid of compassion. And you can't have both. And the irony to me is the fact that that all-or-nothing approach does a dis-service in that compassion arena to all of the people, the migrants included, and all of those Central American and some Southern American countries that are affected in that multitude of areas, economically, and politically, and criminally, and diplomatically. There's so many other issues that I would think it would be the greater humanitarian and compassionate position to be honest and complex about that coverage and conversation.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Jesse, I think there's a lot of dishonesty here in pushing an event that has no positive outcome for the people involved. Like, sooner or later they're going to hit something that isn't going to let them in. And everybody else can just walk away and do another story. This story may be over in a couple of days, but you know what? We've incited a couple of caravans and they're going to fail at some point.\u00a0\nWATTERS: They are. And I'm the most compassionate guy at this table.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I believe that. You're at least at the top five.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yet, I'm always portrayed as mean-spirited just because I want to maintain the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the United States, the country that I love. I treat this country like a house. I want to know who's coming in, and I want to invite them when they come in, and I think every American agrees with me. And I want hungry foreigners to come to America and make money and achieve success, but I also don't like foreigners controlling U.S. immigration policy. I'd like Americans to control U.S. immigration policy. So when you see a bunch of impoverished strangers from Central America, kind of hostility, you're rushing north, and they're chanting things about our president, and they're wearing t- shirts that kind of a little offensive, and they're paying coyotes cash, and then they meet up with a bunch of lawyers from the ACLU, south of the border, and they're coached on what to say in order to get asylum. A lot of Americans look at that and they're a little uneasy with that. All we're saying is don't cut in line. Come here in an orderly process. We want a fair and orderly immigration system. But we also want compassion for Americans. Yuma and, I think, Arizona, this town is being overwhelmed by immigrants who are just dump there by the border patrol because they can't hold them. And the town's people and the citizens of Yuma, Hispanics, blacks, and white, American citizens are feeling like, what is happening to our town? We didn't vote for this. Where's the compassion for them?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Juan, a second caravan already starting. Obviously, it's not like they're getting -- they're getting encouragement by seeing this one before them, and then they start another. That's why this is so -- that's the consequence of this.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think it's a consequence of the failure of this president to enact any kind of immigration policy. And, obviously, the horrible things he was doing to children at the border has not acted as a disincentive. In fact, now we see instances like.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I wanted to say to you, Greg, that to me, as I was listening, I was thinking to myself, wow, so I guess the Democrats clearly are not people who are opposed to borders or opposed to keeping illegals out. What we saw at the top of this segment was Democrats saying, we need borders, we need legitimate protection.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But maybe we don't need a wall that's not going to be effective. But the second thing to say here is that, again, you demonize people. And today, you know, right-wing media sites were showing a picture of what looked like a beaten Mexican cop and suggesting, oh, this was happening in term of the caravan? The picture was from 2012. And, again.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I didn't demonize anybody, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: This is what happen, rather than saying we have a humanitarian crisis right now.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Which I did.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: And that we need to help these people, and we need to figure out a way to deal with this problem so that it doesn't.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So we don't get new lines forming. Instead, the emphasis is on, oh, the Democrats are the bad one. Gees, Louise. I wish that Republicans would say, you know what, I understand somebody is pushing a fair button, and it's the kind of thing that then leads people to conclude, oh, we should go after the Democrats.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Juan, I think it's unfair to say that the Republicans don't want to fix the problem. Republican had tried to fix the problem, try to change the loopholes in the law through congress and build the wall. And when you say that the wall won't work, I disagree with you. Democrats don't want the wall because they know it will work.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: It won't work.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Why wouldn't -- it won't work? Answer the question. Why wouldn't the wall work, Juan?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I'll tell you very quickly, if you want. I mean, the answer is that most people who come into this country illegally come -- and overstay visas, and they come on airplanes.\u00a0\nWATTERS: The wall is not going to prevent people from coming over on an airplane. I agree with you.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: We've got to go. Is the Democrats' dream of a midterm blue wave dead? That's next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: With just 13 days to go until the midterms, new signs indicate the so-called blue wave could come crashing down. Early voting in key battleground states shows Republicans turning out in much bigger numbers than Democrats, especially in pivotal house, senate, and gubernatorial races. All this, plus, former Obama officials now sounding the alarm.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: How many times are we going to do this, all right? It doesn't matter what the early votes look like. It doesn't matter what the polls look like, we could lose everything. We lost everything two years ago. We could lose everything again. Oh, my gosh.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So, Emily, what do you make of -- you know, you see these former Obama administration officials, you see Democrats now, I think, everybody saying, oh, it's going to be close, we always knew it was going to be close. Are they just covering their tracks because they were talking about a blue wave?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Probably. And I think also there was a bit of danger associated with calling it a blue wave because that might lead to complacency with the voters. I do think that in wake of, or in light of, or ironically, after the whole Kavanaugh debacle, I think women are being courted, politically, more than any other midterm election, which is interesting. And also, I think, no polls matter except for the poll after the election of who voted. You know what I mean?\u00a0\nEverything is always going to be probably wrong. There's huge margin of error, we learned that multiple times. And I think the races that matter or that would be very fascinating are the ones outside of Washington state, legislators and the governors. And I think is where a lot of policy will be driven moving forward, especially with the climate we're in, in terms of the state laws. That's going to be an interesting arena moving forward.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So, Jesse, a lot of concern about what the messaging is. The president has been traveling principally to red states, and oftentimes to rural areas. He doesn't go near the cities. But it looks like he's saying, you know what, I'm going to charge up my base. Are those the people who are voting early?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yeah, obviously, it's the midterms. But I think this is a real curveball. A kind of an October surprise, not a political conspiracy with these bomb mailings, but it changes the entire midterm dynamic in a huge way. Think about it. Right now it takes the caravan completely off the front page. It really puts Kavanaugh more in the rear mirror. And then the mob narrative, it doesn't neutralize it, but it definitely slows it down temporarily.\u00a0\nSo I think the president right now has to think to himself, right now, he's not dominating. And he's 99 percent dominating and usually never on the defensive, but he's going to be a little bit on the defensive after these bombings -- attempted bombings, because the media is going to blame him. And they've already started to blame him.\u00a0\nSo he has a choice. Does he sit back and try to rise above it, or does he, you know, fight back? He's going to fight back, and he's going to say something; and there's going to be a big brawl. You can just see it now.\u00a0\nDemocrats probably feel a little vindicated when they look at some of these attacks, because they think, you know, \"We've been saying that the president's rhetoric is going to cause violence and cause a political civil war in this country, and look what is happening.\"\u00a0\nRepublicans are probably looking at this and thinking, \"You know what?\" Probably feeling a little bit guilty if it's some crazy right-wing psychopath and a little bit depressed, and feeling sad.\u00a0\nAnd independents, I think, have kind of started to feel a little calmer with the Trump presidency, but this really brings a whole lot more instability to the Trump presidency. So I think they're a little unnerved by what's going on.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So our local media maven is Dana Perino. And Dana, I wanted to ask about messaging then. The Democrats have been focused on health care as the message, and it looks like they're continuing to do so, despite the fact that it now looks like there's -- the Senate really is going to stay red.\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, there's separate reasons for that. But the Democrats focus on health care for a good reason. Every poll shows, including the Fox News poll, it's the No. 1 issue on everyone's minds.\u00a0\nSo I do think that the Republicans didn't realize that the issue of preexisting conditions, no matter how many times they say, \"We are for covering preexisting conditions,\" there is just a way for the Democrats to get in there and get under peoples' skin and worry people about it.\u00a0\nTwo weeks is an eternity. The political winds can change. Two things will be, for sure, happening.\u00a0\nOne, President Trump will continue to saturate the airwaves. It was a strategy that worked for him in 2016, and he's going to ride that to the end.\u00a0\nBut the other thing is that the 2020 Democrats have realized that Elizbeth Warren getting out last week and trying to, you know, show that she's Indian, Native American, it fell flat.\u00a0\nSo you don't see a lot of the 2020 Democrats getting out ahead of the midterm elections. They're going to wait until the starting pistol goes off. And that will be at midnight on Election Day.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So Greg, what do Republicans do for messaging? We've heard, you know, Dana said they were right to focus on health care, but you've heard, like, Mitch McConnell saying, the majority leader say, \"Yes, the deficit is exploding after the tax cuts, but that's because of entitlement spending, not necessarily because of the tax cut.\"\u00a0\nPERINO: It's true.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: How do you make sense of that?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: We have a great economy right now. We've got some incredible achievements in the last two years that you can point to, in the fact that this is probably one -- who would have thought that Donald Trump would help negotiate peace in the Koreas? It's kind of incredible.\u00a0\nYou've got, like, almost nonexistent unemployment -- jobs not mobs. You think that's a bad motto? It's not. It sticks, compared to what the Dems have, which is nothing.\u00a0\nSpeaking of which, we hung a segment on those three stooges? Those guys actually worked for Obama. They look like -- they remind me of the guys with clipboards on the street trying to get you to sign, like, a -- to help pay for the Greenpeace tugboat.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Do you have a minute?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes. Do you have a minute? Or they're at the electronics kiosk at the airport. But how can we take that seriously? That's hilarious.\u00a0\nI think the -- and they're wrong. The Democrats are in such a commanding position that if I were a Democrat, I wouldn't even worry too much about voting. It's in the bag.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Listen. Listen to this.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I would say, on voting day, if you're a Democrat, start partying early, maybe start the night before, get hammered. It's all in the bag. Don't go out. It's done. You've got this.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That, folks, was the latest form of voter suppression, courtesy of --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: The best I have.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: -- of Greg and Jesse. \"Hey, you young people, you white women, stay home, stay home. These guys have got it. They're going to the polls.\"\u00a0\nBrand-new developments on the investigation into who may be responsible for the suspicious packages sent to Democrats today. All that right here on \"The Five.\" We'll give you the latest when we return.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Fox News alert. Investigators are working to determine who was responsible for targeting high-profile Democrats and CNN with suspicious devices. The NYPD says they appear to be from the same person or persons, so how will the investigation play out?\u00a0\nLet's go to senior correspondent Rick Leventhal with an update -- Rick.\u00a0\nRICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Well, Emily, whoever made these devices only had to make one very small mistake to get caught. It could be a partial fingerprint, or a tiny speck of DNA, or fibers or traceable components.\u00a0\nAnd while the NYPD and local police may have been the first to respond to these incidents, the FBI will take the lead. Its primary focus is preventing and investigating terror attacks. And, of course, this device, described as a pipe bomb, could be described as an attempted terror attack and appeared to be a legitimate threat, which is why it was transported by the NYPD and a special truck known as a total containment vehicle to a facility in the Bronx that's used to investigate and detonate suspicious packages and unexploded ordinances.\u00a0\nBut in this case, authorities do not want to blow this thing up, of course, because it's evidence. Once it's rendered safe, the FBI will take possession and likely move it to Quantico, where they'll examine every inch of it. What are the materials used? Where were they purchased? What similarities does it have, not just to the other devices sent this week but devices found in past months and years? How sophisticated is it? Was it built from instructions off the Internet or by someone with military training?\u00a0\nAnd they have no doubt already obtained surveillance footage from the facilities where these devices were mailed from. One thing the FBI has proven it's very good at is investigating after incidents. So there will be clues, and the FBI most likely will find them -- Emily.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Rick, thank you for that.\u00a0\nPresident Trump is condemning the political attacks while also calling for national unity.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: This egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans.\u00a0\nWe're extremely angry, upset, unhappy about what we witnessed this morning, and we will get to the bottom of it.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: So, Jesse, will we have unity or is there going to be more blinking (ph)?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Well, I remember after the Scalise shooting, there was a call for national unity which lasted about a week. And so I don't expect any sort of national unity now to last any longer than a couple of days. Unfortunately, this country is so divided that something even as heinous as this isn't going to bring us together.\u00a0\nWith that said, everyone is speculating on the motives. We still don't know the motive of the Las Vegas shooter, so for people to think we're going to get to the bottom of this now, they have no clue. These investigations could go any way. Right now, it's -- all signs are pointing to some lunatic right-wing psychopath loner or a group of people, but you don't know what the investigation could find. It could find anything. So I think it's just safer for everybody just to wait and see what happens, and then we can comment on facts.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: And so, Juan, today we've had now threats and suspicious packages for political figures and also in media. And just recently, we had the Capital Gazette newsroom being shot up and multiple people killed.\u00a0\nSo how do you account for that lack of memory, that goldfish memory that the nation seems to have, that week of unity that Jesse just described? Why is that?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think, you know, it's pretty obvious we have a president who likes to divide people.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But to me, the -- you know, the sad part is, if you think back to something like 9/11 and all the flags we saw in every neighborhood, every part of America, those moments of cohesiveness are easily dissolved when you have people who decide, \"You know what? It's easy enough to tell lies. Let the people try to catch up with it later. The press is the enemy.\" You mentioned the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. But there's also, I mean, a constant kind of language that we hear at the rallies.\u00a0\nSo to me, this is very disturbing. And again, I'm with Jesse on this one. I don't think we know what's behind it or who's behind it.\u00a0\nBut I can say I live in America today, that we are not only divided, we are being intentionally divided. We talk about the Russians going at the various fissures in American society, whether it be race or income or party. And this is where we are. And I think President Trump thinks pushing that fear button, telling lies about the caravan, oh, it's just fine, just a political tactic in a midterm campaign. Well, no, it hurts.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Dana, with your experience --\u00a0\nPERINO: I just want to jump in here. OK. We should not blame people for violence if they're not responsible for it.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Thank you.\u00a0\nPERINO: And the Capital Gazette, let's just remember; let's go back. This was a person who had sent letters to the editor and was known to the Capital Gazette. And that whole -- that was not about political speech. It was about how this deranged person had a gun and how he was able to get in there. That was what that was about.\u00a0\nThere was a tangential relationship to say, well, we shouldn't say the press is the enemy of the people. Absolutely agree.\u00a0\nBut if we blame people that are speaking -- like, Juan, last night, your \"One More Thing\" was about the importance of the First Amendment and freedom of speech. Speech is not violence. Speech is not action. Speech is speech, and we have to keep that in mind. That's what keeps our -- there's a First Amendment for a reason. Let's not take the Capital Gazette example and say that this is the same thing. It's not.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, no. I didn't say that. Emily brought it up, and I think it's legitimate, by the way.\u00a0\nPERINO: But --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Let me just say, when you have a president who says, \"I really loved body-slamming -- this candidate who body-slammed a reporter.\"\u00a0\nPERINO: I get it, I get it. No one's -- again, he didn't slam the reporter.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, he celebrated the guy who did.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's a joke. It's a joke.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Everything's a joke. Until there's violence\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You're incapable of telling the difference between something serious and a joke. And by the way, if you want to sit here and blame him for the rhetoric, it goes both ways, sir.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, here we go. What about it? What about it?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: That's what you do.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You refuse to hold Trump to any kind of responsibility.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: No, let me finish. You had your soliloquy. You had your soliloquy. If you want to blame rhetoric, if you want to blame violence on rhetoric, everybody is guilty. OK?\u00a0\nYou could go after the networks for specials on police brutality, linking back to the death of cops. You could talk about how much anti-Trump coverage there is, and you could link that to, perhaps, death threats against him. It's something that is so meaningless.\u00a0\nIf you -- if you blame rhetoric, then you let the real people off the hook, and some of those people just happen to be fringe frickin' psychos who hijack the news. And you're using it to bash Trump, which is kind of despicable.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I am not.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Because you -- no, because you do this every day. You'll take everything you can and throw it on Trump.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, yes. Gee, imagine that.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: And it's so comical. At a point, it's funny. It's funny to me.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Imagine that, because Trump goes after Democrats for turning into socialists. Remember? And not only that, what about \"lock her up,\" the press is the enemy of the people.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: George Soros --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: And that caused violence.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Fake news is the enemy of the people. If we're going to slam him, let's slam him accurately.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think that you purposely close your eyes any time -- you say, anything, \"Trump is just talking.\"\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes, that's me. I was so good on Trump when he was running for president. I was one of the most critical people here.\u00a0\nPERINO: Just go Emily. You can drive.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: All right. Don't go anywhere, you guys. We're going to lighten things up with \"Wild Card Wednesday\" next.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yay.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Stand by.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nPERINO: That's a good song. Throwback from Levi Lowrey.\u00a0\nAll right, it's time for this.\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Wild Card Wednesday.\u00a0\nPERINO: It's \"Wild Card Wednesday.\" We each picked a topic, put them in this hat. None of us know the others' stories that were selected. So I'm just going to pick one out here.\u00a0\nOK, No. 1 is this. San -- San Francisco now has a SnapCrap app to help residents report poop on public walkways. It's a new free application that lets people figure out -- you can take a photo, send it to the city, hopefully get it cleaned up. Greg, was this yours?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: No, it was mine.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You're Bay Area. You're Bay Area, so you know what's -- it's so sad.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Really bad. Totally. And here -- here's what I wanted to say about it. That it took someone not from the bay who moved to the city, a guy who moved to Vermont to figure out this app, to create the app, and it's free. And you just text it when you need. Not only human feces, but also used needles.\u00a0\nIn the year prior, like direct calls to public works of -- in the city, it was over -- let's see, I wrote it down -- 400,000 -- oh, 24,000. All right. A little bit less. But 24,000 direct calls to public works.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's a lot.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: Who even knows that number? So he created this app, and as my home city across the bay, I just find it such a shame.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: The whole city, I mean, their politicians are full of crap, and now their city's full of crap.\u00a0\nDo you know that I had to take an escalator, and when I was coming out of the BART, the escalator was broken. And it was one of the tall escalators. And I told you this. And I said why. He said, \"Well, because it's clogged with feces.\" And they had to open up the whole escalator and dig --\u00a0\nPERINO: This is not fair to your fellow human.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Or to our viewers --\u00a0\nPERINO: No.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: -- who are eating.\u00a0\nPERINO: OK, next one is report, 25 percent of millennials say they're suffering from PTSD because of the 2016 elections. Psychological study -- I mean, come on, guys. Their average stress score was similar to witnesses of a mass shooting seven months after the incident. That's an insult to those people.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It is. It's really pathetic.\u00a0\nPERINO: To veterans.\u00a0\nWATTERS: So this is, like, a couple months after experiencing firsthand a mass shooting. Think about how psychologically scarred that would be. A school shooting, watching friends getting blown away. That's how people feel about Trump's election. Can you believe that, it Juan? How scary is that.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes, but I can believe it.\u00a0\nWATTERS: No. Are you suffering?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I remember the election night. Chris Wallace said to me, he said, \"Buddy, you're going to have a rough four years.\"\u00a0\nWATTERS: Four? How about eight?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You know what? I think you don't understand. This gets back to what we were discussing earlier in the show, how divided Trump has made this country.\u00a0\nPERINO: You can have division but not say that you have PTSD like veterans.\u00a0\nWe have time for one more? OK, $10,000 sleep coaches are like personal trainers for your dreams. A growing number of people -- oh, my gosh -- are turning to sleep coaches and sleep centers to help them catch enough shut- eye. It can cost up to $10,000 for an individual day-long session.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Where they teach you how to sleep better?\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes. This was yours?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: This was mine. Because my sleep coach is ZzzQuil. And probably the best damn coach I've ever met in my life.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Cheaper than $10,000.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Exactly. It's like seven bucks a bottle.\u00a0\nPERINO: You know that America is doing pretty well if you can spend $10,000 for --\u00a0\nWATTERS: Some people -- some people -- if you're buying a sleep coach, you disgust me.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But I think you're right. I think what did you say, Nyquil?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: ZzzQuil. ZzzQuil is Nyquil without the --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What about Budweiser?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Got to get up and pee.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: My sleeping aid , it was a weighted blanket. It was a gift. I tried it out. I passed out immediately.\u00a0\nPERINO: Because you couldn't breathe?\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: It's amazing. A weighted blanket, far less expensive.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right, \"One More Thing\" is up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nWATTERS: It's time now for \"One More Thing\" -- Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, good news, Jesse, for some lucky kids in New York City. Rapper and businessman Sean \"P-Diddy\" Combs is putting a million dollars into a new charter school. Here he is, telling us why he did it.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSEAN \"P-DIDDY\" COMBS, RAP MOGUL: It's about educating our children, bringing them up as leaders, bringing them up to fight for social justice, preparing them for this world that we live in.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: This will be the third charter school That P-Diddy is supporting. He already has one in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and another here in Manhattan in Harlem. The rapper says he wants every kid to have a good shot at making it in America.\u00a0\nI'm a big supporter of charter schools, and Sean Combs, let me say, I salute you, because you're exactly right to do is focus on our children as the key to America's future.\u00a0\nWATTERS: We should get him on \"The Five\" one of these days.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'd take him.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. Dana. OK, there's a new \"I'll Tell You What\" podcast. We recorded it today, Chris Stirewalt and me, and it's got a lot of stuff about the midterms, in case you love that stuff.\u00a0\nAnd also last night -- Jesse, you're going to want to pay attention to this -- PBS air the last episode of \"The Great American Read.\" They have a -- I think I have animation.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Oh, God.\u00a0\nPERINO: Blah, blah, blah. Whatever, we don't have it.\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Dana's Book Club\u00a0\nPERINO: It's very cute. That's \"Dana's Book Club.\"\u00a0\nBut it was a contest. America participated to figure out which books do you like the most. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" No. 1. \"Outlander,\" \"Harry Potter,\" \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Lord of the Rings\" -- I know you like that one -- and others. So you can find good books there.\u00a0\nWATTERS: \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" my father's favorite book.\u00a0\nMy turn. The police are on the hunt for this man. Take a look at him right here. British police are after this guy who stole some beers from a liquor store. Does he remind you of somebody?\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Everybody thinks it's David Schwimmer. OK?\u00a0\nNow, Schwimmer actually responded to the story with this video, but he says he has an alibi. He actually was in America at the time this happened.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Where were you?\u00a0\nWATTERS: I don't know why everyone's pointing a finger at me. I haven't - -\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Split screen of suspect and Jesse Watters hold a box of beer\u00a0\nWATTERS: Who did that?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: By the way, they Photoshopped that. Why didn't they just go buy some beer and re-create it? You would have had some beer.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's right. And then they could have expensed beer for me.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Then you could have gone to sleep.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's true. Also, \"Wednesdays with Watters\" on Martha tonight at 7.\u00a0\nGreg Gutfeld.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right. My podcast is up. It's at FOXNewsPodcast.com. I interview one of the great writers in my life, Dennis Boyles, about his new book called \"The Republican River,\" which focuses on red states like Kansas and Nebraska, and why they're red. It's a great book. If you want to get it, it's not at TheRepublicanRiver.com. But the podcast is great. Give it a listen.\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Greg's Transportation News\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Here, you can have my copy. Now you have to read it.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Emily.\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: OK. I think this is particularly resonating today, that two Vermont candidates who are running for a state house seat drew national attention because, after they had a two-hour debate in a local library, they asked the viewers and participants to hold on a second. They had something extra. Take a listen.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\n(MUSIC: EDDIE VEDDER'S \"SOCIETY\")\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCOMPAGNO: OK, so it didn't sound good, but the point was that they did this duet. And they were playing Eddie Vedder's \"Society,\" whose lyrics speak of a less competitive society. And one of the voters said, you know, \"It gave me a lot of hope.\"\u00a0\nWATTERS: I'd like to see Trump and Biden doing that after the debate.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next -- Bret.\u00a0\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Jesse.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) Calling himself a \u201cpolitically incorrect conservative,\u201d Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp said he could personally \u201cround up criminal illegals\u201d in his truck if needed in his latest campaign ad. Sitting in a Ford F350, Brian Kemp, the current Republican secretary of state, said, \u201cI got a big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.\u201d \u201cYep, I just said that,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cIf you want a politically incorrect conservative, that\u2019s me.\u201d The 30-second spot starts with an explosion in the background as Kemp said, \u201cI\u2019m so conservative, I blow up government spending.\u201d He then moves on to showing off a gun, which he said \u201cno one is taking away,\u201d and a chainsaw, quipping that he is \u201cready to rip up some regulations.\u201d Kemp also promoted the ad on social media, tagging President Trump in a tweet. \u201cHey, [Trump]! If you need some help rounding up criminal aliens [and] sending them back home, let me know. I\u2019ve got a big truck,\u201d he said in a tweet. This isn\u2019t the first ad the gubernatorial hopeful released during this campaign that has raised eyebrows. Earlier this month, Kemp was criticized for his campaign ad that showed him pointing a shotgun toward a young man who supposedly wanted to date his daughter. The man, Jake, responded with a list of reasons why Kemp is running for governor when prompted. That list included: \u201ccap government spending,\u201d \u201ctake a chainsaw to regulations\u201d and \u201cmaking Georgia number one for small businesses.\u201d And in order to date his daughter, Jake responded that he needed to have respect and an \u201cappreciation for the Second Amendment.\u201d The primary for Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race, and other elections in the state, will be held on May 22. Kemp will face off against other Republicans for the party\u2019s nomination, including Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, former state Sen. Hunter Hill, businessman Clay Tippins and state Sen. Michael Williams.

            "article_content": "Far-left New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon wants to pass single-payer health care then figure out how to fund it. In her quest to become New York\u2019s next governor, Cynthia Nixon has advocated for a single-payer health care system in the state \u2013 something studies have shown would be a costly endeavor. The proposed New York Health Act (NYHA), which would establish universal health care for everyone in the state, including undocumented immigrants, would require the state\u2019s tax revenue to increase by about 156 percent by 2022, according to a study by the RAND Corp. But it also found state spending on total health care under NYHA would be slightly lower \u2013 about 3 percent \u2013 by 2031 than under the current system. Nixon recently told the New York Daily News editorial board\u00a0she did not yet have a plan to pay for single-payer. \u201cPass it and then figure out how to fund it,\u201d Nixon said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who Nixon is challenging in the Democratic primary next week, has said it should be up to the federal government to pass a universal health care system. During a debate between the two candidates last month, Cuomo said the NYHA was good \u201cin theory,\u201d but would cost more than New York\u2019s annual budget to implement it \u201cin the long-term,\u201d according to the Albany Times Union. 'SEX AND THE CITY' STAR CYNTHIA NIXON COULD BE NEW YORK'S NEXT GOVERNOR: A LOOK AT HER POLITICAL ACTIVISM Nixon, on the other hand, has said a single-payer system will save the state and New Yorkers money overall. There is widespread disagreement over how much it would cost to implement a single-payer health care system. Supporters say it would cut excessive administrative costs compared to those incurred by private insurers. But critics, including most Republicans, warn the savings would be less dramatic than expected \u2013 and the system would cost too much. Joe White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, has estimated that with single-payer\u00a0\"costs and taxes will rise, or patient access will be severely diminished \u2013 turning America\u2019s medical system into a third-world product.\u201d The Medicare-for-all bill proposed earlier this year by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was estimated to cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years by a Mercatus Center at George Mason University study. ANDREW CUOMO, CYNTHIA NIXON ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF LYING, CORRUPTION IN HEATED PRIMARY DEBATE The term \u201csingle-payer health care\u201d denotes only one entity bears the financial responsibility of health care \u2013 the government. Under this system, the government would be solely responsible for covering health care costs. \u201cThe basic idea of single-payer is to cover everybody with a single government program, and that program would basically cover all the doctors and hospitals,\u201d Dr. Adam Gaffney, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told Fox News. As the Times Union reported, the NYHA has continuously been introduced by Democrats in the state Assembly every year since 1992 but has been unsuccessful in the Senate.",

            "article_content": "On 'Fox & Friends,' the former ICE acting director calls on Democrats to stop playing politics and fix the immigration system 'once and for all' after an illegal immigrant is accused of killing the Iowa college student. The Mexican national accused of murdering college student Mollie Tibbetts in Iowa last month lived in the United States illegally for several years -- and worked for a farm that used\u00a0Social Security Administration data in part to vet potential employees, according to officials there. However,\u00a0Yarrabee Farms co-owner and manager\u00a0Dane Lang clarified Wednesday afternoon that the farm did not use a\u00a0federal E-Verify check on suspect Cristhian Rivera, despite the company's claim earlier in the day that it did. Lang said Rivera provided a state-issued photo identification and social security card. \u201cWe learned that our employee was not who he said he is.\u201d Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder Tuesday after the body of Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student, was discovered in a cornfield about 12 miles southeast of Brooklyn, where she was last seen running. Police said Rivera was in the country illegally and an immigration detainer was placed on him after his arrest. Yarrabee Farms told reporters Rivera worked at the farm for four years. MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER SUSPECT WORKED LESS THAN 3 MILES FROM WHERE SHE WAS STAYING Lang said earlier that all documents regarding Rivera\u2019s employment have been turned over to authorities. Yarrabee Farms is owned by the family of Craig Lang, the former president of the Iowa Farm Bureau and a former GOP primary candidate to be Iowa's Secretary of Agriculture. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services told Fox News:\u00a0\"A search of records by USCIS revealed Rivera did not make any DACA requests nor were any grants given. We have found no record in our systems indicating he has any lawful immigration status.\" DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was instituted during the Obama administration and allows some immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country. Investigators have said he arrived to the U.S. illegally from Mexico at some point between 4 and 7 years ago. A search of Iowa court records revealed no prior criminal history for Rivera, and it's unclear whether he'd ever been subject to prior deportation proceedings. MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS CRISTHIAN RIVERA, 24, LIVING IN US ILLEGALLY Identity fraud is the most common way illegal immigrants and \"unscrupulous employers\" try to thwart the system, said Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. While the details regarding how Rivera may have gamed the system remain unclear, Vaughan said many of the cases prosecuted in the past have seen an illegal immigrant simply purchase fraudulent identities. \u201cThere have been cases of inmates selling their identities because they are incarcerated and don\u2019t need them,\u201d she said. In one Massachusetts case, a hiring manager actually had an agreement with an identity vendor across the street who would help any illegal immigrant receive an identity that would pass muster, Vaughan said. \u201cThey would send them across the street and tell them to come back later,\u201d she said. MOLLIE TIBBETTS MURDER SPARKS LAWMAKERS' DEMANDS FOR 'JUSTICE,' COMPARISON TO KATE STEINLE CASE Rivera\u2019s arrival to the U.S. as a teenager has also raised questions about if he may have been a so-called \u201cDreamer,\u201d who may have qualified for the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Vaughan, however, said it is unlikely because to qualify for DACA, an illegal immigrant child must have lived in the U.S. for at least five years before 2012. If Rivera arrived in 2011 \u2013 the earliest officials believed he could have crossed the border from Mexico \u2013 he would not have fit the criteria. USCIS officials have not confirmed any possible DACA status for Rivera. \u201cThere are a lot of layers to peel off,\u201d Vaughan said.

            "article_content": "Fox & Trends with Carley Shimkus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo pardoned several illegal immigrants Monday in order to help them avoid deportation. The New York Democrat, who is up for re-election this year, pardoned seven people who had minor criminal convictions, ranging from petty larceny to drug possession, his office said. And with the pardons, Cuomo didn\u2019t miss the opportunity to take a dig at the Trump administration and its \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policies that left thousands of minors separated from their families after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cAt a time when President Trump and the Federal government are waging a war on our immigrant communities, New York stands firm in our belief that our diversity is our greatest strength,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cWhile President Trump engages in policies that rip children out of the arms of their mothers and tries to ramp up the deportation of New Yorkers to advance his political agenda of hate and division, we will protect our immigrant communities,\u201d Cuomo continued. \u201cWith the Statue of Liberty in our harbor, New York will always stand against the hate coming out of Washington and instead serve as a beacon of hope and opportunity for all.\u201d CUOMO CLAIMS HE\u2019S \u2018UNDOCUMENTED,\u2019 CHALLENGES OFFICIALS TO DEPORT HIM Cuomo pardoned seven illegal immigrants who had minor criminal convictions. (AP) The separation of minors from their parents was swiftly and harshly criticized by many on both sides of the aisle. After the national outrage, Trump signed an executive order in June allowing families to remain together in detention. The administration is still working on reuniting those who have been separated; nearly 1,200 were reunited by this week. According to the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency, a 2017 executive order from Trump expanded the agency\u2019s focus to include removing immigrants who have been convicted or charged with a criminal offense, among other things. Frank Barker, 43, was among those pardoned Monday, according to the governor\u2019s office. He was convicted for criminal possession of\u00a0stolen property and controlled substances and identity theft which stemmed from a drug addiction. Also pardoned are: Jose Rafael Cruz, 53, who was convicted of a sale of a controlled substance; Ludames De La Cruz, 53, who was convicted for an attempted sale of a controlled substance; Elpidio Rodriguez, 57, who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated; Tamar Samuda, 35, who was convicted nearly two decades ago for low-level assault and petit larceny; Marino Soto, 43, who was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance; and Carlos Suarez, 41, who was convicted for petit larceny. CUOMO SIGNS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS EXECUTIVE ORDER AHEAD OF TRUMP\u2019S SCOTUS NOMINATION Cuomo faces a primary challenger in Cynthia Nixon, an actress and progressive activist who has been credited with pushing the governor to the left in the race. During the campaign, Nixon has called for the abolishment of ICE. Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Nixon, told Newsday that while Cuomo\u2019s pardoning was good, Nixon would do more to \u201cend the deportation pipeline\u201d by allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s licenses. Republican gubernatorial candidate Marc Molinaro\u2019s campaign accused Cuomo of political grandstanding with the pardons. \u201cEverything Andrew Cuomo does is for his own political benefit, regardless of whether it\u2019s right, wrong or dangerous to the public,\u201d spokeswoman Katherine Delgado told Newsday. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s all about trying to out-liberal Cynthia Nixon for the September primary.\u201d Cuomo has pardoned 34 people since taking office, according to a news release.

            "article_content": "Andrew McCarthy, former federal prosecutor, and David Schoen, criminal defense attorney, on developments in the Manafort and Cohen cases. This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" August 21, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Tucker, thank you. And what an incredible news night. Major breaking news: Robert Mueller's partisan witch hunt and guess what? It has nothing to do with Russian collusion. Nothing. Paul Manafort earlier today found guilty of the eight of 18 charges all related to bank and tax fraud. No Russia collusion. Michael Cohen pled guilty. Eight counts of bank fraud, tax fraud, minor campaign finance violations, far worse has been committed by others. No Russia collusion. And once again, the sentencing of Michael Flynn delayed. Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI investigators that didn't think he was lying. And no Russia collusion. George Papadopoulos now considering a withdrawal of the guilty plea. He lied to investigators. Nothing to do with Russia collusion. Coming up, we explain why each of the men were targeted by team Mueller, none of it about the Russia collusion. Just their connection to the president? Is it dangerous to be friends with Donald Trump? We're going to call out what is the blatant, single, most disgusting two- tiered justice system that we've ever seen in our country's history. We'll show you how the president is reacting to breaking developments as he just wrapped up a massive rally in West Virginia. And finally, tonight, we have such sad disturbing news. The body of missing Iowa jogger Mollie Tibbetts was found. An illegal immigrant now charged with her murder. All right. It's time for tonight's breaking news. You won't hear anywhere else opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. Buckle up. Stay with us for the entire hour. We will give you information, I promise, and perspective that you will not get anywhere else, as the media is once again besides themselves with false reporting, speculation and hysteria. Yes, Paul Manafort was found guilty after a Northern Virginia jury found him guilty of eight out of 18 counts. Jurors forced a mistrial on the other ten charges after becoming deadlocked. Now, more evidence Mueller stacking charges he couldn't prove to scare Manafort as Judge Ellis said in the beginning into singing or composing. And he was never really ready for an actual trial. By the way, Manafort worked for Trump a little over 100 days. And as we have said so many times, these are decades' old bank charges, tax fraud charges, zero to do with Russia collusion, zero to do with Donald Trump or the Trump campaign. Now, meanwhile, more breaking news today, this time in New York. Michael Cohen, he pled guilty to eight federal charges including bank, tax fraud, two minor campaign finance violations. Far worse crimes committed by others. They didn't get charged. Earlier today, Bret Baier raised this very, very important question. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, HOST, \"SPECIAL REPORT\": The campaign finance violation because of the way he phrased it that he was directed by the candidate to do that and submitted that money to be repaid by the Trump Organization, that is a direct liability. But I can already see battle lines being drawn here legally, because I just got an e-mail saying the fact he pleads guilty to campaign violations does not mean that the payments were criminal violations. This did not go to trial. And you have people like former FEC chairman Bradley Smith saying the payment is not a violation, which is what Rudy Giuliani was saying in his interview earlier. So, that, you can already begin to see the Trump lawyers potentially and others making the case that this would not be a violation. Obviously, the prosecutor saying that it is. And Michael Cohen is on the hook for it now. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And meanwhile, many of the other charges against Michael Cohen surround, let's see, we go from Russia, to the family, taxi medallion company. Once again, these charges have nothing to do with the Russia collusion. From Russia collusion to taxi cabs. Hello? Now, President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani released a statement. It reads, quote, there is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government's charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen's action reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time. Now, while Michael Cohen did say today, I would argue knowing him all the years, I have known him probably forced by prosecutors. He has changed his story about whether or not Trump knew about the payment to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Back in March, he claimed, quote, Trump did not know that he played Clifford the $130,000. A month earlier, The New York Times, Mr. Paper of Record, that said the same thing, he paid the money out of his pocket, quote, without Trump's knowledge. And today, we learned one more piece of breaking news about another Mueller target, and that's former national security adviser, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. His sentencing has been delayed for a fourth time. 2017, he pled guilty to lying to the FBI even though James Comey later testified that, in fact, investigators did not believe that Flynn had intentionally lied. Again, this guilty plea, nothing to do with Russia. Russia, to tax returns, to fraud, to bank applications, to taxi medallions, to lying to the FBI -- nothing about Russia. Neither did the guilty plea from the Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos whose wife was on last night. He pled guilty to lying to investigators. His wife, Mrs. Papadopoulos, now weighing in on his legal options and he may withdraw that plea. Without a doubt, let's be straightforward here. It is wrong. There are lessons to learn from today. Don't ever knowingly lie to the FBI, do not lie on a bank loan application ever, or commit bank fraud. Pay your taxes. But did we need Robert Mueller for all of this? Think about this. How do you go from an investigation into Russia collusion in the 2016 election and this is what we have? Taxes from years and years ago? Bank fraud? Medallions? Lying to the FBI? Where is the Russia stuff? Would any of these people that we are talking about tonight have been investigated or charged if not for their connection to Donald Trump? Is it also a lesson, OK, don't lie to the FBI pay your taxes. Don't lie on a bank application. Don't be friends with Donald Trump? Is this not now the witch hunt the president has been saying, an attempt to turn the screws as Judge Ellis said about Manafort to would-be witnesses to find dirt on one man? In other words, so that they will sing or compose to either prosecute or impeach the president of the United States. And if so, how is that not political, selective, persecution and not prosecution? Now, I don't care if you are liberal or conservative, we better look at where the country is today. We did learn valuable lessons. Pay your taxes, don't lie on a loan application, don't lie to the FBI but this is it? Robert Mueller, are you proud of this? Did we need you for 500 days for this? How did we go from Russia collusion to this? Now, today, the president reacted to Mueller's ongoing witch hunt. Let's take a look at his reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I feel badly for both. I must tell you that Paul Manafort is a good man. He was with Ronald Reagan. He was with a lot of people over the years. And I feel very sad about that. It doesn't involve me but I still feel, you know, it's a very sad thing that happened. It has nothing to do with Russian collusion. This started as Russian collusion. This has absolutely nothing to do. This is a witch hunt and it's a disgrace. This has nothing to do what they started out, looking for Russians involved in our campaign. There were none. It's the way it ends up. And it was not the original mission. Believe me. It was -- it was something very much different. So, it had nothing to do with the Russian collusion. We continue the witch hunt. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Hang on. I'm looking for Russians. Oh. Now, tonight, this is not funny, because these are real people's lives, real families. This is way beyond what this mandate was. And every American that cares about our Constitution or republic, the rule of law, equal applications of our laws, you better be concerned tonight. Now, in West Virginia, the president raised an important question. Where is the collusion? He raised it again. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Fake news and the Russian witch hunt. We got a whole big combination. Where is the collusion? You know, they are still looking for collusion. Where is the collusion? Find some collusion. We want to find the collusion. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I hate to say. Equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws is dead. And I will explain in a minute. Cohen and Manafort are literally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for bank and for tax frauds, et cetera. Let's take a look at some prominent liberals tonight, shall we? That committed similar crimes. They didn't face the same consequences. Remember tax cheat Tim Geithner? Oh, it's a name you haven't heard in a while. Underpaid taxes tens of thousands of dollars over the course of multiple years before becoming Obama's first treasury secretary. Oops. No indictment for him. Remember Al Sharpton? Remember now, he used to be guest on the show, works at conspiracy TV MSNBC, reportedly once owed millions of dollars in back taxes to the IRS. He's also fined $285,000 by the FEC over an illicit political donation. Of course, Sharpton, he is enjoying his freedom because his job talking about Michael Cohen and everybody else over at NBC. Hey, let's not forget about, remember, former New York Congressman Charlie Rangel. Remember the picture of him laying on the beach chair? He failed to pay taxes on tens of thousands of dollars in real estate income. Rangel censured in the House of Representatives. He's now enjoying his retirement. And there's former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle. Remember, Rush used to talk about the Tom Daschle show? He failed to pay 128 grand in taxes. And, look at this. Oh, even the Obama campaign in 2008, they were hit with a mere fine which at the time was a lot, 375 grand for the campaign reporting violations over $2 million worth. Cohen is now getting prison time. Somehow team Mueller missed all of those crimes. Wait. Because there is no connections to President Trump. In today's two-tier justice system, as a Democrat, clearly you can commit financial fraud and get away with it. By the way, that's just the tip of the iceberg. If you are a Democrat and you have subpoenaed information, well, first, you can mishandle and destroy classified information which violates the Espionage Act. Clearly, you can have the top intelligence, and then you can delete subpoenaed e-mails. Not one, not ten, 33,000 of them. And acid wash your hard drive with the Bleach Bit, and eliminate the evidence and then have an aide smash up your devices with hammers and get away with it. And you can have exoneration written months before you are investigated. And, by the way, the guy that is doing the interview of you hates your opponent, loves you. If your name is Donald Trump, or you are associated with Donald Trump your entire life, it's going to be scoured for potential crimes. Your doors will be kicked down late at night, early in the morning raids, the screws are going to be turned as Judge Ellis said and they will ask you to sing or compose or you will go to jail for crimes other people have committed and don't go to jail for. Ask Paul Manafort tonight. Ask Michael Cohen tonight. Ask General Flynn, boy, he served his country for 30 years. Not even the guy that interviewed him at the FBI thought he lied. Not even Comey thought he lied. Not even Peter Strzok thought he lied. Ask George Papadopoulos. I bet he regrets volunteering for the Trump campaign. Just ask the White House counsel Don McGahn. Oh, the White House counsel interrogated for 30 full hours. Trump thinks, you know, the lawyers thought, we will cooperate and we'll turn over 1.4 million documents. We'll cooperate with Mueller. It will go away, because we didn't do anything wrong. And the most exculpatory evidence is in Comey's notes. I didn't collude. I didn't conspire, but if anyone on the team did, you got -- you got to hold them accountable. Those were in Comey's notes. Now, Mueller's witch hunt is not and has never been about Russia collusion. How did we get to taxi cabs? And tax fraud. And bank fraud. And lies to the FBI? This is what we have been telling you for a long time. We have the evidence. It is an attempt at a political takedown of the man that the deep state never wanted to be the president of the United States. I will tell you tonight that the sovereignty of your vote is now in question. Before we get to our guests we have another important topic to cover. Now, for weeks, foxnews.com has been following the heart-wrenching story out of Iowa. On July 18th, a 20-year-old college student, a young girl, all of future potential, life ahead of her, Mollie Tibbetts, went missing. Today, sadly, her body was recovered. Ad now, the police have arrested an illegal immigrant they believe is responsible for her murder. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A first-degree murder charge was filed today in connection with the disappearance of Mollie Tibbetts who is last scene jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa, on July 18th, 2018. A complaint and affidavit names Cristhian Bahena Rivera age 24 who resides in rural Poweshiek County and he has been charged with murder in the first degree. We have confirmed with homeland security investigations that he is an illegal alien and we believe he has been in this area now for four to seven years. (END VIDE OCLIP) HANNITY: What happened to this young woman Mollie Tibbetts is a senseless, evil, horrific crime. Now, we believe and charges against an illegal immigrant. Tonight, we extend our deepest condolences, our prayers to the family and the friends. We will get to that in the course of the show. Now, we also have the great one, Mark Levin, is going to joining us. We got a lot of reaction to get to. We've only begun to touch the service. But joining us first for reaction to developments, we have former federal prosecutor himself, he worked at the Southern District of New York for 20 years, of big cases like the blind sheikh case and the first Trade Center bombing, Andrew McCarthy. Civil and criminal defense attorney, David Schoen. Andy, let's start here with what I think is so obvious. How did we get from Russia collusion to five years of taxes in the case of Paul Manafort? Tax and bank charges against him? And, by the way, I'm advising everyone, pay your taxes and don't lie on loan applications, don't lie to the FBI three lessons to take out tonight. How did we get from Russia collusion to this? ANDREW MCCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Sean, I agree with what you said about the two-tiered justice system. Because I don't think you can justify how the same or similar cases have been handled on these two different categories of people. I'm not as convinced that what we started with was Russian collusion. I really think what we started with is Russia interference in the election and that is still -- HANNITY: Well, that is what they called it, right? MCCARTHY: Supposed to be at least -- well, no. They said the collusion was one thread of an investigation into Russia's involvement in the election. I'm pretty convinced that Mueller is not pursuing a collusion case now -- HANNITY: It's obstruction case. MCCARTHY: -- against president Trump. I think it is an obstruction case. As far as Manafort goes, I don't think that Manafort -- I don't think Mueller thinks Manafort has anything with respect to Trump campaign collusion with Russia that Mueller couldn't already get from Gates who is Manafort's partner who has been cooperating for six months. I think his interest in Manafort has to do with exactly Manafort's connections to Russia. Not necessarily the Trump campaign. Until I see something different, that is what I have concluded. HANNITY: You know the Southern District of New York. It has the reputation of probably being in terms of the federal prosecution the toughest one in the country. And you worked there 20 years. Over two decades of your life. Rudy Giuliani worked there, interestingly. Very smart, aggressive, tough attorneys that work there. MCCARTHY: He hired me. HANNITY: Rudy hired you? I didn't know. We got some (INAUDIBLE) But the heart of what they are saying is -- MCCARTHY: Yes. HANNITY: -- so I have all the examples where Michael Cohen said the president didn't know he did it on his own. And that he didn't do it with any expecting payback. Michael Cohen says today said at the direction of the president. There are numerous times that he said it. Why do I think this is the special sauce that the prosecution wanted? Because remember, this was fed to them and served up to them by Robert Mueller. And again, we got taxi medallions and tax fraud. And another big question, as side note, if you can answer both, would any of the people, Flynn, Papadopoulos, Manafort, or Cohen be in trouble in any way if it weren't for the issue of Russia which didn't come up in any case? MCCARTHY: Yes, I think -- Sean, I think the last question is the easiest one to answer. These guys got on the government's crosshairs because of their connections to first candidate and now President Trump. I don't think there is any question about that. But I do think that the Cohen case ended up in the Southern District because Mueller didn't see him, Cohen, as somebody who was going to advance the Russia investigation, and the Southern District had different line of interest in Cohen. HANNITY: But let's focus on the main what he said into the direction of the president, and he previously had not. Why do I think it had to be a big part of what they wanted from Cohen to get the deal he got? Because he otherwise facing 65 years. MCCARTHY: But, Sean, it's a straight up guilty plea. It's not a cooperation agreement. I don't think they regard him as a witness. I think for precisely the reason you pointed out, you know, he has made statements all over the map. They did elicit that from him today when he gave his allocution at his guilty plea. But I think if they regarded him as valuable witness or cooperator, you'd see a very different kind of plea agreement. HANNITY: Yes, well, I do agree with that, too. David, you have seen a lot of the cases over the years and we talked about at length. Look, we have -- there are Russians issues here. Hillary paid for a phony Russian dossier with funneled money through a law firm to an op research group that hired a foreign national, which I thought was bad for our elections. And he came up with the Russian lies disseminated to the American people to impact -- that were never verified, never corroborated to impact our election. And then such information was also used as the bulk of information to get FISA warrants on the Trump campaign associate. Russian lies were used and I believe fraud was committed before four FISA court judges. None of these people, nor is Hillary Clinton, who I think has the most open and shut case on obstruction, none of them are indicted today. Why? What should the American people take from that? DAVID SCHOEN, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: The answer why is purely a political one. I think the American people are entitled to hold the United States attorney to his word when he said the message from the Cohen case, is that the rule of law should be applied equally and evenly across the board. We haven't seen that yet. Mr. McCarthy is exactly right that the mandate started out a question of Russian interference. I think the case today, Manafort perfectly illustrates how wrong they went in the breadth of the mandate given that Judge Ellis examined and found this case fell within that breadth. But so far beyond that, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the president certainly, but the charges today, nothing whatsoever to do with Russia. And, of course, your original question, how did it get in the Southern District? We know, for example, a member of the Mueller team comes out of the unit that prosecuted Mr. Cohen, Andrew Goldstein, comes from that unit. Let's hold the Southern District to their word and let's get past these cases that have nothing to do with the president and get on with the business that you've reported day after day. The misconduct before the FISA court is outrageous. The American people cannot withstand that kind of treachery before that kind of secret court in an ex parte proceeding. We have to have the answers and full disclosure. HANNITY: You know, doesn't it happen every day, Andy McCarthy, that people that commit fraud on their taxes and people that commit campaign finance violations, Obama $2 million worth. Cohen is about 300 grand. They only paid $375,000 fine. I have used the Hillary case. I used the fraud before the FISA judges. I wouldn't -- Andy, I wouldn't lie to any judge ever. It's dumb. I wouldn't also if I had a subpoena by Congress for my e-mails I wouldn't delete them. I wouldn't acid wash my heart drives and beat up or have somebody beat up my phones. And I think America has to look tonight and ask itself, is this a witch hunt? As the president is saying based on what we know are real crimes. And some of them actually have to do with Russia. MCCARTHY: Sean, I don't think anybody objective could look at the way the Clinton e-mail investigation was handled and the way the Trump campaign has been pursued and say that there is a single standard of justice. I don't see how that could be. At the same time, I don't want to see Mueller pursuing the investigators or what happened in the Hillary case. As I understand it, that's being looked at by the Justice Department, by the inspector general, and by Mr. Huber, the U.S. attorney from Utah, that the attorney general assigned to this. I think we ought to let them do their work. I'd rather see them do it than see Mueller do it. I think Mueller should stay focused on what he is doing and bring it to an end. HANNITY: All right. Andy McCarthy, David Schoen, thank you both for being with us. Now, earlier tonight at his West Virginia rally, President Trump asked where is the Russia collusion. Here is what he said. Apparently, we don't have that. We had it earlier. Anyway, joining us now with latest on today's news is FOX News chief national correspondent Ed Henry -- Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sean, good to see you. You're right. And before the rally, the president called the Robert Mueller investigation again a witch hunt. What's interesting is the Michael Cohen case could be more damaging for the president because in that case, he is directly implicated by Cohen, a far cry from the Manafort case with major developments today. That has nothing to do with the president, nothing to do with 2016, nothing to do with Russia collusion. The former Trump campaign chair found guilty on five counts of filing false income tax returns, one count of failing to file report of a foreign bank account, two charges of bank fraud. The jury could not reach a verdict on 10 other counts against Manafort. Prosecutors have until the end of the month to decide on a possible retrial. There is also the possibility that Manafort would be pardoned by the president who declared again as I noted that the Mueller probe is a witch hunt. He said he was deeply frustrated about that. The president though said nothing in his comments about the Cohen case, leaving it to his attorney Rudy Giuliani to provide this written statement tonight, quote: There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen's actions reflect pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time. But remember, Cohen's plea deal alleges he broke the law to influence the 2016 election on behalf of a candidate. That candidate, of course, being Trump. Cohen will get prison time 43 to 63 months in charges of bank fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance charges involving payments to two women who alleged affairs with the president that he has strongly denied, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Now, remember, Rudy Giuliani told you in that exclusive interview back in May that no campaign finance law was broken. This plea deal contradicts that and it's going to raise questions about whether anyone else in the Trump could be implicated, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Ed Henry with that report, thank you. Joining us now with reaction, author of the \"New York Times\" bestseller three weeks in a row, \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", the heart of what I'm discussing tonight, and FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. FOX News contributor Sara Carter, who's also been covering and breaking a lot of news that apparently doesn't end up in an indictment of anybody, which is the point here. You know, look, I stand by what I say. Pay your taxes, or you are applying for a loan, don't lie. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Right. HANNITY: Don't lie to the FBI. JARRETT: That's right. HANNITY: All lessons everybody should learn. It has nothing to do with Russia, but America should be asking a question tonight if we have a two- tiered justice system. JARRETT: Oh, we totally do. I mean, there's one for Donald Trump -- HANNITY: So, we don't have a -- we don't have a -- we don't have a constitutional republic. JARRETT: No. Hillary Clinton violated the Federal Campaign Election Act in a criminal way. There is no investigation of her for that. And that here you see the feds pressuring Cohen to try to implicate President Trump. There are two reasons why his payment in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement is not an illegal campaign contribution. The law says that if there is a dual or a secondary purpose, it's not illegal. Here, President Trump had personal and commercial reasons. Second of all, the Federal Campaign Election Act is a specific intent crime if you are going to criminal criminalize it. And that means you have to prove, quote, knowingly and willfully committed a violation of the campaign law. Who is that steeped in campaign election laws to know that a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for money is a violation, so you can't even prove the case. HANNITY: Well, this is an amazing thing, too. And, look, I actually think that they wanted that line. At the behest of -- JARRETT: Oh, they did. They pressured him for the one line. HANNITY: It was 65 years -- JARRETT: They didn't care about anything else other than the one line. HANNITY: Agreed. And you know what? After all the other times that he said just the opposite -- JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: -- he was pressured to do it, and basically, if you are looking at 65 years or four or three, I'm going to take the deal. JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: Most people would take the deal. Sara, your investigating reporting has shown us that we do have Russian issues here. Bought and paid for dossier, funneled money through a law firm -- SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Exactly. HANNITY: -- to Fusion GPS, which is an op research to a foreign national, which I thought was bad, apparently not if you're Hillary Clinton. On top of her obstruction case, then that money is used as the basis to lie to four FISA court judges, four separate occasions, four applications. It's all false Russian information. And we are talking about taxes. CARTER: Incredible. HANNITY: And the only thing that's common is they are friends with Trump in some way. CARTER: Incredible violations, Sean. And, remember, they did not disclose that. Hillary Clinton campaign did not disclose on their FEC. They didn't disclose that they were paying a foreign spy basically through a U.S. research firm for a dossier filled with lies from the Russians. That was something that they kept very secret until the \"Washington Post\" actually broke that story. And we reported over and over again, document after document where there was actual collusion. Collusion between the DOJ and the FBI -- how many people at the FBI have been removed or demoted? Over 25 people, Sean. And still nothing. And I'm going to say this. Rod Rosenstein gave carte blanche over this special counsel for Robert Mueller. And Rod Rosenstein himself signed off on the fourth FISA application on Carter Page which means he should have known everything that was contained in those FISA applications, those previous FISA applications. This is really incredible. And he wrote the letter, remember, wrote the letter for President Trump to fire Comey. So, if this is an obstruction case, isn't he a witness or a co-conspirator? Why is Rod Rosenstein in charge of this? And where is Attorney General Jeff Sessions? When is he going to stand up and do something about this? We don't even know what's happened with Huber. We don't even know what he's doing. And as far as the inspector general's report, well, that could just come out next year there. There needs to be a special counsel according to a number of sources that I've spoken with. There needs to be a special counsel in order for this not to be a two-tier justice system. HANNITY: So well said. JARRETT: There is a reason Rod Rosenstein has been obstructing Congress and in my judgment, obstructing justice. Because he is knee-deep in all of this. He signed off on the renewal without the required evidence. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: The court before FISA. JARRETT: That's right. And it show Rod Rosenstein is engaged in what I suspect is a very deliberate cover-up. He's not only covering up the wrongdoing of the FBI and the Department of Justice -- and by the way, taking no action against Bruce Ohr for what he did but he is also covering up his own role. HANNITY: You have 25 people, top people between the FBI and the DOJ, that have either been fired demoted or resigned. JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: OK. The top people. This is not about the rank and file. And I'm just wondering and I think America should wonder tonight. Again, we go from the Russia collusion, and we end up with the tax issues going back years ago. In both cases. And bank applications that have nothing to do with the campaign-- JARRETT: That's right. HANNITY: -- nothing to do with Trump, nothing to do with Russia years ago. Now we have got into taxi medallion land which is nothing to do with anything. And I think Americans are saying wait a minute, in this campaign of 2016, Hillary did do these things. JARRETT: Sure. HANNITY: And forget about -- you can even add to the list that she cheated Bernie Sanders out of the nomination. Nobody seems to care but me for Bernie. Bernie doesn't even care. So then she does her bit with the e-mail subpoenaed. Then she does her bit to pay for the phony Russian dossier and then they disseminate it to influence the American people and then it's used for the bulk of the information for a FISA. It seems to me that the perspective is so far off here. That the president's analogy that it's a witch hunt is accurate. JARRETT: Absolutely. When James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt, he simultaneously launched the investigation of Trump in direct violation, as I explain in book, of the FBI guidelines. Then the special counsel was also illegitimate. This has always been an investigation in search of a crime. But the federal regulations say there must be a stated crime. There was none. HANNITY: Sara, we'll give you the last word. CARTER: Look, Sean, they are trying to force people to compose. They are targeting everyone around President Trump. This is pretty obvious what's happening here. The only thing I can hope for is that actually Hubert (Ph), he is doing his job, the attorney general will listen and the special counsel will be appointed. HANNITY: All right. Thank you both. I appreciate it. Your book got to the whole heart of it. Right there. And here we are today. Taxi medallion. Sad. JARRETT: It is. HANNITY: When we come back, he is called the great one for a reason. Mark Levin weighs in and much more. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Here with the reaction to all of today's breaking news. He is the host of the number one show on Sunday night at 10 Eastern, Life, Liberty, and Levin right on the Fox News channel, host of CRTV's Levin TV. We call him the great one for a reason. Mark Levin. All right, Mark, I mean, there are some lessons here. I agree that you shouldn't lie to the FBI. Everyone agrees with that. I also agree that you should pay your taxes. I also agree that you better not lie on a bank loan application. Mark, how did we get from Russia and that this is it after nearly, we are almost at 500 days. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: All right. I want to address Michael Cohen. How did we get to that? I want to help the law professors, the constitutional experts, the criminal defense lawyers, the former prosecutors and of course, the professors. I want to help them understand what the law is. The general counsel for the Clinton mob family, Lanny Davis, he had his client pleaded two counts of criminality that don't exist. These campaign finance violations that is all over TV, they are saying implicates the president of the United States directly. First, let's back up. It is a guilty plea. It is a plea bargain between a prosecutor and a criminal. A criminal who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison. That is not precedent. That applies only to that specific case. Nobody cites plea bargains for precedent. That's number one. Number two, just because a prosecutor says that somebody violated a campaign law doesn't make it so. He is not the judge. He is not the jury. We didn't adjudicate anything. It never went to court. That's number two. A campaign expenditure under our federal campaign laws is an expenditure solely for campaign activity. A candidate who spends his own money or even corporate money for an event that occurred not as a result of the campaign, it is not a campaign expenditure. Let me give a few examples to help people understand this, especially the American people. Let's say, I wrote these down. Let's say a candidate had said we owe vendors a whole lot of money. We've had disputes with them. But I want you to go ahead and pay them. I'm a candidate, I don't want all this negative publicity. So he says to his private lawyer, you pay them, I'll reimburse you, get it done. Is that illegal? It's perfectly legal. Yet according to the prosecution of the Southern District of New York it's paid at the direction of the candidate to influence the election. Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, how stupid is your point? It's not a crime. More, let's say that this candidate settles a lawsuit that was initiated before he becomes a candidate. And he says to his personal lawyer, I want you to pay, settle that lawsuit. You can use my corporate funds, my private funds, whatever it is. That is perfectly legal, too. The prosecutor would say but that influenced the election. So what? There are certain things you do that influence an election that are legal and certain things you do to influence an election that are illegal. Let's say a candidate gets a non-disclosure agreement from a disgruntled employee and he wants to quiet that disgruntled employee as he goes into the election. He pays the funds out of his pocket or through his corporation. Perfectly legal. Nothing here was spent out of the campaign, nothing was done with the campaign or to the campaign. This is exactly what the federal law is. And Mr. Lanny davis had his client plead guilty to two offenses that aren't offenses that the prosecutor insisted were offenses. That's why he is no good. That is Michael Cohen against Donald Trump. Donald Trump is in the clear. Let's say Donald Trump even directed Michael Cohen to make payments in non-disclosure agreements. So what? He is allowed to do that. Now, here's my question. Has the Southern District of New York ever paid money in a non-disclosure agreement with any of its employees? How about any U.S. attorney's office in the United States? How about the Department of Justice? How about any business? HANNITY: Or Congress. LEVIN: How about any union? How about the DNC? How about member of Congress? It's done all the time. It is all hush money. And all of this hush money, they can't pay hush money. Well, it is hush money. It's legal. It's a contract. It's done all the time. Now, what does Mr. Mueller have left? It's worked. He is chasing the Manhattan madam. Who the hell is the Manhattan madam? I don't know. And how is he interviewing? He is dragging her in front of the grand jury. What's next? The Manhattan madame. He's got -- he's got Manafort where he wants him on banking charges, he set up a few guys like Flynn who has gotten in trouble. Now they have Cohen. What do they have? They have nothing. I'll tell you what they have. Mr. Mueller as a federal prosecutor is preparing his impeachment report which is an unconstitutional activity. Mr. Mueller is supposed to be nonpolitical. He is not supposed to preparing impeachment report. Mr. Mueller, I told you before, you can't indict a sitting president. I told you that 15 months ago. Now you figured it out. You and Rosenstein figured it out. Now you and Rosenstein are trying to figure out what to do with the subpoena. You see, Sean, Giuliani was on your show the other day or somebody's show and said why do they take two or three weeks? I'll tell you why they take two or three weeks. Because Mr. Mueller has to consult Mr. Rosenstein, his boss, to figure out what to do with the subpoena. I'll tell you what happens when they issue that subpoena. The president of the United States takes it all the way to the Supreme Court. And what does he cite? Department of Justice memos. What else does he cite? The Constitution of the United States. So this is going to be an impeachment battle in the end. The president of the United States if he doesn't get involved in the perjury trap -- think about that. They don't have a crime. He needs this interview to create a crime against the president of the United States. This prosecutor. Well, that's pretty damn outrageous. So in any event I want the news media to understand. You know what took place in the Southern District of New York? Nothing that matters. Zippo. HANNITY: You know what, Mark? LEVIN: There was no violation of the federal campaign laws. Lanny Davis blew it. Lanny Davis -- Lanny Davis he puts out a tweet today. \"Today, Cohen stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime.\" You are a dummy, Lanny. \"By making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?\" They weren't a crime for Michael Cohen. He screwed himself. And they're not a crime for Donald Trump either. Now move along and go back into your corner with Hillary Clinton. HANNITY: Well, obviously, he is a huge Clinton sycophant. So there's 2016 campaign, we're what, 77 days out is now becoming as I have said for a long time. It's about impeachment, keeping Obamacare, then wanting their crumbs back, eliminating ICE, open borders and stopping the investigation into what I say is the biggest abuse of power. Here is what I want to ask you. So we now have Hillary Rodham Clinton obstructing, violating the Espionage Act and no indictment. We now have her paying for what turns out to be a foreign entity, a foreign agent, putting together Russian lies that are disseminated to the American people to influence an election. Lies. Never verified or corroborated. Then put as the bulk of information and for FISA warrants, Comey, Sally Yates, Rod Rosenstein, they all signed off and they all said, they swore, they put their good name and credibility behind it. I don't see Comey indicted. LEVIN: Right. HANNITY: I don't see any -- I don't see any Hillary Clinton indictments. I don't see any crimes that are being pursued here. Barack Obama had what, $2 million in campaign finance violations he just paid upon. LEVIN: Can I interrupt for a second? HANNITY: Yes, go ahead. Interrupt on my own show. LEVIN: The head of the FBI is not the head of the FBI anymore. He is a confessed leaker and he is under investigation by the inspector director. The deputy FBI director was fired and is under criminal investigation. Mr. Strzok was the head counterintelligence investigator was fired and he is under investigation, I believe, or will be, or should be under investigation as well. That's the top tier of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have never heard of anything like this before. You have a mole in the deputy attorney general's office who's working with Strzok has been fired. His wife works for the Fusion GPS. And pushing out the opposition research against the president of the United States. Getting in front of the FISA court through the FBI, Bruce Ohr. Bruce Ohr who served for the deputy attorney general of the United States and there is tons more. You have FISA court judges that have never been held to account. HANNITY: Fraud. LEVIN: You had an application that was filed with the FISA court. They didn't say who paid for the opposition research that was used to violate their rules. HANNITY: I got to run, Mark. LEVIN: yes. We need a special counsel now. For that. HANNITY: You know, some great, smart, constitutional lawyer once wrote a book and in book he said, this is a post-constitutional America. That was you. We're there. Mark, thank you. LEVIN: Thanks, Sean. HANNITY: Life, Liberty and Levin Sunday night at 10 Eastern right here on Fox. When we come back, we'll have a live report from Iowa, the very latest of this horrific murder of this young innocent Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts, murdered by an illegal immigrant. Full reaction. Geraldo and Dr. Gorka, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico. And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman. It should have never happened. Illegally in our country. We have had a huge impact but the laws are so bad. The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We are getting them changed but we have to get more Republicans. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That was the president earlier tonight in his West Virginia rally lamenting what was the ultimate death -- the untimely death of Mollie Tibbetts. We feel so sorry for her family. Tonight our thoughts and prayers as we said earlier go out to them. This is a tragedy that can be prevented. More on reaction of this horrific story author of the book \"Why We Fight,\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Author of the \"Geraldo Show,\" Fox News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, this to me, I see Kate Steinle, a beautiful young girl, her entire life stalked by this guy apparently. According to Fox News reports earlier tonight. And brutally murdered. Again, an illegal immigrant in this country. We have to fix the problem. This should be the end of it for everybody. Build the wall, keep a door. We'll call it the Geraldo door. Seriously, because you and I have disagreed on some aspects of immigration. Stop drugs, stop human trafficking, control who comes in the country. We love you. Come from anywhere, we just need to vet you so you are part of our family. We don't care where you come from. Just we need to know that you are safe and secure for the people that are here. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT AT LARGE: You know, Sean, I totally understand the anger that so many people are expressing and feeling over this horrible case and my heart breaks for the Tibbetts family. It really does. This is absolutely horrific. I feel so sorry for them. As the father of five, it is so, so saddening to me. It's saddening for what this family has suffered and it is sad because it will fuel the malignant false notion that this terrible savage crime is characteristic of this population. The 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country are not all MS-13. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Geraldo, no, it's not. No. That's absolutely true. You are right. But we've got to be able to try and vet those that are here because they love our country-- (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: Of course. Sean, there is no argument. I have no -- there is no distance between us on that point. But I fear is that this case will now become the rallying cry to deprive the DREAMers of their protected status. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: The president offered appeal, Geraldo. RIVERA: To harshly crackdown on the mom and pops who have been here for years and care for our babies and mow our lawns and wash our dishes. HANNITY: How about we just make sure that -- how about we just check everybody out? Dr. Gorka, let's make sure-- (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: I would love. I would love that. HANNITY: I know you believe that. You agree further. I know you. RIVERA: I would hire every Wal-Mart in the country in a parking lot and tell come on, we'll give you a yellow pass and we'll figure out who you are and what your status is. I just -- I just want everyone to know. My dad -- I want to quickly say. My dad Cruz Rivera -- and this guy's name is Rivera? Please, you wonder how I feel about this. My dad when he was alive, Cruz Rivera, we moved from Brooklyn to Long Island from the Democratic heart of Brooklyn to the Republican Long Island. All we wanted to do was fit in. Every time there was a violent crime my dad would pray that it wasn't a Latino because the community was already beleaguered enough. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Geraldo, those people that are going to love people together-- (CROSSTALK) RIVERA: And now this happens. May heart is broken. HANNITY: They're not conservatives. Anybody but. Dr. Gorka. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Sean. HANNITY: We do have things we can do. And we're not doing them. GORKA: Sean, Kate Steinle should never have died. Now Mollie's life has been ripped away from her by an illegal alien. Americans should never forget these women, never forget these young girls and we should never rest until the wall is built. And every single criminal like this is removed from this country or put in prison. Nobody, nobody has the right to come to America and to be an American. The sanctuary cities, the outrageous catch and release policies of the Obama administration are because of one reason and one reason alone. And it's not humanitarianism. It's because the Democrat Party-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I've got to run. GORKA: -- wants illegal votes. That's the only reason. HANNITY: We pray for their families. And I know you mean it, Geraldo. More \"Hannity,\" next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Last word tonight, we better do a lot of soul-searching as a country, because if Russian collusion becomes taxi medallions and taxes and, bank fraud, and we ignore obstruction of justice, if we ignore real Russia collusion, we are going to lose the country. It's that important. The election this midterm the most important in our lifetime. Jason Chaffetz in for Laura tonight. Sir, take it away.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Breaking: IG report says Comey broke protocol - Lawmakers insist on immigration tweet from Trump - New Q poll shows tight race for Ohio gov. seat - New lawsuits filed for redistricting in three states - \u2018A series of tubes\u2019 BREAKING: IG REPORT SAYS COMEY BROKE PROTOCOLFox News:\u00a0\u201cJustice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday released his long-awaited report detailing his review of the FBI and DOJ\u2019s Hillary Clinton investigation during the 2016 presidential election, finding then-FBI Director James Comey to be \u2018insubordinate\u2019 with his public statements on the investigation. For more than a year, Horowitz has been reviewing the agencies\u2019 actions related to its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Horowitz\u2019s investigation looked at a variety of allegations, including whether it was improper for Comey to make a public announcement about not recommending prosecution over the Clinton email arrangement. \u2018We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions from his superiors, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, for the admitted purpose of preventing them from telling him not to make the statement, and to instruct his subordinates in the FBI to do the same,\u2019 Horowitz\u2019s report says. \u2026 \u2018In particular, we were concerned about text messages exchanged by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Special Counsel to the Deputy Director, that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u2019 the report says.\u201d \u2018Foreign actors\u2019 accessed Hillary Clinton emails -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u2019Foreign actors\u2019 obtained access to some of former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails -- including at least one email classified as \u2018secret\u2019 -- according to a new memo from two GOP-led House committees and an internal FBI email. Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week\u2019s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday. The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton\u2019s email security. \u2018Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails -- including at least one email classified \u2018Secret,\u2019\u2019 the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.\u201d New York sues Trump foundation over self-dealing -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cThe New York state attorney general\u2019s office on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the\u00a0Donald J. Trump Foundation for alleged illegal conduct and \u2018unlawful political coordination\u2019 to benefit personal and business interests, drawing a harsh Twitter rebuke from President Trump. \u2026 Acting Attorney General\u00a0Barbara Underwood\u00a0filed the lawsuit Thursday over the foundation\u2019s alleged \u2018persistent illegal conduct\u2019 which occurred over \u2018more than a decade.\u2019 The suit alleges that there was \u2018extensive unlawful political coordination\u2019 with Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, and alleged violations of \u2018basic legal obligations for non-profit foundations.\u2019 But the president fired back on Twitter Thursday, blasting the lawsuit, and Schneiderman for \u2018never\u2019 having \u2018the guts\u2019 to bring the suit while he held the post. \u2026 The suit claims that Trump used the foundation\u2019s charitable assets to pay off his legal obligations, promote Trump brand hotels and businesses, and to purchase personal items.\u201d McGahn recused his staff from working on Russia investigation -\u00a0Politico: \u201cWhite House Counsel\u00a0Don McGahn\u00a0recused his entire staff last summer from working on the Russia investigation because many of his office\u2019s lawyers played significant roles in key episodes at the center of the probe, former White House attorney\u00a0Ty Cobb\u00a0said on Wednesday. McGahn made the decision to halt his staff\u2019s interactions with Special Counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u00a0because many of his own attorneys \u2018had been significant participants\u2019 surrounding the firings of national security adviser\u00a0Michael Flynn\u00a0and FBI Director\u00a0James Comey, Cobb said. \u2018The White House made a decision to recuse his entire office,\u2019 Cobb said during a panel discussion hosted by George Mason University in Northern Virginia.\u201d The Judge\u2019s Ruling: Stay in your lane -\u00a0This week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0asks if Congress can interfere in the ongoing federal criminal investigation into the president: \u201cThe relationship between the congressional committees on one hand and federal law enforcement on the other has been a give-and-take, push-me-pull-you relationship that generally led to compromise between Congress and federal law enforcement. \u2026 The Republicans on [the House Intelligence Committee] are determined to use their regulatory powers over federal intelligence gathering to investigate federal law enforcement. They are doing this because they claim to smell a rat in the origins of the special counsel investigation\u2026 But it is not the role of Congress to do this in the midst of a criminal investigation\u2026\u201d More\u00a0here.

Kerr\u2019s love of the flag grew from stories of the Civil War told by his father,\u00a0Jackson Kerr, who fought with a Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment. \u2026 So began a quest to have this day designated in honor of the Stars and Stripes. The drive to make today Flag Day started in earnest when William Kerr, who was born in Pittsburgh in 1868, was picked at age 14 to make a patriotic speech at a convention in Chicago. His address about the flag began a 67-year campaign in which he met with nine presidents and wrote countless letters to senators, congressmen, governors and local officials in hopes of advancing his plan to designate June 14 as Flag Day. The date is significant -- on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted a flag of 13 red and white stripes and 13 stars in a field of blue as the nation\u2019s first flag.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.

Stephen Miller, the main architect of the Trump administration\u2019s approach on immigration, met with GOP lawmakers at the Capitol on Wednesday \u2026 Miller assured lawmakers that Trump supports a plan laid out by House leaders late Tuesday that will put two immigration bills on the floor next week: a GOP compromise bill being pulled together by leaders of different Republican factions and one favored by conservatives that is sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman\u00a0Bob Goodlatte\u00a0of Virginia. Lawmakers from the conservative Republican Study Committee told Miller, however, that immigration is such a hot-button issue in their districts that they need an explicit and public Trump tweet -- not just a closed door meeting with a staffer -- to give them political cover to vote for legislation that hardliners could label as \u2018amnesty\u2019 for undocumented immigrants, according to the person in the meeting.\u201d NEW Q POLL SHOWS TIGHT RACE FOR OHIO GOV. SEATQuinnipiac University:\u00a0\u201cThe Ohio governor\u2019s race is too close to call, with former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director\u00a0Richard Cordray, the Democrat, at 42 percent and State Attorney General\u00a0Mike DeWine, the Republican, at 40 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released today. There are wide gender and racial gaps as men back DeWine 47 - 36 percent, while women back Cordray 48 - 35 percent, the independent Quinnipiac University Poll finds. White voters go Republican by a narrow 44 - 39 percent. Non-white voters go Democratic 56 - 23 percent. DeWine takes Republicans 85 - 4 percent, as Cordray takes Democrats 81 - 8 percent. Independent voters are divided with 39 percent for Cordray and 37 percent for DeWine. DeWine gets a 39 - 31 percent favorability rating, with 27 percent who don\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion. Cordray gets a 32 - 15 percent favorability rating, while 51 percent don\u2019t know enough about him to form an opinion.\u201d McConnell insists Kentucky Gov. Bevin run for re-election -\u00a0Lexington Herald Ledger:\u00a0\u201cSenate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0is making it clear: He wants Kentucky Gov.\u00a0Matt Bevin, a potential re-election rival, to stay home. Bevin, a Republican, has yet to say whether he will seek a second term in 2019, prompting speculation he\u2019s interested in unseating McConnell in 2020 \u2014 or that he\u2019s hoping for a Trump administration gig. \u2026 \u2018I hope he runs for re-election and finishes the job by serving the full eight years that are allowed under the Kentucky Constitution,\u2019 said McConnell, patriarch of the Kentucky Republican Party.\u00a0\u2019I will say I think the governor\u2019s done a terrific job ... I\u2019m very much in his corner,\u2019 said McConnell, who said he would not speculate on a re-match with Bevin. McConnell trounced Bevin in a contentious 2014 Republican Senate primary. Bevin was backed by the tea party, a grassroots movement usually identified with conservative causes. The two men have since made amends, but their relationship has never been close.\u201d Md. gubernatorial candidate gets massive cash infusion -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cMaryland gubernatorial candidate\u00a0Ben Jealous\u00a0is getting a large infusion of cash from outside groups just as early voting begins in the June 26 Democratic primary, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors connected to a social advocacy group that helped\u00a0Stacey Abrams\u00a0win the Democratic nomination in Georgia. The spending by the Maryland Together We Rise PAC and a second coalition of progressive groups will total about $1 million over the next two weeks \u2014 considerably more than either Jealous or his top rival, Prince George\u2019s County Executive\u00a0Rushern L.

The legal challenges, which are supported by Holder\u2019s National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee \u2014 a political action committee chaired by Holder \u2014 claim the new majority-minority districts are needed because each state\u2019s current electoral maps violate the federal Voting Rights Act by depriving black voters of the ability to elect representatives of their choice. Georgia Secretary of State\u00a0Brian Kemp, Louisiana Secretary of State\u00a0R.

The dispute has pitted members of Congress and elected officials versus labor leaders and grass-roots activists, with the party base looking like it will win this fight handily.

They are two separate cities and, while the general public might be forgiven for assuming that Minneapolis is the real city and St. Paul is some kind of blink-and-you-miss-it town that\u2019s really just a part of Minneapolis, reporters who pride themselves on accuracy are not given that same leniency. St. Paul is a city of more than 300,000 people (Minneapolis only has 117,000 more) and has a number of businesses headquartered there, including 3M.

This issue at hand has to do with children, babies being taken from their mothers while they are being detained at the border. My own personal code of conduct follows the belief that every human being should be treated with a high level of respect, and that family is the most important part of what makes us human. This practice goes against every fiber of my being, and anger and hatred are filling up for anyone who thinks this a fair way to handle someone who is here \u2018illegally.\u2019 I\u2019m just so sad and embarrassed for our country. I surely hope my 2-year-old daughter will live to see a more compassionate world, where humans in this country are valued no matter where they come from, or what they are escaping.

            "article_content": "Jose Nunez, a 10-year veteran with the Bexar County Sheriff's Office, was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a 4-year-old girl. Officials said he was found dead of an apparent suicide in his jail Monday morning. (Bexar County Sheriff's Office) A Texas detention deputy accused of having sexually assaulted a young child whose mother is undocumented has been arrested. Jose Nunez, a 10-year veteran of the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office, was arrested Sunday and charged with super aggravated sexual assault of a child, who is possibly a relative, according to Sheriff Javier Salazar. The charge is considered \u201csuper\u201d because the victim is only 4 years old. Salazar said police were notified after the girl\u2019s mother brought her to a local fire station after she cried out for help. While the case is ongoing, Salazar said investigators believe the abuse by Nunez, 47, had been ongoing for several months \u2013 if not several years. He said she had also suffered minor injuries from the alleged assault. \u201cThe details of the case are, quite frankly, heartbreaking, disturbing, disgusting and infuriating all at the same time,\u201d Salazar said at a news conference. At the time of his arrest, Nunez was assigned to the annex jail, KSAT-TV reported. Nunez threatened the girl\u2019s mother, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, with deportation if she reported him, Salazar said. He said investigators are working with the mother to complete paperwork in a way that ensures she has a protected status \u201cpending the outcome of this case.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the young girl is a U.S. citizen. Nunez is being held without bail. If convicted, he would face a minimum of 25 years in prison. Salazar said investigators believe there could be other victims and encouraged parents, including those in the undocumented community, to come forward if their children had contact with Nunez. The Bexar police department is \u201cnot afraid to do the right thing,\u201d Salazar said, adding that his \u201cobjective\u201d is to remove Nunez from the force. \u201cWe will absolutely arrest you if you break the law, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you wear a uniform, if you carry a badge, if you carry a gun. If you break the law, you\u2019re going to jail,\u201d he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Turnout among Hispanics historically low in Lone Star state His legal name is Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke, but he goes by Beto, his nickname from his childhood growing up in El Paso, Texas \u2013 a border town that is one of the most Hispanic cities in America. A fluent Spanish-language speaker, he occasionally sprinkles the language in his speeches and talks about inclusion and representing everyone. \u201cThat means going to every county in Texas, but it also means listening and speaking in English y\u00a0tambien en Espanol,\u201d O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat, said during a rally at Rice University last week. The El Paso congressman, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Texas, is Irish-American but is trying to mobilize Latino voters in a Republican-leaning state with a large Hispanic population. \u201cI think I have never seen something in Texas where one candidate is so popular, particularly among young people,\u201d\u00a0said Carlos Duarte,\u00a0Texas state director for the non-partisan non-profit organization, Mi Familia Vota.\u00a0\u201cI think using his nickname, Beto, has really connected with Hispanics. But, I think he has also invested the time, visiting people, doing the ads targeting the Latino community.\u201d Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke says he addresses crowds in English and Spanish because he wants to make sure everyone is represented. (Fox News) One of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s challenges: He\u2019s running against Cuban-American Texas. Sen. Rafael Edward Cruz, a Republican who ironically goes by his nickname, Ted, for a seat that Cruz has held since 2013. O\u2019Rourke has been receiving national attention and has been called \u201cKennedyesque,\u201d but experts say if he wants to stay competitive in the race he has to energize Latino voters, who in Texas have traditionally failed to show up to the polls on Election Day. A recent Quinnipiac poll shows Cruz leading the Senate race by 9 points, but O\u2019Rourke holds a 24-point lead among Hispanic voters. Texas has routinely ranked near the bottom for voter turnout, and census data shows only 40 percent of Hispanics voted during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe belief [is] that the more Latinos who are not regular voters turn out, the smaller the proportion of Latino votes that Republicans [will] win,\u201d said\u00a0Mark Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. Cruz has mocked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s effort to appeal to Latino voters, suggesting the congressman is trying to deceive them. \"Liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin,\" said a Cruz campaign jingle. Sen. Ted Cruz, who recently released a digital Spanish ad, says Hispanics in the Lone Star state are conservative.\u00a0 (Fox News\u00a0) O\u2019Rourke has pushed back from the criticism. Earlier this year, he released an Instagram post with a photo of him as a child wearing a sweatshirt that had his nickname, Beto. \"My parents have called me Beto from day one, and it's just -- it's kind of a nickname for Robert in El Paso. It just stuck,\" he told CNN in an interview. Cruz has also made an effort to appeal to Latino voters. Last Friday, he released a Spanish-language ad featuring his father\u2019s escape from Cuba. But Cruz's hardline stance on immigration has turned off some Latino voters, according to Duarte. \u201cBecause he has this Latino last name, they think, \u2018OK, so he\u2019s Latino so I should be voting for him,\u2019\u201d Duarte said. \u201c[But] they oppose a border wall, they really hate the situation of the separation and incarceration of families at the border, and definitely the support for Dreamers is in the minds of a lot of young people.\u201d Canvassers are hitting neighborhoods throughout Houston, reminding residents to vote. Census data shows only 40% of Hispanics voted during the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 (Fox News) Duarte said O\u2019Rourke is drawing support among Latinos because he favors a more sympathetic stance toward undocumented immigrants \u2013 he opposes the border wall and supports Dreamers. \"It's clear Beto is gaining a lot of ground with the Latino community,\u201d Duarte said. Cruz, however, is not buying it. \u201cThe Hispanic community in Texas, our community, is a conservative community. The values we believe in are faith, family and patriotism,\u201d Cruz told reporters during a rally in Houston last week. About 28 percent of\u00a0eligible voters in Texas are Hispanic, the second largest Hispanic statewide eligible voter share nationally, according to Pew Research Center. Pew says about 21 percent of Texas' population who are Republican or lean Republican are Hispanic and 37 percent of the population who are Democratic or lean Democrat are Hispanic. The state\u2019s Democratic Party said Hispanics are a part of the electorate that it is trying to reach. \u201cThis cycle, Latinos are the primary target for our candidates to engage with at every level of their campaigns,\u201d party officials said. The Republican Party of Texas, meanwhile, said its message connects with the community. \u201c[Our] pro-life, fiscally conservative message resonates,\u201d the party said, \u201c\u2026not just with Hispanic voters, but with all Texans.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Michael Grimm was a rising star in the Republican Party before scandal struck and he served seven months in a minimum security federal prison camp New York\u2019s disgraced former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm said it\u2019s a \u201cno-win\u201d situation for President Trump when endorsing congressional candidates. Grimm is campaigning for his old seat in the state\u2019s primary this month. He is competing against incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., whom the president endorsed this week. \u201cOut of respect for the president, I wouldn\u2019t advise him to get involved in House primaries because you either upset the grass-roots or the entrenched establishment, making it a no-win situation,\u201d Grimm told Fox News, adding that it was \u201cnot a warning\u201d to avoid involvement. Trump\u2019s endorsement of Donovan came with a reminder for voters of Alabama\u2019s special Senate election last year \u2014 when Roy Moore seized the Republican nomination but ultimately lost the general election to Democrat Doug Jones amid a sexual misconduct accusations. Grimm, a former two-term congressman, FBI agent and lawyer, fell from grace in\u00a02014\u00a0when he was indicted on 20 counts of tax evasion, hiring undocumented immigrants and perjury. Grimm pleaded guilty to one count of federal tax fraud \u2014 for paying undocumented workers under the table \u2014 and spent seven months of an eight-month sentence in a minimum security federal prison. \u201cThere is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!\u201d Trump tweeted this week. He added: \u201cVery importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November\u2026and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can\u2019t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!\u201d Donovan didn't vote with the president on tax cuts. Grimm is honing in on that--releasing a new television ad Friday titled: \u201cEvery time it mattered, Dan Donovan voted against President Trump.\u201d Donovan, who has been in New York City politics for decades, has said that Trump endorsed him at least six times throughout his political career. He has had, though, to explain voting against Trump\u2019s tax overhaul and plan to replace former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law \u2014 ObamaCare. \u201cI vote with Trump 90 percent of the time,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI vote with my constituents 100 percent of the time.\u201d Grimm\u2019s criminal history has been the central issue for the former congressman throughout the campaign. The president this week pardoned conservative filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza who pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine. D\u2019Souza had claimed for years that he was unfairly singled out for prosecution and unfairly treated by the Obama administration. When asked if Grimm wanted a presidential pardon from Trump, he replied: \u201cOf course!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who wouldn\u2019t, especially in my circumstances,\u201d Grimm said, insisting that his harsh sentence was politically motivated.

This division, this hatred, this ugliness has to end.\u201dThis was the same Joe Biden who at a Florida rally the day before said of\u00a0Donald Trump, \u201cThis president is more like\u00a0George Wallace\u00a0than\u00a0George Washington.\u201d\nThere\u2019s truth in what Biden had to say about our divide-and-conquer president who stokes cultural animus for political gain, but campaigning in the contest that could see Florida\u2019s first-ever black governor elected, we assume Biden was more interested in invoking the first chapter of Wallace\u2019s career as a vicious, enthusiastic segregationist.So the \u201cthis\u201d in Biden\u2019s remarks about division, hatred and ugliness might be better understood as \u201cyour.\u201dBut when it comes to misleading parts of speech, Biden\u2019s articles have nothing on the president\u2019s pronouns.\u201cWe have to unify. We have to come together,\u201d Trump said in brief remarks today promising to bring the guilty to justice. \u201cActs or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\u201dNow, we will take the president at his word that he opposes political violence, despite his lusty talk about violence at his 2016 rallies. But Trump talking about national unity would be like\u00a0Kim Kardashian\u00a0talking about the need for modesty on social media.\nThis was, after all, the same Trump who in Houston on Monday declared that \u201cThe Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation, and the safety of every single American.\u201dNot that their policies might produce these things, mind you, but that the intent of the party that includes something like a third of his countrymen want to destroy the nation and endanger every citizen.\u00a0\nTrump even falsely accused Democrats about opposition to the anti-opioid addiction bill, the signing of which provided the backdrop for his plea for national unity. At an Ohio rally on Oct. 12, he claimed that the bill that passed with \u201cvery little Democrat support.\u201d The bill passed the Senate 99-1, with only Republican\u00a0Mike Lee\u00a0of Utah dissenting. Lolz. So Trump\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d today about the need to unify ought to be read as \u201cyou.\u201d You ought to unite with him and otherwise shut up about it.\nTrump has taken the long-lamented practice of subtly but invidiously raising questions about the motives of one\u2019s political foes and turned it into a Gatling gun of calumny. The term \u201cdivider in chief\u201d has been applied to his two immediate predecessors, but Trump\u2019s the only one who embraces it.\u00a0\nNow, it\u2019s foolish to spend too much time parsing the niceties that politicians offer when they sense dire events may lead to their own political peril. Pay attention to what they\u2019re saying when they think they have room to swing the axe to get a sense of them, not what they say when they\u2019re worried.\nBut indulge us in just one more.\u00a0\nCampaigning for a Democratic House candidate in Florida today,\u00a0Hillary Clinton, one of the intended recipients of the explosives, also had some thoughts on the need for national healing.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is a troubling time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a time of deep divisions, and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together.\u201d\nThis is the same woman who two weeks ago told CNN,\u00a0\u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.\u201d \u201cThat's why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again,\u201d she continued.\u00a0So her \u201cwe,\u201d today is, of course, is like the president\u2019s. It means \u201cyou.\u201d When you are ready to bend the knee, then we can \u201cbring our country together.\u201d\u00a0Remarkably, Clinton continued her remarks in Miami saying that the way to heal these deep divisions was to\u2026 choose her party\u2019s candidate in the election. There\u2019s nothing to suggest that the choice between Democrat\u00a0Donna Shalala\u00a0and Republican\u00a0Maria Salazar\u00a0would either deepen or heal the wounds Clinton described, but why pass up a chance to score some points? We\u2019re not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. But we suggest that in a time when political violence is on the rise and public confrontations are increasingly common, it\u2019s time to stop expecting the politicians who profit from these divisions to be the ones who will somehow fix them.THE RULEBOOK: WHAT IT TAKES\n\u201cNo axiom is more clearly established in law, or in reason, than that wherever the end is required, the means are authorized; wherever a general power to do a thing is given, every particular power necessary for doing it is included.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison, Federalist No. 44TIME OUT: CELESTIAL DENSITY AL DENTE\u00a0Atlantic:\u00a0\u201cNeutron stars exist under unfathomable conditions. For one to form, another star must grow old and die. When a giant star has burned through the fuel supply that makes it shine, its core collapses under its own weight, mashing electrons and protons together to produce neutrons. \u2026 The light show eventually fades, but the compressed core\u2014now a newly formed neutron star, shining brightly on its own\u2014remains. \u2026 For all astrophysicists have learned about these bizarre objects since they were first predicted in the 1930s, they still don\u2019t know exactly what neutron stars look like on the inside. For now, the study of their interiors relies on theoretical models\u2026 They compare them to pasta. \u2018I guess physicists just love their food,\u2019 says\u00a0Matt Caplan, an astrophysicist at McGill University who studies neutron stars. It\u2019s not just that, of course. The carb-heavy framework, first proposed in the early 1980s, may sound silly, but it makes a lot of sense. The structures that astrophysicists predict exist inside neutron stars really do resemble some classic pasta shapes.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with\nyour tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDTrump job performance\u00a0\nAverage approval:\u00a044.2 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a052 percentNet Score:\u00a0-7.8 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 1 point\n[Average includes: Gallup: 44% approve - 50% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 45% approve - 52% disapprove; CBS News: 42% approve - 53% disapprove; Fox News: 47% approve - 52% disapprove; ABC/WaPo: 43% approve - 53% disapprove.]Control of House\nRepublican average:\u00a040.4 percentDemocratic average:\u00a049.6 percentAdvantage:\u00a0Democrats plus 9.6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Democratic advantage up 2 points\u00a0\u00a0[Average includes: Fox News: 49% Dems - 42% GOP; ABC/WaPo: 53% Dems - 42% GOP; CNBC: 42% Dems - 36% GOP; CNN: 54% Dems - 41% GOP; NPR/PBS/Marist: 48% Dems - 42% GOP.]GILLUM ETHICS WOES ARISE AHEAD OF FINAL DEBATE TONIGHT\u00a0NYT: \u201cDogged by a state ethics commission investigation into trips he took as mayor of Tallahassee,\u00a0Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has insisted that all of his travel was above board, paid for by himself, his wife or his younger brother. \u2018I don\u2019t take free trips from anybody,\u2019 Mr. Gillum said in a debate on Sunday. But records made public on Tuesday suggest that Mr. Gillum knowingly accepted a ticket to the Broadway show \u2018Hamilton\u2019 from men he believed to be businessmen looking to develop property in Tallahassee \u2014 but who were actually undercover F.B.I. agents. The records also suggest that a lobbyist friend provided Mr. Gillum and his brother with a hotel room in New York \u2014 and possibly paid for much of a vacation the mayor shared in Costa Rica. Mr. Gillum never reported any of the perks as gifts, as required by law for elected officials in Florida.\u201dPoll shows tightening race for Connecticut governor -\u00a0WSJ:\u00a0\u201cRepublican\u00a0Bob Stefanowski\u00a0and Democrat\u00a0Ned Lamont\u00a0are locked in a tight race for governor in Connecticut, according to a Sacred Heart University and Hearst Connecticut Media Group poll released Tuesday. Mr. Lamont, a cable television entrepreneur, leads Mr. Stefanowski, a former business executive, 39.5% to 36.1%. \u2026 Mr. Lamont\u2019s lead over Mr. Stefanowski has shrunk in recent weeks. A similar poll from September had Mr. Lamont leading 43.1% to 36.9%. \u2026The state\u2019s economy has performed sluggishly in recent years, and the next governor will have to close a $4.4 billion budget gap over the next two fiscal years. \u2026 Other polls have shown Mr. Lamont with a larger advantage. A Quinnipiac University survey released earlier this month showed Mr. Lamont leading by 8 percentage points.\u201dPoll: Dead heat in South Dakota gubernatorial for Noem, Sutton -\u00a0Sioux Falls Argus Leader:\u00a0\u201cIt's a dead heat. Two weeks ahead of the South Dakota general election, two gubernatorial hopefuls are tied, according to a poll commissioned by the Argus Leader and KELO TV. In a survey of 500 registered voters likely to cast their ballots in the election, 45 percent said they would vote for Republican\u00a0Kristi Noem\u00a0if the race were held today. Meanwhile, 45 percent said they'd vote for Democrat\u00a0Billie Sutton. One percent of those surveyed said they planned to support Libertarian Kurt Evans. Another 9 percent said they were undecided. Jacksonville, Florida-based Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy polled voters by telephone between October 18 and October 22. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. The numbers illustrate that for the first time in more than 40 years, a Democrat could be poised to take the governor's mansion. While campaigns' internal polls reported a tightening race and the Cook Political Report earlier this month shifted the race from a likely Republican win to a toss-up, this is the first independent polling to show the race is a dead heat.\u201dCivil but sharp debate in Georgia governor race -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cThe candidates in the hotly contested and closely watched Georgia gubernatorial contest stood firm in their respective political corners Tuesday night in a debate that touched on some of the ideological divisions that are playing out at the national level.\u00a0Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee who hopes to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor, talked about expanding Medicaid, as well as the electorate, accusing Republican\u00a0Brian Kemp, who is Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, of striking fear into the state\u2019s growing minority population by making it harder to vote. Kemp talked about lowering taxes and \u2018putting Georgians first,\u2019 criticizing Abrams for wanting to allow some young undocumented immigrants to participate in a state-funded scholarship program and saying that she is encouraging \u2018illegals\u2019 to vote.\u00a0Each continually accused the other of misstating their positions, but the hour-long debate was not rancorous and offered no surprises.\u201dNevada\u2019s Laxalt faces political attack from family members -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cThe midterm elections are ruining Thanksgiving \u2013 at least for a handful of families bitterly divided over relatives running for office. In a startling trend, several candidates this year have been hit with attack ads and op-eds featuring siblings and other family members. The latest political family feud to go public involves the Laxalt family, of which\u00a0Adam Laxalt\u00a0is running as the Republican nominee for Nevada governor. A dozen relatives essentially called him a big phony, in a scathing op-ed published this week in the Reno Gazette-Journal. \u2018[W]e feel compelled to speak publicly about why we believe that Adam Laxalt is the wrong choice for Nevada\u2019s governorship,\u2019 they wrote, out of a proclaimed interest to \u2018protect our family name from being leveraged and exploited by Adam Laxalt.\u2019\u00a0The op-ed went on to question his Nevada-roots narrative\u2026\u201dMENENDEZ LEADS, BUT TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE FOR HUGINNJ.COM: \u201cOn the same day of\u00a0the only debate in New Jersey's U.S. Senate race, a poll released Wednesday gave U.S. Sen.\u00a0Robert Menendez\u00a0a 5-point lead over\u00a0former Celgene Corp. executive\u00a0Bob Hugin.\u00a0The\u00a0Rutgers-Eagleton survey\u00a0put Democrat Menendez ahead of Republican Hugin among likely voters, 51 percent to 46 percent,\u00a0within the poll's margin of error of 5.1 percentage points. The candidates are scheduled to face off Wednesday evening.\u00a0Every poll\u00a0has put Menendez in the lead, but narrower than expected given New Jersey's\u00a0blue tint\u00a0and the opposition in the state to Republican President\u00a0Donald Trump. In a midterm election\u00a0seen as a referendum\u00a0on the president, just 41 percent of likely voters approved of\u00a0Trump's\u00a0performance in office, with 56 percent disapproving.\u201dDonnelly, Braun trade poll leads in Indiana dead heat -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cRepublican businessman\u00a0Mike Braun\u00a0and incumbent Democratic Sen.\u00a0Joe Donnelly\u00a0are trading the lead in the polls just two weeks before voters cast their ballots in Indiana\u2019s tightening Senate race. A new poll, released on Tuesday by IndyPolitics.org and Mason Strategies, found that that 47 percent of voters in the Hoosier State back Braun, while 43 percent said they support Donnelly in his bid for a second Senate term. Libertarian candidate\u00a0Lucy Brenton\u00a0earned 3 percent while 7 percent are still undecided.\u00a0Another poll, released on Monday by the Indianapolis Business Journal, found that 41 percent of voters in Indiana back Donnelly, while 40 percent said they support Braun. Brenton comes in third with 8 percent of the vote.\u201dRNC pumps cash to House, Senate committees -\u00a0Politico: \u201cThe Republican National Committee has transferred $3.5 million apiece to the GOP\u2019s House and Senate campaign arms. The last-minute infusion, which was confirmed by a person with knowledge, is designed to help the congressional committees combat a wave of Democratic spending.\u00a0House Republicans, in particular, have found themselves deluged. Through the end of last week, the National Republican Congressional Committee had been outspent on the TV airwaves by its Democratic counterpart, $65 million to $44 million.\u00a0With the transfer, the RNC \u2014 which has benefited heavily from President Donald Trump\u2019s fundraising \u2014 has given the congressional committees nearly $17 million in total.\u201dIOWA DEMS WORRY ABOUT END OF STRAIGHT-TICKET VOTINGPolitico: \u201cIowa Democrats are worried that a small change in the state\u2019s voting law might have serious implications up and down the ballot this fall. For the first time, Iowa voters will be denied the opportunity to vote a straight-party ticket \u2014 a time-honored practice that enables voters to choose a party\u2019s entire slate of candidates with a single mark. Until the legislature outlawed the practice in 2017, voters could simply fill in just one oval to back every single party candidate on the ballot. Now, with grassroots enthusiasm surging and a higher-than-usual turnout expected in November, Democrats are increasingly nervous that the change will end up tamping down their vote totals in a year that shows signs of being a wave election for the party.\u201dWhat about those ballot initiatives? -\u00a0National Review: \u201cOften overlooked, however, will be several important ballot measures that could have a far more direct impact on people\u2019s lives than the high-profile races that receive all the news coverage. \u2026 But in six states, voters will have the opportunity to cap, limit, or restrict taxes. Arizona voters will consider whether to prohibit new or increased taxes on real-estate transactions, banking, investment management, health care, and other services. In Florida, voters will vote on two anti-tax measures. The first would make permanent a 10 percent cap on property taxes that is currently set to expire next year. The second would require a two-thirds supermajority in both chambers of the legislature to raise taxes.\u201dPLAY-BY-PLAYNate Silver\u00a0offers two alternate visions of Election Day\u00a0-\u00a0FiveThirtyEightAnd yet he persisted:\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0pens op-ed about recent restaurant protest\u00a0-\u00a0Courier JournalStudy finds only eight states require civics class\u00a0-\u00a0Ed WeekAUDIBLE: NEED SOME ICE FOR THAT BURN?\n\u201cI didn't know we were that close.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Dallas Mayor\u00a0Mike Rawlings\u00a0after he was asked by the Dallas Morning News\u00a0about his relationship with Rep.\u00a0Pete Sessions.

Republicans spent six years of the Obama administration bottling up policies, nominees and initiatives they thought to be harmful to the country. Certainly they were clear about this to voters who gave them the House and then the Senate for that very purpose. Add in the constant investigations and oversight hearings, the GOP proved very effective at blockading the previous administration. Now, Democrats are asking for the chance to do the same thing in return. It is too bad that we can\u2019t see more cooperation on issues that really do enjoy broad consensus like immigration, infrastructure, firearms and more. That was the norm when Dole was a senator, but not anymore. There are a lot of reasons why, particularly a primary election system that rewards radicalism, but our moment is certainly one of obstruction over cooperation.]Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.WORTH IT, TBH\u00a0KFSN: \u201cThe Fresno Fire Department said a man who was house-sitting for his parents set the home on fire after he used a blowtorch to kill black widows.\u00a0Yes, you read that right.\u00a0Thankfully, firefighters say no one was injured in the fire and the man who initially called them made it out safely.\u00a0The house fire happened Tuesday night at a home in the Woodward Lake housing development.\u00a0Fire crews said there was damage to the second-story of the home and the attic.\u00a0Twenty-nine firefighters responded to the two-alarm fire and were able to extinguish it.\u00a0Although the official cause has not been determined, fire crews believe the blowtorch is to blame.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cDefending the status quo today is a thankless undertaking.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Charles Krauthammer(1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on June 23, 2016.\u00a0\u00a0Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is the politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0Brianna McClelland\u00a0contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "President Trump picked Brett Kavanaugh to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. After a contentious confirmation battle including sexual assault allegations against the nominee, the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the High Court. Long before Judge Brett Kavanaugh was thrust into the national spotlight as his nomination to the Supreme Court became bogged down by decades-old accusations, he was well known in Washington circles. Kavanaugh, 53, who was confirmed to court on a 50-48 vote on Oct. 6, is a graduate of Yale Law School and a former clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose retirement from the nation\u2019s highest court left the open seat on the bench Kavanaugh will fill. With approximately 300 opinions issued in 12 years as a judge and a raft of legal articles and speaking engagements, Kavanaugh was the most prolific of the nominees Trump was said to be considering for the role. His confirmation was all but certain until a few women publicly came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of engaging in sexual misconduct during parties and social gatherings in high school and college. Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her allegations. President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals judge, to the Supreme Court in July 2018. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Ford claimed\u00a0Kavanaugh held her on a bed, attempted to forcibly remove her clothes and covered her mouth with his hand while at a house party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has repeatedly \u2013 and at times emotionally \u2013 denied the allegations. Read on for a look at Kavanaugh\u2019s career. Kavanaugh co-wrote independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s report in the 1990s. He laid out the legal framework supporting Clinton\u2019s impeachment for his affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton could have been impeached for misleading the public and lying to staff members, Kavanaugh argued then, according to The New York Times. However, he later wrote that he thought presidents shouldn't have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office. Kavanaugh has never directly ruled on abortion as a judge, so it\u2019s unclear how he would decide the subject. He did, however, dissent on an appeals court decision that allowed a pregnant undocumented teenager in federal custody to have an abortion. KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION DERAILED BY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS: A LIST OF HIS ACCUSERS During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh called Roe v. Wade an \u201cimportant precedent\u201d that has been \u201creaffirmed many times.\u201d He was questioned about his stance on abortion multiple times by lawmakers. Kavanaugh was nominated to the federal appeals court by former President George W. Bush, who said he selected Kavanaugh \u201cbecause of the force of his mind, the breadth of his experience and the strength of his character.\u201d Serving as a lawyer and staff secretary during the Bush administration, Kavanaugh traveled in top D.C. legal and political circles, earning the confidence of key players such as Karl Rove. He\u2019s also married to Bush\u2019s former personal secretary, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, and has two daughters. In this June 1, 2006 file photo, from left to right, President Bush, watches the swearing-in of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, far right, during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) Bush said Trump's choice to nominate Kavanaugh was \"an outstanding decision.\" \"Brett is a brilliant jurist who has faithfully\u00a0applied the Constitution and laws throughout his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit,\" Bush said. \"He will make a superb Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Kavanaugh, as an only child, points to his mother, Martha, for his career trajectory. Martha Kavanaugh taught high school history before returning to school for her law degree. She later became a prosecutor and a judge in Maryland. \"She's instilled in me a commitment to public service and a respect for the rule of law that I've tried to follow throughout my career,\" Kavanaugh said at his 2006 Senate confirmation hearing for a spot on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. An avid runner, Kavanaugh lists his two Boston Marathon finishes on his court website biography: 3:59:45 in 2010 and 4:08:36 in 2015. His team, D.C. Circuitry, regularly wins medals in an annual 5K charity race along the Anacostia River. The judge currently coaches his daughters' basketball teams. Kavanaugh also has tutored children at a D.C. elementary school, volunteered for Catholic charity groups and is a regular participant in services at his Catholic church.

            "article_content": " California has escalating crime, cities teaming with homeless people, clogged and crumbling roads, massive unpaid bills, some of America\u2019s highest taxes, and some of its worst public school systems. So what\u2019s the plan by Gavin Newsom, the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate for governor, to improve the situation? On Tuesday he suggested giving free health care to illegal immigrants. Speaking on a left-wing podcast, the former mayor of San Francisco said: \u201cI did universal health care when I was mayor, fully implemented, regardless of pre-existing condition, ability to pay, and regardless of your immigration status. I\u2019d like to see that extended to the rest of the state. San Francisco is the only universal health-care plan for all undocumented residents in America.\u201d Thus continues California progressives\u2019 war on the state\u2019s law-abiding and productive residents, especially its middle class. If Newsom becomes governor, they may get to pay for health care for people who don\u2019t even belong in the country and can\u2019t or won\u2019t pull their own weight. It\u2019s unclear if Newsom and his progressive allies understand that dispensing a growing list of government benefits to groups of people creates an unwanted magnet effect. In 2016, Los Angeles voters approved a bond initiative throwing an extra $1.2 billion at the spiraling homeless problem \u2013 on top of existing programs. The result: more homeless people and more crime. Some blame pleasant weather and high housing costs for California\u2019s homeless crisis, but those factors exist in other states. The difference in California is lavish benefits for homeless people and kid-glove treatment because the police have had their hands tied by progressive politicians and judges. The result is the opposite of the \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing of petty crimes that Rudy Giuliani used to save New York City from mayhem when he was mayor. Instead of cops incentivizing people to meet minimum standards of society \u2013 like not shooting up drugs or relieving themselves in public \u2013police must stand by and watch communities decay. Judging from the demonstrated magnet effect of expanded benefits for the homeless amid general lawlessness, what can we now expect free health care for illegal immigrants to produce?\u00a0 The answer is more of them. Not only will they come to California from other states for \u201cfree\u201d services, more will be tempted to come illegally into the U.S. from Mexico. If you think this bad idea will be confined to California, think again. Newsom would achieve universal health-care coverage for illegal immigrants by expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which is known as Medi-Cal. Currently the federal government pays an unbelievable two-thirds of this California program. Unless Congress takes action, taxpayers from across the nation could soon be on the hook for much of this new handout. Newsom\u2019s promise is particularly bad news for middle-class Californians. They don\u2019t have high-paying jobs in tech or entertainment that enable them to live in places like Newsom\u2019s posh Russian Hill neighborhood in San Francisco, send their kids to private schools, pay cash for medical concierge services, or drive Teslas and other luxury cars. Middle-class Californians must contend with the crime and the distressed freeways, schools, and crowded hospitals that uncontrolled illegal immigration has produced by straining resources. Some California locales are even starting to water down the voting rights of citizens by letting illegal immigrants cast ballots in some elections \u2013 a step San Francisco will begin in elections this November. This comes on top of any voting by illegal immigrants due to California\u2019s lack of a requirement to show a photo ID to vote. This silliness has to end. Newsom\u2019s Republican opponent for governor, John Cox, has made clear he would work with the federal government to get tough on illegal immigration, including by supporting commonsense steps like a border wall. But Cox faces long odds in a state where government unions and a rich coastal elite have built a formidable political machine. Congress may have to step in. Ultimately it\u2019s not up to California\u2019s progressives to decide who gets to be a citizen and whether people who are here illegally should get lavish handouts paid for with Americans\u2019 money. Congress must protect the voting and taxpayer rights of U.S. citizens in California \u2013 and across the nation.",

            "article_content": "Analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Star panel. The Trump administration announced last year its plan to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) \u2013 which provides a level of amnesty to certain undocumented immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children \u2013 with a six-month delay for recipients. But a federal appeals court ruled against the proposal in early November, declaring the government couldn't immediately end the program. \u201cThe Executive wields awesome power in the enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cOur decision today does not curb that power, but rather enables its exercise in a manner that is free from legal misconceptions and is democratically accountable to the public.\u201d Trump had initially set a March 5 deadline for the program and called on Congress to pass legislation pertaining to the young immigrants.\u00a0But the deadline came and went, with no congressional action but several lawsuits challenging the administration's decision to end the program. FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON DACA Federal judges in New York and Washington also have ruled against President Trump on DACA. President Trump has repeatedly blamed Democrats for inaction. Here\u2019s a look at the DACA program and why the Trump administration wants to dismantle\u00a0it. Nearly 800,000 undocumented youth fell under the DACA program's umbrella. (Reuters/Jose Luis Gonzalez) The DACA program was formed through executive action by former President Barack Obama in 2012 and allowed certain people who came to the U.S. illegally as minors to be protected from immediate deportation. Recipients, called Dreamers, were able to request \u201cconsideration of deferred action\u201d for a period of two years, which was subject to renewal. \u201cDeferred action is a use of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time,\u201d\u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u00a0stated. \u201cDeferred action does not provide lawful status.\u201d Individuals were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007. Individuals also had to have a high school diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or still be in school. Recipients could not have a criminal record. It did not provide \u201clegal status.\u201d Nearly 800,000 youth, called Dreamers, are under the program's umbrella. Daniel Garza, president of the conservative immigration nonprofit Libre Initiative, told Fox News that DACA offers a \u201creprieve from a life of uncertainty for innocent kids who didn\u2019t break the law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rather disappointing to think they could return to a state of anxiety and fear,\u201d he said. The Trump administration announced in September 2017 that it planned to phase out DACA for current recipients, and no new requests would be granted. But\u00a0a lower court order required the administration to continue accepting renewal applications for those under the DACA program, and the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to intervene. Since the announcement, Trump had offered to work with lawmakers on a solution for the hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who fell under DACA\u2019s umbrella of protections. But at the same time, he has repeatedly blamed Democrats on social media for lack of a solution. Earlier this year, Trump released\u00a0his \u201cfour pillars\u201d of immigration reform, which included a provision for legal status for DACA recipients and others who would be eligible for DACA status. The White House estimated that total to be 1.8 million people.\u00a0The Senate rejected the plan. Republicans \u2013 and some Democrats \u2013 opposed Obama\u2019s directive establishing DACA from the start as a perceived overreach of executive power. Obama spoke out on social media after the Trump administration announced a plan to dismantle the program, stating that it's \"self-defeating ... and it is cruel\" to end DACA and questioned the motive behind the decision. Despite some rumors circulating online to the contrary, Dreamers\u00a0were eligible to serve\u00a0in the U.S. military since 2014 when\u00a0the Pentagon adopted a policy\u00a0to allow a certain amount of illegal immigrants to join. In fiscal year 2016, 359 DACA recipients had enlisted in the Army \u2013 which is the only branch to accept immigrants of this category.

            "article_content": "AP Photo/Michael Conroy President Trump warned on Twitter last week that law enforcement would be looking for \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in the midterm elections. Many journalists quickly responded \u2013 as they always do \u2013 by dismissing the very existence of voter fraud. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta tweeted \u201cvoter fraud in this country is actually very rare.\u201d Glenn Thrush of The New York Times claimed: \u201cthere is essentially no voter fraud in this country.\u201d He instead asked, \"Will the (Justice Department) Civil Rights division prevent/investigate a real threat-voter suppression?\" Journalists have credulously repeated unsupported, patronizing claims that in Georgia and other states, voter registration and absentee ballot laws somehow suppress minority votes. The preference for opinion journalism over real reporting prompted Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame to tell a CNN summit last Monday, \u201cWe need to be doing stories that really look at whether or not there is widespread voter fraud\u2026. we still need to be doing that basic aspect of the reporting.\u201d David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report said there are \u201cvalid concerns about the restrictive impact of new voting laws and voters improperly removed from rolls, but there's also a lot of outrage-stoking and sloppy journalism in this realm that are counterproductive to fixing real problems.\u201d For example, to improve the accuracy of Georgia\u2019s records, state legislators last year required \u00a0that information on a voter registration application match a \u201cdriver\u2019s license, state ID card or Social Security record.\u201d Inconsistencies can cause a voter\u2019s registration to be flagged as \u201cpending\u201d while the discrepancy is investigated. Brian Kemp, the GOP candidate for governor and current secretary of state in Georgia, is being accused of \u201cvoter suppression\u201d because of this law. But a \u201cpending\u201d status does not prevent anyone from voting as long as he or she has a government ID that substantially matches the registration application. In any event, every voter can cast a provisional ballot that will be counted once the registration information is verified. As the secretary of state told radio host Erick Erickson, there are 75,000 pending voters among a record total of 7 million registered in the state. Of these, 9,224 are minors under 18; 2,935 used a fake address; 3,393 are not citizens, and 5,842 were already registered. Of the remaining applications, 75 percent submitted erroneous Social Security information. Almost a quarter of those \u201csloppy forms\u201d came from a registration effort by the New Georgia Project, a group founded in 2014 by Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor. Abrams seems unconcerned about voter integrity, telling a crowd in Jonesboro that the \"blue wave\" would include \"those who are documented and undocumented.\u201d She later claimed she didn\u2019t mean to imply noncitizens should actually vote. While journalists have chased down the Georgia rabbit hole, law enforcement and citizen watchdog groups have uncovered serious voter fraud problems that have received almost no national attention. For example: In Texas Court filings by the Texas attorney general reveal that funding for a voter fraud ring came from the former head of the Texas Democratic Party in Fort Worth. Leticia Sanchez and three other vote \u201charvesters\u201d have been indicted for allegedly submitting fraudulent absentee ballot applications and then either intercepting the ballots in mailboxes or improperly \u201cassisting\u201d elderly voters in filling out their ballots. Separately, the Texas attorney general has announced he\u2019s investigating mailers sent to non-citizens by the state Democratic Party asking them to register using applications that already had the box asking about citizenship checked \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d In California California was recently forced to admit that it had mistakenly registered almost 25,000 ineligible voters. The state didn\u2019t even realize it was registering noncitizens until a Canadian who is a permanent resident of the U.S. contacted The Los Angeles Times to say he had been improperly registered under the state\u2019s new automatic voter registration system. In a letter calling for an audit, Democratic Secretary of State Alex Padilla admitted that such \u201cpersistent errors\u201d will \u201cundermine public confidence.\u201d In Pennsylvania Over a 20-year-period, Pennsylvania Department of Motor Vehicles officials have allowed thousands of noncitizens to register to vote and many have actually voted. After state officials withheld documents from the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) and even state legislators with oversight authority detailing this mess, the PILF sued to enforce a federal disclosure law. After months of litigation, state election officials are still concealing the information that no one in the media seems interested in uncovering. In Michigan PILF found that Michigan lacks a system to keep false citizenship claims\u00a0from being accepted during voter registration. The group\u2019s preliminary study of the Detroit metro area found at least 1,444 non-citizens have been registered to vote in recent years. PILF has also found thousands of non-citizens \u2013 many of whom have voted \u2013 on voter rolls in other jurisdictions, including New Jersey, Illinois and numerous sanctuary cities. In states around the U.S., major problems with our voter registration systems have been tolerated for years. A 2012 report by the Pew Center on the States found that more than 1.8 million dead people were registered to vote and 2.75 million people were registered in more than one state. The Pew report found that 24 million registrations were either invalid or inaccurate, making the registration systems vulnerable to fraud. Despite this abysmal record, the Justice Department under President Obama decided it wouldn\u2019t take any action to enforce a federal law that requires states to maintain accurate voter rolls by regularly removing ineligible voters When the 2002 Help America Vote Act \u00a0passed Congress with bipartisan support in the aftermath of the 2000 election debacle in Florida, it\u2019s co-author \u2013 Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut \u2013 declared the goal of our laws should be to \u201cmake it easy to vote and hard to cheat.\u201d Indeed, there is no reason why we can\u2019t pursue both goals. But the media aren\u2019t doing our democracy any favors by summarily dismissing the existence of voter fraud \u2013 like the almost 1,200 proven cases in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s election fraud database \u2013 while questioning the very need for accurate voter rolls.

            "article_content": "The viral photo of the crying two-year-old Honduran girl has been used by the media to represent the crisis of children being separated from their parents. However, the girl\u2019s story might not be what it seems, according to her father. A little girl shown in a viral photo crying as a U.S. Border Patrol agent detained her mother\u00a0\u2013 and used by TIME magazine to symbolize the Trump administration's family separation policy \u2013 reportedly was never separated from her mom. \u201cWelcome to America,\u201d declared a somber TIME cover, which showed the picture of the Honduran child Yanela Sanchez next to a towering President Trump. TIME, which is standing by the cover despite the new information, originally called it \u201can image America could not ignore\u201d and interviewed the photographer, as did other outlets. TIME followed up with another article\u00a0entirely about the cover and \u201cthe story behind\u201d it. The picture was featured in international coverage of the policy around the world. The New York Daily News also put Sanchez on the cover of its June 16 issue with the headline: \u201cCallous. Soulless. Craven. Trump.\u201d CNN analyst Chris Cillizza wrote an entire article on the TIME cover: \"It shows the compassion gap that exists between the Trump administration's 'zero-tolerance' border policy and the real-life people that are affected.\" But multiple outlets interviewed the father of the girl behind the iconic image, and he said he had learned that his two-year-old daughter was detained with her mother at a facility in Texas, and the two were not separated at all. The Honduran government confirmed his version of events to\u00a0Reuters. The Washington Post\u00a0reported that the mother, Sandra Sanchez, had previously been deported in 2013 to Honduras. Her husband told the Post that she left without telling him she was taking Yanela with her and couldn\u2019t contact her. But then he saw the picture on the news. \"You can imagine how I felt when I saw that photo of my daughter. It broke my heart. It's difficult as a father to see that, but I know now that they are not in danger. They are safer now than when they were making that journey to the border,\"\u00a0Denis Javier Varela Hernandez told\u00a0The Daily Mail. He also said he did not support his wife\u2019s decision to make the perilous trek to the U.S. and that they have three other children together. MCALLEN, TX - JUNE 12:  A two-year-old Honduran asylum seeker cries as her mother is searched and detained near the U.S.-Mexico border on June 12, 2018 in McAllen, Texas. The asylum seekers had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is executing the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy towards undocumented immigrants. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also said that domestic and gang violence in immigrants' country of origin would no longer qualify them for political asylum status.  (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) (2018 Getty Images) \"I didn't support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day.\" But despite the dad's explanation, TIME stood by its cover in a statement Friday. \u201cThe June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents,\"\u00a0TIME editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said. \"Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment.\u201d Yet, in its story about the photo, TIME included the following correction: \"The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together.\" The confusion and misrepresentation over the family's circumstances came amid a chaotic week in which passions flared over the administration's controversial \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that seeks prosecution for virtually all illegal border crossers. That policy led to family separations, but Trump backed off with an executive order earlier this week allowing families to stay together during proceedings. He faced bipartisan criticism over the separations, but the outrage reached intense levels on the left. Activists, lawmakers and journalists have accused the administration of running \u201cinternment camps,\u201d while Trump administration officials have had their cell phone numbers revealed online and been chased out of restaurants. \"We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!\" Trump tweeted Friday. It\u2019s the latest immigration-related misstep by media outlets and reporters. Last month, liberals and journalists rushed to share an article featuring pictures of children locked in cages at an Arizona detention center. Many such tweets were quickly deleted or clarified when other users pointed out that the article was from 2014 -- during then-President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. EMBARRASSMENT FOR NEW YORK TIMES AS TOP EDITOR FALLS FOR OLD PHOTO AMID WEEKEND OF MISLEADING ANTI-TRUMP TWEETS Others shared a tweet about a \u201cprison bus\u201d that Immigration and Customs officials allegedly used to carry babies. But the bus was used for educational field trips, and the picture was published on April 2016 -- about six months before Trump won the presidency.

            "article_content": "No one should be permitted to undermine our immigration laws or destabilize the security and sovereignty of the United States of America. As the so-called US-bound \u201ccaravan\u201d traveling through Mexico continues to swell, some questions arise that the\u00a0media will not ask. Who is funding these efforts? How has it grown so quickly and what did the Democrats have to offer besides a bunch of cliches and bromides, and of course grandstanding? If you have been watching other networks, you have been treated to sympathetic, overwrought coverage of this invading horde, which is anything but a \u201ccaravan.\u201d Mainstream news networks have dispatched teams of embedded reporters who are not so much covering the migrant mob as covering for it. They highlight the wonderful camaraderie and welcoming spirit of the masses bent on breaking into our nation. If you are skeptical, or dare to think our border should be secure, you are a \u201cfear-monger\u201d who doesn\u2019t treat people with proper respect. Why, you may have even turned your back on the teachings of Christ, according to the previously militantly secular media. Their latest gripe is President Trump\u2019s suggestion that Middle Eastern terrorists might be part of this peace-loving group of traveling mothers and children. \u201cTake your camera, go into the middle and search,\u201d Trump counseled what he calls the \u201cfake news\u201d media. \u201cYou are going to find MS-13, you're going to find Middle Easterners, you're going to find everything.\u201d CNN\u2019s Don Lemon reacted with horror, accusing the president of \u201cseizing on unsubstantiated right-wing media reports that the caravan has been infiltrated by criminals and unknown middle easterners.\u201d Lemon\u2019s colleague, Anderson Cooper, asked a guest if there was any evidence that \u201cMiddle Easterners\u201d could be part of the caravan, and was predictably told, \u201cof course not!\u201d So why aren't journalists doing their jobs and vetting this horde, investigating who actually organized it and finding out who is financing it? Well, it turns out the president may be privy to more information than the bright lights at CNN headquarters and their reporters. The spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the caravan includes \"citizens of countries outside of Central America, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia and elsewhere.\" Vice President Mike Pence said something else that is getting scant\u00a0attention, but ought to send a chill down your spine. \u201cWhat the president of Honduras told me was organized by leftist groups in Honduras, financed by Venezuela and sent north to challenge our sovereignty and challenge our border,\u201d Pence said. This confirms what Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d reported last week. So why aren't journalists doing their jobs and vetting this horde, investigating who actually organized it and finding out who is financing it? \u00a0After all, the vice president just gave you a huge tip. Instead of running with it, the media are strangely incurious about things like the arrest of Irineo Mujica. He's the director Pueblo Sin Fronteras, and the main organizer of the caravan that stormed the border last spring. Mujica is a renowned activist with dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship who was arrested last week by Mexican authorities for allegedly attacking officials and resisting arrest when they intercepted the horde. Now, why was Mujica there in the first place? And what about Bartolo Fuentes? Guatemalan officials arrested him last week when the horde entered their country. Fuentes is a former Honduran opposition party leader and yet another immigration activist. Now, he's reportedly the main organizer of this latest invader caravan. Guatemala deported him back to Honduras and this all substantiates Vice President Pence's comment. But where are the journalists following up on this story? Who is funding Fuentes and Mujica and what are their ultimate goals? Rather than doing actual reporting, it's easier to take up the mantra of the left, embed yourself with the migrants - actually act like you are a migrant - emotionally manipulate the audience and then dismiss Trump as just a heartless fear monger. The Democrats and their pals in the media have no answers to the immigration crisis. It\u2019s funny how just a few years ago, all the top Democrats agreed with President Trump\u2019s current stance. Check out these quotes, and guess who said them: A)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked.\u201d B)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone. We simply can't afford it.\u201d C)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPeople who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who enter the U.S. legally.\u201d If you said A) Barack Obama, B) Dianne Feinstein and C) Chuck Schumer, give yourself a hand. If you thought all three quotes were from President Trump, you have been brainwashed by the liberal media. It's all up to the American people. We can either allow Democrats to continue to ignore the obvious and promote lawlessness on the border, or we can empower the president with the majority he needs to protect our country. And as for the invading horde headed our way, they must be intercepted and sent back to their countries of origin. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the real blue wave we have to worry about will be the Honduran flag mocking our lost sovereignty.

            "article_content": "Why is the wall so important? U.S. Border Patrol chief shares insight on 'Fox & Friends.' My grandfather was the first generation of our family born in the United States. His parents came to this country from Norway and became farmers, which is what my grandpa did too until the day he died. Grandpa was fiercely proud to be an American citizen. He once told me his father wouldn\u2019t teach him Norwegian because \u201cthis family is American now.\u201d Grandpa never forgot it. I haven\u2019t forgotten it either. When you come to this country, you join a family \u2013 the American family. And in America, we stick up for one another, believe in one another, fight for one another. Unfortunately, our ruling elite has given up on all that. They\u2019ve become globalists first and Americans second. If you want to see Exhibit A, look at Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who I am running against in the November election. While illegal immigrants pour across our southern border, bringing drugs and gangs and lower wages with them, McCaskill won\u2019t vote to build the President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. She won\u2019t vote to secure the border. And she lavishly praises the extremists in her party who want to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. That\u2019s bad enough. But now she is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress. Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border. With McCaskill\u2019s approach, illegal immigrants who use children as human shields would win release into the interior of this country, no questions asked. That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s lawless. That\u2019s not Missouri. But McCaskill doesn\u2019t stop there. She\u2019s also trying to prevent the government from asking Americans about citizenship on the 2020 census. She wants illegal and undocumented immigrants to count toward a state\u2019s representation in Congress, just like you and I do. If McCaskill gets her way, law-abiding Missouri citizens may well lose seats to California and other states sheltering large numbers of illegal immigrants. But maybe that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, since McCaskill has voted to protect sanctuary cities and give them federal funds. I don\u2019t know who she thinks she\u2019s representing, but it sure as heck isn\u2019t the state of Missouri. McCaskill and her globalist allies live in a fantasy world where citizenship doesn\u2019t matter and national borders are embarrassments. Their most important priorities are getting cheap labor at home and cheap products from aboard. I promise you this. I\u2019ll never apologize for protecting American citizens and I\u2019ll never shrink from defending our way of life. We need an immigration policy that works for the citizens of this country, not the global elite. That begins with securing the southern border. Enough apologies and temporizing. Build the wall. Fund the border patrol. Back ICE. You can count on me to fight for all of the above. Next, we need to reform our legal immigration system to make it work for Missouri workers. For decades now, we\u2019ve admitted millions of immigrants with few or no skills \u2013 the percentage of foreign-born is at its highest levels in nearly a century. These low-skill immigrants are competing for jobs with folks in our own country struggling to find work, while driving down wages for those who are working hardest. It\u2019s time to do right by American workers. Limit the number of low-skilled immigrants who come to this country. End the visa lottery system. End chain migration. Replace that with a skills-based immigration system that prioritizes the training and know-how we need to create new jobs in this country for our own people. My family\u2019s story is no different from that of most other people in Missouri. Missourians know that while this country has a noble heritage of welcoming strangers from many lands, we are a nation of Americans. It\u2019s time we had a senator who acts like it.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" October 23, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. As the so-called caravan continues to swell in size, we're going to ask the questions are media brethren will not. Who is funding these efforts? How has it grown so quickly and what did the Democrats have to offer besides a bunch of cliches and bromides, and of course grandstanding? All those answers tonight. Plus, after Trump declared himself a nationalist last night, the media have a case of the vapors. They are labeling him a white nationalist. And tonight, we're going to examine the disturbing trend of the left pushing race at every turn. And we will bring you more footage from Raymond Arroyo's trip to Houston, this is so funny, and what he heard from women about Kavanaugh and the midterms might actually surprise you. Plus, Steve Scalise, Tom Homan, Corey Lewandowski, all here. But first, leftists aiding and abetting an invasion. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" If you have been watching other networks, which of course you shouldn't be, well you are likely to have a very distorted view of reality when it comes to the caravan of thousands making their way to the U.S. border. The sympathetic overwrought coverage of this invading horde, you know, calling it a caravan is a misnomer and frankly sickening. The networks have dispatched teams of embedded reporters, I mean, reporters enclosed -- who are not so much covering the horde as covering for it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see trucks full of freshly cooked tortillas, and incredible sort of Christian gestures of welcoming the stranger. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As a nation in the United States, we have to choose what kind of nation we are and treat them with respect. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- up fear of the stranger is a tactic that's as old as politics. That's what makes the teachings of Christ to welcome the stranger, so radical. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Who died and turned him into Joel O'Steen? Anyway, their biggest gripe is a president suggestion that middle eastern terrorist might be part of this peace-loving group of traveling mothers and children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Take your camera, go into the middle and search. You are going to find MS-13, you're going to find middle eastern, you're going to find everything. DON LEMON, CNN HOST: He's ceasing on unsubstantiated right wing media reports that the caravan has been infiltrated by criminals and unknown middle easterners. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The reality here is, there is no specific evidence as far as we know. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Have you seen any evidence as to the president's claim there are middle easterners members of this caravan. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course not. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, it turns out the president may be privy to more information than the bright lights at CNN headquarters and their reporters are ever privy to. Tonight, the spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the caravan includes \"citizens of countries outside of central america, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the.\" And Vice President Pence said something else that is getting very little attention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT: What the president of Honduras told me was organized by leftist groups in Honduras, financed by Venezuela and sent north to challenge our sovereignty and challenge our border. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now that by the way, to toot our own horn, confirms what we reported last Friday night. Now, rather than betting with this ever- expanding horde of people surging toward the U.S. to violate the immigration laws or at least gain the system, and laboring to humanize them, all these reporters, why aren't the journalists doing their jobs and investigating who actually organized this crowd, and who is financing them? Now, the vice president just gave you a huge tip, run with it. Instead though, the media are strangely incurious about things like the arrest of Irineo Mujica. He's the director Pueblo Sin Fronteras, and the main organizer of the caravan that stormed the border last spring. Mujica is a renowned activist with dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship who you see here being arrested last week by Mexican authorities for allegedly attacking officials and resisting arrest when they intercepted the horde. Now, why was Mujica there in the first place? And what about Bartolo Fuentes? Guatemalan officials arrested him last week when the horde entered their country. Fuentes is a former Honduran opposition party leader and yet another immigration activist. Now, he's reportedly the main organizer of this latest invader caravan. Guatemala deported him back to Honduras and this all substantiates Vice President Pence's comment earlier today. But where are the journalists following up on this story? Who is funding Fuentes and Mujica? And what are their ultimate goals? Rather than doing actual reporting and digging into this, it's easier to take up the mantra of the left, embed yourself with the migrants, actually, act like you are a migrant, emotionally manipulate the audience and then dismiss Trump. It's just a heartless fearmonger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump continues stoking fears over illegal immigration. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's easy for these voices of fearmongering on the right to say, oh, look this. This is threatening all these people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see he is stoking fear and lies. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is betting on this caravan vaguely for the midterm election to get people afraid and out to the polls. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Do they all read the same sheets in the morning? (Inaudible) marching order? Who do they get them from? They are all repeating the same lines. Do you notice there is no substantive solutions being offered? It's just a pejorative against Trump. The Democrats have no answers, zero answers to the immigration crisis. So, like their media enablers, they write it off as just Trumping, you know, he's just alarm as fearmonger. But that's not an answer. And just a few years ago they actually agreed with Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF.: The day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone. We simply can't afford it. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who enter the U.S. legally. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Will the real Chuck Schumer, the real Barack Obama, the real Dianne Feinstein, step forward? Well that was the way they were then. But now they are out of power. And Democrats have immigration amnesia. There is no crisis. What's the big deal? Joe Biden telling a reporter, \"Trump's making it sound like they're breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part\" Well Joe, unless they take a hard left and go for a swim, where do you think they are headed? The president is sounding the alarm now because unlike your administration, Joe, he actually sees this looming danger and is trying to proactively shield the United States from it. The president saw what happened when the last so-called caravan swamped the border. And this current horde coupled with a number of illegals streaming across the border daily, will overwhelm the infrastructure and cause another crisis that is entirely avoidable. But still, Democrats refuse to be part of the solution. Instead, they are demagogy the issue and were unwilling to work with the president earlier this year to craft sensible legislation that might have avoided this crisis. Even when President Trump, think about this, offered amnesty to 2 million illegals in exchange for the construction of the wall and for some other common sense reforms about chain migration and so forth, the Democrats would have none of it. They didn't want to give Trump the victory. So, they ended up endangering the migrants and they ended up endangering the American people in opening this whole system up for further corruption. But now my friends, it's up to the American people. They will either allow Democrats to continue to ignore the obvious and permit rank lawlessness of the border or you the voters will empower the president with the majority he needs to protect our country. And as for the invading horde headed our way, they must be intercepted and sent back to their countries of origin. And the Justice Department should criminally and civilly prosecute if possible any NGO or individual organizing this crush on our borders. No one should be permitted to undermine our immigration laws, coach the migrants or destabilize the security and sovereignty of the United States of America, which is exactly the threat presented by this horde. Whether it's reported by the media or not, I don't care, those are the facts. If this keeps up, well, this is the only blue wave that we're going to see in November. See it? It's the blue flag of Honduras waving. We'll see that in November perhaps. And that's \"The Angle.\" All right, joining us now for reaction, James Trusty, the former DOJ prosecutor and Eileen Blessinger is an immigration attorney here in Washington, D.C. Let's start with you James. Now, as someone who has worked on these issues at DOJ, what are the possible legal avenues for prosecuting these groups that are encouraging this lawlessness, coaching the migrants and basically assembling thousands of people on false pretenses? JASMES TRUSTY, FORMER DOJ PROSECUTOR: Well, it depends on a lot of facts that I'm not totally certain on at this point, but the bottom line is, if they are organizing and financing and trying to encourage people to cross illegally, to cross outside the points of entry. It's at least arguable that there is alien smuggling and racketeering charges that could be investigated, a lot of practical difficulties with that, a lot of factual underpinnings that we don't know at this point, but that's at least an option. INGRAHAM: Well, what about James, the idea of giving instructions sheets to migrants where things are written down on pieces of paper which is, you know, obviously tantamount to coaching a witness, but it is basically the instructions for gaining entry into the United States. TRUSTY: You know, the problem ultimately it needs a political solution but the legal aspect of that is, you could argue that they are aiding and abetting false statements for immigration purposes. But actually proving up that they are encouraging false entry as opposed to entries at a point where they are lawfully turning themselves in and seeking asylum is definitely going to be a problem there. INGRAHAM: Eileen, this is what Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State said today about the current situation. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances. If you seek to come here, go through the normal refugee process. If you apply for refugee status, a permanent solution is possible in Mexico or in a third country. But I can tell you with certainty that we are determined that illegal entry to the United States from this caravan will not be possible. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Eileen, domestic violence, a fear of gang activity in your hometown or your city or even your country are not any longer valid reasons for credible fear to claim credible fear as an asylee into the United States. So, aren't this really just economic migrants, people who want to come here to work or to be with family members who are already here. How is that typically either an asylee or possibly a refugee? EILEEN BLESSINGER, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: Actually, gang violence is not necessarily not qualified for asylum. You have to -- the way you qualify for asylum is showing them someone is going to harm you for something you can't change or shouldn't have to change. A lot of these people, a lot of the migrants that were coming, the people that I've interviewed at least at the border were coming here for political reasons. So, that tied with the gang violence shows that they have a basis to come here. INGRAHAM: When you -- I'm sorry to interrupt, but when they were interviewed, many of them by media types in Guatemala, they cited, well, you know, there is no work. If anything were saying there's no work. Then by the time they get to Mexico, you start hearing the stories changing as the NGO's like Pueblo Sin Fronteras and Casa (inaudible) and all these other groups end up in groups like them. I'm just paraphrasing because a lot if these groups have the same ultimate goals. And suddenly this narrative start changing. Then it is,oh, I live in incredible fear of XY and Z. But isn't this the case that the Central American countries are themselves, many of them are corrupt, don't run their economies all that well and so people feel like, god, I can come here, just credible fear, I get here, I get my foot in and I'm at the door and they put an ankle bracelet on and I rip it off. Isn't that really what's going on here in economic migration? BLESSINGER: OK, so that's not completely what is happening, and a lot of these people do leave their ankle bracelets on. I think it's important to know that we do have a legal process in place. People can't just come here and say, I want asylum. They have to actually pass what you call the credible fear process and interview with an asylum officer that's going to show that there is at least a possibility of winning an asylum claim. INGRAHAM: The asylum process however, James, is such that you claim credible fear and ultimately if you have those recited lines down, then you are driven to a bus depot or something like it, and you are basically released into the United States. Sometimes you go to a catholic relief services shelter, it's a Lutheran Services, and then you get, you know, sent all across the United States. We have 700,000 pending immigration cases in the country. We don't have the facility to do this. We don't have the infrastructure to do this. So this is tantamount. Everyone watching this should understand, to catch and release, and these migrants are smart enough to know this. Correct, James? TRUSTY: Well, I view it as a big problem for law enforcement. The longer lines you're saying. I mean, it's such a daunting task not just in terms of resources and numbers, but to not be able to instantly know whether any individual migrant is telling you a true story or a false one. There is absolutely people that have fear of gang murders and rapes and slavery taking place in their home country. They come to our border and they could use our help. But there is also demonstratively false stories where people are coached up to say, I'm not in a gang anymore, or I'm afraid of x, y and z, where it's not true. So I look at it kind of from the lens of law enforcement. The Border Patrol people and I think this is just an impossible task for them to process all these people and figure out true from false on the fly in these kind of field interviews that they conduct and come to rationale decisions. That's why the whole system needs an overhaul. It can't possibly be just a function of fine-tuning our border patrol or the resources that they have. INGRAHAM: All right, both of you. Yes. both of you thank you so much. And this is obviously a problem that's going to continue unabated until we develop a solution, and James just referred to a congressional solutions necessary. Former ICE acting director and Fox News contributor Tom Homan is with us and Louisiana Republican congressman and House majority whip Steve Scalise. Gentleman, thank you both for being here. Tom, I want to start with you given all your expertise in this matter. What is the one thing that could be done right now to help stem this tide? TOM HOMAN, FORMMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR: Well actually there are two things. First of all, raise the asylum bar. As the attorney said, they get (inaudible) by an asylum officer, 88 percent of them pass asylum interview because they are coached on what to say. But when they get to court, if they get to court, more than 80 percent lose their case. So, we got to raise the asylum bar because the effect is too big. The second thing we do, look, if these families wanted due process, they have a right to claim asylum, there's only one way you can get to due process, Keep them in family (ph) residential center until they see a judge. Back in 2014, we first did this under Secretary J. Johnson. We kept them until they see a judge, and guess what? Eighty percent more lost their case. We put them on airplanes, send them south. The numbers (inaudible) if we show the (inaudible) and where you get your due process when a decision is made and you lose, you're going (inaudible). INGRAHAM: Congressman Scalise, we don't really have time to do anything before this midterm election. This is a national security issue and economic issue cost taxpayers billions of dollars to take all these people in, public school, health care, all of what we know. It's a health issue too because we don't know what people have coming in here. We have diseases in this country we haven't had for decades. What will congress do after the midterms to address the issue? REP. STEVE SCALISE, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Laura, I think in the next two weeks you're really going to see this debate play out because ultimately that election in two weeks will help decide it. I am really glad that President Trump is putting such a sharp focus on this. Look, I mean, when you look at these -- it's like a parade going over. These aren't asylum- seekers. I mean, you can see and you've talked about this. You've highlighted the people that are coaching them along the way so that at the beginning of this march, they are talking about coming over here looking for jobs and by the time they get closer, they are being coached about how to finally try to get in here legally even though this is not what the legal process is supposed to be like. We need to change the law. We've had two different bills on the House floor. We've got actual votes to tighten these loopholes to actually close the loopholes that are allowing this. INGRAHAM: So what's the problem? Why is it not getting traction? This is a national emergency. I would pull everyone back from midterm campaigning to deal with this frankly. That important that we have thousands of people -- SCALISE: Look at this. INGRAHAM: -- maybe most of them are unarmed or all of them are unarmed for all we know. We don't know. This is an invasion into this country and the American people are seeing this play out they're like, this is like the phone is ringing and no one is home. No one is answering the phone here. SCALISE: And that's what you're seeing President Trump saying, look, we are not going to allow this. First of all, all the Latin American countries, all of those billions of dollars of foreign aid needs to be on the table. They need to be made very clear. INGRAHAM: They are already out of the Central America. SCALISE: If you do this, this is going to be a threat to your billions of dollars that you are getting. INGRAHAM: They're gone. SCALISE: But President Trump has already made that clear. This is going to be in jeopardy. And you saw Secretary of State Pompeo saying, we are not going to let you into our country. We have to treat this as an invasion but also you have to look at this as we are a nation of laws. We have said, just play by the rules. There are rules that you can play by but they are trying to gain the system. We have got to be very clear -- INGRAHAM: Have to be changed. SCALISE: -- that these laws have to be changed, and there is going to be an election in two weeks, in just two weeks. There are people that -- look, Pelosi wants open borders. This is a real impact on Pelosi's whole idea of having open borders. President Trump has done a great job of making this an election issue because the country is going to ultimately decide. INGRAHAM: They don't want -- SCALISE: Do we want to know from a national security open borders, I'm for it, national security. They are for open borders. INGRAHAM: Tom, the groups that are facilitating this, they are co- conspirators in the gaining of the system and the mass rush on the border. What can be done? HOMAN: What you describe is absolutely aiding and abetting and helping people make an illegal entry. That is a violation of a United States code 1324 which is alien smuggling. It's a felony. So HSI need to work with the partners in Mexico, identify these people and prosecute. INGRAHAM: Gentleman, we can do a whole hour on this. Thank you so much for joining us and Congressman Scalise, we're going to have you back on this issue and so many others. I love having you both on. And after he called himself a nationalist, President Trump is getting slammed all across the board. Guess what? They are playing the race card xenophobia, all the isms and the ifs. It doesn't. We're going to tell you why when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: They have a word, it sort of became old-fashioned. It is called a nationalist. And I say really, we are not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) INGRAHAM: And that one line sent the media and Democrats into a fit of rage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is trying to do the America first thing and he's trying to lend a new vocabulary to it and now he's brought a nationalist and maybe it's a dog whistle to race as such. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are suggesting there is some kind of dog whistle there? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is. It is. It does provoke hate activity. It does provoke discrimination. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Send me a memo when we're going to retire that phrase. (Inaudible) to others even dog whistle wasn't strong enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When Donald Trump dais he's a nationalist, that is not a dog whistle, it's a fog horn to his base. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Merriam-Webster defines nationalism thusly, loyalty and devotion to a nation. In other words, loyalty and devotion to America. So where is the controversy? To examine that question let's bring in two of our favorites, Horace Cooper, senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research and Preston Mitchum, he's the chair of the Washington Bar Association Young Lawyers Division. Preston, I want to start with you. Why is the notion of loyalty and devotion to country a \"dog whistle?\" PRESTON MITCHUM, CHAIR OF WASHINGTON BAR ASSOCIATION: Laura, we already know in this country what nationalism means. We've heard it used many times. We know that extreme nationalism is what catapulted Hitler to the person that he is and that we know (inaudible) be today and, though I won't go as far to call Trump Hitler, I will say that it smells very Hitler-ish. The problem with nationalism as a concept is that not only are you attempting to say that America's better than any other country, which on a surface level is a harmless term, surface level. When we peel back the layers, when we really start to have a conversation about what nationalism means and how it's been used against people who are Muslim, people of color, other folks who may not necessarily be \"patriotic\" in this country. A lot of violence has ensued against many of those people, and that is the harm of nationalism. INGRAHAM: One question about that is when Trump is talking about nationalism of the country, the country is very diverse. I mean, we have an increasing number of Latino Americans, African-Americans, people from Asia and Pacific Islanders. We have people from all over the world. He was referring to America, which is a very large, diverse population. So, again, why -- I'm not following, you know, and then he says Hitler-ish. I mean, his daughter is Jewish, his son-in-law is Jewish. He has the strongest relationship of any modern day president to Israel. So, are you then saying like -- I don't see how that computes. Our policy was before described as two pro Israel. Now you are saying it's Hitler-ish? MITCHUM: That's (inaudible) like I'm saying because someone is married to a black person that they can't be racist. Simply because their daughter -- (INAUDIBLE) INGRAHAM: That's pretty tough. HORACE COOPER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH: \u00a0That's very hard. That would be hard. INGRAHAM: That's pretty tough. MITCHUM: Yes, absolutely. You've lived in this country longer than I have so I'm surprised you would say it's hard, that we see it -- COOPER: Wait, wait -- (CORSSTALK) INGRAHAM: All right, Horace, I want to play -- Horace, I want to play -- this is what President Trump followed up, after he heard all of the, he's Hitler, he's pulled (inaudible). He's like everyone bad who ever lived because he's a nationalist. This is what he followed up with today. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: All I want for our country is to be treated well, to be treated with respect. For many years, other countries that are allies of ours, so full of allies, they have not treated our country fairly. So that said, I'm absolutely nationalist and I'm proud of it. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: You know, I mean, so that's his latest. COOPER: This president loves this country. I watched during Hurricane Harvey when he went out and was a volunteer helping to distribute goods and services. If you watched the camera and you weren't paying attention to what the commentators were saying, what you saw was a person that liked the people that they encountered. This president is devoted to this country. Now, it's the strangest form of racism that I've ever seen that black Americans, Latino Americans and even Asian Americans have done better in this country relative to every other population. The Civil Rights Act was passed because blacks and minorities couldn't get work. Now, you've got five records of unemployment achievement for black Americans. It is the weirdest form of racism almost as weird as saying, you can be a racist while being married to a black person. MITCHUM: What does that have to do with nationalism? COOPER: He is working diligently to make it better for people who live in this country. MITHUM: Ask the people in Puerto Rico and what is he making it better for them because Puerto Rico, contrary to what many conservative -- COOPER: That's not what the government says. MITCHUM: It's part of (inaudible) of the United States. INGRAHAM: Guys, let's keep this focused. MITCHUM: -- and act like it was. INGRAHAM: OK, well, the Puerto Rican infrastructure was a disaster during eight years of Obama. It wasn't that -- it's been difficult for a long period of time. But that having been said, there's another issue I want to quickly get your take on, Andrew Gillum of course is the up-and-comer in Florida running against Ron DeSantis for the governorship. He said this on Hill T.V. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW GILLUM, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNTORIAL CANDIDATE, FLORIDA: I definitely think we are held to a different standard. And you know, I try not to spend a lot of time on what that is, rather focusing on what my contributions are and how we push past it. They don't expect much of me to begin with. They certainly didn't even expect me to be there. And now they are having to wrap their heads around what it means to have someone like me on the state and the national scene. (END VIDEO CLIP) LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Preston, how is this not playing the race card to divert attention from the FBI investigation? And the new thing is that got tickets to Hamilton and kind of lied about that. PRESTON MITCHUM, WRITER AND RACIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE: We're considering that playing the race card when Ron DeSantis called him the equivalent of a monkey and a chimpanzee? INGRAHAM: He never said that. That's a complete lie. MITCHUM: He absolutely said that. INGRAHAM: He said monkey around. Monkey business. MITCHUM: So monkeying around is different between calling somebody a chimpanzee? Laura. Laura. INGRAHAM: I have heard so many people say that phrase. And to say that that -- Ron DeSantis, if that's what you're going to try to beat Ron DeSantis -- MITCHUM: We're not being historical. Ron DeSantis -- INGRAHAM: But why do you have to argue race? Precisely. If that's the case then why argue the race card? MITCHUM: Because there's a specific impact that black people experience in this country that many people are just not believing. That is not our fault that people are not believing -- INGRAHAM: So when Barack Obama wins reelection and get the majority of white voters was that racism, too? MITCHUM: And 57 percent of white women voted for Trump, that doesn't mean. \u00a0You don't see that connection there? INGRAHAM: No, I don't. MITCHUM: That is a problem. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR OF PROJECT 21: We have a problem in this country when you can see how much progress black Americans have made. We own more houses, we have more cars, we have more income, we have more billionaires than we have ever had, ever. You cannot say it's worse. You can say that we have made substantial. Those comments deny that progress, and they imply that this country is in fact opposed to the interests of -- MITCHUM: He's running for a governorship in Florida -- COOPER: And you can't win. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Just win on the merits. And he's ahead in the polls, so why is he complaining about it? He's ahead in the polls. MITCHUM: Because that is a fact of his lived experience. INGRAHAM: OK, gentlemen, great to have you on, love the panel, as always. What Raymond Arroyo heard from women voters about Kavanaugh in the midterms might surprise you. Another debate, coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The way that Democrats use women and sexual assault to get a delay, that is a total turnoff. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No one has ever been treated like they treated him. \u00a0And it was just hard to watch. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We loved Kavanaugh. We believed what he was saying. \u00a0I hate to say it, I didn't believe her. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The lady seemed as if she was being used by politicians. And I think the Democrats, it will be their downfall. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That sounds awfully different from the narrative Democrats wanted us to believe. And that's not all. Thanks to a strong economy, labor force participation among prime age U.S. women aged 25 to 54 has actually risen to 75.2 percent from 73.3 percent three year ago. And unemployment among that group is at the lowest level since the 1950s. \u00a0Between the backlash to Kavanaugh and the great economic fortunes, should Democrats be taking the female vote for granted? Joining us now to react, Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and RNC chairwoman from California, and Sarah Badawi, a Democrat strategist and senior lobbyist for Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Sarah, I want to start with you on this. Look at these numbers, just economic numbers for women. \u00a0More women in the labor force really since the 1990s, record number of people earning a good living, wages beginning to go up, you look at the chart there, since 2000, of course at the height of the tech boom and so forth. These are just staggeringly good economic numbers for women. SARAH BADAWI: Sure. So those economic numbers are good, but having a job and being a part of the labor force is the bare minimum for women. When suburban women go home and talk to their families, they are thinking about health care. And when Mitch McConnell is on television promising to vote to repeal the ACA again, taking health care coverage away from millions of Americans, that matters. And when he promises to cut Social Security benefits for millions of seniors, that matters. INGRAHAM: When did he do that? BADAWI: Just the other day. He was saying to make up for the deficit we're going to have to cut Social Security benefits. INGRAHAM: How does the Progressive Change committee, committee for change advocate for reforming Social Security, how do you guys think we should? BADAWI: I think Democrats up and down the ticket all across the country are fighting tooth and nail in stark contrast to not only to protect Social Security, but -- INGRAHAM: You know it's not sustainable. You probably know math better than I do. I'm not very good at math, but the numbers obviously are not sustainable. You've got to make changes to Social Security at some point. \u00a0Nobody wants to. BADAWI: Actually I think it's perfectly sustainable because what you'd do is you just raise the cap on income tax so people can see the solvency of the Social Security fund for generations to come. But regardless, I think what we are seeing is a stark contrast between what one party is offering and the other -- INGRAHAM: You guys, the left, Harmeet, cares about really a couple issues. \u00a0Health care, definitely they are pushing the health care issue. But I pay for my own health care. It's gone up I think 60 percent since Obamacare. \u00a0And that was when you pay for your own as a small business owner. So I had health expenses before Obamacare but it's like through the roof. It's like a joke. It's a complete joke. That was after Obama. So with that, what is it with the suburban female voter, though? Is it uncomfortable with the tonality of some of what they are hearing in the Trump administration? \u00a0Because the economic news is great, and some of these other issues, they don't seem like they are bubbling up to the surface as they would normally like in a presidential election. HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: I just heard Democrats want to raise taxes. \u00a0Raising taxes is the solution to every problem. But I think women are more complex than that. And I think that for each of these women who like to have a job, some of them also like to have the choice of working at home and being moms, and that's a perfectly legitimate choice. And they want their husbands and their want their families and they want their kids to have futures that are bright and have a lot of opportunity. So these numbers are coupled with amazing opportunities for Americans. And we saw the lead of the story about how women reacted negatively to the caricature of them as only caring about one side of an issue. We care about all sides of the issue. We own businesses. We provide for our employees. We don't like paying taxes, and we like to have a bright future. So I think Democrats are taking us for granted as a cookie-cutter approach. INGRAHAM: And I think that one of the interesting things I think you saw when Raymond was interviewing all these people, and it's a self-selecting group, people that go to a Trump rally. But I've noticed this with folks who are not all that political. The ability to separate some of the tweets they might not like from the president and the way America is, outside of the bubble of metropolitan areas where everyone is attacking each other in restaurants, most people just want to go home and live their lives. And they have more money in their pocket. They are able to go on vacation. \u00a0And they feel more optimistic about the future. That's not a FOX News poll, though those are great polls. These are polls that are Pew Gallup, people are more confident about the future, women and men. And you can't say it's nothing to do with Trump. It's something to do with Trump. He is the guy who is in charge, and if it were going badly, Democrats would be saying, it's horrible, and Trump is a reason. BADAWI: That maybe true for some women, but I think the electorate of women engaging with this midterm election is going to be completely different than what we saw in 2016, especially in the suburbs. They're more diverse that ever, they're younger than ever. INGRAHAM: What do they want? Tell me what they want that they are not getting in the greatest economy that I have ever experienced in my lifetime, and I'm a lot older than you. BADAWI: I think some people just look at the landscape of politics, and they are appalled by what they are seeing. And some are going to vote that moral conscience. INGRAHAM: What specifically are they appalled by? BADAWI: I think seeing the majority party try to strip health care from millions of people, to try to cut earned benefits for seniors, not doing anything about the rising costs for drug. But I think something that is really important here -- INGRAHAM: They're doing more for drug prices than Obama ever did. Leave the politics out of it. I'm not a big -- BADAWI: \u00a0We see it in the way suburban women are turning out in record numbers in special elections. Suburban women -- INGRAHAM: Won the two Democrat districts in their special election. BADAWI: \u00a0Doug Jones, historically from a red state -- I'm happy to see Democrats pick up seats. INGRAHAM: Doug Jones is going to lose the next election. BADAWI: \u00a0Same thing with Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania. We also saw Ralph Northam. All of these people in historically red and purple places being carried into office by energized suburban women voters. DHILLON: You know what women don't like? They don't like to hear things like Kyrsten Sinema say that women who stay home are bloodthirsty leeches. \u00a0And so we don't like caricatures, and that's what the Democrats are painting us as. BADAWI: I'm a Democrat and I don't agree with that either. DHILLON: You just said we're all single issue voters which we aren't. (CROSSTALK) BADAWI: Retirement security, health care, it's many different issues that come at it from a variety -- DHILLON: You actually assumed that because this political system is going on that everyone is going to vote a single way, and they aren't, and we are seeing that. And the women I know, the women who work in the professional world, the women who own businesses, and the women who want futures for their kids, they are looking at the whole panoply, and they're saying I like having more money in my pocket. I like having choices in my health care, and I like my government not going bankrupt because of dumb Social Security policies. BADAWI: Or tax policy. INGRAHAM: Guys, this is such a great -- can I say guys? Is that even allowed? I never know what to say. BADAWI: I'm OK with it. INGRAHAM: Ladies, what do you say, people, existence, whatever. DHILLON: Persons. INGRAHAM: Great to have you both on. Thanks so much. And Corey Lewandowski is here to react to the latest leftist mob tactic, and the caravan, his first reaction to stories of some physical altercation between himself and White House chief of staff John Kelly. Stay right there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: If you thought the aggressive tactics of the left were going to die down after the Kavanaugh confirmation, well, think again. Congressman Kevin McCarthy's California office was vandalized. Someone threw a boulder through his window, that very subtle, and robbed the office on Saturday. \u00a0And this was right after Mitch McConnell was heckled by \"ditch Mitch\" protester while having dinner with his wife in Kentucky. The attacker threw McConnell's food out the door. Oh, my goodness. Chuck Schumer only pointed out the vandalism, of course, in McCarthy's office, but they only noted that a pipe bomb was found, or something resembling a pipe bomb was found in George Soros' mailbox. Corey Lewandowski, co-author of the new book, \"Trump's Enemies,\" and former Trump campaign manager joins us here in the studio. Corey, it feels a lot like -- we say this a lot, but why are these confrontations going so crazy out there? COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Because you've got people like Eric Holder saying when they are down, make sure you kick them. \u00a0You've got people like Maxine Waters calling for incivility. You're making sure that people who are working in government service, whether it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders at a restaurant, Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, or others, Ted Cruz, are being asked to leave restaurants by these mobs that are being encouraged by the Democrats and the left because they have no message for where they want to take the country. Their only message is incivility and chaos and bedlam, and that doesn't play well in the midterm elections. INGRAHAM: In Morning Joe, that's what my name for them is, they were on today, basically saying whatever was found in the mailbox is Trump's fault. \u00a0Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: We heard the name George Soros brought up by the president of the United States. We've heard the name George Soros brought up by backbenchers in the Republican Congress, blaming him for funding these caravans, blaming him for funding one fake conspiracy after another. We've got to point the finger back to the president and these Republican members of Congress that have just been spreading these conspiracy theories that have anti-Semitic overtones to them towards George Soros. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I don't even know if George Soros is Jewish. I have no idea. \u00a0But the idea that this president with the closest relationship, I said this earlier, with Israel, Jared, Ivanka, I don't get that line of argument at all, but that's where they are. LEWANDOWSKI: He literally has a daughter that is Jewish. I would not call that anti-Semitic. You can't become more the antithesis of anti-Semitic when your own daughter -- INGRAHAM: Bibi Netanyahu. LEWANDOWSKI: And you grandchildren are Jewish, by the way. But on top of that, right, what Joe doesn't want to talk about, what the left doesn't want to talk about is the guest you had on earlier tonight, Steve Scalise, a man who has actually assaulted, attacked, almost murdered in cold blood by a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter, a self-proclaimed Bernie Sanders socialist who wanted to go and kill Republicans. That is what the real crimes are. That's what the left is perpetrating here. But the mainstream media, that doesn't fit their narrative. INGRAHAM: All right, Corey, just because we love you, this was the montage that the media was running with today about you and John Kelly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: As breaking news goes, this is certainly something. An argument between Chief of Staff John Kelly and former senior campaign official Corey Lewandowski turned physical. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: CNN has learned White House chief of staff John Kelly and President Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski got into a heated argument in the West Wing, this back in February. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Chief of Staff John Kelly grabbed former senior campaign official Corey Lewandowski by the caller. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: What happened? LEWANDOWSKI: I'm a senior campaign official. I thought I ran the campaign. Can't I get a little credit from CNN at least? Just a campaign manager may be the right thing. I can't even get the credit. INGRAHAM: What happened? LEWANDOWSKI: John and I have a great relationship. We are both on the Trump-Pence agenda, and that's where it was. What may or may not have taken place ten months ago, eight months ago, is completely irrelevant to where we are today. This is a story that no one talked about because it wasn't a big deal INGRAHAM: A near brawl, it's a near brawl. LEWANDOWSKI: It didn't come to a near brawl by any stretch of the imagination. INGRAHAM: What was it about. LEWANDOWSKI: John and I have had very passionate views about making sure the president's team was ready for the midterm elections. This has now gone on, and I've been very candid that early in the administration, I wanted to make sure they were ready for what is about to transpire in two weeks. And we've come to the resolution that he's got a great team. We're all on the same team, and that's the Trump-Pence agenda. INGRAHAM: Kelly's chief of staff, things are going pretty well. The president is up at 47 percent approval. People are in a great mood. It looks like we're maybe turning about some of these more difficult elements in the midterm election cycle. You know what I said, we come from an ethnic family. If you are not fighting, you are not getting anything done. \u00a0I'm sorry, I thought this was a big snore. It made it more interesting for me. LEWANDOWSKI: It's amazing, John and I are both from Boston, just north of Boston. We're both guys who are very passionate. And the bottom line is, we are moving somewhere and we're going to set a historic precedent where we're actually going to gain seats in the Senate, hold the House majority. \u00a0That's because of the leadership of the Trump-Pence team. INGRAHAM: I wouldn't want to wrestle neither of you. You are both very strong. I want no part of it, but you could do something for charity. I would turn this into a charity thing. Corey, it's always great to see you. \u00a0Thanks so much. LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you. And Cory Booker, we are going to get into that tonight. John James, why isn't he a household names? While the media obsesses over Democratic challengers like Beto O'Rourke, we'll ask James why he thinks the media -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you, too. Thank you all. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're a rock star. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. No, it's just so many great people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Really you are. You can't go anywhere -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's really gotten kind of a rock star reception last night in Des Moines. You could really feel that electricity among about 500 people who showed up to see her. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Media types gushing about Democratic rock stars just in the last 24 hours. I kid you not. Let's play a little game. Republican John James has closed the gap to seven points in his challenge against Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow. Beto O'Rourke likewise trails by seven in his race to unseat Ted Cruz. But according to Google news, a Beto O'Rourke search 2.68 million results. John James, 82,100. Here to react, Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, John James. John it's great to see you, as always. Any guesses as to why you're not the subject of these glowing media profiles? Because a lot of people out there I've talked to do think you are a rock star, by the way. JOHN JAMES, R-MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: Well, I'm not a rock star. I'm just a servant. But I can guess that the liberal media is dealing with me the way they deal with a lot of issues. They're ignoring them and hoping they will go away. Well, they can't ignore me and I won't go away just like the issues that are facing Michigan that Debbie Stabenow has ignored for decades. We are surging in the polls. We went from 23 to 18 to nine, and now seven. We outraised Debbie Stabenow by double last quarter. And we just had a rally last week that got 4,000 people when Bernie Sanders struggled to get 1,000 last week. We really love the momentum, and if you'd like to learn please go to JohnJamesforsenate.com. We'd love to have you on board. INGRAHAM: This is a big deal. Stabenow is a fixture in Washington. She's part of the swamp. And you represent something, again, that the American media don't want to recognize, a conservative African-American. And when we come back, we're going to talk about what's happening in another state that I want your reaction on. This is Andrew Gillum's incendiary comments earlier today that African-American politicians, namely liberal, are treated differently. John James will stay with us. When we come back, we'll address that. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Your reaction to Andrew Gillum's comments I just mentioned that black politicians are treated to a different standard. John? JAMES: My father was raised in the Jim Crow south, and he taught me to never make excuses and to do everything that I could to excel. That's why I made it to West Point, deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and brought all my men back home as a Ranger qualified Apache pilot, and grew my family business. I believe in a red, white, and blue message, not white or black message. And that's why my message is resonating, because we're all Americans and we need to push past the identity politics, make sure we bring people together. And -- yes. INGRAHAM: John James, Michigan voters are watching tonight. I really appreciate you're joining us and thank you for your service to this great nation. And coming up next, of course, the great Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team have another phenomenal show and I can't wait to get home to watch the whole thing.

            "article_content": "Residents to weigh in on nation's oldest sanctuary law; Dan Springer reports on the controversy surrounding the policy. Voters in Oregon are about to weigh in on one of the most controversial topics of our time. Should the local government provide sanctuary to immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally? Ballot Measure 105 would repeal the country\u2019s oldest sanctuary state law, passed almost unanimously in Oregon in 1987. It bars local police from using resources to enforce immigration law. Oregonians for Immigration Reform is spearheading the repeal effort. Leaders say it is policies like this that encourage the caravan of Central Americans making its way through Mexico to the U.S. border. \u201cOregon has laid out the welcome mat for people to come into our country illegally,\u201d said Cynthia Kendoll, President of OIR. \u201cOn one hand we say, \u2018don\u2019t try to cross our border,\u2019 on the other hand we say, \u2018if you get here, we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d According to the Center for Immigration Studies, there are 300 sanctuary city jurisdictions, including seven states. Immigrant rights groups working to defeat the repeal of Oregon\u2019s law are trying to keep the focus local and not on caravans, President Trump or the border wall. \u201cThis ballot measure is about Oregon, our Oregon values of fairness and how we treat each other,\u201d said Andrea Williams, executive director of Causa and leader of the No on Measure 105 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s also about a law that we passed 31 years ago that has been working really well for us.\u201d But 16 sheriffs from across Oregon say the law is not working. Citing safety and respect for the law, they signed a letter supporting a repeal of the law. Among the examples they point to is Sergio Martinez, an illegal immigrant convicted of sexually assaulting two women in Portland last year and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Citing safety and respect for the law, 16 sheriffs signed a letter supporting a repeal of the law. Among the examples they point to is Sergio Martinez, an illegal immigrant convicted of sexually assaulting two women in Portland last year and sentenced to 35 years in prison. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Keith Gardner) Just days before the attack, Martinez was in the Multnomah County Jail. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents requested a detainer until they could get him. But citing the sanctuary law, Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese ignored the detainer request and released Martinez, even though he had already been deported 13 times. Fellow sheriffs in Oregon and the Western States Sheriff\u2019s Association say that\u2019s wrong. \u201cWhen people have committed a crime, and they\u2019re being hidden and released back into society and they do more crimes, I think that\u2019s the worst thing you could possibly do,\u201d said Morrow County Sheriff Ken Matlack. The feeling, however, is not universal among law enforcement. Retired Hillsboro Police Chief Ron Louie, said immigrants will be less likely to report crimes or come forward as witnesses if the sanctuary law is repealed. \u201cThe community itself has a higher level of trust under the current law and I believe trust will be eroded under Measure 105, because, if anything, the perception of fear,\u201d Louie said. FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, estimates there are 146,000 illegal immigrants living in Oregon, costing state taxpayers $1.22 billion in 2017. \u00a0While Oregon is a blue state when it comes to statewide elected officeholders, voters have recently repealed special rights for undocumented immigrants. In 2014, voters repealed a law that provided a driver\u2019s permit to illegal immigrants, by a 66-34 margin.",

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" August 29, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to Hannity. All right. We start tonight -- you're an American citizen, you live in America. I don't care what your political party is, you need to pay attention. What we're going to tell you is beyond outrageous. Our worst fears were confirmed. The extreme level of corruption at the highest levels of our federal bureaucracy is now exposed. It is a very ugly picture. It's not a pretty picture. FISA abuse, fraud nepotism, real Russia collusion with a seedy ex-foreign spy, all in an effort to destroy and stop Donald Trump. Coming up, we're going to show you the shocking new revelations from Bruce Ohr's explosive congressional testimony. We'll also bring you a new report about Ohr's wife Nellie whose sketchy work with Fusion GPS is front and center in this ongoing investigation into the deep state. Plus, John Solomon out with a brand new story tonight. It uncovers damning flaws in Mueller's case against that one time Trump aide, volunteer George Papadopoulos. And tonight there's only days to go until the most important midterm election in our lifetime. We will explore the Democratic Party's hard turn to the left as gubernatorial candidates in two states now we're calling for universal health care, open borders and a tax rate that'll make your stomach turn. We'll also bring you very good news again from our booming economy. We'll expose the latest example of the media's sickening anti-Trump bias, especially fake news CNN and stay tuned Florida gubernatorial winner from last night Republican Ron DeSantis, he will join us to respond to a controversy surrounding comments he made right here on this channel earlier today. Buckle up. Time for our breaking news, jam-packed opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. Yesterday's testimony from Bruce Ohr blew the lid off the deep state's attempt to cover up their rampant corruption. Now thanks to Mr. Ohr, Gregg Jarrett's stellar reporting and other important deep state investigations, we now can tell you the following: First, in 2016, ex-foreign spy Christopher Steele was being paid by both the Clinton campaign as op research for Fusion GPS, with funneled money through a law firm and he was being paid by the FBI. In fact, Steele was paid times by your FBI in the lead-up to the 2016 election. In other words, the Clinton campaign, the DNC, Christopher Steele, the FBI were all working on one team. Now, we also know that Steele was fired by the FBI in November of 2016 for lying and leaking to the press. Third, we know the FBI then broke its own rules their own protocol and continued collecting evidence from Steele using the fourth highest ranking member of the Justice Department, Bruce Ohr, as a back-channel. And four, we know Bruce Ohr had been in close contact with Christopher Steele and Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, oh she worked with Steele on the dirty Russian dossier that Hillary and company were paying for. The Ohr's were literally making money producing the anti-Trump dossier, all while passing its contents on to the FBI even after, of course, Christopher Steele was fired. And, of course, officially disclosing their blatant conflicts of interests, well, only to the FBI but not where he worked at the Department of Justice. Fifth, Bruce Ohr and the FBI knew that the contents of this dossier were unverified and by the way based on my sources they even said Bruce Ohr admitted it could be never used in a court of law but it was used for FISA warrants they also knew Christopher Steele was hell-bent as we pointed out last night on taking President Trump, candidate Trump down. And Bruce Ohr even documented that Steele was quote desperate that Donald Trump not get elected, was passionate about him not being president. And, sixth, despite Steele's obvious bias and his lies in his dossier that was bought and paid for by Clinton, the DNC and the FBI -- well, the FBI still use the information as the basis for its Trump Russia collusion investigation and they used it to commit a fraud on the FISA courts in their applications not one time but four times, and they never disclosed the true nature of the evidence to federal judges and who paid for it. They lie to these judges. It is a crime to commit a fraud against the court, and lie to a judge. It's the kind of abuse of power corruption frankly that goes on in banana republics. This is not supposed to happen ever in our constitutional republic in the United States of America. And believe it or not, Bruce Ohr although twice demoted he's still working for the DOJ. Jeff Sessions, you're in charge, where are you? And today, the president tweeted this out, quote: How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful. Witch-hunt. He's right. Now, Congressman Jordan of Ohio also weighed in earlier tonight. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Why did Glen Simpson and Christopher Steele pick Bruce Ohr in the first place why did they select his wife to come work for Fusion? They had a direct access -- Chris Steele had direct access to the FBI. He was handing them parts of the dossier. Why did they also want to run it through Bruce Ohr at the Justice Department? MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST, \"THE STORY\": Good questions. JORDAN: It seems to me to create weight and credibility behind a document that was completely false. If you can now go tell the press and tell other people, oh, a senior Department of Justice official is also talking about the dossier and also passing it on to the FBI, it gives it weight when in fact it was completely a uncredible, unverified document and a bunch of garbage. MACCALLUM: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: There are some people in Washington, they get it. Now, of course, the Ohr-Steele text, they now make perfect sense. Remember, Christopher Steele often expressed concern to Bruce Ohr, he didn't want to be exposed. He was hoping those firewalls held. Now, we know it and, by the way, it should rock every single American -- forget your politics -- to their core. And meanwhile, Robert Mueller, he couldn't care less about the real corruption and collusion that we just showed you. And, by the way, Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele were trying to funnel what he knew or lies to Robert Mueller, instead to focus now on - - let's see, taxicab medallions, loan applications, tax returns from years gone by and lying to investigators and we have an update on that. It's just pathetic. And tonight, John Solomon out with a breaking news report it raises serious concerns about one facet of Mueller's witch-hunt. And according to Solomon, who will join us, Mueller's case against one-time Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos probably completely bogus. The special counsel has been claiming they want this kid that spent six months in jail, saying Papadopoulos lied about the sinister details surrounding a meeting with a European professor that he knew. They claimed Papadopoulos was looking for information on Hillary's hacked emails, but according to Solomon's report -- well, the professor that they reached out to that also wrote them and confirmed what he said to the FBI read, quote, repeatedly insisted that his contacts with George Papadopoulos were innocuous. And Solomon writes, quote, he went out of his way to tell the FBI there was no talk of sinister cybersecurity intentions such as a plot to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. As we have previously reported, Papadopoulos is considering withdrawing his guilty plea. We did reach out to Papadopoulos, the FBI, the special counsel and, of course, we don't get comments, although I think George Papadopoulos' wife is right. Solomon will have a full report, a damning new report tonight. All right. But, first, we're 69 days away from what I'm telling you is the most important midterm election in our lifetime. Look at the side of your screen. We have long warns you what the Democrats will do if they regain power. It is a scary picture and this is especially true for two states. One, California, which has now become so liberal, it's pretty much now almost a one-party socialist state and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom who wants to be president one day looks so poised to become the next governor. This is a disaster for the people of California that pay a state income tax of thirteen and a half percent. Now, if Newsom wins, voters are going to get a super-sized helping of radical left-wing agenda including, of course, Medicare for all. And under Gavin Newsom, statewide single-payer health care system, the state, they're not only going to cover the citizens of California, no, they were going to cover the all of the states the only 3 million illegal immigrants, a lot of people's health care to pay for, for free. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Plan to get single-payer passed? GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: It needs to be pulled into the governor's office, the executive needs to lead it. Obamacare would not have happened, it was just exclusively a legislative fiat. That said, Nancy Pelosi did a magical job of organizing it, but it required the concerted contributions in the present United States. I'm not naive about it. I did universal health care when I was mayor, fully implemented regardless of pre-existing condition, ability pay, and regardless your immigration status. San Francisco was the only universal health care plan for all undocumented residents in America. I'm very proud of that, and we proved it can be done without bankrupting in the city. I'd like to see that we can -- (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, by some estimates, that radical plan, it could cost taxpayers, get this, over $400 billion, including tens of millions of dollars for the sanctuary states massive influx of illegal immigrants. It means, on average, each Californian would be on the hook for at least at least $10,000, in new taxes each year and that's assuming the thirteen and a half percent income tax stays where it is. And meanwhile in Florida, we now have a race between Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, he'll join us in a few minutes, and the Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. Gillum, a far left candidate, was endorsed by the socialist Bernie Sanders. He's ready and willing to implement his extreme agenda to every corner of the great state of Florida, the Sunshine State. Now, his platform includes abolishing ICE, supporting sanctuary cities, raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour, a steep corporate tax increase may be as high as 40 percent, universal health care for all, increased gun restrictions, increased funding for Planned Parenthood. If you live in Florida -- take note -- this man is ready to raise your taxes through the roof, and literally restrict your Second Amendment rights, punish small and large businesses around every turn, in pursuit of what is now the Democratic Party. This socialist, mythical utopia. Now, sadly, moderate Democrats are a thing of the past. They were driven out a long time ago. Ask Joe Lieberman. This is now the party of Nancy Pelosi and Chuckie Schumer and Maxine Waters and Bernie Sanders. It is a far left, unapologetic socialist party. They want your crumbs back. They want open borders, and they want most of all to impeach the president and keep Obamacare. But tonight, the only group hoping for Trump's impeachment more than the Democrats might actually be the corrupt destroy Trump so-called mainstream media. Yesterday, we called out CNN for standing by what is a faulty story about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Now, remember the breathless reporting from fake news CNN. It's all not true back in July. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: We have a Cuomo primetime exclusive tonight. A claim that goes to the truth of what the president knew and when he knew about an event that is central to this special counsel's Russia investigation. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN REPORTER: Tonight, sources with knowledge tell myself and Carl that Michael Cohen claims that then-candidate Donald Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton. CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN ANALYST: It's very, very significant because the president has denied any foreknowledge of this event, in this meeting, goes to the question of intent to collude. BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST: You've been saying for a year that we need to follow the money, follow the lies, and figure out this cover-up. So, how did you do it in this case? Talk to us about how you got this reporting. BERNSTEIN: Well, I talked to sources. (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: All right. We now know that a source for that report, the main source, was Michael Cohen's attorney, our old friend Lanny Davis, who backpedaled and reversed this story, making all the reporting that you just saw fake news at its worst. And it's just the latest of what is a long list of shady anti-Trump reporting from CNN, the s-hole network, the Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy network, the impeach, impeach, impeach network, the Russian, Russian, Russian network. And still, CNN, they just remain defiant, even taking a shot at the president on Twitter. Oh so much for objectivity. Make no mistake -- they try to lecture the president -- CNN does not lie. Really? We report the news, we were report it when people in power tell lies. CNN stands by our own reporting and our reporters. There may be many fools in this story but Carl Bernstein is not one of them. Yes, actually it is. And CNN wonders why crowds of Americans have singled them out, CNN sucks. They say it, they chant it, they scream it and the network still can't even admit when they get something wrong. And by the way think about -- well, they think this about the network. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AUDIENCE: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I had all night. I can play all the different montages. But we've got other news to cover today. But despite CNN's long history of abusively biased, flawed reporting, the 2016 Trump Tower story was literally cheerfully picked up, repackaged by every news network back in July, except most of them at least admitted they were wrong. According to NewsBuster's, while ABC, CBS, NBC, they spent 39 minutes hyping that CNN story. As of last night they completely ignored the Lanny Davis reversal on air. And while fake news CNN and others almost exclusively push aggressive anti-Trump coverage, we're going to show you the full picture which includes an economy that is literally breaking records. Remember, they were the Clinton news network. They loved Obama. They hated Bush. Now, they really hate Trump. So, today, we learned that the second quarter GDP growth which we were really happy about, well, it actually was revised upward to 4.2 percent and we can now report that American job satisfaction is now ranking the highest it has been since 2005. Add to that, yesterday's consumer confidence number, currently at an 18-year-high. Plus, more jobs than people that are on unemployment, a record-setting stock market, historic low levels of unemployment in 14 states, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, 15-year low, and so much more. Thankfully, because the forgotten men and women in this country, they deserve it.  The American economy is booming. Tat's what our upcoming elections in 69 days need to be about. That's what the media should be reporting. And the state of our country, by the way, is strong. And the president has literally changed things around. We're now heading in a much better direction. All right. We have a lot of ground to cover tonight but, first, with his breaking news story from The Hill, John Solomon, and the author of the upcoming book, \"The Deep State: How An Army of Bureaucrats Protected Barack Obama and Are Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda\", Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, and good friend of the program, former assistant U.S. attorney, Victoria Toensing. Well, I have to admit has done work for me in the past and she, like Joe diGenova, came in my Christmas party. But she is a killer, tough attorney. Hello, Victoria. Let's start with you, John. VICTORIA TOENSING, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Hello, Sean. HANNITY: This is -- let's go into the story because this is a follow-up to yesterday's story and I really what this professor told the FBI about poor George Papadopoulos and Robert Mueller wants this campaign you know unpaid aide to go to jail for six years. JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: Yes. HANNITY: You say in the piece, you don't condone lying, but the professor is clear he was never involved in anything nefarious at all, but it seems Mueller ignored it. Why? SOLOMON: This is so essential because if you remember, Sean, we've been talking about the dossier and peeled on that layers back and showing what a flawed document that was. But the FBI couldn't have got to the dossier if they didn't open a predicated file and they open it a predicated file against the Trump campaign based on Australian Ambassador Downer claiming he heard Papadopoulos bragging about foreknowledge of the Hillary Clinton email leaks, right? That's what they opened the case on. We now know that the man who allegedly gave that information, who set Papadopoulos up with his Russian contacts who did all these things, told the FBI in February 2017 there was no funny business going on. We spent our time talking about ways to facilitate peace, to talk about diplomacy, we didn't talk about cybersecurity, i.e., hacking. He completely waived them off the entire sinister notion that Bob Mueller puts in his indictment when he charges George Papadopoulos, and even in the prison recommendation document he filed this week. They make it look like Papadopoulos lied because there was some big sinister plot between this professor, Russia and Papadopoulos. And this professor voluntarily told the FBI none of that went on. It was about world peace, about diplomacy, a bunch of academics talking. This has been hyped into something it is clearly not. And I have another important point to make -- the FBI opened that allegation on July 31st, 2016. Apparently, it wasn't very important because they don't interview Mifsud until February. I have a very strong informed theory that something happened very early on to the allegation about Papadopoulos. I believe the FBI found out it was a nothingburger and they kicked it to the sidelines until February and now, we've made it into something much bigger than it is. My reporting is clearly pointing in that direction. HANNITY: And this is sad. You're going to do this to this kid and no wonder, his wife is fighting every night to save him and pull out of that plea deal. Victoria, let me go to that and add to that all the information we have about Bruce Ohr and his testimony yesterday. Robert Mueller never called him. That's pretty interesting to me. All the contacts, he was the conduit for the FBI and Christopher Steele. They're trying to funnel even that phony dossier to Robert Mueller himself. He's worried about being exposed. He's hoping that firewalls hold, and I'm thinking 70 contacts, 60-some-odd pages of text and emails and private meetings. Why is he still have a job? TOENSING: Well, I don't know why he still has a job. You know, that's -- he shouldn't and he should be out of there yesterday. But, Sean, I'm much more interested in the fact that John Huber -- remember, John Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah who Jeff Sessions told the members of Congress calling for a special counsel, hey, no problem, I've got Huber in here, the U.S. attorney from Utah, and he's going to take care of everything. In fact, the words they use for he's really going to evaluate everything. Now, what were the two issues amongst of several that he was supposed -- he Huber was supposed to be looking at, this career prosecutor, an Obama holdover, by the way? He was supposed to be looking at the surveillance of Carter Page and, Sean, Uranium One, Uranium One. Now, let me tell you, nine months later, has Doug Campbell, my client in Uranium One, been contacted by Huber? No. Now -- HANNITY: That's amazing. TOENSING: Now, I'm also upset that neither Nellie Ohr or Bruce Ohr were contacted by Huber. How can you even do? They -- we used to do investigations when I was a Justice Department official. They're calling it an evaluation, I don't even know what that is, it's like a matter. But they were supposed to do a full-fledged evaluation to placate these members of Congress and they haven't even interviewed Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, or my client about these two issues. HANNITY: Unbelievable. And, Congressman, you know, you were the forefront of this, even subpoenaing documents well before you left Congress. People don't even remember you as a congressman. With all due respect, you've remembered more fulfilling in for Ingraham. I'm kidding, of course, and this show. But in all seriousness, you know, does the president now have to step in and get all this material unredacted, 302s, FISA warrant applications and everything in between now that we know what happened? JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, the president is going to have to do that because Attorney General Sessions is there in name only. He's not doing anything. He should have never recused himself in what, you know, is a counterintelligence operation. It was not a criminal investigation, we've been through that. But there's no reason why the attorney general can't step up and make sure that Rod Rosenstein recuses himself from the investigation. His name's on that FISA document. He shouldn't be overseeing this investigation. But he should also be insisting and making sure that the congressional subpoenas are fulfilled. And when it comes to making sure that people in these high positions at the FBI are held accountable, you can take away their security clearances. I know you have to go through the Office of Professional Responsibility, but unilaterally, Director Wray and others can revoke a security clearance and if you do so, you don't have a security clearance you don't have a job. You don't have a job. HANNITY: John, you and Victoria, the last word tonight -- John. SOLOMON: Yes, listen, I think that we are beginning to peel back another onion. The origins of this case start with George Papadopoulos. If it turns out that was a bogus story, that there was nothing sinister going on the entire origin of this case is gone, and the obligation of the FBI would have been to shut its predicates down, not pivot to Christopher Steel and go look for other dirt. HANNITY: Victoria? SOLOMON: There's something that doesn't smell right here. TOENSING: Sean, it's a legal matter -- HANNITY: You're one of my attorneys, if I lied to a FISA court or committed a fraud on a court, what would happen? TOENSING: I'd have to protect you again. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: Last word for you. TOENSING: I want to say that that Mueller lied to the court by saying that that Stephanopoulos or Papadopoulos gave him a problem -- gave him a problem in doing the investigation. That was an absolute lie to the court. Reminds me of Patrick Fitzgerald doing it to Scooter Libby, saying that he didn't know -- couldn't do the investigation because Scooter didn't tell the truth. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: This was a conscious omission. This is what conscious lies. They knew better. All right. Thank you all. We appreciate it. On this breaking news night, Kristen Fisher has a live report from our nation's capital. Sara Carter, Greg Jarrett, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Kellyanne Conway, busy news night. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Yesterday, disgraced DOJ official Bruce Ohr was grilled on Capitol Hill over his connection to former British spy Christopher Steele and the anti-Trump Clinton funded dossier. Joining us now live from Washington with much more is our own Kristin Fisher tonight. Kristin, what's the latest? KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sean, House Republicans say that yesterday's testimony only heightened their concerns that federal authorities abuse surveillance powers during the 2016 election. They say Bruce Ohr who's still a high ranking official at the Justice Department told his contacts at the FBI that there were credibility issues with the trunk dossier and its author, former British spy Christopher Steele. And yet, when it came time to obtain a surveillance warrant on an aide with the Trump campaign, Carter Page, House Republicans say the FBI did not include those issues on the application. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIK) REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS CHAIRMAN: Not only did the FBI know that the dossier was unverified, but they also knew that there was real credibility issues because of the inherent way that it was collected and the bias that was associated with that. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER: Now Democratic lawmakers have said that this is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the special counsel's investigation, but Democratic lawmakers did not attend yesterday's hearing. The House is in recess. So, they sent their staffers instead -- Sean. HANNITY: All right. Kristin Fisher in Washington tonight, thank you. And with more reaction, the author three weeks in a row, the number one \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", if you haven't read it, it's a must read, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and FOX News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter. Thank you both for being with us. Sara, let's start with the news portion of this discussion. You've got new information as it relates to what actually happened. Turns out our reporting was accurate, and more, Bruce Ohr never went before Mueller with all of this information we now have? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He never went before Mueller and he never went before John Huber. I mean, Sean, this is incredible information. So, what we know now is that nobody has questioned Bruce Ohr. What we do know is that Congress is now going to call on Nellie Ohr to testify behind closed doors. They want -- HANNITY: Why behind closed doors? When do we get these transcripts? CARTER: Well, we're hoping that the transcripts will be available after Labor Day, that's what we're hearing. It's not certain, but hopefully sometime after Labor Day, those transcripts would be made available. But look, they want to talk to Nellie Ohr, they want to talk to Andrew McCabe. They want to talk to Peter Strzok and other who were close to Bruce Ohr particularly Lisa Page who had told them that she had a very low-key relationship with Bruce Ohr. In fact, she downplayed it. So now they realize that that wasn't the case so they want to go back to her. HANNITY: Let me go to you, Gregg Jarrett, let's talk a little bit about the Papadopoulos story we discussed. This is something you have focused extensive on both in the book and on the show. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: That's right. I argue that it was never Papadopoulos bar talk that triggered the Trump and Russian collusion investigation. That was a clever cover by the FBI because they got caught. I mean, think about it. A professor tells Papadopoulos that he has information from Russia about Hillary Clinton. Where is the crime in that? There is no crime. There have to be, according to FBI guidelines, specific articulable facts of a potential crime. There is none there. What happened is the FBI got caught. They used a phony dossier from a liar to launch the investigation. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But Gregg, they're putting-- JARRETT: They huddled this story to the New York Times to deflect from the dossier that they had illegally used. HANNITY: And the things that is so interesting in all of this is that, if you look at the conversations with Bruce Ohr, what, the 60 somewhat pages of text message and e-mails and you know, all these contacts over 70 of them, they were already discussing feeding what they knew were lies to Robert Mueller. In other words, Steele couldn't give up his dossier. He was afraid of getting caught, or his words, exposed and he's afraid that the walls come tumbling down, the fire walls. But they were still pushing it hard to Mueller. I want to know if they got to Mueller. CARTER: I want to know that too, Sean. I think the important question right here is whether or not any of the information that they discussed got to the special counsel? Whether it was Mueller or whether it was Jeannie Rhee or somebody else on the special counsel, I think we need to know that. I think another important factor of what happened yesterday was the fact that Bruce Ohr basically threw everybody else under the bus. Bruce Ohr was kind of saving himself. He is coming clean to some extent. And he knows that the rest of them are going to be dragged in. But he doesn't want to pay the final price. So believe me, he's going to be talking a lot more, probably in the next few days. (CROSSTALK) JARRETT: He has to say-- HANNITY: The thing that he said too, though, beyond the special counsel issue, Gregg, is that not only were they're trying to get this information to Mueller or his team. JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: But they also, as it relates to the FISA warrant-- JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: -- he knew it wasn't true. JARRETT: Absolutely. HANNITY: He testified yesterday that he knew no court-- (CROSSTALK) JARRETT: And he told the FBI it wasn't true. It was a lie and the FBI was determined to go further. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: But go further, what does that mean? JARRETT: To damage Trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the Trump campaign. This is important. Here's what should happen. This was a fraud on the court. The chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is in charge of the FISA court he should direct the presiding judge, Rosemary Collyer to hold a hearing and call of these people from the DOJ and the FBI in there. And if she finds there were crimes committed, and surely there were, there should be a criminal referral by her to the Department of Justice against these FBI and DOJ officials including James Comey. HANNITY: The house of cards is coming down. That's why your book is number one for so long on the New York Times list. Good job both of you. Great reporting. Great work. We're very close. The cards are about to collapse. When we come back, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer, they weigh in on, yes, fake news CNN and their credibility crisis. Also tonight, Florida gubernatorial Republican candidate he won yesterday, Ron DeSantis, he'll join us. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Fake news CNN still refusing to retract their botched Trump tower story. Earlier today, the president tweeted, \"Fake news CNN is -- yes, that's a fake -- is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie refusing to admit the mistake. Sloppy Carl Bernstein, a man who lives in the past and thinks like degenerate fool, making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country. Fake news.\" It is at the end. Joining us now with reaction is counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway. You know, I watched you on the network. I didn't actually watch. I read the transcript. Then I watched the media (Inaudible) that puts up these clips of you and Chris Cuomo. I get along. I get along with Chris and Don Lemon. I haven't had any issues with anybody in the business, except for fake liberal Joe. So, I'm watching this and I'm thinking, I got a headache watching it. And I am thinking, I admire you for doing it. But I'm thinking why? KELLYANNE CONWAY, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: Well, I did get two questions in about this very topic that's burning a whole week later. Twice if not three times I confronted him with the fact that CNN including on his show had let this lie fly for over a month now. And that this report, this bombshell report that they had talked about had been quickly unraveling and discredited. And would they admit that? And in his attempt to get me to call the president of the United States the l-word which I would not do, he was trying to do that again and again and again. They've been caught-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Again and again. That was the whole thing. One question over and over and over. CONWAY: They rush -- they rush to judgment about this but I got in the question about this particular issue which now this particular story which has been discredited. Lanny Davis has admitted it he made a mistake and he didn't have the information. But remember, what Lanny Davis said his client would tell Mueller essential to the entire claim of collusion which the president says is phony. And it's so central to the claim of collusion that without that, then all -- that bombshell report is just a bomb. But, Sean, this goes directly to the problem we have, which is trust immediately, tweet incessantly, and verify never. As long as it's negative, negative, negative. Why won't CNN just say look, it was based on false reporting and we retract it and we apologize? Why can't they just say it? They had to do it. They had fired three people, three reporters at CNN because they lied about Anthony Scaramucci meeting with Russians four days before the inauguration lie. That same host and other host from Sunday, their Sunday show had lied about Ted Cruz the senator being afraid to talk to CNN. Why are they only giving the interview to the mother ship Fox News, they ask. Very jealous of Fox News always and yet, Senator Cruz has just gave a CNN reporter a 15-minute on camera interview that CNN had not just aired. So, people make mistakes. But those who are constantly assailing everybody else are loathe to admit it. I appreciate you running the president's tweets about this. Because when the president talks about fake news, he is really talking about two big things. Which is, inaccurate and unfair imbalance reporting and also sins of omission. Not just commission from the network. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Well, Kellyanne, let me ask. CONWAY: Why are you excluding all the important information from America? Why aren't you telling them about the economy, why aren't you telling them about the growth rate, about the job creation, and about the $91 million and the-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Kellyanne, answer your own question. CONWAY: -- story of funding that president gave today the drug-free communities. HANNITY: You know the answer. (CROSSTALK) CONWAY: But you know they are not doing that. HANNITY: They loved Clinton. They loved Obama and they hate Bush and Trump. They are a biased news, so-called news network. CONWAY: Sure. HANNITY: But they won't admit that they're biased. CONWAY: I have a totally different view on all of this. By the way, I'm not sure it matters anymore, Sean. Because the president, himself, uses his considerable social media platform. Our director of social media today at the White House, Dan Scavino said in answer to the president's question in an open press forum that the president has about 160 million. That's basically one out of every two adults in this country. HANNITY: Well. CONWAY: More than that on one of his social media platform. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: He doesn't need them. CONWAY: So he corrects -- he connects directly -- he doesn't need them. I don't think it matters anymore because people know when they open up their 401-K statement, when they see that they've got extra spending money, when they see less regulation and more consumer confidence they know what they see. And this president is connecting directly with them. But you also why won't they -- why won't they investigate the other side of this? Why isn't Peter Ohr the leading story on every single network tonight? The America has a right to know. HANNITY: Because-- CONWAY: In the interest of transparency and accountability that Christopher Steele was nervous. He would be up a creek without his Ohr if Peter Ohr was -- if Bruce Ohr was the next to go. People have the right to know what's making this-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I have to run but-- CONWAY: -- FBI and the DOJ taxpayer funded paid person so nervous about losing access. And the last thing I want to say is, they were exchanging messages not just in 2016 before Donald Trump was democratically elected with 306 electoral votes-- HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne. CONWAY: -- they were doing it in 2017, 2017. It's a problem we should investigate it. HANNITY: Good to see you. You're always -- you're always welcome here. CONWAY: Thank you. HANNITY: All right. CONWAY: Thank you. HANNITY: Joining us more the author of \"The Briefing, the Press and the President.\" It's a best seller. Former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. You know, you've dealt with this crap more than anybody to be honest with you. And you know, Kellyanne was right. They missed the biggest abuse of power story in their lifetime. They can't admit a mistake. Jim Acosta is anymore -- any one more abusively bias than more of a political hack than him. SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, I think the story that we are talking about now with Lanny Davis is typical of what we're seeing over and over again. The pursuit of trying to take this president down leads them to do whatever and say whatever. Despite all of the concerns that they have about people using the phrase fake news, here we have an instance which is pretty clear that Lanny Davis, they used him in a story, they put in the story that he was not available for comment. Lanny Davis has now gone on the record saying in fact, it was a comment. That in fact was a lie by CNN and they should admit it. Number two, is that Lanny Davis himself, has said that he regret and made a mistake when it come to underlying premise of the entire story. And number three, Mr. Cohen himself, in sworn testimony before Congress has admitted that in fact there was no discussion of that -- of that being fire to with respect-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: He said it in an interview. SPICER: Right. But here's the thing. HANNITY: I know Lanny Davis. This is one thing everybody has got to know about Lanny. If you understand he is myopic when it comes to the Clintons. It's him. I accept it. He is also smart. He wrote a book. Tell the truth, tell it all, tell it early. So which he kind of used his own advice and he admitted it. Maybe get a little ahead on his skis here. But CNN should just admit it. SPICER: Well, they should. But look, we've seen this study from the Media Research Center. Ninety two percent of the coverage of this president is negative. That's backed up by Harvard and Pew. The fact to the matter is that there is no objectivity left. There is a pursuit of taking down this president when it comes to the mainstream media. And the bottom line is that regardless of how blatant the mistake and the lie is in their face, they are going to do nothing but they won't do anything to back down from it. Because the overarching goal is to push back against this president as hard as possible. HANNITY: Yes. Well, to destroy him. You cover it really well in your book. I know-- (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Yes. I was just going to say, Sean, thank you. I mean, part of it was to really go through and give examples to people and make them understand how these stories are done. And that's what the book really walks through. HANNITY: The good news is it is a New York Times bestseller. Congratulations to you. I don't know how you ever did this, but to be honest. SPICER: Real news. HANNITY: Good to see you. SPICER: Thanks. HANNITY: When we come back, he won a big victory in Florida last night. Florida gubernatorial candidate, Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, he is next as we continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. Last night, Congressman Ron DeSantis he secured the Republican nomination for governor in the great state of Florida. Big huge margin. Come-from-behind victory. He is going to face off against the Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. And Congressman DeSantis joins us now. Full disclosure, I did do town halls with him. And we talked to people. I talked too. Anyway, good to see you, Congressman. And I endorsed you and I don't regret it. A lot of it has made you an interview with our own Sandra Smith today and you talked about not monkeying this up. And I saw your statement afterward. I saw some of the media reaction and your opponents reaction. And I want to give you a chance to respond. Did you, in any way, and do you in any way, think that was something that was misstated or racist in any way? Because that's what they're implying. REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.: It has zero to do with race, Sean. It has everything to do with whether we want Florida to continue to go on a good direction, building up the success or do we want to turn to left wing socialist policies which will absolutely devastate our state? And here's the thing. I believe people should be judged based on their ability and character regardless of race. But it's because of that I know socialism won't work in Florida. It's not good for any race, color or creed. So this is not about race. This is about ideas and principles. And I'm not going to let the Democrats and Andrew Gillum try to obscure a debate about whether his tax increases, his single-payer healthcare plan, his desire to abolish ICE, whether that is something that's acceptable for Florida. I don't think it is and I don't care what color you are. HANNITY: Well, listen, Florida is become one of the fastest growing, lowest unemployed states in the country. And it's very diverse state. You know, but we're now in an environment where people want to purposely take things out of context. Your life's work, who you are, and what other people have said, even though on their side that they support politically doesn't seem to matter. And I guess the issue comes down to who you are, what's in your heart. And what do you tell people that are hearing that news and interpretation tonight. DESANTIS: Well, look, Sean, from athletics to the military to how I conducted myself as an elected official. I'm a straight shooter. I treat everyone with respect regardless of circumstances of birth. And I believe the great thing about this country, is that you can grow up in places where you don't have a lot of opportunity initially and you can work hard and get ahead regardless of the color of your skin. That's really-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: This is a very interesting race. We see in California with Gavin Newsom and we see with your opponent, really somebody that has taken the hard, hard left of the Democratic Party. I mean, how much does he want to tax corporations? You know, what is his position on ICE and-- (CROSSTALK) DESANTIS: Forty percent tax increase. We have an opportunity to attract record investment in Florida on the heels of the President Trump tax cuts. And doing a 40 percent tax increase would absolutely kill Florida's economic boom. We have a $1 trillion economy. It is the wrong approach. And this is all about substance. It's about people's lives and it's about what's best for the sunshine state. HANNITY: You know, it is amazing. Under Barack Obama, we saw how bad the economy. Disproportionately minorities were impacted. Record low unemployment for youth, for women in the workplace, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans. Policies matter about helping people where one country lift their lives. And that gets ignored by so many people. That's an important thing that you can help somebody's life. DESANTIS: Sean, in Florida we have a tax credit scholarship program for low income families where the family can take that money and go to different schools including a private school. About 100,000 families are on it. Disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities. I am a big supporter of that because the results have been phenomenal. Andre Gillum would take those scholarships away from some of the most needy families in Florida-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I don't see how you afford any of this. Let me ask you the last question. How big and important was the president's endorsement to you in your opinion? DESANTIS: No, I mean, he is the 800-pound gorilla in Republican politics. There's nobody that's even close in moving numbers. Although, Sean, my rise in the polls did coincide with you coming down. So maybe we can talk to the president data, look at Hannity, sir-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: You mean, 2 percent and Trump gets 50. All right, I got it. I got my little place in the world. I do enjoy town halls and meeting people. And I can see that your message is resonating with people and Matt Gaetz. We have a great time. DESANTIS: Yes. HANNITY: Thank you for hosting me in that. That was a lot of fun. DESANTIS: Well, thank you for your support. And we are on the path to victory in November. HANNITY: All right. Thank you. We appreciate it. Gubernatorial candidate from Florida, Ron DeSantis. When we come back, Rush Limbaugh unloading on CNN for sticking to the discredited Trump tower report. That's next, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Earlier today, Rush Limbaugh went after CNN for standing by their botched report. Let's take a look at what Rush says. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST: One of the primary reasons CNN is hanging tough, what is going to happen to them? Nothing is going to happen to them. How can they lose any more respect than they've already lost? How can their audience get any smaller, significantly? What really is anybody going to do to them? Nobody is going to do anything to them. Nothing happens to any of these people on the side of this that are trying to nail Trump. With bogus Trumped up, never happened evidence. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Boom. Great job, Rush. All right. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues with Ingraham. She does radio, too.

MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you, Bret. So, we are one week out now from the midterm elections and the heat is clearly on. The president all in revving up the base saying now that he believes he can change the ability to gain U.S. citizenship if you're born on U.S. American soil.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous and it has to end.\u00a0\nJONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Have you talked about that with counsel?\u00a0\nTRUMP: Yes. I have.\u00a0\nSWAN: So we're in the process.\u00a0\nTRUMP: It's in the process, it'll happen. It's with an executive order.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, Canada is the only other developed nation to have this rule according to the IMF. Others also have it, but the move sparked some outrage.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nRUTH MARCUS, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's ridiculous that we have the rule. It's not ridiculous that we have this rule, this rule is in the Constitution.\u00a0\nTHIRU VIGNARAJAH, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, MARYLAND: There is no precedent, there is no legal authority, there is no legitimate basis to the suggestion.\u00a0\nBROOKE BALDWIN, HOST, CNN: This is the president of United States who is supposed to be on office and uphold the Constitution, and he is trying to defy the Constitution.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But actually, if you look back in history, this idea has been discussed obviously since the original debate of the 14th Amendment. And the meaning of the words of that amendment have been wrangled with for decades.\u00a0\nIn fact, Jeb Bush also suggested that perhaps the amendment should be revisited, as did Harry Reid.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSEN. HARRY REID, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR: If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant. No sane country would do that, right? Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, Reid later backpedaled on that and changed his mind. So, he regretted bringing it up. But in moments, Brit Hume is here on the vitriol toward President Trump following this announcement.\u00a0\nBut first, we start with constitutional law attorney, Jonathan Turley for a level-headed look at what the president actually can and cannot do. Jonathan, good to have you with us here tonight.\u00a0\nYou say that this -- you're glad the president brought it up because you believe that it will force the courts to look at it and that's good.\u00a0\nJONATHAN TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL: That's absolutely correct. You know, we're about 150 years late in finding out what this amendment means.\u00a0\nThere has been a debate since this was first ratified. All of this debate turns on these six rather ill-chosen words. Is to what was meant by being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u00a0\nSome of the drafters at the time clearly evidenced a belief that non- citizens that come to this country, whether they're diplomats or undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children. And so, there's a good debate here. There are three different types of interpretations that have been put forward.\u00a0\nI can't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United States for any reason can have a citizen when they give birth on our soil. That's not evident from the text of the amendment. Many people at the time clearly didn't hold that view.\u00a0\nNow, it's not -- that's not a frivolous view, there's good faith arguments on both sides. But the Supreme Court has never said with any clarity or finality what it means. The only --\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Interesting. So you think that this would -- this would kind of -- you know, move that forward. Can the president do it with an executive order? Could he make that change?\u00a0\nTURLEY: That I think is more doubtful. I think Lindsey Graham is right that the best way to go about this is with legislation. Of those three interpretations, the president would lose on two in using this particular means.\u00a0\nIt ultimately comes back to the meaning of the amendment. If the amendment means that anyone in the United States can produce a child who is a citizen, then, obviously the president can't change it, neither can Congress. One interpretation is that it's left to Congress, and in that case, he still can't change it with an executive order, but Congress can.\u00a0\nSo an executive order is not the ideal way to go here. He's adding baggage to an already difficult challenge.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, here's a tweet from Jim Acosta earlier today. He said, \"The founders set up the Constitution so the president can't do what he's proposing to do with birthright citizenship. It's a stunt like sending troops to the border for a non-existent invasion,\" he says.\u00a0\nBut you know, in terms of the first part of that, we're going to get to the second part of it within a moment with Brit Hume. But in terms of the ability to approach this as a president, what is -- you know, what tools does he have in his toolbox potentially?\u00a0\nTURLEY: Well, the best tool is to go to Congress and follow the lead in this case of Lindsey Graham, and to seek legislation. It's a good thing for this to be reviewed by the court. The Supreme Court ruled many years ago that a Chinese family was entitled to the citizenship of their child who was born on U.S. soil.\u00a0\nBut that family was here as legal residence. And many people who adopt the more narrow view of this amendment believe that, that with citizens would fit that narrow interpretation. So, the Supreme Court still has work to do and it's been about150 years for it to do it.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Jonathan Turley, always enlightening. Thank you very much. Good to talk to you tonight.\u00a0\nTURLEY: Thanks, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, as we said, that heat's on about a week to go. So, all of these issues are hot, hot, hot right now. And there is no shortage of vitriol flying around on both sides. Watch this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, MORNING JOE, MSNBC: But what Donald Trump and what the Republican Party that has now been completely taken over by Donald Trump is using is, is -- it racism.\u00a0\nAnd you see it in Donald Trump, saying he's going to circumvent the Constitution with an executive order. He can't do that. It's not about anything other than scaring Americans, and actually appealing to the most racist base instincts.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, says that the charges that the president is racist reflect media coverage gone awry. Brit, good evening to you.\u00a0\nBRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Your reaction to Mr. Scarborough, there.\u00a0\nHUME: Well, look, this may be misbegotten as Jonathan Turley suggests. And an executive order may not possibly pass muster under the Constitution to repeal birthright citizenship. But that doesn't make it racist.\u00a0\nI mean, racism is a pretty clear thing, it is the belief in the superiority of one race over another and you have to pretty well express that it seems to me to be considered a racist. And I think the case that's constantly made, and you hear it. It's not even a case, it's the assertion that's constantly made, the casually made flung about that Donald Trump is a racist is simply not substantiated.\u00a0\nAnd for Joe Scarborough, who ought to know better, to say something like that as casually as he did there, it seems to me is, is what is an example of why the media are having so much trouble building public support these days. It's declined to near record low levels and this kind of stuff is what's part of it.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, that's the problem. And so, you know, you can't bring something up and discuss it without these labels starting to be attached to it. And you know, we played that video of Harry Reid way back when, it was in the 90s, long, long time ago.\u00a0\nBut, you know, bringing up the topic, discussing it, he later changed his mind about how he felt about it. But the idea that discussing it.\u00a0\nNow, I understand that there's a -- you know, a perception which may be true that this is political with one week to go, and that it's -- you know, sort of throwing more red meat where the president thinks it will help them out a week from now.\u00a0\nBut the idea that you can't even discuss it without being labeled a racist is I think something we all have to sort of really stick, take a step back and think about here.\u00a0\nHUME: And think about it this way, Martha. What's that -- what is the great achievement of the civil rights movement of the 60s and beyond? And that was that racism in America became absolutely unacceptable.\u00a0\nI mean, the overwhelming consensus in this country is anti-racist, and that is why it has become unfortunately since then, a cudgel in the hands of those who would use it to attack others. Because if you can be successfully labeled a racist, you're a finished.\u00a0\nI mean, that is about as damaging that -- as anything you can have. So, it's tempting for demagogues to fling that term about. What you don't expect is people who are supposed to have some sense in the media. Who even if they are -- you know, if they were entitled to express their opinions to be tossing around a term like that. It's just totally improper.\u00a0\nAnd earlier, you know, you had a quote from a White House correspondent for CNN who labeled this a stunt, and said it was a -- you know, it was a bogus threat at the border.\u00a0\nWell, maybe it is. But is that the job of a beat reporter to be saying that, or is that the job of one of their editorialists, one of their opinion dispensers? Because in my day, when I was covering in the White House, you couldn't be both.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Fascinating. Well, look, you know, David Remnick also weighed in. He is more of an opinion person. But this is sort of the general line of thinking that it's OK to say that the president is a racist because we're in completely unprecedented times, and they believe that -- you know, basically, the country as we know it under this president is falling apart. Watch this.\u00a0\nDAVID REMNICK, EDITOR, THE NEW YORKER: This is an emergency.\u00a0\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST, MORNING JOE, MSNBC: Yes.\u00a0\nREMNICK: The Trump presidency represents an emergency. I can't emphasize that enough.\u00a0\nBRZEZINSKI: I agree.\u00a0\nREMNICK: The President of the United States of America now encourages division hatred --\u00a0\nSCARBOROUGH: Right.\u00a0\nREMNICK: -- and exploiting this for purely electoral means.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, that was the discussion this morning. And you know, nods all around the table. Everybody just nodding, absolutely. Oh, yes, absolutely in agreement.\u00a0\nHUME: You know -- Well, you know, Martha, I've been saying for some time now that a journalists in this country consider his -- Mr. Trump's election to be a national emergency. I kind of expected I might get some pushback on that. It is interesting to hear one of the dukes who --\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Come on this picked up your line.\u00a0\nHUME: -- of liberal journalism pronouncing that as if it's a certified fact. If you look what's going on around this country, if you get outside of New York City where the opinions seem not to differ very much among journalists, you don't see this attitude. They don't feel like you're an emergency.\u00a0\nNow, they may have trials and tribulations, they may have policies they don't like. But you know, with unemployment at these levels with this stock market still way higher than it was when he took office and so on, I don't think people think this is an emergency, and I don't think that increasing the defense budget and taking a different posture around the world constitutes an emergency.\u00a0\nThe thing about Trump, is he says a lot of extravagant things, but if you - - if you follow him with any -- with any thought, you notice that his bark is far worse than his bite.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes.\u00a0\nHUME: And that a lot of the stuff, he says it's just bluster that people react to get their hair on fire about it all the time. You know you feel like saying, \"Folks, grow up.\" Watch.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes. And know, I was listening to this conversation this morning. I listened to hear sort of what the meat behind the argument was, and at one point it went to that he was responsible for sort of like emotional climate change in the country. You know, a version of emotional psychological climate change in the country.\u00a0\nHUME: That's a good phrase. Yes.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: One last question because, you know, the politics of this suggestion that he has made in terms of changing the 14th Amendment sort of went both ways today. Here's Paul Ryan. I want to get one last thought for you on the politics of that suggestion.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nREP. PAUL RYAN, R\u2014WISC., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. You know, as a conservative, I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution. And I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process. But where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here, which is unchecked illegal immigration.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Chuck Grassley basically agreed with him, and Lindsey Graham lined up with the president that it was worth looking at this.\u00a0\nHUME: Yes, but Lindsey Graham, said the way to do was -- you know, he would try it in Congress and he would and indeed, I believe he went on to say they introduced a constitutional amendment.\u00a0\nSo, I think -- you know, on balance, the members, the leaders on the Hill are not lining up with the President on this idea of an executive order.\u00a0\nLook, I think the language of the 14th Amendment is pretty clear. I don't think you can do this by an executive order. It'll be interesting to see if it gets tested in the court. But one can only imagine, for example, Brett Kavanaugh, what he's devoted -- his devotion to the text of the Constitution, ruling on an executive order by a president that says, \"I'm revoking this.\" I don't have a sense that the kind of judges that the president has promoted to the bench are going to take anything other than a dim view of this.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes. Well, you know, it's interesting because Jonathan Turley said that these five words subject to the jurisdiction thereof have never been -- you know, really tested by the Supreme Court in this way. And he welcomed that kind of discussion and debate over the constitutionality of it. So, it will be interesting to see where it closed. Brit, thank you.\u00a0\nHUME: Yes, it will be. You bet.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes, thanks so much. Great to see you.\u00a0\nHUME: You bet, Martha. Thank you.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, despite calls like this to stay away --\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCHUCK DIAMOND, FORMER RABBI, TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE: Please Mr. President, if you're watching this. Wait, wait a week. Come next week. The focus this week is on the funerals.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: President Trump was in Pittsburgh today. Here are some of the scenes from that. He is with the rabbi from The Tree of Life synagogue there. He paid his respects to the community that's been shaken after a mass shooting at the local synagogue, the Tree of Life.\u00a0\nMollie Hemingway, here on the optics, the civility, the healing of all of this. Coming up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So President Trump in Pittsburgh today with the First Lady and his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner all showing their support and mourning the lives of the innocent 11 people who were gunned down as they worshipped at Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday. That's the Rabbi in front of them there. The visit overshadowed somewhat by controversy as some protested and there were some officials who stayed away. At least one potential presidential candidate cast blame on the president.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER MAYOR, NEW YORK: When he goes around getting people to scream in hate bad things happen. And that's you saw the results here.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley defended the President and offered some context from her time as South Carolina governor when a hate crime struck Charleston in 2015 and nine African-American churchgoers were murdered at the hands of a white supremacist. Haley tweeting in part, \"the country was very racially divided at the time, we didn't once blame President Obama. We focused solely on the lives lost and their families. Have some respect for these families and stop the blame.\u00a0\nHere now Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor of The Federalist and a Fox News Contributor. Mollie good evening to you. Good to have you here today. Your thoughts on this controversy as we watch the President in Pittsburgh.\u00a0\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think it's important at times like this for everyone in the country to unify, to come together and to join together to condemn acts of terrorism such as this. You saw a lot of media highlighting of people saying that the President shouldn't represent the country at the Tree of Life Synagogue. You didn't see a lot of coverage of the rabbi of the congregation, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyer who said that of course, the President is welcome, that he's welcome anytime reminding people that he is a citizen of this country, that the rabbi is a citizen and that that is his president. That's the proper posture. It's one that the country has done a pretty good job with.\u00a0\nIn previous incidents, we've had controversial presidents for a while now, but generally, the country comes together in unity to condemn acts of terrorism and that's a good place to be. It has been disappointing to see the media, mainstream media figures and other people on the left use it as a political cudgel.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: What does she think of Nikki Haley's comments about the similar incident in some ways that happened in Charleston?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: Yes, unfortunately, because evil exists there were quite a few acts of terrorism during President Obama's eight years of presidency. And even at a very controversial time, you know, she gave the example of what happened in South Carolina, also there was the Gabby Giffords shooting in Arizona and I think what you saw was people largely responded to President Obama's remarks and speaking on those issues in good faith. They generally commended him for his work at those times. That is a -- that is a much better way to be.\u00a0\nAgain, it has been a missed opportunity I think for the media in that they have used this not as a time of unity but for -- to two to demonstrate that they're not very good at covering issues like this fairly. They're literally blaming Donald Trump for these horrific acts of anti-Semitism -- horrific acts of anti-Semitism which is inappropriate on multiple levels. Not only is he not an anti-Semite but it's a form of scapegoating.\u00a0\nWhat this shooter did at the synagogue in Pittsburgh was scapegoat Jews for -- he thought he thought Jews were to blame for everything that was wrong in the world. That's scapegoating. The proper response to violent scapegoating is not to scapegoat other people to say that President Trump or Republicans are the reason that these types of things happen. That's a very inappropriate reaction.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: David Harsanyi, your colleague at the Federalist said it was ironic to see many of the same Liberals who recently fought to prop up the world's most powerful Jew-hating terrorist state, he wrote, lecturing us on the importance of combating anti-Semitism but they were -- they were -- but they were -- but there they were I should say, yesterday. What do you think about that?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: Right. And this is the thing. People want to make anti- Semitism a thing on the left or a thing on the right, unfortunately, anti- Semitism has a long and storied history. It exists all across the political spectrum and it is very disappointing to see people not deal with the anti-Semitism problem in their own corner, use it again as a political cudgel against other people. A lot of what we've seen with the recent -- with recent spate of anti-Semitic rhetoric or violence has come from the left and it can come from the right as well. It is a universe problem and it should not be used to target one political side or another.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Mollie, I thank you. Great to have you with us tonight, Mollie Hemingway. So coming up next, Hillary Clinton cracks a joke during a discussion about African-American politicians--\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, UNITED STATES FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, I know they all look alike.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No they don't.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Juan Williams says relax, it was just a joke and he joins me next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCLINTON: Well, I'd like to be president.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So that comment made even Hillary's fellow Democrats a little bit nervous perhaps some of them this week. And then today there's another controversy over a little joke that she made about race. Watch this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think of Cory Booker's and you didn't come under him and you feel --\u00a0\nCLINTON: No, I adore him.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think about him saying kick them in the shins essentially start to get to that kind of political.\u00a0\nCLINTON: Well, that was Eric Holder.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Eric Holder, yes, sorry.\u00a0\nCLINTON: Yes, I know they all look alike.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, they don't.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Whoa, said the crowd. Joining me now Juan Williams co-host of \"The Five\" and Fox News political analyst one always good to have you here. What do you think?\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think you know, I'm glad you played that piece about Hillary saying she want to be president and everybody whoa. And of course, if you play the whole tape you'd see she said, I'm not running again. And in this case, I think --\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Hold on. She said -- she said I don't want to run for president --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: There you go.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: -- but I'd like to be president.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: She doesn't like the running, the politics part --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, you got to run. You got to run.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But she does sure well, think about after the midterms. I going wait until after the Midterms --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes, I see -- no. I mean, but -- I say, Martha, for president, if you want to run, that's what I suspect. And in this case, I think it's pretty clear that Kara Swisher had confused Cory Booker and Eric Holder for the -- if they go low kick him. And so she plays on this and Kara's response is telling, she says no they don't, and then she realizes, oh my God everybody's laughing. Hillary Clinton was just playing on the old meme of black people looking like or something and it was a joke. But it was to me obviously, a transparent joke. I don't think there was any ill will intended or involved and I think that --\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Let me ask you this --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: -- people who don't like Hillary are going after it.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Right. You know, if President Trump said that in an in the same situation.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh different context because of his whole divisive nature on in terms of racial comments. But again, I think in that situation conservatives don't like politically correct speech and the inability to make a joke and I think President Trump in that situation he would have set off alarms but I think he would have had the same defense.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But you know, but this is what -- and we live in such a hypersensitive moment right?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: And when you and I spoke about Ron DeSantis you know, and he said monkey it up, right? You felt that that was clearly a racial issue.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Now, the question was --\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: And I said I think he was just joking and I think he even mixed up his metaphors when he made that joke.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But he wasn't allowed to -- that -- he wasn't let off the hook for that.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, because I think that the whole question was about DeSantis playing to white nationalists instincts.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But you're putting it on top of --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying, I'm a -- I'm a journalist, you're a journalist, we know the context of that race in Florida is quite rich especially with racial animosity and when DeSantis used that coming out of the box against Gillum, I mean it's like Gillum said in the recent debate, you know, it's not that I'm saying he's racist, it's that white racist say he's one of them. That's a -- that's a hell of a statement.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Well, I mean -- I mean, you know, we could have a whole discussion about the Florida race, it's very -- you know, we actually have -- we have more on that because here's the way it stands right now. Andrew Gillum is up 46.9 Ron DeSantis at 43.9. And I should just say he would completely -- DeSantis would say that you know, your characterization of him is completely wrong. He has said --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I didn't character -- I just quoted what Gilliam said about him. But again what I am saying and I don't think this is in dispute is that race in that contest for governor of Florida is a charged issue.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: All right, let's take a look at this stop from President Trump with regard to that. Here's what he said.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: He is a guy that in my opinion is a stone-cold thief. And his city, Tallahassee is known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation. He is a disaster. And how he's even close to being tie is hard to believe.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Now a lot was read into that today because he called him a stone-cold thief. Now the whole issue here is over Hamilton tickets, and you know, some investigation that was done. They're saying he's not under investigation but there are questions that were raised about whether or not he inappropriately got these theater tickets.\u00a0\nThe president as he often does goes, you know, way further. But he does that with everybody regardless of their gender, regardless of their race.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: He often does that. But boy, that point was jumped all over today. That that was a racist thing for him to say.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't know about racist. But goodness, gracious. Don't call thief and he then doesn't have anything to back it up. If he said, here's why this man is a thief. We know XYZ, then you'd say, well, I guess he has the goods, but he doesn't have the good.\u00a0\nSo, it comes across as a political statement intended to help his favorite Ron DeSantis down in Florida.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But you don't see that stone-cold statement. You would not say that that--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't know how race got into that one.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: No. I watch the whole segment on another show.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't think that's fair.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: OK.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But I do think it's -- I think is libelous. I mean if you come out and say Juan Williams is a thief. You say, why would you say such a thing? What evidence do you have of that, and when he was ask about President Trump--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Well, he's seen on the whole stupid thing about the Hamilton ticket. I'm not saying that it's substantiated but the conversation that's happening in that race, that's what he's talking about.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, now if you say someone is a thief I hope you have some evidence of it beyond he took some theater tickets from an FBI undercover agent. I think the best argument, Martha, from the president's perspective would be the ongoing probe into Tallahassee, a corruption--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: That's what he said.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes. But there is nothing, nothing in the FBI isn't saying that Gillum is the target of that investigation.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But they're investigating the office.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes. Not the office. They're investigating the whole city hall operation. But I would think the president--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Of what he (Inaudible).\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Right. But I would think that President Trump especially given the Mueller investigation would be very sensitive to anybody saying you are the target when in fact President Trump repeatedly says he's not the target of the probe into Russian interference.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Good point. Juan, thanks.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You're welcome.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Good to see you.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Nice to see you.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Thanks for coming by.\u00a0\nSo, with more than 5,000 troops deploying to the southern border, we talked to the man who once led the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan about whether President Trump's answer to the migrant caravan will work. General Stanley McChrystal coming up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were just saying, just saying gets people sent to Allenwood, just saying could get you buried real quick.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Great scene from the movie \"Black Mass\" based on Boston mob boss Whitey Bulger. The man once known as the most wanted fugitive in the United States. He was reportedly murdered today on his first day at a new West Virginia federal prison. It was new to him.\u00a0\nTrace Gallagher live from our West Coast newsroom with a look back at one of America's most notorious killers. Trace?\u00a0\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Martha, the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons still won't confirm exactly how Whitey Bulger died, but as you noted, there are numerous reports saying the former mob boss was killed by fellow inmates with ties to the Mafia.\u00a0\nTMZ is also reporting that Bulger, who was confined to a wheelchair was wheeled into a secluded corner of the prison outside the view of surveillance cameras and beaten to death. He was found lying on the ground at 8:20 this morning.\u00a0\nRemember, Whitey Bulger was an FBI informant for many years and actually ratted out his gang's biggest rivals. Experts in organized crime say this may have been payback a long time coming.\u00a0\nIn the mid-1990s it was a corrupt FBI agent who tipped off Bulger that he was about to be arrested. Bulger then fled and remained on the lam for 16 years, becoming the FBI's most wanted criminal.\u00a0\nAnd despite his face routinely being featured on national news and a film about his life, \"The Departed\" winning best picture in 2006, Whitey Bulger was somehow able to hide in plain sight living with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig in a seaside condominium in Santa Monica.\u00a0\nAfter getting a tip in 2011 the FBI raided the condo and found fake I.D.s, numerous weapons and $800,000 in cash. Bulger was then convicted on a laundry list of charges, including his part in 11 murders, though some investigators believe he killed dozens along with racketeering and money laundering charges.\u00a0\nCatherine Greig was also convicted on lesser charges and is scheduled to be released from prison in 2020. Whitey Bulger to gain the nickname as a kid because of his blonde hair had been serving his life sentence at a prison in Florida, but he apparently threatened a prison employee and was transferred to the Hazleton prison in West Virginia.\u00a0\nHe was killed just a few hours after arriving and is the third inmate killed in Hazleton in the past seven months.\u00a0\nThe prison union says the facility is severely understaffed. Martha?\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Wow. Quiet, a story. Thank you very much, Trace.\u00a0\nHere now joining me, someone that Whitey Bulger also threatened to kill because of his in-depth reporting over many years about the mob boss, Howie Carr, Boston Herald columnist and radio talk show. Howie, good to have you with us tonight.\u00a0\nHOWIE CARR, COLUMNIST, BOSTON HERALD: Thanks, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I am -- you wrote several books about him. You have studied him and his family for many years. What was your reaction when you heard what happened in West Virginia today?\u00a0\nCARR: Well, I know, Martha, you're not supposed to speak ill of the dead, but you now, he did threaten to kill me, and I fortunately wasn't murdered obviously but he was a monster. He was really an arch criminal. He was a bank robber, a cocaine dealer, a serial murderer, a pedophile, and extortionist.\u00a0\nHe was a horrible, horrible person, and I can't say that I'm unhappy that he is dead tonight. You know, he lived to age of 89. That's a lot longer than most of his victims lived obviously. And--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Do you have any theory--\u00a0\nCARR: No one shedding any tears.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Any theory on what happened who wanted to get him and who might have been in this West Virginia prison to finish that job?\u00a0\nCARR: Well, I talked to Johnny Martorano, one of his partners today are in the Winter Hill gang who why I wrote a book with \"Hitmen.\" And he said it's perfect karma, you know, the guy -- the guy ratted all these people into prison. And he was a vicious criminal who killed people in cold blood and so now he ends up by getting killed in cold blood in prison.\u00a0\nI don't know who killed them, really. I'm kind of surprised that there would still be this kind of up feeling about him are in organized crime. Most of the people that he -- that he double-crossed are either out and fairly old and, or they're dead. This is -- this is a perfect ending for him, though.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Maybe it's one of their -- one of their kids, one of their younger relatives, perhaps and maybe someday we'll learn.\u00a0\nCARR: Right.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Speaking of relatives, his brother learned the news of what happened today from a local reporter in Boston. Watch this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you heard the reports before?\u00a0\nJACKIE BULGER, WHITEY BULGER'S BROTHER: No.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Am I the first one telling you this?\u00a0\nBULGER: Yes.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm sorry to be doing that.\u00a0\nBULGER: That's all right.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell me what's your reaction is on hearing that?\u00a0\nBULGER: No.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's your brother.\u00a0\nBULGER: I know he is.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would--\u00a0\nBULGER: I don't -- I don't have anything to say with them.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: What do you make of that?\u00a0\nCARR: Well, I mean, Jackie, Jackie Bulger, his younger brother paid a heavy price for being his sibling. He lost the state pension. He actually went to prison for a while for lying to a grand jury about visiting a Florida bank why he had a safe deposit box.\u00a0\nSo, I guess you know, it's like the godfather Michael Corleone said, this is the life we chose, right?\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes.\u00a0\nCARR: I mean, this is the life the Bulgers chose and this is the -- this is what they're paying. The trial, Martha, was it was amazing back in 2013. At one point one of the victims his girlfriend Catherine Greig who Trace was referring to, she had she was a divorce. She had two brothers-in-law and Whitey murdered both of her brothers-in-law.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: My God.\u00a0\nCARR: And then she took up with him and lived with him. And he -- one of the brothers-in-law was a guy named Paulie McGonagle and after Whitey killed them and buried his body he disappeared. They couldn't get insurance for him. He called up the house where Paulie McGonagle lived and a 10-year-old, 12-year-old son picks up the phone. This was right at Christmas. Whitey says to the kid, \"your father won't be home for Christmas.\"\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: My God.\u00a0\nCARR: And the kid goes, \"who is this?\" And Whitey goes, \"Santa Claus.\"\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Unbelievable. Great story, Howie. I guess there's something that Catherine Greig found appealing about all of that. She spent a lot of time with them in--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nCARR: She likes the bad boys, that's what she said.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: My gosh. Howie, thank you very much. Howie Carr, great to see you tonight, sir.\u00a0\nCARR: Thanks, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Good to have you with us.\u00a0\nSo, President Trump sets off some critics with his decision to send thousands of U.S. troops to our southern border. Is it the right move? We will talk to General Stanley McChrystal, former U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, coming up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: The Pentagon announcing the deployment of more than 5,000 troops to the southern border and already critics are taking aim at the president's decision, noting that it is more than double the 2,000 troops in fighting in Syria against -- in Iraq against ISIS. Listen to this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These troops are being rushed to the border in time for the midterms, not in time for the migrants to arrive.\u00a0\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Exceeding the combined U.S. military footprint in Iraq and Syria.\u00a0\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: OK. It's not about anything other than scaring Americans and actually appealing to the most racist base instincts.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: General Stanley McChrystal is the former U.S. commander in Afghanistan who developed and implemented a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy there. He is also the author of the new book \"Leaders: Myth and Reality.\" General, thank you so much for being with us. It's wonderful to have you with us tonight.\u00a0\nSTANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, RETIRED U.S. ARMY: Thanks for having me, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So, tell me what your reaction is. You know, you hear the back- and-forth. The president obviously thinks it's a good idea to send them to the border. I interview the homeland security secretary. She thinks it's the right move on. And then you hear, you know, others who think that it's sort of just complete overkill, way overboard.\u00a0\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think defending our borders is essential. I would say that announcing the deployment of regular army forces or regular military forces is nowhere sort of reinforcing the walls of the Alamo.\u00a0\nIt creates a mental image that in some people, I think maybe connotes the idea of an emergency that I don't think it's this greatest the depiction might be.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: You talk about the fact that you think that it's tempting to want strength in these tumultuous times. But you say that, you know, it's exactly the moment when you're in for a strong charismatic leader to lead us, in questioning our opposition that we actually need a more humble approach. Is that, is that about President Trump?\u00a0\nMCCHRYSTAL: No. That's about any leader. In reality, as we get pushed towards greater levels of vitriol and greater levels of emotion we want to defeat the enemy until they are crushed, until we went completely.\u00a0\nBut in reality, that's a shortsighted view. There's going to be at tomorrow. There's going to be a next week. You have to deal with the people who were your opposition. And in many ways, it's that balance.\u00a0\nThe Federalist papers the design of the United States is designed for that and I've seen it in conflict as well. We really need leaders who are mature enough to see a middle growth.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: You talk about the comparisons. You make an analogy to Plutarch's lies and you draw comparisons between people like Boss Tweed and Margaret Thatcher. Just give us sort of a thumbnail sketch of what we can expect in your book with regard to that comparison.\u00a0\nMCCHRYSTAL: Sure. Our new book \"Leaders: Myth and Reality\" what we've done is taken 13 leaders. And when we look at that comparison like Boss Tweed and Margaret Thatcher, what we're really doing is exploring why they would emerge as leaders, and what we find is they're not two-dimensional caricatures. They're really very rich holistic flawed people and that's what we've got a look at in our leaders now, not only in the leaders we see and we follow, but the leaders we select for the future.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Well, General Mattis is leading the Department of Defense as you well know, and he spoke out today. And I just wanted to play this for you given your own commitment and the time that you spent leading our forces in Afghanistan, and I want to get your reaction to this assessment of his just a short time ago.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: It's not a matter of military is holding ground. The Afghan-led are doing the fighting. They look at the casualties over a 1,000 dead in August and September. A 1,000 dead and wounded in August and September and they stayed in the field fighting.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: What would you say about that, sir?\u00a0\nMCCHRYSTAL: Well, I think Jim Mattis has got it right and I won't speak for him, but Afghanistan from afar looks very frustrating and up-close it is as well, but it's not the same place it was before 9/11. We've had females in school for now. Seventeen more years in young people.\u00a0\nThere's a generation coming up in Afghanistan. They won't tolerate the foolishness that my generation is actually running in the country. So, I think that there's great hope for the future but there's frustration between now and then.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: General Stanley McChrystal, great to have you with us tonight, sir. And congratulations on the book. It looks great. Thank you very much.\u00a0\nMCCHRYSTAL: Thank you, Martha.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: You bet. So still ahead tonight, President Trump revised his attacks on the media.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: When I say enemy of the people I'm talking about the fake news, and it is fake.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: But Brian Kilmead says he is the first president to take issue in this way with the press, and he is here with a history lesson, coming up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: President Trump renewing his attack on fake news in an interview here last night with Laura Ingraham. Watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: When I say the enemy of the people I'm talking about the fake news, and you know it better than anybody. When I say enemy of the people I'm talking about the fake news and it is fake.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: So many critics denounced that as unpresidential, but perhaps there are other presidents who have had similar feelings. President Andrew Jackson, our seventh president, also hated fake news and talked about a quite a bit.\u00a0\nHere to explain is the expert on this. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox and Friends, and author of the New York Times bestseller \"Andrew Jackson and the Miracle of New Orleans.\" The paperback is now out so can stick it in your bag and carry with you everywhere and read it.\u00a0\nHello, Brian.\u00a0\nBRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: Martha, we talked about this before.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I did not know that Donald Trump would even run for president when I was researching this. And he ran and he won, and I couldn't believe the similarities either could the present. He hangs up his portrait in the White House.\u00a0\nBut one the obsessions of Andrew Jackson was bad press. And when I see Donald Trump again, I think over the top like Jackson did and just say fake news to everything. It just gets people like Jarvis, one of Axios or people here at Fox News exercise.\u00a0\nWell, who you mad at? Are you mad a network to puts on a panel of five people all who hate you as much, you know, as a hate you a lot? Or were you mad at people that are reporting news that might not be positive, or you're just mad that these people are not on your side.\u00a0\nSo what Jackson did which I thought was appropriate, then Jackson which is clip the newspaper articles. And when he saw them he'd say hey, what's to deal with you. And we even have a picture he used to bind the, put them in binder. He was obsessed with it. And he keeps these binders right by his chair and those of the binder stayed back to he used to keep up until the day he died.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: I saw those when I was at the Hermitage, they were sitting on a floor.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'm not allowed to open it because they turned to dust, but they are newspapers.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: That's amazing.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: And as soon as Bill Jones or whoever wrote a bad story he'd open to page 56, he goes, you're not getting an interview until you can justify the story. Or he would write it back and flip it over and mail it back to them, and said fix this, you got it wrong.\u00a0\nHe hired his own White House new service and he said call the White House news. If he like the reporters he hired that reporter and he says, now I want to tell the stories the way I want it.\u00a0\nI mean, Donald Trump might try to do that but that's why he's not the first. I was reading Bush 41. He was upset every day about the way the press was treating. It's not unusual. It's just that this, I think the president makes things worse by being so aggressive in the retort.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Yes. I think you are absolutely right. I think most presidents have complained about the news. The Clintons complained about the press so they were all over them all the time, so certainly that's not new. But I think, you know, the term \"enemy of the people,\" obviously gets people riled up, but you know, the president doesn't ever hesitate to use it. He thinks it works for him.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Washington didn't think Jackson was worthy, they hated him. He's used to go back home and go with his people. Trump in D.C. They hate them in D.C. When he goes to his people they both go to big crowds and explain the story. That's why they both were successful.\u00a0\nAnd keep in mind for Trump haters, Jackson was just as powerful after he left the White House than when he was in the White House because everyone come to him for advice and try to get some power.\u00a0\nSo, if Donald, you know like Donald Trump he's not going anywhere, even if he leaves the White House.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: History is always really the most important decider of presidential success, so we'll see.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Brian, thank you very much.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Martha, thanks for having me.\u00a0\nMACCALLUM: Great book. Send paperback, you can stick it in your purse. Thank you. That's our \"Story\" -- if you had one -- for tonight on this Tuesday night. We'll be back again tomorrow night at 7. \"Tucker Carlson\" is coming up next in D.C.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Judge Barrett's faith mocked as a 'potential weakness.' Panel debates the media's stance. President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that he has narrowed his list of potential Supreme Court nominees to just two or three people. \u201cI am interviewing some extraordinary talented and brilliant people and I\u2019m very happy that we will pick somebody who will be outstanding for many years to come,\u201d Trump said. Fox News has learned that Trump has completed the interview process after speaking with six judges: Appeals court judges Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett, Amul Thapar, Joan Larsen and Thomas Hardiman. The interviews involved seven conversations in all \u2013 Trump talked to one candidate twice. Here\u2019s what we know about them: Thomas Hardiman, blue-collar appeal Judge Thomas Hardiman may have more humble personal roots than other finalists, but his legal record is just as strong. His supporters note he was the first in his family to attend college, and drove a taxi to finance his law school education. The fact that he did not attend an Ivy League school (unlike every current member of the high court and the late Justice Antonin Scalia) may appeal to Trump's stated populist sentiments. Some commentators compare Hardiman favorably to Justice Samuel Alito in terms of personality and jurisprudence. Both served on the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The issues the Massachusetts native has tackled include gun rights. In a 2016 ruling, he backed a decision that said non-violent felons enjoyed the right to carry a weapon. \"Their crimes of conviction were nonviolent and that their personal circumstances are distinguishable from those of persons who do not enjoy Second Amendment rights because of their demonstrated proclivity for violence,\" Hardiman wrote, showing the measured, non-flashy language that is his trademark. He also dissented in a court ruling upholding a New Jersey law that mandated potential gun owners show a \"justifiable need\" to carry a handgun in public. He said the constitutional right \"to keep and bear arms\" extends beyond the home for self-protection. One more thing might appeal to Trump: respect for the separation of powers. \"I have no hesitation in applying a law regardless of what I might think about it,\" Hardiman said during his 2006 Senate confirmation. \"I think any good judge recognizes his or her place in our constitutional government, and that place is not to upset the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives.\" Amy Coney Barrett, faith and family Amy Coney Barrett received a shocking introduction to Washington politics when she faced off with Democratic senators last year at her confirmation hearing for a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told her bluntly, \"The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern.\" Barrett\u2019s response was measured but on point: \"If you're asking whether I take my Catholic faith seriously, I do, though I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge.\" It is the 46-year-old's perceived views on the intersection of faith and the law that have drawn praise from conservatives \u2013 and concern among progressives. She told a 2006 Notre Dame Law School graduating class \u201cyour legal career is but a means to an end, and \u2026 that end is building the kingdom of God. \u2026 If you can keep in mind that your fundamental purpose in life is not to be a lawyer, but to know, love and serve God, you truly will be a different kind of lawyer.\u201d The rhetoric matches that of her mentor Scalia, for whom she clerked in 1998. She recalled he was a tough but fair boss. \u201cIn these conferences where you debated the merits of cases, you had to be on your feet, know your stuff inside and out, you had to be articulate.\u201d Like the late justice, Barrett has a large family \u2013 she's the mother of seven children. Barrett has talked about the challenges of juggling a busy home life with a career as a law school professor. But it was her successful political \u201caudition\u201d to serve as a judge that \u2013 sources say \u2013 impressed the White House. Much of the focus was on abortion rights. Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked her, \u201cAnd you have no personal beliefs as to whether Roe was correctly decided?\u201d Barrett\u2019s response on the Roe v. Wade landmark ruling: \u201cI\u2019m sure every nominee before you would have personal beliefs about that precedent and many others. But all nominees are united in their belief that what they think about a precedent should not bear on how they will decide cases.\" She was more pragmatic two years ago \u2013 just days before the presidential election \u2013 about the chances that Roe v. Wade would be overturned in coming years: \"I don't think the core case -- Roe's holding that women have a right to abortion -- I don't think that will change, but I think the question of whether people can get late-term abortions -- how many restrictions can be put on clinics -- I don't think that will change.\" Brett Kavanaugh, steady insider The federal appeals court here in Washington is seen as a professional stepping-stone to the Supreme Court. Three current justices (John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas) served on that bench before joining the high court, as did Scalia. Now Judge Brett Kavanaugh is poised to make the leap, though if history is any guide, he could face an especially tough Senate confirmation. It is the image that may cement \u2013 or sink \u2013 the Supreme Court aspirations of Kavanaugh. His elevation to the federal appeals court was celebrated with a Rose Garden swearing-in by a fellow Catholic who's now retiring from the bench, Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom Kavanaugh served as a law clerk in 1993. Front and center: His former boss, President George W. Bush, the man who nominated him. \"I chose Brett because of the force of his mind, the breadth of his experience and the strength of his character,\u201d said Bush. The former loyal aide to Bush served as a White House lawyer and staff secretary. As an aide, Kavanaugh traveled in top D.C. legal and political circles, earning the confidence of power players like Karl Rove. His detractors this week began circulating a photo of Rove with his arms around Kavanaugh, to highlight the close Bush ties, which some conservatives see as a concern. And concern from the left. Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial nomination came after two years of contentious delay tactics by Democrats \u2013 who claimed Kavanaugh was overly partisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was unsparing. \u201cYou could not think of another nomination, given Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s record, more designed to divide us. This nomination appears to be judicial payment for political services rendered.\u201d Sources said at the time they believed opposition from the left was fueled by concerns that Kavanaugh could one day have a seat on the Supreme Court. \"I consider myself a Republican, I am a supporter of President Bush,\u201d Kavanaugh said at his 2004 hearing. Those close ties may now create concern from the current president -- given Trump's past rhetorical run-ins with the Bushes. Trump in 2008 seemed to back impeaching President Bush for the Iraq war -- which Trump said would be a quote \"wonderful thing.\" And candidate Trump in 2016 had repeated verbal clashes during the primaries with rival Jeb Bush -- the former Florida governor. As for Kavanaugh, he brings a stellar resume -- law school at Yale, and a stint as a top deputy to Special Prosecutor Ken Starr's probe of Bill Clinton that led to the president's impeachment. On the bench, the 53-year-old has been a reliable conservative on his court -- reining in dozens of administrative decisions of the Obama White House. But conservatives are at odds over whether a 2015 ruling on ObamaCare signaled his implicit support of the law. And there\u2019s debate as to whether Kavanaugh would limit access to abortion \u2014 since he has never directly confronted the issue as a judge\u2014and hasn\u2019t said publicly whether he\u2019d overturn Roe v. Wade. But just days ago, he dissented in the appeals court decision that allowed amn undocumented pregnant teen to get an abortion. Despite his sold conservative credentials,\u00a0 there is some concern among Trump supporters who fear that Kavanaugh is too much the \"D.C. insider,\" having been born, raised and thriving in the Washington \"swamp.\" Solidifying his insider status, Kavanaugh married President Bush's personal secretary, the former Ashley Estes. Raymond Kethledge, the loner Justice Anthony Kennedy once told Fox News, \"There's a loneliness\" to the job of sitting on the bench-- the work consisting mostly of reading and writing by yourself in chambers. A top finalist to the fill the Kennedy seat has taken that to heart. Judge Raymond Kethledge co-authored a book last year called \"Lead Yourself First: Inspiring Leadership Through Solitude.\" In it the 51-year-old said, \"A leader who silences the din not only around her mind, but inside it, can then hear the delicate voice of intuition, which may have already made connections that her conscious mind has not. And a leader who is aware of his weaknesses can guard against them.\" Kethlege says he enjoys working in his northern Michigan cabin -- by himself and without an Internet connection. Nevertheless, Kethledge has maintained strong ties to the conservative legal movement.\u00a0 He was a Kennedy law clerk in 1997 and later worked as chief counsel for then Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. After starting his own small law firm, President Bush tapped him a for a seat on the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, where-- unlike other high-profile nominees-- Kethledge faced little attention, and little opposition. On the bench, his conservative record has been solid, but absent any big blockbuster cases. He has ruled to restrict unions collecting dues from its public sector members; ruled in favor of the Tea Party, which claimed political bias by the IRS; and ruled the police do not need a warrant to search a suspect's cell phone history records. The Supreme Court overturned that decision two weeks ago. Off the bench, Kethledge enjoys hunting and fishing. His supporters compare him favorably to Justice Neil Gorsuch, also an avid outdoorsman. Joan Larsen, fond memories Judge Joan Larsen attracted national attention in 2016, when she was asked to speak at a memorial service for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. At the time, the 49-year-old was a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court, and had clerked for the conservative icon in 1994. In her remarks, Larsen spoke eloquently of her former boss as a buoyant warrior for his conservative jurisprudence. \"His wit was sharp, and he delighted in testing it against anyone who was foolish enough to try,\" she said. \"What better preparation for any of us, male or female, than to have matched wits with the justice? With each thrust and parry, we got sharper. What an incomparable gift to a young lawyer.\" Months later, she appeared on then-candidate Donald Trump's list of possible Supreme Court nominees. And after his election, the Michigan native was named to the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Her scant federal record has given some conservatives pause, whether she would be a reliable right-leaning voice. But her backers say a look at her record on the Michigan high court bench should ease any concerns. During her 2017 Senate confirmation, Larsen was careful to avoid promising how she would vote if asked to overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent guaranteeing the right to abortion. But senators cited a 2000 book review where she wrote,\u00a0 \"In the case of abortion, the constitutional right was first formally articulated by the Supreme Court itself, not by the citizenry... The people think the Constitution guarantees a fundamental right to abortion because the Supreme Court told them that it does.\" When pressed, Larsen last year replied, \"Both in my current role as a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court and if confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, I will faithfully apply Roe, Casey, and any other binding precedent of the Supreme Court.\" If nominated to the high court, she would almost certainly face further scrutiny. Amul Thapar, diversity considerations Judge Amul Thapar would make history: the first Asian American to sit on the Supreme Court. He now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, joining two other judges on that bench as current finalisits. Born in Detroit to immigrant parents from India, Thapar has had a varied professional career as a law professor, private attorney, the top federal prosecutor in eastern Kentucky, and a federal trial judge. President Trump took the unusual step of interviewing him in person last year for the vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Typically only appeals court judges get serious Supreme Court consideration. It was a sign Thapar was being groomed for bigger things. Sure enough, weeks after Neil Gorsuch was chosen Thapar became Trump's second judicial pick. And he has one very prominent supporter: his home state senator Mitch McConnell, who as majority leader just happens to be the man who would spearhead what promises to be a contentious confirmation. With a scant appeals record, most of the attention is focused on Thapar's trial court service, where he is remembered for sprinkling pop culture and colloquial references in his work. At one trial, he noted if someone \"promised to pour a man a glass of Pappy Van Winkle [a pricey bourbon brand], but gave him a slug of Old Crow instead, well, that would be fraud.\u201d His best known case may have been sentencing a nun and two others who broke into the federal Oak Ridge nuclear power facility, posting anti-nuke messages. Thapar gave then 85-year-old Sister Megan Rice a nearly three-year prison sentence. But a federal appeals court later overturned the sabotage conviction. The opinion was written by Judge Raymond Kethledge, now a Thapar colleague on the 6th Circuit, and a Trump Supreme Court finalist.

            "article_content": "President Trump reignites attacks on weak immigration system as section of border wall is completed. President Trump acted boldly and decisively Thursday when he threatened to send troops to close our southern border and cut off payments to Mexico and Central American countries if Mexico fails to halt a caravan of about 4,000 Hondurans headed for the U.S. The president dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with government officials in Panama on Thursday and Mexico on Friday to discuss border security. Hopefully, the president\u2019s threat will convince our neighbors to the south that he is serious about dealing effectively with this vital issue. President Trump understands that he must act to deter additional waves of illegal immigrants from entering the U.S., putting themselves at risk and violating our immigration laws with impunity. If illegal immigrants believe they can enter the U.S. at will, many more may choose to come here in violation of our laws. The president tweeted Thursday morning: \u201c....The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA. Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border. All Democrats fault for weak laws!\u201d USMCA is the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement for free trade between the three nations that is awaiting ratification as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). President Trump added in another tweet: \u201c...In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..\u201d Halting the flow of illegal immigration ought to be a bipartisan issue, because Congress and the president are obligated to enforce our immigration laws. If Democrats in the House and Senate believe immigration laws need to be changed they should work with Republican colleagues and the president to try to do so. But ignoring existing law by turning a blind eye to the flow of illegal immigrants is irresponsible. Unfortunately, many Democrats see immigration as a political issue they can use to gain votes in the Nov. 6 midterm elections rather than a public policy issue requiring legislative compromise solutions. One of these Democrats is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who inexplicably attacked President Trump in personal terms Tuesday for his effort to gain funding for his proposed border wall that would reduce the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into our country. \u201cIt happens to be like a manhood issue for the president, building a wall,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cand I\u2019m not interested in that.\u201d Pelosi tried to soften her stance by giving general support for strengthening America\u2019s border but it was far too late. The political damage was done. With less than three weeks before the midterm elections, Pelosi fell into a political trap of her own making. Her inflammatory remarks are a stark reminder to voters of how she and the Democratic Party are utterly disconnected from the state of America\u2019s immigration system and how we ought to fix it. When Democrats speak about immigration, the emphasis is almost always on how immigrants in past years have contributed to our current greatness. No reasonable person would disagree with these great contributions, of course. But that\u2019s not the question before us. Rather, we must ask whether yesterday\u2019s policies of the open embrace of immigrants will lead to the same kinds of success tomorrow. The answer \u2013 no matter how politically incorrect \u2013 is decidedly and unquestionably \u201cno.\u201d To understand why, we must look to the roughly 4,000 people who are at this writing heading towards our border with Mexico. These people are part of a decades-long wave of migrants from Central and South America. Most are destitute, hoping to find safety and economic security in our country. Their numbers were once staggering, with 1.6 million illegal immigrants arriving at our border annually back in 2000. Since 2010, that number has decreased to below 500,000 a year. Still, none of these travelers followed American law to get here. If they had, they would have spent months in dialogue with their local American embassy or consulate officials to process the appropriate paperwork. So why don\u2019t they follow the rules? Some are unquestionably criminals. Mexican drug cartels, for instance, make tens of billions of dollars each year in the illicit drug trade. They frequently use children as drug mules to ferry their dangerous cargo across the border and onto America\u2019s streets. But many other immigrants skip our embassies and consulates because they know they\u2019ll never be granted legal status. The reason is clear: they lack the skills, education and financial stability that would make them attractive additions to the American family. But still they come. And when they enter our country, studies show that most end up as a net drain on the American economy and government. Indeed, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine state unequivocally that \u201cfirst-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than are the native-born.\u201d Moreover, the vast majority of these illegal immigrants lack a basic ability to speak English. Indeed, the government puts the figure who can speak English at less than 20 percent. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that these workers tend to stay in low-paying jobs. Of the top 10 jobs held by immigrants (both legal and illegal), none earn more than $20 an hour and most are well below $15. More troubling, there\u2019s good data that suggest these jobs pay so poorly because wave after wave of illegal immigrants keep flocking to them, thereby depressing wages from an oversupply of labor. That, in turn, hurts not just other immigrants but native-born Americans \u2013 particularly those without high school diplomas. As politically combustible as these facts may be, they are but a sliver of the great upheaval to come. In late 2016, the Obama administration published an alarming study that showed upwards of 47 percent of American jobs might be eliminated due to the technological advances in robotics, automation and machine learning. The most vulnerable jobs? Those filled by workers with lower pay, lower skills and less education. In fact, President Obama warned that any American making less than $20 an hour \u2013 the average wage for U.S. factory workers \u2013 would likely be \u201cautomated into obsolescence.\u201d None of these facts are controversial, or at least they shouldn\u2019t be. They\u2019re simply a reflection of common sense backed by good science and rigorous study. And up until 2008, they rightfully formed the backbone of the Democratic Party\u2019s policies on immigration. \u201cWe cannot continue to allow people to enter the United States undetected, undocumented, and unchecked,\u201d the Democratic Party platform read 10 years ago. \u201cThose who enter our country\u2019s borders illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of the law.\u201d Alas, that Democratic wisdom is dead and gone. In its place is a cabal of immigration activists who believe America should instead embrace sanctuary cities, open borders and abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Why? They view deporting illegal immigrants of any kind and for any reason an act of \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d And so America watches as the progressive mob takes over a once proud Democratic Party. Sadly, we should expect more talk of Trump\u2019s \u201cmanhood\u201d instead of securing the border and a careful tightening of America\u2019s immigration policies. If Democrats lose in November, the progressive fever may break and a semblance of normalcy might return. But don\u2019t hold your breath. It\u2019s awfully difficult to put out a brush fire in a party filled with arsonists.",

            "article_content": "Attorney and RNC committeewoman for California doesn't says it's a stretch to say paying hush money to a blackmailer is necessarily trying to affect an election. This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 21, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JASON CHAFFETZ, GUEST HOST: Good evening from New York City on this night of major breaking news. I'm Jason Chaffetz sitting in for Laura Ingraham. A tragic ending in the search for missing Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts. The alleged killer, a 24-year-old illegal immigrant, and we've got Democrats out there saying ICE should be abolished. It's unbelievable. We'll have a full report later in the hour. But let's get right to our top story. Serious legal trouble for two of President Trump's former top associates, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry is here with the details. Ed, what is the latest? ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jason, great to see you. Difficult day for the president on two fronts, as you mentioned, Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen. The Cohen case could prove to be more damaging legally and politically because the president was directly implicated in the plea deal, a far cry from the Manafort matter which has nothing to do the president, the 2016 campaign, or allegations of Russian collusion. The former Trump campaign chair was stone-faced in the Virginia court as he learned the jury found he's guilty on five counts of filing false income tax returns, one count of failing to file a report of a foreign bank account, two more charges of bank fraud. The jury could not reach a verdict in Manafort's case on 10 other counts. Prosecutors have until the end of the month to decide whether they'll seek a retrial on that. Manafort also facing at second trial in Washington on charges of lobbying, fraud and other matters -- that comes in the fall. There is also the possibility Manafort will be pardoned by the president, who declared today before his rally in West Virginia that the special counsel investigation is simply out of control, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a witch hunt and it's a disgrace. This has nothing to do what they started out, looking for Russians involved in our campaign. There were none. I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. Again, he worked for Bob Dole, he worked for Ronald Reagan, he worked for many people, and this is the way it ends up. It was not the original mission, believe me. It was something very much different. So, it had nothing to do with Russian collusion. We continue the witch hunt. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Now, significant the president did not say anything about the Cohen case, leaving it to his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to revive this statement, quote, \"There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president and the government's charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen's actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.\" But Cohen's plea deal alleges he broke the law to influence a 2016 election on behalf of an unnamed candidate who clearly is the president. Cohen will get somewhere between 43 and 63 months in prison after pleading guilty to the campaign finance charges I mentioned, plus bank fraud, and tax evasion. The campaign charges involve payments to two women who alleged affairs with the president that he's vehemently denied. Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, in Cohen's plea deal, seems to directly contradict something that Giuliani told Fox back in May. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman, $130,000, I mean, which is going to turn out to be perfectly legal? That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know. It's not campaign money! No campaign finance violation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, they funneled it through a law firm? GIULIANI: Funneled through a law firm and the president repaid it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Well, that at least raises the questions now, but whether there is any legal jeopardy for the president or anyone else in the campaign. Plus, Stormy Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, always very aggressive and reaching out to the media, he is now claiming this plea allows him to get the stay lifted in the civil case that's separate from this. Meaning there will be new fight over whether the president has to give a deposition. Avenatti tweeting to Giuliani, quote, \"Buckle up, buttercup\" as if this fight is just beginning, Jason. CHAFFETZ: Ed, thank you very much. Let's bring in our legal panel to break down today's development. Harmeet Dhillon is a Republican and a lawyer, Vinoo Varghese is a criminal defense attorney, and Tom Dupree, who was a deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. Thank you all for being here. We want to try to break down today's developments so I want -- one at a time. So let's talk just first. We'll go around the horn on Paul Manafort. And Harmeet, I'd like to give you the first stab at this. What is your take on the developments today? HARMEET DHILLON, ATORNEY: Well, the developments today I think very unfortunate for Mr. Manafort because he is close to the president at one point in time for a brief period of time. He got caught in the crosshairs of the prosecution of the Mueller investigation. As we can see from both the indictment as well as the charges and the ultimate jury verdict today, we don't see anything about the president, about Russian collusion, or anything other than irregularities in his taxes and statements to banks. Now those are serious issues and unfortunately, Mr. Manafort, now will probably spend a good decade plus, to the rest of his life in prison, depending on what happens next. But it's got zero to do with the president and it just frankly underscore that (inaudible) for his closeness to the president he probably wouldn't have been prosecuted. So, its part of the narrative of, you know, unfair witch hunt here. CHAFFETZ: Now, Vinoo, who is joining me here in the studio in New York, is she right? Harmmet makes a good point. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. The proximity of the president is really what's driving this, isn't it? VINOO VARGHESE, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, look, first thing that you should notice are ostriches and pythons all across the country will sleep well tonight knowing that Paul Manafort will remain behind bars. Understand that this is a big victory for team Mueller in the court of public opinion because they won this case in the court. There's been a number of guilty pleas here. CHAFFETZ: But it's a case --it's a case that has nothing to do with the original Manafort directive. VARGHESE: This is Trump's campaign chairman. It was his campaign chairman. And Paul Manafort -- CHAFFETZ: Are you going to -- like everybody that's ever worked for you, are you going to -- VARGHESE: And I hope that Paul Manafort here has been found guilty. Look, his team took a gamble. CHAFFETZ: Of what? Something that he did a long time ago? VARGHESE: His team took a gamble. And to try (ph) this case in Alexandria, Virginia, hoping for a much more conservative jury than in Washington, D.C. CHAFFETZ: Do you really believe that he would have been prosecuted except for his proximity to Donald Trump? VARGHESE: Obviously they looked at him, that was part of it. No, I agree. His proximity to Donald Trump brought the case. That doesn't mean this is the only thing there. CHAFFETZ: And look, if somebody has (inaudible) the tax laws, I want them to be convicted. But to have the national spotlight on them just because he's worked for like 100 days for Donald Trump seems a bit over the top. But let me get Tom's take on this. Tom, what do you think is happening here with Paul Manafort? TOM DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, a few things here Jason. For one thing, I do think he was the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. I mean, look, the fact that Bob Mueller is poking around. Mueller has a broad mandate. He has the authority to investigate any crimes he uncovers in the course of investigating Russia collusion. Unfortunately for Manafort, put the spotlight on him. I think as far as a president goes, I think there is no legal jeopardy to the president from today's verdict. As we all know, this involves things that they are not connected to Manafort's work on the campaign or the Manafort service to Donald Trump. I think at most the president is guilty of making a very poor personnel decision when he chose Manafort to be his campaign chairman. CHAFFETZ: But the reason that the president picked Manafort, I mean, that could be debated, but the question about whether -- there's a reason why the special counsel, right, decided to push this off for a different prosecutor rather than holding it for himself, correct, Tom? DUPREE: Well, the Manafort, remember, was tried by the special counsel's team so I think this part of the case, Mueller is kind of keeping close to heart. Now look, I agree with you that if Manafort were -- CHAFFETZ: But why are they doing that? I guess the point I should make, to word it better was, why do that? Is he now putting the squeeze on Mr. Manafort, saying hey look, I made my case. You are going to be convicted here. You've been convicted and now I'm going to put the squeeze on you. You better cough something up on Donald Trump or I'm going to actually -- is that is what's -- where this is going? DUPREE: Jason, I bet you that Mueller and Mueller's team has been putting the squeeze on Manafort for many, many months now, and he hasn't caved. I suppose the pressure will continue although at this point, obviously Manafort has lost a lot of the leverage that he had at the outset given that he now stands criminally convicted. That said, it's possible that at some point they'll reach a deal. As we know, Manafort has another trial coming up in a few months, so there might be an opportunity to do some wheeling and dealing. Although I tend to think if Manafort has something of value to give to Mueller and he was willing to turn it over to Mueller, you'd think Mueller would have it by now. CHAFFETZ: All right, let's talk about Michael Cohen because that is a different scenario. And Vinoo, I want to give you the first shot at that. How do you read that situation? VARGHESE: The first thing, I actually think this is a big political victory for the Republicans today, with announcing that Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, paid hush money to a porn star and playboy model. There's no debate that President Trump has better taste in women than Bill Clinton. He's an attorney. This is a guy who has committed a crime, multiple crimes, tax evasion, violation of campaign finance laws. He is going to be automatically disbarred. The question is how much time is he going to face behind bars. The deal says 43 to 63 months but that judge can give much more than that. That is the reality of the case. So for him, it leaves open the possibility of cooperating. There is still an opportunity to cooperate. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that December date is pushed back. CHAFFETZ: Harmeet, how do you read this situation and I think it's pretty interesting who Michael Cohen picked as his attorney because Lanny Davis is obviously no friend of Donald Trump but very close in proximity to Hillary Clinton. DHILLON: Well, a couple of things to give in mind about Michael Cohen. You know, he is a guy who tapes his clients, that he's a guy, who a few months ago, when he was looking at potentially 60 years in prison for these potential charges, that point he was saying the president had nothing to do with any of this stuff and, you know, there is no campaign finance issue. Fast-forward to today when, you know, you're facing 60 years in prison and the alternative is potentially five years in prison and you can get that five-year deal if you say that a couple of things that aren't crimes are crimes and pin them on the president. So I think that the overwhelming power of the prosecutors here in those situations and every situations where it's a federal prosecution, have led to this result. And Lanny Davis has really sold his client out because I think it is a real stretch, and I'm a lawyer who does election law, campaign finance, it's a real stretch to say that somebody who deals with paying off hush money to a blackmailer is necessarily trying to affect the outcome of an election. I suspect that throughout his career, Donald Trump has been approached by women like who have, you know, shaken him down and this is a standard way that people are paid off and so, you know, I don't see the campaign finance violation here at all. And so, you know, it is really unfortunate that he was forced into the situation and have done this, but, you know, again, A, nothing to do with collusion or Russia and B, no crime here for the president. CHAFFETZ: All right, Jonathan Turley, a noted attorney, was on Fox News earlier. Let's listen to him and then Tom, I would like to get your reaction to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW PROFESSOR: Unless its unidentified candidate is Bernie Sanders, it's going to be bad news. I mean, you're already not paying attention, because if the prosecutors accept what is in this indictment, then the president just became an unindicted co- conspirator. That's the simple matter of it. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: Tom, you've got deep experience at the Department of Justice. Is Jonathan Turley right? DUPREE: Well, not quite. The way I look at it is look, for one thing, the fact that Cohen pleaded to a particular charge doesn't mean that other people are automatically deemed guilty. I mean, that is why we have trials, that's why you have evidence, that's why we have juries to make these determinations. I will also say that one of the most complex and byzantine areas in the entire sphere of federal law is the election code and lawyers will argue to the nth day about whether something constitutes an election violation or it doesn't and I think this is no different. For me, what this ultimately is going to come down to is whether Cohen has something other than his own word that this is what happened, that these payments were made for the purpose of influencing a campaign, that they were done at the direction of presumably Donald Trump. If Cohen has Trump on tape, if Cohen has evidence to support his allegations, then it could pose greater jeopardy for the president, but right now, all we know is it's just Cohen's word against presumably the president's word. CHAFFETZ: But there are tapes and is Trump team able to hear and listen to all of those tapes if they are in the possession of the special prosecutor or is that something that they've only maybe heard snippets of? DUPREE: My guess is the president has not heard everything that is in the possession of the prosecutors. I mean, lord knows what sorts of things Cohen was taping. There have been some tapes that address some of the subject matter of today's indictment. We don't know if those are all of them and the tapes that we have heard have been somewhat ambiguous to say the least. CHAFFETZ: But Vinoo, I have a hard time believing that this is the -- first of all, I haven't heard the word Russia yet and collusion. You haven't seen anything there regarding Russia and collusion, have you? VARGHESE: That's not what this -- that's not what this is about. CHAFFETZ: I know but this is what the special prosecutor is spending all of his time, about a guy who is dealing with medallions on taxis -- VARGHESE: Well, that's the tax evasion part of it, right. So, you have here Donald Trump's personal lawyer, the man who said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump, who has now said in open court that the direction of the candidate, he funneled this money to influence the election, right? So, the question of Russia collusion, that's a separate question. The fact is -- CHAFFETZ: What's the prime question of what the prosecutor is supposed to be going for? VARGHESE: But he has a broad mandate. As he said, he can investigate different things and all of these came from this, and the fact is now you have Trump's national security advisor, his former campaign chairman -- CHAFFETZ: Which they delayed, right? They delayed the -- VARGHESE: His campaign chairman -- CHAFFETZ: -- and there is a lot of evidence out there that he was manipulated along the way. VARGHESE: -- all guilty. CHAFFETZ: So Harmeet, last word, how do you read the situation going forward? What happens next? DHILLON: Well, I mean, obviously the left in this divided country is going to go crazy like Vinoo just did, you know, imputing guilt by association here but, you know, this is a tragic tale of a lawyer gone awry in many ways. It's unfortunate for him personally, but the president is very focused on his agenda. He's popular. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't affect his popularity one bit because people are beginning to see the results in this country. And yet after all this money, all this effort, all this drama, all these indictments, all he's got is zero to do with Russian collusion. The only person who committed campaign finance violations with respect to Russia, with respect to foreign countries, is Hillary Clinton, and she never got indicted. So, I think this really underscores for the president's position that this is a witch hunt and it has no legitimacy and needs to end. VARGHESE: The Mueller investigation is not over. CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciated it. Harmeet, gentlemen, thank you and we do appreciate it. Authorities say the murder suspect in the Molly Tibbetts case is an illegal immigrant. We'll have the details on this shocking situation directly ahead. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: The 34t-day search for missing Iowa college student, Mollie Tibbetts ended today in tragedy. I can't even -- seriously, as a parent, I can't even imagine going through this. Authorities charge Christian Rivera today with Mollie's murder saying the 24-year-old led police to what is believed to be her dead body at an Iowa cornfield. And in a stunning revelation, authorities say Mr. Rivera is an illegal immigrant. President Trump weighed in on this case tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in very sadly from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman. It should have never happened. CHAFFETZ: Joining me now for reaction, our immigration attorney Michael Wilde, former Los Angeles police department detective Mark Fuhrman, and Bill Gavin, former assistant FBI director in New York. Gentlemen, I thank you all for being here. Unfortunately, you've had experience with these types of horrific cases and we want to get your insight because not only is the family going through an amazing tragedy, but the police work, the 34 days I think is an important thing that we also look at and we want to get your perspective Mark, I would like to go to you first. What is your assessment of how law enforcement dealt with this case and does it sound to you, again, A, it's an allegation, and B, it is still very early in this process. But based on what you've seen so far, in your professional experience, what is your assessment? MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER LAPD DETECTIVE: Well, I think the written media kind of skips over the police investigation making it seem like it all happened in a day or two, but I think they were very patient. I think they approached it very intelligent and a very skillful approach once they had a suspect when it got to interrogation. The suspect just sit and walk in and start giving up information. They had enough investigative tools at their disposal to actually prod that suspect into somewhat of an -- somewhat of a confession. He leaves out that he actually murdered the victim, but I think the police did an incredible job on this. CHAFFETZ: Yes, I mean, he says he actually blacked out during the time that the actual murder happened. But Bill, you have experience in the FBI. If somebody leads you to the body, is there any more evidence that you need that maybe this was the actual perpetrator? BILL GAVIN, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: I don't think there is any doubt he's the perpetrator and I agree with Mark, I think the police did a terrific job. One of the concerns that I have is, how long did he stock her? By what means did he kill her? Strangulation, blunt force trauma, stabbing, whatever, where she sexually molested? I think the other thing, Jason, that concerns me is he was in the country, they say, four to seven years, four years in Volusia (ph) County, and maybe three years someplace else. They have to go back and look and see has there been any other crime similar to this? There is no doubt he stalked her. Has there been any other crime similar to this, any place that he has been? Has he been in one of the sanctuary cities where everything goes anyway? Where has he been? What has he done? CHAFFETZ: Because he was charged with first-degree murder, does that lead you to believe that he was stalking her as opposed to a chance happening she was running, he was driving by and decided, hey, this might be a good target? GAVIN: I think that probably he was stalking her. I think the police did a marvelous job. You know, they didn't let out any information until they had all the details pretty well-collected and lined up for the information that they give out this afternoon. They did a marvelous job with this. And another thing, you know, when you get -- we get so many people complaining about cameras, you know, their civil liberties are violated when they appear on a camera, the police did such a great job in contacting people as they went through this. They found somebody who had a camera who saw the Chevy Malibu, who actually saw the runner. What a great job they did, and have hats off to the police department. CHAFFETZ: Now look, it's a smaller law enforcement organization. It's not like the Los Angeles police department with untold number of assets at their disposal for a smaller department like that to do this kind of police work. But Michael, it does beg the question -- he is here joining me in studio -- this person should have never been in the country in the first place, correct? I mean, it's an allegation but he should have never been here, right? MICHAEL WILDES, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: Thank you for having me Jason. A horrible, senseless act of violence -- my heart goes after the family. There should be full consequences to this man for committing this murder, for the rest of his life. The truth is that the political arena of immigration is not going to be satiated through legislation. You can't to legislate your way out of a murder. It's many ways a sad -- CHAFFETZ: You can put up a wall. You can enforce -- you can start expelling people that are here illegally. WILDES: I understand but when you look at the facts, we have U.S. Marines that marry foreign nationals and the vetting here is critical. Even if you vet, you have more U.S. citizens craving (ph), more heinous crimes than undocumented or legally permitted -- CHAFFETZ: But he would have never -- he would have never been able to even have a chance to commit a crime if he was not (ph) here in the first place. WILDES: You are saying then, Jason, that we really need to shut our doors and not have them here. I don't know that you can stop a murder steadily despite all of the walls -- CHAFFETZ: You can shut it off. If he's here illegally, that says to me, at least on the first blush, that he should have never been here. What about the million people we bring in legally and lawfully? I have a higher moral obligation, I think this country does to those people than it does -- WILDES: I agree. And I agree also with the other two speakers here, the former director of the FBI and the officer, because in all truth, when it comes down to it, the beautiful police work that is being done, the system here, should stand and we should have redundancies between state, local, and federal crimes, so that the vetting doesn't stop. What about the people who radicalize who are citizens when they travel internationally and come back to the U.S.? CHAFFETZ: And you know what -- WILDES: If a local cop gets them and then reports it redundantly to our intelligence services, yes, Jason, we should be able to stop this but we cannot blame immigrants as the scapegoat because they do a lot -- CHAFFETZ: Well, I'm blaming this one. I'm blaming this one. WILDES: -- as I am too as a father. CHAFFETZ: And I worry, again, we don't have a total immigration debate here, but there is a difference between being here illegally and being here legally. You do a disservice to the legal immigrants by just saying, well, this guy was an immigrant. No, he wasn't, he was an illegal immigrant. So, we'll see. It's an allegation at this point. I want to get back to the case here. And Mark, he's being charged with first-degree murder. What is it going to take in order to prove that? What would police have to see in order for a prosecutor to feel comfortable that, yeah, it was actually first-degree? FUHRMAN: Well, it's first-degree because he wasn't involved with the victim. It wasn't a hot blood murder where he was involved in an argument with a spouse or a live-in girlfriend. This was a directed intent murder where he actually formed the intent, which can be formed in just a matter of seconds to actually kill her. And they are going to do this forensically. They've got him to get to the point of capturing her, and then he blocks out until he's -- she's in the trunk. So, they are going to fill that gap in forensically. They are going to have the cause and method of death. They are going to try to get as much DNA. The problem here is, 30 days in the elements, insects, animals, and the heat, which is the average temperature is about 87 degrees in Iowa at this time of year. That creates a lot of decomposition, but I think they are going to achieve their goal and they will get a first-degree conviction. CHAFFETZ: Bill, is the FBI, is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, helping these smaller departments and agencies? Do they have the types of resources and can they quickly turn this around to help a smaller agency such as in Iowa? GAVIN: Absolutely. That is why the FBI has resident agencies all over the country, in the smaller areas. And the participation of agents and police officers and sheriffs offices is terrific today. Plus, there's the opportunity for the bureau to run classes and whatnot and for police departments, larger police departments, to run those kinds of classes for smaller police department as well. But the spirit of cooperation is there. Anytime any police department want something done, in comes to the bureau, it will absolutely get done any place in the country -- CHAFFETZ: Well, the FBI, I think one of the great bright spots for the FBI these days is the work that they do and the forensic labs there at Quantico and whatnot. But Michael, I want to ask you one last question here. This kid is in a tough situation -- I don't want to say kid, but I'll call him a punk or a killer, at least a wedge. He's going to be in a very difficult situation. Does he have any chance of wiggling out of this at this point? WILDE: We saw sadly with the Kate Steinle case, where the state did not bring a good prosecution. The forensics of these very distinguished law enforcement officers spoke about today, and I'm a former federal prosecutor myself, is just the first step. The prosecution has to be ironclad. And I would agree, it has to be strong and with due process to make sure that we send the message out. Tonight is not immigration, that we don't scapegoat immigrants because of this son of a gun's work. CHAFFETZ: Just the illegal immigrants. Mark, I want to give you the last very quick word. What are the immigration policies happening right now? How is that affecting the Los Angeles area? FUHRMA: Well, I can tell you this, we never know what crimes are not committed because an illegal alien is stopped at the border. That is indisputable. You can't even argue that point. But the flood of illegal immigrants that are gang members is what is the catastrophic effect in communities and you can't control this by saying we are going to let some come across the border and we are not going to let others. It's got to be legal immigration policy or no immigration illegally. I mean it's an issue that can't be debated, that if you let somebody come in illegally and they are criminal, they are going to commit crimes, just like this crime. CHAFFETZ: Gentlemen, thank you. I wish we had more time to discuss this, but this case will go on, but for the meantime, god bless that family and what they are doing tonight, the friends and family in that community. Governor Mike Huckabee is here to discuss the political fallout of all of today's major stories. Stay with us. He's up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: There is major potential political fallout for the Manafort and Cohen stories, plus Mollie Tibbetts murder case. But with me to break it all down is former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Governor, I really do appreciate you joining me this evening. You saw the Cohen news. You saw the Manafort news. You heard obviously about the tragic death of Mollie Tibbetts. But what is your political read about what is going on, particularly with Manafort and Cohen, how is this going to play out to the average American? MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: It was not the best day for the president because two people closely associated with him either were convicted or pled guilty. Whether or not that stink ends up on him, time will tell. I think a lot of a his supporters are not going to be persuaded by an attorney who has admittedly lied, and by someone who did things that had nothing to do with Donald Trump and happened years before he was even briefly associated with the campaign. But let's be honest, this is not the kind of thing that if you are Donald Trump, you want to have at the end of the day, two converging legal issues. But in the great scheme of things, most people recognize this had nothing to do with Russia, which was the whole point of the Mueller investigation, and it also doesn't really show that there is a singlehanded form of justice being applied to Democrats like Hillary Clinton, whose campaign funded the Russian dossier, and all of these things surrounding the president. So I don't think that we know whether it's going to have a big impact. My guess is in a long term, it doesn't. But time will tell. I do think there is a huge impact on this issue with Mollie Tibbetts, and what a heartbreaking situation. And Congressman, I heard what you said a moment ago, couldn't agree with you more. You can't look at this just from a raw political standpoint. As you said, you look at this as a father, as a dad. And I just can't even get my arms around the grief of Mollie Tibbetts' family. And the fact that this person shouldn't have been here, if there is not a pushback against open borders and sanctuary cities and the Philadelphia mayor dancing in his office over sanctuary cities, I don't know what is. CHAFFETZ: Look at the average voter. I understand where Republicans will be leaning one side and the Democrats will be leaning -- but this truly independent person, the person who is maybe not watching every story and reading every news article that comes out, personally, I don't believe that the Cohen and Manafort story really moves the meter in any one direction, especially when they've lost so much credibility of the last two years. But what does touch the heart, what does touch people's emotion is what happened to Mollie Tibbetts, because they can relate to her, and she was murdered. And all the polls are showing that the number one issue is immigration. So people say don't politicize it, but how do we talk about it and at the same time not be criticized for being -- just throwing politics out. HUCKABEE: I find it interesting, Congressman, that you've got a lot of Democrats saying we shouldn't be politicizing the Mollie Tibbetts' murder, but they are the very ones that absolutely overwhelmingly politicize Parkland school shooting and every shooting that happens. It's a natural emotional reaction, but what we have to do is examine policies to determine, can we fix this, can we do better? There is not a lot of sympathy among even Republicans for Paul Manafort for tax evasion or for lying about bank documents. I don't care who you are, Democrat or Republican. You ought to have to pay up for that, and he is going to. And if Michael Cohen committed crimes then he is going to have to answer for that. But just because they knew Donald Trump or had a relationship with him does not mean that whatever they did is automatically attached to the president, certainly not Manafort. But all of us were attached to the unnecessary death of a young lady whose life was ahead of her and who is dead because we have a broken immigration system. And I think the Republicans have a great opportunity to say, let's fix this, and say to the Democrats, work with us to fix it, and if you don't, then please don't tell us that you care about murder of these girls and the immigration policies that we've got to fix. CHAFFETZ: Governor, I really do appreciate your perspective. Very kind of you to join us this evening. There are other sides to this story. Another perspective on the other side of the aisle, so joining me now is Democratic strategist Jason Nichols. Jason, thank you so much for being here. I do appreciate it. I want to pick up where we left off with Governor Huckabee. The polling I've seen saying the number one issue going into the election prior to this week is immigration. And so yesterday, we ran stories about a person who was supposedly with his wife going to the hospital but ICE picked her up, and then they ran all the stories about how heartless ICE was, but it ends up that he was just wanted for murder, and that the Mexican government wanted us to detain him. Here, today, we have the allegation of the murder by an illegal immigrant, again, an allegation of a young woman who was going to be a junior in Iowa. How is this not an issue? And how is it that Democrats think that they can actually take the positions that they have on immigration and win? JASON NICHOLS, PH.D., LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I don't think anyone says this is not an issue and really quickly, I just want to send my heartfelt condolences out to the Tibbetts family, and also to the University of Iowa. I'm at the University of Maryland and we have had some recent high-profile deaths, and I have had students who have passed away, so I want to send my condolences to that entire community. I don't think Democrats are saying that immigration is not an issue, and as a matter of fact, many are saying that this is a major issue and that we need comprehensive immigration reform. This is something that you, as a member of Congress, or former member of Congress, know that both sides of the aisle agree that this is a major issue. We just don't agree on how to fix it. We don't think that separating families was the way to go about it. We don't think that some of the cruel policies that Donald Trump has promoted -- CHAFFETZ: Wait a second. Donald Trump didn't think we should be separating families either. That was something started in the Obama administration. NICHOLS: Come on, Jason. CHAFFETZ: That's true factually. NICHOLS: That is absolutely untrue. You know that catch and release -- CHAFFETZ: Yes, I do know. I was on the immigration subcommittee at the Judiciary Committee and I sat there and listened to Democrats on this issue. NICHOLS: And catch and release was the Obama policy. I understand, Jason. And catch and release with the Obama policy. You might say that that was flawed. CHAFFETZ: Yes, I would. NICHOLS: And separation of families, zero tolerance, was the Trump policy. So these separation of families was a Trump policy -- CHAFFETZ: Wasn't an Obama policy? You know it was. NICHOLS: The separation of families was not an Obama policy. CHAFFETZ: You're telling me those pictures were not under Barack Obama? NICHOLS: And this sounds a lot like what about-ism. You are better than that, Jason. CHAFFETZ: No, facts will prove that you're wrong on that one. But keep going, Jason. I like -- keep going. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. Democrats are advocating, some big people like Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Warren are advocating the abolishment of ICE. I have never seen a national party win an election by advocating getting rid of law enforcement and trying to demonize them as if they are doing something wrong other than enforcing the law. How is that a winning issue for Democrats? NICHOLS: Again, this is oftentimes misunderstood. I think what people are calling for when they say the abolition of ICE, they are talking about restructuring ICE. We think that ICE definitely does a great job when they are catching cybercriminals and catching child pornographers and doing many of the jobs that -- CHAFFETZ: Murderers. NICHOLS: We know that many of them, actually, a couple, I think it was 19 members of ICE said we want to focus on those important jobs, not on separating families and doing some of the other things that -- CHAFFETZ: You are so conflating the issue. ICE does not detain those people. NICHOLS: No, it's border patrol. CHAFFETZ: They don't. When people come across the border illegally, they don't necessarily going to ICE detention. NICHOLS: No, no, no. CHAFFETZ: It is homeland -- NICHOLS: Again, you are misunderstanding what it is that I am saying. Of course we know that ICE is not responsible for border enforcement, that is CPB, Border Patrol. What I'm saying is that ICE does, in the community that I used to live in, many years ago, they use to actually do raids that all kinds of things and separate hardworking families. And so one of the things that we are saying is that we need to restructure this particular law enforcement agency, just because ICE is a relatively new agency, as a matter of fact. CHAFFETZ: That the Democrats helped create, by the way. And they are enforcing laws the Democrats voted and supported for. Jason, I wish I could keep going with you because I love these kinds of debates. And I know you believe wholeheartedly in what you are saying and I hope we have you back on this program again. But I've got to keep moving on. Thank you, Jason. NICHOLS: I believe it because it's true. Thank you, Jason. CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Protesters topple a Confederate statue at the University of North Carolina. Is it mob rule or justified? We'll debate it next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: A wild scene in the University of North Carolina yesterday. Protesters taking down Confederate statue that had been on campus for more than 100 years. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SHOUTING) (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: University leaders condemned the students' actions and are cooperating with a criminal investigation. Joining me now for reaction are Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21, and civil rights attorney Eric Johnson. Eric, I want to start with you. It's the day before school starts. The students are gathered, they are for a couple of hours, and then next thing you know, they are not just engaging in free speech, but they are actually engaging in taking this thing down. What is your take on this? Is this free speech or is this sort of mob rule? What is your take on it? ERIC JOHNSON, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I think it is really a combination of both. It is an expression of free speech in the fact that many people are upset with the images that a lot of these studies portray. However, the fact that they did destroy public property is something of the university will take into consideration. Their methods in handling it are something that may not have been the best, however, I do believe that the university administration needed to take into consideration the sentiment in that particular community as it related to these statues, not only from individuals who didn't like them, but also some of the sentiment that they may infest and grow in individuals who seem to support them in that outdated way of thinking. CHAFFETZ: And Eric, they are may be a legitimate debate there, but aren't you concerned that here in a college campus, all of a sudden they are just saying, hey, they are allowing this to continue, cops are called in. I mean, this is breaking the law, is it not? JOHNSON: It is breaking the law, but you have to understand, you also have similar situations if the university had won the championship. There's also a lot of vandalism and things that goes on then. So at least this particular time it is not just a simple celebration of a sporting event, but these individuals are actively exercising their free speech rights and doing something that -- CHAFFETZ: But it went overboard. I want to bring in Horace here, because it wasn't just simply free speech. It was breaking the law, correct? JOHNSON: I understand it was breaking the law. CHAFFETZ: No, no, I want to go to Horace. We got Horace here with us as well. Horace, jump in here. HORACE COOPER, COCHAIR, PROJECT 21: Couple of things. One, to equate what happens when college students drink too much, become overly exuberant, and celebrate, and resulting damages with intentional destruction of private property, those are not one in the same. Those are not to be treated the same way. Yes, some damages can result from both, but we have to be very, very vigilant about making sure we are not telling young people that when you have a personal or political difference that the way to resolve that is with the use of force. CHAFFETZ: Eric, do you agree with that or disagree with it? Horace makes a great point. Do you agree or disagree with that? JOHNSON: I would agree to a point. The fact is, we never want individuals to resort to violence to solve anything. However, we have to look at the underlying reason at which the violence is being exhibited. CHAFFETZ: Absolutely. But you are saying is justified? JOHNSON: I never said that it was justified -- COOPER: You absolutely are -- JOHNSON: I'm not saying that it's justified. What I'm saying is, the fact is, you have to understand what is going on, and if you have rioting situations where they go on, whether they are for celebration or whether they are for the expression of free speech, they both have to be looked at for exactly what they are. So in this particular situation, we have a Confederate statue, which is a divisive symbol on that campus that was toppled down. So therefore, there is an understandable reason for that. CHAFFETZ: Eric, should those people will be prosecuted? Yes or no? Yes or no? JOHNSON: I do believe in some form or fashion there should be some punishment because they did, as I stated, in an ordered society you do not want the destruction of public property. CHAFFETZ: Horace, what is your take? What should happen to the students that engaged in this? JOHNSON: They should be held accountable. Here's the problem. The real problem is this -- Democrats put up the statues. Democrats engaged in behavior during my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents lifetime terrorizing them. What we have learned from this event is there are people that, just like they did at the turn-of-the-century, justified this behavior, called it underlying conflicts and concerns. We have a similar mindset at work today. If you wish to remove the statues, there should be a political conversation and a process. The mob violence was not appropriate when it terrorized black Americans in the 19th and 20th century, and it's not appropriate now in the 21st century. CHAFFETZ: Horace, well said. Eric I appreciate you being here for the debate. It will continue on, but I thank you both for your perspectives. You wouldn't think Hollywood celebrities could debase themselves any further with their blind hatred of President Trump, but you're wrong, you're wrong, because details are coming up after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Hollywood's cultural rot on full display last night's MTV Video Music Awards. The show in theory is supposed to honor the best in the music industry. Instead, it often devolved into anti-Trump antics in their cheapest form. Here is a sample. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand we are live coast-to-coast right now. I'm looking at this like it's game day, people. But do not worry, because at this game you are allowed to kneel. You can do whatever the hell you want. No old white man that can stop you. You never know what's going to happen at the VMAs. I mean, bad language, people running to the bathroom and sending out crazy tweets. It's basically like a typical day at the White House. In your face, Trump, suck it! (END VIDEO CLIP) CHAFFETZ: At least MTV wasn't rewarded. The ratings are in and they were the worst ever in history the VMAs. When will they realize how utterly disconnected they are from the average Americans? Joining me tonight with reaction, Lisa Boothe is a Fox News contributor and Josh McBride is an entertainment and lifestyle expert. Josh, I remember when MTV was all about Duran Duran and Men at Work. I'm that old to remember when MTV started, and now it has devolved into this thing that -- I can't even recognize the hatred that's out there and what they are spewing and what they are showing. What is your take on that? And why do you think of the ratings are literally at their all-time lowest levels? JOSH MCBRIDE, LIFESTYLE AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPERT: I think these are two separate issues. The first one being, are they spewing hatred over these two comedians doing their job on a network that has always been incredibly inclusive of sexuality, sexual orientation, race, religion, when we have a president that is not that inclusive. So when we are talking about -- CHAFFETZ: But what is inclusive about their message that they are saying about enforcing the law, that sort of thing? MCBRIDE: But isn't the law, the Constitution say freedom of speech, as well? So if two comedians, two African-American comedians are up there targeting a network and are on a network that is an incredibly inclusive of people that this president has been -- lack there of a better term -- not interested in, doesn't care about -- CHAFFETZ: Driving their unemployment levels to record -- MCBRIDE: But let's stick with one thing. From a race perspective, from an inclusive perspective, from supporting of gay rights, things like that. Let's talk specifically about those things. CHAFFETZ: The president hasn't done anything that is antigay rights. MCBRIDE: OK, this is a longer conversation. But as far as sticking with this, this was a moment for two comedians who have freedom of speech. And this is what comedians do. CHAFFETZ: There were a lot of people though, Lisa, that didn't think it was too funny, right? LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm sure a large proportion of the population that voted for President Trump didn't feel included last night watching the VMAs. Look, it is such an unoriginal idea now to hate the president and to be critical of him in Hollywood. It's almost so boring now, right. It's not even interesting anymore. They hate him, they go out and make these statements, and there is no shock value anymore, either. After Kathy Griffin held his head up, or a fake version of his head up, Snoop Dogg shoots him in a video, Madonna threatens to blow up the White House, there is no shock value anymore. It's boring. So be more original, Hollywood. And also, you look under President Trump, the Emmys have had the lowest ratings ever. Oscars, lowest rating ever, VMAs, lowest ratings ever. NFL has also taken a significant hit. What is the common denominator with all of this? They've all gone overtly political. Can we just have entertainment and have us be entertaining without politics injected in it? I just want to have fun. MCBRIDE: But why are we so surprised that Hollywood is so left? We do this after every -- BOOTHE: We're not, but it's gotten so pathetic now. It's not even interesting. It's not even entertaining anymore. They're not even original. CHAFFETZ: But everyone is cheering in that audience. MCBRIDE: Because they all share the same viewpoint. But the rest of America doesn't because they're not tuning in. CHAFFETZ: If I don't want that viewpoint, I am going to change the channel -- BOOTHE: Like I did. I didn't even bother with it. CHAFFETZ: But that is every TV show now, let's be honest here. MCBRIDE: It's not Fox News, I'll tell you that. CHAFFETZ: That's literally every awards show -- BOOTHE: And all those ratings are going down, down, down. MCBRIDE: Everything is going digital. I don't think we can really say -- BOOTHE: People tuned in for \"Roseanne.\" People tune into things that they want to watch. Unfortunately you look at all of these, as I mentioned, the VMAs, the Emmys, the Oscars, even the NFL, everything that has gotten so overtly political, people are tuning out. They just want to be entertained. They don't want the volatility, they don't want the hostility, they just want something that is supposed to be entertaining to be entertaining. MCBRIDE: And this is the fundamental problem, the people that preach the most tolerance, they are the least tolerant among them. They used to be people like Jay Leno and whatnot, they picked on both sides. But when it is so one-sided, that is what is wrong. I've got to leave it there. I could go for a half-hour. But we'll be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHAFFETZ: Many thanks for Laura Ingraham for allowing me to guest host tonight. But before we go, a quick plug for my new upcoming book. It's called \"The Deep State, How an Army of Bureaucrats Protected Barack Obama and Is Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda.\" It's available now for preorder online and hits the bookstores on September 18th. I spent eight and half years in Congress, eight and half months writing this book, I hope you check it out and get it. That's all the time we have tonight. I'm Jason Chaffetz in for Laura Ingraham. I'll be back tomorrow night. But again, my favorite person at Fox News, Shannon Bream is up next. Shannon, take it away. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "Growing caravan from Central America gets closer to U.S. despite warnings from President Trump; reaction and analysis from 'The Five.' President Trump turned to an unlikely source Tuesday evening to find\u00a0support for his hard-line immigration policies: his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump tweeted a 2005 video in which Obama, then a senator, made a statement\u00a0against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment \"I agree with President Obama 100%\". \"We are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States,\" Obama says in the 31-second clip. \"But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently\u00a0and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.\" Obama is not the only Democrat cited by Trump and his supporters\u00a0to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President Bill Clinton, whose State of the Union address in 1995 featured the following: \"All Americans ...\u00a0are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,\" Clinton said that night. \"The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.\" \"We are a nation of immigrants,\" Clinton added. \"But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.\" Tuesday's tweet came as the Trump administration wrestles with what to do if a caravan of some\u00a07,000 people that originated in Central America arrives at the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0The march appeared to begin as a group of about 160 who decided to band together in Honduras for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone; it\u00a0snowballed as the group moved north. It now has thousands of people and is facing more than 1,000 miles, likely farther, to the end of the journey. The caravan comes on the heels of a surge in apprehensions of families at the southern border, which has given Trump a fresh talking point to rally his base ahead of next month's midterm elections.\u00a0Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border during the budget year 2018 were families and children \u2014 about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, suggested that the administration make a \"third party\" agreement with Mexico that would force any caravan members seeking asylum to do so in their country of arrival \u2014 Mexico. The lawmakers said the process already works that way in Europe. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Before the big game. Bret, thanks so much. See you later. So, we've got three days, four hours, and 59 minutes until Election Day officially begins. And tonight we've got two presidents in the middle of it all, battling it out in a blitz to win voter support. On the left side of your screen, that's where in moments we are going to see President Obama in Georgia. He is campaigning for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. This is a very hot race. One we're watching very closely. That's going to happen in a moment. Then, on the right-hand side of your screen, another huge race, this one in Indianapolis as President Trump makes stop number two of the day. In Indianapolis, he's going to be there in the Senator Joe Donnelly and Mike Braun race. He's on the Braun side, of course, he is the Republican there. And he was in as I said, West Virginia, earlier this morning. So, good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, live in Washington, D.C. tonight. Just a short time ago, the president said something very interesting. He acknowledged the possibility that his party could lose the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Democrats and it could happen -- it could happen. We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate. What could happen? And you know what you do my whole life, you'd only to say, don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out. MACCALLUM: That -- that's an unsurprising comment, right? That it -- that sounds like the way that President Trump goes through a lot of life. And this, of course, is the scene from the caravan. We also know today. And we're going to get to this in a moment. Very strong economy, which should really in many people's minds be the main story here. But the battle over this caravan and the bruising rhetoric that surrounds it is cutting both ways with voters as some members of the caravan have now found attorneys in the United States to help them sue the White House for entry to America. Geraldo Rivera on that in just a moment. Plus, Howie Kurtz with his analysis of brand-new polls that show who the American people actually blame for stoking the flames in all of this? But first, Trace Gallagher has the story from our West Coast newsroom tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The class-action lawsuit was filed in federal court against President Trump, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security. It was filed on behalf of six Honduran migrants and their children who are part of the caravan now making its way toward the U.S. border. The lawsuit is asking the court to declare the president's policies unconstitutional. The president says, he will send up to 15,000 U.S. troops to the border, several hundred of which are already on the ground. And Mr. Trump, says undocumented migrants would be held at the border, many in tent cities. Here's how the president explained it to Laura Ingraham. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We're going to put tents up all over the place. We're not going to\u00a0\nbuild structures and spend all of this -- you know, hundreds of millions of\u00a0\ndollars. We're going to have tents, they're going to be very nice. And\u00a0\nthey're going to wait, and if they don't get asylum they get out. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: The president also says that asylum seekers would be blocked\u00a0\nfrom claiming asylum if they're caught crossing the border anywhere except\u00a0\nlegal points of entry. Current law says asylum seekers can make a claim\u00a0\nanywhere in the United States. Immigrant's rights activists argue that holding migrants in tent cities\u00a0\nviolates the Flores Act, which dictates how long and in what conditions the\u00a0\nfederal government can detain children. This summer a federal judge\u00a0\nrejected an administration request to modify the Flores Act. Those who filed the lawsuit also claim, the president's actions are nothing\u00a0\nbut a racist political ploy. But the president is not backing down, in\u00a0\nfact, it appears he is doubling down. At a rally this afternoon in West Virginia, Mr. Trump said, he won't have\u00a0\ncaravan after caravan of unvetted illegal immigrants flooding into the U.S.\u00a0\nThe president, said Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, no\u00a0\ncaravans. Martha. MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. Here now, Geraldo Rivera, Fox News\u00a0\ncorrespondent-at-large, who is been obviously following this story\u00a0\nthroughout. Geraldo, good to see you tonight. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: You know, your thoughts on the legal side of this, and the case\u00a0\nthat is being made suing -- via members of the caravan suing the United\u00a0\nStates for entry and for the possibility of asylum. RIVERA: First, Martha, let me just tell you where I am. I'm at the\u00a0\nUniversity of Arizona, my alma mater. I'm 60 miles from the Mexican border\u00a0\nhere. In a state where there is an absolute heated contentious race, a\u00a0\nbattle for Jeff Flake's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat. You've got two candidates who are fighting, both of them are pro -- you\u00a0\nknow, strict border enforcement. But one-third of Arizona's population is\u00a0\nLatino. So, it does -- it's the fourth largest Latino population anywhere\u00a0\nin the country. Davis-Monthan, the big air base just five miles from where I'm sitting\u00a0\nright now is one of the military bases that will be used -- one of the 14\u00a0\nfrontier bases that will be used for President Trump's deployment of the --\u00a0\nof the troops. As I understand, not to your specific question, Martha, as I understand the\u00a0\nlawsuit, what the filers are worried about -- what they are suing the\u00a0\ngovernment for is to ensure that, that caravan when it reaches the border,\u00a0\nthat those people are if they appear as the president has required them at\u00a0\na legal port of entry -- MACCALLUM: Right. RIVERA: The lawyers want to make sure that those migrants are allowed if\u00a0\nthey so choose to request asylum. What happens when they request asylum,\u00a0\nthen, the due process of the United States comes into play, and they are\u00a0\nrequired to be given a hearing before an immigration judge. What I would like -- and now the some of the stuff in the hurry. What I\u00a0\nwould like is rather than the president sending troops to the border, which\u00a0\nI think President Obama did it, George W. Bush did it, to no effect,\u00a0\nmeaning, full effect. What I would like to see is a mobilization of immigration judges to make\u00a0\nsure that those people once they request asylum are given a speedy hearing.\u00a0\nNot the six to eight-month wait that the president has complained about,\u00a0\nbut something measured rather in days. Martha. MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, you know what, I think that you're right about\u00a0\nthat. And I think they are going to need an army of immigration attorneys\u00a0\nbecause of the Flores rule, they're going to have a small window to process\u00a0\nthese people in. Because as the president said, they're not going to\u00a0\nrelease them. They will catch them, and then, they will hold them. And if they have legitimate asylum claims which we know a very small\u00a0\npercentage of the group generally has once they go through the process,\u00a0\nthey have -- that's in my mind, the White House's biggest jam right now.\u00a0\nBecause they've got a time clock that will tick on that as soon as it\u00a0\nbegins. How do you think they're going to handle that? RIVERA: Well, I think, first of all, the person, the people coming up in\u00a0\nthe migrant caravan, generally speaking, are impoverished people, ordinary\u00a0\npeople who want a better life for their families. They're not an army of\u00a0\nMS-13 coming. We've all seen the video. We know that. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes, but that doesn't mean that they can get asylum. What you\u00a0\njust described is not -- is not eligible for asylum. RIVERA: You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. Poverty is not\u00a0\na substantive reason for asylum. If so, as the president said, there are a\u00a0\nbillion, 2 billion poor people on earth. MACCALLUM: That's right. RIVERA: Under the poverty test, they would all be qualified for asylum.\u00a0\nThat's not these, they've got to be, for instance, the gangs killed my\u00a0\nhusband and they forced my daughter into prostitution, we had to get -- you\u00a0\nknow, there are -- there are legitimate reasons coming from -- you know,\u00a0\nthis hotbed of insecurity in Latin America. But the main thing here coming back to this race between Martha McSally and\u00a0\nKyrsten Sinema. To -- you know, very highly regarded congresspeople. Both\u00a0\nvying for Jeff Flake's open seat. They are both kind of tough on\u00a0\nimmigration, but the notion of using the military, I think is something\u00a0\nthat gives people pause. And I do believe that that's why President Trump in this last -- you know,\u00a0\nrally -- you know, bonanza weekend, before the election. Rally bonanza\u00a0\nacross the country, he is not coming here to Arizona where ordinarily, you\u00a0\nwould expect him to come. I think he -- even the president is afraid that\u00a0\nhere, he could tip this delicate balance now between the Democrat and the\u00a0\nRepublican, separated by less than half of percentage point. Martha. MACCALLUM: Perhaps. Yes. I think he's trying to build essentially a\u00a0\nhuman wall with the military. And that's his symbolic way of saying to\u00a0\nCongress. You know, either you give me the wall and we fund the wall, or\u00a0\nI'm going to have to have -- you know, a wall created by United States\u00a0\nmilitary. Because we all know that the places where people sneak in are between the\u00a0\nareas that the Border Patrol is able to cover. So, he's trying to block\u00a0\nthose gaps and -- you know, it's going to be fascinating really that she\u00a0\nhad this place up. RIVERA: I don't think they can be used -- I don't think they can be used -\n- the military can be used in that fashion. I think the military can that\u00a0\nthey want to take water to the Border Patrol, they could provide a vehicle\u00a0\nfor Border Patrol. MACCALLUM: But would they're there -- you know, in a support role. RIVERA: In a support role. MACCALLUM: But if they're standing there -- you know, that that's -- yes,\u00a0\nthey're going to be standing there. And we'll see how it close. RIVERA: It's the message they are sending. That's the most important\u00a0\nthing in Arizona, the message. MACCALLUM: That's exactly right. That's what I'm saying. Yes. Geraldo,\u00a0\nthank you. Always good to see you. Thanks for being here tonight from\u00a0\nyour alma mater, University of Arizona. RIVERA: Thank you, Martha. You too. Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, the fight has animated the worst on both sides. But a new\u00a0\npoll shows that Americans put the blame just as much on the press for\u00a0\nstoking the flames. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: This is a very big night for the President of\u00a0\nthe United States. He is all in on fear and loathing. ALISYN CAMEROTA, ANCHOR, CNN: President Trump is ratcheting up his anti-\nimmigration rhetoric, and using the White House podium to stoked fears and\u00a0\nrally Republican voters. CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, HARDBALL, MSNBC: Stoking fear, anger, and anxiety,\u00a0\nPresident Trump is going to new extremes to rile up white voters in red\u00a0\nstate America. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: And you get the idea. And President Trump hitting back at the\u00a0\nmedia today in another round of blame pointing. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You're creating violence by your questions, you know. You are\u00a0\ncreating you. And also, a lot of the reporters are creating violence by\u00a0\nnot writing the truth. The fake news is creating violence. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now at the polls and the analysis, Howie Kurtz, the host\u00a0\nof \"MEDIA BUZZ\". Howie, good to see you tonight. HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: What do you make about the press? He's pointing fingers. What\u00a0\ndo you think about all that? KURTZ: Well, he was in asked a question about a Washington Post, ABC poll\u00a0\nout today, which has a stunning finding. Which is roughly half the\u00a0\ncountry, 49 percent blames President Trump. And roughly half the country,\u00a0\n47percent, blames the news media for encouraging politically motivated\u00a0\nviolence. But the question from the ABC reporter was only about that blame Trump\u00a0\npart. So, he was punching back. And so now, we have this sort of\u00a0\nspectacle of each side blaming the other. I tend to blame the perpetrators\u00a0\nin these situations. But the media very rarely, except with this poll,\u00a0\npause to consider their own role in spreading devices. And as you saw in those clips from other networks, that's all the president\u00a0\nis fear-mongering, the president is race-baiting, the president is tearing\u00a0\nthis country apart. A lot of people out there think we are complicit as\u00a0\nwell. MACCALLUM: Yes. And you know, some of the references that we played in\u00a0\nthat montage are to immigration. They're about immigration. But the issue\u00a0\nhere is about illegal immigration. And I think that people do respond to\u00a0\nthat, you know. They say, wait a minute. No, that's not we're talking about. And they can\u00a0\nfeel that they're sometimes being kind of bulldozed into thinking of it in\u00a0\nthose terms. And I think they do react negatively to that at times. KURTZ: The press has absolutely been pounding the president as the major\u00a0\nmidterm theme. He is using immigration to rile up his base and all that,\u00a0\nand they come out and say some commentators some journalists, race-baiting\u00a0\nand it's inflammatory, and all of that. But the way in which it's covered is also divisive. And what the message\u00a0\nthat the press is sending by putting all the onus on President Trump, is\u00a0\nthat a lot of millions of Americans saying, they don't care very much about\u00a0\nthe very real problems created by illegal immigration. They just want to\u00a0\nuse it as a battering rehab against the president. At the same time, the\u00a0\npresident's rhetoric has gotten pretty hot. Sometimes uncomfortably hot. MACCALLUM: Absolutely. I want to switch gears for a moment and ask you.\u00a0\nSenator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is now\u00a0\ninvestigating two false claims about Judge Kavanaugh during that whole --\u00a0\nyou know, brouhaha. And we remember that at the time, there were a lot of Democratic Senators\u00a0\nwho were saying -- you know, there's all these other claims, we're getting\u00a0\nother phone calls that are coming in, and told we investigate every one of\u00a0\nthese -- you know, this is not a legitimate vote that we're taking. Let me put up one of the sort of findings of this investigation that was\u00a0\nreleased today. This is a woman named, Ms. Munro-Leighton, who claimed to\u00a0\nbe the author of an anonymous allegation regarding Justice Kavanaugh,\u00a0\noriginally sent to Senator Harris. When questioned by the committee investigators, she admitted that she had\u00a0\nfabricated the claim, and she confessed to the committee investigators that\u00a0\nshe just wanted to get attention. It was a tactic, and that it was just a\u00a0\nploy. KURTZ: This is a really serious matter. And I remember when there was a\u00a0\nwhite-hot debate over Christine Blasey Ford versus Brett Kavanaugh, and a\u00a0\nlot of people took Christine Blasey Ford's allegations seriously, though\u00a0\nthey were never corroborated. But then, with some of these other women jumped in, including Julie\u00a0\nSwetnick, who's their subject the first referral from Senator Grassley. I think it muddied the waters because their claims were outlandish, didn't\u00a0\nhave any backup whatsoever, and now we have the second woman who had been\u00a0\nanonymous saying, yes, I made it up. Which sort of plays into what the\u00a0\ncritics of the -- of the people who are going after Judge Kavanaugh, who\u00a0\nwere saying, which is you can't necessarily believe anybody who comes out\u00a0\nof the woodwork without evidence. MACCALLUM: You know, and you had reporters like Jane Mayer -- you know,\u00a0\npublishing stories that were not corroborated. KURTZ: Yes. MACCALLUM: Based on the same sort of situations -- (CROSSTALK) KURTZ: Julie Swetnick ended up backing off in an NBC interview. She said\u00a0\nhe spiked the punch, no, I didn't see it. She claimed that she witnessed\u00a0\nall these gang rape parties. It simply was incredible. I don't know what\u00a0\nwill happen or the referral to the Justice Department, but it does show you\u00a0\nthat in that overheated atmosphere, media in particular and the public and\u00a0\nthe politicians have been very, very careful about these explosive claims\u00a0\nif there's no corroborating evidence. MACCALLUM: He's pursuing it. And it's important, obviously to stick to\u00a0\nthe facts. Howie, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. KURTZ: Good to see you here in Washington. MACCALLUM: So, in Florida, two candidates try to win over Miami voters,\u00a0\nwhere the district is increasingly purple. You've got wealthy\u00a0\nneighborhoods, you have many Cuban Americans there. You have a lot of\u00a0\nfolks who fled New York and New Jersey for the Sunshine State. So, it's a\u00a0\nreal interesting mix of Florida voters. And it is making for quite a race\u00a0\nbetween Maria Salazar and Donna Shalala, that's coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants are\u00a0\nmade automatic citizens of the United States every year because of this\u00a0\ncrazy lunatic policy that we can end, that we can end. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: President Trump hammering home his opposition to birthright\u00a0\ncitizenship heading into Tuesday's elections and it is front and center in\u00a0\nFlorida's hotly contested 27th district. Democrat Donna Shalala is up\u00a0\nseven points over Republican Maria Salazar in the latest New York Times\u00a0\npoll, but only a few days earlier Salazar led Shalala by two points in a\u00a0\nMason-Dixon poll. So in this heavily Hispanic district, Salazar initially\u00a0\nwent after the president in this tweet saying this. President Trump, our\u00a0\nConstitution is sacred. Birthright citizenship is protected and you cannot\u00a0\nchange that by executive order. But now says that the 14th Amendment\u00a0\nshould \"be reviewed.\" Here to tell us about that House Republican candidate Maria Salazar. Good\u00a0\nto have you with us this evening. I should mention that we have also\u00a0\nreached out to your opponent and we are hopeful that she will join us on\u00a0\nMonday evening. But you heard the President, he said this is a crazy\u00a0\nlunatic law when he refers to the 14th Amendment. Do you agree with him? MARIA SALAZAR, R, CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, FLORIDA: Well, what I agree is\u00a0\nthat we need to look for an immigration reform law and that is one of them\u00a0\n-- my signature plan. Because look what you were talking about in the\u00a0\nprevious segment, look at the caravan that is arriving. What are we going\u00a0\nto do? We need to and I have called for an immigration reform law but not\u00a0\nonly that, for a summit meeting where President Trump can really show his\u00a0\nleadership, where he should call for a summit meeting between the president\u00a0\nof Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala and help them keep their boys home. That is the only way my said that is going to prevent another caravan from\u00a0\noccurring. Because as you were saying before, the Honduras is one of the\u00a0\nmost explosive countries in the hemisphere. It has one of the highest\u00a0\nmurder rates in the world. So what do you think those people are going to\u00a0\ndo? And I'm not saying that we need to allow them in, I'm not saying that\u00a0\nwe cannot protect or we should not protect our borders, what I'm saying is\u00a0\nthat we need to find a solution. And since I am from Miami, and we have\u00a0\nhundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens in my town, and I know them\u00a0\nvery well, I know what the solution is. At one point I was the Central American Bureau Chief for Univision. I\u00a0\nlived in Guatemala, I lived in El Salvador, in Nicaragua, and in Honduras,\u00a0\nand I know what they need. And I saw President Reagan showing leadership\u00a0\nin helping those people, in helping their governments to have to keep their\u00a0\nboys home. MACCALLUM: Understood. You know, when you look at your district though,\u00a0\nand you know, I mean, people have been trying to do what you're suggesting\u00a0\nand come up with comprehensive immigration reform for decades and I think\u00a0\nit's one of the greatest frustrations that the American people have because\u00a0\nboth sides just like using it against each other too much in elections\u00a0\nessentially to get anything done, but talk to me really quickly about your\u00a0\ndistrict. I only have about a minute left, because it was a Republican\u00a0\ndistrict, a lot of Cuban Americans live there. However, it also has you\u00a0\nknow, a lot of you know, northeasterners who've moved to that area. So\u00a0\nwhat do you think is the most important thing for them? What are they\u00a0\ngoing to use to decide between the two of you? SALAZAR: Well, the fact here is that I was born, raised, and I have worked\u00a0\non television in this town for 35 years. And that's why I'm sure the\u00a0\nvoters are going to prefer me over my opponent because Mrs. Shalala does\u00a0\nnot belong to the melting pot. See Miami is the ultimate melting pot in\u00a0\nthe United States and you need to be part of that social fiber. You need\u00a0\nto be part of the ultimate melting pot in order to be able to represent\u00a0\nthem in the House of Representatives. I mean the name says it, the House\u00a0\nof Representatives. And in reality, I am -- I am the person that could\u00a0\nrepresent them the best because not only I speak the language but I they\u00a0\nget me and I get them. You cannot come from outside and just want to help\u00a0\n-- won a review of the representative from Miami. MACCALLUM: We're going to be watching it very closely on Tuesday night as\u00a0\nall these returns come in. Thank you very much, Maria. Good to see you\u00a0\nagain. SALAZAR: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Maria Salazar joining us from Florida tonight. So a big win\u00a0\nfor the White House with less than four days to go until the Midterms. You\u00a0\ngot these brand-new jobs numbers that show a very healthy economy as\u00a0\nAmerica heads to the polls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: More American today, right now, this hour are working than ever\u00a0\nbefore in the history of our country. How good is that? (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So while there is a lot to argue about out there, it's pretty\u00a0\ntough for either side to not like the economic numbers that came out today.\u00a0\nToday's announcement included soaring jobs numbers of 250,000 jobs in\u00a0\nOctober. Unemployment at 3.7, haven't been there since 1969, and wages for\u00a0\nworkers rising 3.1 percent. That's a big part of that number, that's a\u00a0\nnine-year high. So here now Economist Art Laffer who served on President\u00a0\nRonald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board and did a pretty good job\u00a0\nthere and then later as an economic adviser to president Trump's 2016\u00a0\ncampaign. New book Trumponomics is out now. Art, good to see you tonight. ART LAFFER, ECONOMIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 2016 CAMPAIGN: Good to\u00a0\nsee you, Martha. MACCALLUM: You know, obviously those numbers look really good. Are you\u00a0\nsurprised this isn't more of a focus of the Midterm discussions? LAFFER: Not really. I mean, I think people are well aware of the\u00a0\neconomics. It may not be the hyperactive conversation you want to have but\u00a0\nI think they're very well aware. It's just amazing. And the changes in\u00a0\ntax policy, Martha, have been incredible. I mean the tax bill was amazing.\u00a0\nHe got it through. It's just the foundation of his policies. And if you\u00a0\nlook at the deregulation, I mean amazing here as well. If you look at the\u00a0\nmonetary policy with Powell, I mean, he's doing a great job on that. And\u00a0\nthe trade is -- MACCALLUM: So why is the president keep yelling at it him, Art? Because\u00a0\nthe presidency you know, keeps saying that he shouldn't -- he doesn't like\u00a0\nthe suggestion that he's going to continue to raise interest rates and the\u00a0\nmarket was down a little bit today. I mean, that's what -- that's what\u00a0\nsome market prognosticators are saying as you well know, that this is --\u00a0\nthat we've had the high in this GDP. What do you say? LAFFER: Well I don't -- can't explain all of Donald Trump's conversations,\u00a0\nto be honest with you. He does it -- he does it so forgive me, Martha -- MACCALLUM: We need a longer show. LAFFER: Yes, we need a longer show but Powell is doing a good job. And\u00a0\nTrump is doing a great job on trade. I mean it's working progress right\u00a0\nnow but Xi and he are going to meet in Argentina and there's a very good\u00a0\nchance we get good trade deals with China and we need China badly because\u00a0\nwithout China, Martha, there is no Wal-Mart. And without Wal-Mart, there\u00a0\nis no middle class or lower class prosperity. The U.S. needs China and\u00a0\nChina for goodness sakes really needs us and I think we're moving along on\u00a0\nthat very well. And then look at our GDP numbers growth. I mean, those\u00a0\nare pretty astounding -- MACCALLUM: Let's put the GDP number up, guys. LAFFER: Yes, and it's just great. You got to -- I don't know if you -- MACCALLUM: So -- yes, we have it up. And so you know, obviously, very\u00a0\nstrong growth in the last two quarters in particular. What's your outlook\u00a0\nfor the next two? LAFFER Well, I hope it continues. I mean, we need about -- MACCALLUM: Well, we all hope it continuous but you're the economists so\u00a0\nwhat do you think it's going to do? LAFFER: I think it's going to continue, how's that? I think we're going\u00a0\nto have a very good prosperity for the next six or seven years. I think\u00a0\nit's very much like the Reagan period, like the Kennedy period, and like\u00a0\nthe Clinton period, not Hillary, Bill. It's -- I think we're going to have\u00a0\na very strong economic growth for the next five or six years and we'll get\u00a0\nback to the types of prosperity we really would need and want. And I think\u00a0\nhe's doing a great job on the economy and I'm an economist. I can't tell\u00a0\nyou about everything else but on the economy, he's as good as I've ever\u00a0\nseen in the first term and he's not even halfway through it yet. MACCALLUM: All right, so in the 30 seconds I have left, what would be your\u00a0\none thing you would say to him, but don't do this, you know, because that\u00a0\nwould be problematic. LAFFER: Don't raise taxes, don't increase regulations. But the thing I\u00a0\nhope he does do is where we haven't succeeded which is government spending. MACCALLUM: Yes. LAFFER: We need to get control of government spending, entitlement\u00a0\nprograms, and government spending and I think that's what he is going to do\u00a0\nin his next six years. MACCALLUM: All right. And so, Art, thank you very much. (CROSSTALK) LAFFER: Thank you, Martha. It's great. I love your show by the way. MACCALLUM: Thank you. LAFFER: I really do. MACCALLUM: You can come back anytime. LAFFER: Any time you want me I'm here. MACCALLUM: It's always good to see you. LAFFER: Greta to see you. MACCALLUM: It's going to be very interesting to watch with this economy\u00a0\ngo. It's definitely not the top of my topic, but as you say, people feel it\u00a0\nin what they're doing every day. (CROSSTALK) LAFFER: Only four days left. MACCALLUM: And we'll see what happens when they walk into this voting\u00a0\nbooth. LAFFER: Yes. MACCALLUM: Art, thank you very much. Art Laffer joining us tonight. LAFFER: Thanks, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, coming up this evening, what an interesting story Missouri\u00a0\nis. Watching this race, Claire McCaskill going after a fellow Democrat for\u00a0\nwhat she said about President Trump, and she is not alone as Democrats\u00a0\nfight to win in red states. They have some very surprising messages out\u00a0\nthere. Former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile is here with a message for them tonight\u00a0\non the Story, when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Some red state Democrats, if you listen closely, sound a bit\u00a0\nlike Trump supporters in this election. Among them, at risk Indiana Senator\u00a0\nJoe Donnelly with this morning on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The radical left wants to illuminate ICE. SEN. JOE DONNELLY, (D) INDIANA: I support ICE, funding Trump's border\u00a0\nwall. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: There you go. So West Virginia's Joe Manchin split with his\u00a0\nparty voting yes for Brett Kavanaugh, while Montana's Jon Tester tells the\u00a0\nHill that Democrats botched the debate on the new Supreme Court justice. Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor joins us. What are you doing in\u00a0\nNew York, I came all the way to Washington to see you. CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR: I must owe you money,\u00a0\nI'm hiding out. I knew you are coming to town so I'm laying low up here. MACCALLUM: Good move, my man. Good move. All right. So, you know, I mean,\u00a0\nobviously they are running in red states but, you know, there's all this\u00a0\nsort of idea that there are so many progressive candidates out there, but\u00a0\nthat is certainly not what these folks think is going to win the day for\u00a0\nthem, Chris. STIREWALT: Well, look, I should start out and say, I think that these\u00a0\npeople are sincere, right. I think they are not saying things that they\u00a0\ndon't mean. But I do think this. Democrats by and large took the wrong\u00a0\nlessons from Barack Obama's election and it was that they don't need white\u00a0\nworking-class voters anymore, right? When in fact, Barack Obama did really well with white, working-class\u00a0\nvoters. There were millions of Americans who voted both for Barack Obama\u00a0\nand Donald Trump. There is a culturally conservative fiscally liberal\u00a0\nstreak that runs through a huge chunk of this electorate in states like\u00a0\nthese. This is the old new deal, Democratic coalition, and these were their\u00a0\ngrandchildren. And there are -- non-issues like immigration and others they\u00a0\nare not liberal. They are actually quite conservative, and Democrats are\u00a0\ncoming around to having seen the electoral college consequences in 2016,\u00a0\nand now looking at the Senate map in 2018. Some Democrats are understanding\u00a0\nthat they need these culturally conservative voters and they can't do it\u00a0\nwithout them. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, it so interesting because the message, you know,\u00a0\ncertainly in the presidential candidates that seem to be lining up for\u00a0\n2020, it's completely the opposite of that. So, you know, when we\u00a0\nobviously, when we see the results on Tuesday night, it's going to send a\u00a0\nvery big message out one way or the other to those future candidates. Won't\u00a0\nit, Chris? STIREWALT: Well, it should, but it won't. It should if there were smart\u00a0\nthey would pay attention to what got results and how to win. Democrats have\u00a0\nto have back the upper Midwest. They have to have that back if they want to\u00a0\nbe competitive, they've got to rebuild the blue wall and they can't just\u00a0\nleave these voters follow. Now they are expecting a good night on Tuesday but it isn't whether they\u00a0\nwin or not, it's the lesson that they take from the victories that they do\u00a0\nobtain and if they say, we are fine, we don't need to change anything, they\u00a0\nare not paying attention. MACCALLUM: All right. I want to take a look at the Arizona race and an\u00a0\ninteresting back and forth. This is obviously this is a very tight race,\u00a0\nKyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally. Listen to this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRSTEN SINEMA, D, ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE: You know in Arizona it's not new to have\u00a0\nmilitary deployment to the border to provide a support role for our customs\u00a0\nand border agents who are down there. So, we wish them well and tell them\u00a0\nto stay hydrated. REP. MARTHA MCSALLY, R\u2014ARIZONA: Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. Wow.\u00a0\nWell, my message to them is, thank you for service and your sacrifice. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I mean, this is in many ways sort of the essence of the\u00a0\ndifference between these two candidates, Chris? STIREWALT: Well, yes, but. And I think the but here is, Kyrsten Sinema is\u00a0\nan effective campaigner. MACCALLUM: Yes. STIREWALT: And she has demonstrated that she has turned around\u00a0\nsubstantially on these issues. But this is somebody who was an anti-war\u00a0\nprotester during the Iraq war, she was very left, left, left. But as she\u00a0\nhas represented a swing suburban district outside of Phoenix, what she's\u00a0\nfigured out is that doesn't play in Arizona. That's not what winds up with\u00a0\nArizona voters so she has recalibrated. And here is, she's doing the same smart thing that Claire McCaskill did in\u00a0\nMissouri which is, you don't -- if Trump is trolling you on sending up a\u00a0\njillion troop to the border, you don't have to take the bait. You're not\u00a0\noblige to oppose him. You can say, yes, cool border security is good, it's\u00a0\nfine, and take the issue away from Republicans and that's what smart\u00a0\nDemocrats do, they don't squeal. MACCALLUM: And remind them to bring their water when they go to the\u00a0\nborder. STIREWALT: And -- it's very dry out there. It's you who were just there,\u00a0\nit's very dry. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes, it's very dry out there. Chris, thank you so much, we'll\u00a0\nbe spending a lot of time together over the next few days. I look forward\u00a0\nto it. STIREWALT: See you soon. MACCALLUM: So why is Nancy Pelosi taking heat from Michael Moore for\u00a0\nsaying her party is going to win it, and that she will be back? Former\u00a0\nDemocratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile joins me next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: A Democrat-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. MOORE: -- who just automatically announced, we are going to win. And it's\u00a0\nlike, my God, that's what happened in 2016. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D\u2014CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Up until today, I\u00a0\nwould have said if the election were held today, we would win. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What happened today that change that? PELOSI: Now what I'm saying is, we will win. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Nancy Pelosi saying she will win it, her bold assertion about\u00a0\nwinning back the house not sitting well with outspoken activist filmmaker\u00a0\nMichael Moore who is worried that she is getting ahead of herself. Watch\u00a0\nthis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOORE: A Democrat-- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. MOORE: -- who just automatically announced, we are going to win. And it's\u00a0\nlike, my God, that's what happened in 2016. Everybody was throwing the\u00a0\nparty for Hillary before the election. Don't think for a second that come Tuesday, they don't have every intention\u00a0\nof holding onto the House and of the Senate. That is -- and they are good\u00a0\nat what they do and you should respect the fact that they are able to get\u00a0\naway with this. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: He saying, you got to fight until the very bitter end. Joining\u00a0\nme now, Donna Brazile, former DNC chairs and co-author for the new book,\u00a0\n\"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics.\" Donna, good to have you\u00a0\nwith us. DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: It's great to\u00a0\nsee you. Welcome to Washington, D.C. MACCALLUM: Thank you, it's great to be here tonight. BRAZILE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So which camp are you in? Are you the optimist like Nancy\u00a0\nPelosi or the it's not over till it's over Michael Moore? BRAZILE: I'm in both camps. Look, I come from the school that you have to\u00a0\nwork until the polls are closed across the country. I also believed that\u00a0\nNancy Pelosi has a real good gut instinct about what's happening out there,\u00a0\ngood quality candidates. She's been crisscrossing the country raising money\u00a0\nbut at the same time, Michael Moore is so right. You have to keep knocking on doors. We know that during midterm elections,\u00a0\nDemocrats tend not to turn out. We are more infrequent voters. Republicans\u00a0\ntreat every election like the World Series, Democrats like the World Cup. MACCALLUM: Well, you know, we heard the opposite for so long in this\u00a0\ncampaign, that Democrats were super fired up and that they were trying to\u00a0\nget Republicans more fired up. But I want to play this interesting sound bite from Claire McCaskill who is\u00a0\nobviously in a neck and neck race-- BRAZILE: Yes, sure. MACCALLUM: -- with Josh Hawley in Missouri right now. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D\u2014MO.: The crazy Democrats are people who\u00a0\nwalk in restaurants and scream in elected officials faces. The crazy\u00a0\nDemocrats are -- we have a state senator here in Missouri that actually\u00a0\nadvocated for the assassination of President Trump. That's a crazy\u00a0\nDemocrat. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think about that, Donna? BRAZILE: Well, there's a lot of people out there today that I would label\u00a0\nas, let's just say, not civil. But the truth is, we have to tone it down.\u00a0\nIt's important that Democrats, Republicans and independents, that we find a\u00a0\nway to tone down the rhetoric, it is hot out there. It is, as we call it in\u00a0\nLouisiana, it's a nasty hot. But at the same time people are very passionate. They are passionate about\u00a0\nhealthcare, they are passionate about immigration. We need to allow people\u00a0\nto speak their minds without confronting them. Look, I have Republican\u00a0\nfriends, I have Democratic friends and friends who are independents. And\u00a0\nyet, you know what I want to do at the end of the day? I want to have a\u00a0\ngood glass of wine, I want to watch football and drink beer. MACCALLUM: You know, that's the old way of Washington. It certainly\u00a0\ndoesn't feel like that anymore. BRAZILE: Yes. And by the way, are you wearing crimson red? Because you\u00a0\nknow I'm LSU. Are you not trying to send a signal here? Because go Tigers,\u00a0\ngo Tigers. And you see, we could talk about football without getting into a\u00a0\nfight. I'm trying to put on my best shade of purple. MACCALLUM: There you go. BRAZILE: Yes. MACCALLUM: So, you know, speaking of how nasty it gets, as you said. BRAZILE: Yes. MACCALLUM: This is Maria Chappelle-Nadal who is a state senator. I mean,\u00a0\nshe went after Claire McCaskill. Look at this tweet that she put out there.\u00a0\n\"Claire McCaskill is desperate. She is a piece of S. You know what, instead\u00a0\nof knowing what people of color are angered by this administration, she\u00a0\nchooses to put us and our families in harm's way. If my family is harmed,\u00a0\nblame it on Claire McCaskill. She deserves to lose. She is not a Democrat.\"\u00a0\nYour thoughts? BRAZILE: I don't know who this person is. I know who Claire McCaskill is. MACCALLUM: She is the state senator that Claire McCaskill is referring who\u00a0\ncalled for the Assassination of President Trump-- (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: Well, come on. MACCALLUM: -- which by the way she said was a mistake. BRAZILE: Look, Michelle Obama was attacked. Barack Obama was attacked. The\u00a0\nfirst lady has been attacked, Mrs. Trump, the president, OK? Cut it out,\u00a0\nit's not what we do. These are people that we have elected to lead us,\u00a0\npeople that are serving as spouses. It is important that every-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Well, I mean, Hillary Clinton called for a no stability until\u00a0\nafter the election. Eric Holder said kick them in the knees. So you're\u00a0\nagainst all that? BRAZILE: I am against what the president of the United States says every\u00a0\nday when he tweets. I'm against any elected officials using their job that\u00a0\nwe hired them to do to-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: But you are saying I want to be friends with everybody. So, are\u00a0\nyou also against Hillary Clinton calling for a no civility and Eric Holder\u00a0\nsaying kick them in the knees? BRAZILE: You know, I don't want to sit here and name calling, what are we\u00a0\ntrying to prove by calling out Hillary and Eric? President Donald Trump-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I'm just saying be fair on all sides when somebody is out of\u00a0\nline we have to call on all sides. BRAZILE: I have -- I have been fair. But you know what, my job is, my job\u00a0\nis a citizen because I'm no longer chair of the party, is to I go out there\u00a0\nand to build hope. It's to inspire the next generation to vote. I'm worried\u00a0\nthat we have a lot of millennials who have not yet decided to vote. This is\u00a0\n-- this election impacts their future, that's what I'm worried about. MACCALLUM: Oprah was certainly doing a good job getting out in Georgia. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: I love what she did yesterday, you know. MACCALLUM: But you know, I want to bring this up. Because the economy is\u00a0\ndoing so well. BRAZILE: Yes. Yes. MACCALLUM: And Jared Bernstein who was Joe Biden's former economic advisor\u00a0\ntweeting today, \"Pretty much everything you could want in a monthly jobs\u00a0\nreport. Payroll gains way up better than expected, nice pop in labor force\u00a0\nparticipation, wage growth continues, finally beating inflation.\" BRAZILE: Yes. MACCALLUM: You know, so he's very positive on the economy. BRAZILE: Right. MACCALLUM: So, you know, when you look at that, is that a difficult\u00a0\nargument for Democrats to make in terms of, you know, rolling back some of\u00a0\nthese tax cuts, rolling back some of the regulatory changes that have\u00a0\nhelped to create this economy? BRAZILE: The Democrats what they've been saying and I've looked at a lot\u00a0\nof the ads. They want an economy that works for everyone. Whether you are\u00a0\nmaking $100,000 per year, are your-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: This is what everybody is unemployment numbers are the lowest\u00a0\nthey've been in decades. BRAZILE: -- are you getting paid. But you know, when Barack Obama was\u00a0\npresident Republicans had a hard time saying good news. I'd like to good\u00a0\nnews, good news. I wouldn't care if it's good news that come from a\u00a0\nDemocrat or Republican or independent. Good news. We want people to have\u00a0\njobs. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: So you think President Trump has done a good job with the\u00a0\neconomy? BRAZILE: President Trump is not out there campaigning on the economy. He's\u00a0\ncampaigning as if people who are (Inaudible). (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: No, but that's not my question. My question is, do you think\u00a0\nthe president has done a good job with the economy so far. BRAZILE: I think that the overall the structure of our economy is good.\u00a0\nAnd while the White House is claiming credit just like Barack Obama claim\u00a0\ncredit for turning the economy around. Give credit where credit is due. We\u00a0\nshould not undermine people confidence in their country or the economy\u00a0\nsimply because they have a R or D behind their name. That's where I come\u00a0\ndown on all of this. MACCALLUM: Donna Brazile, thank you very much. (CROSSTALK) BRAZILE: I want everybody to have jobs. I want to keep my job by the way. MACCALLUM: Good to see you tonight. The book is \"For Colored Girls Who\u00a0\nHave Considered Politics.\" BRAZILE: Thank you, Martha. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here, Donna. Come back. BRAZILE: I will. MACCALLUM: Great having you here. BRAZILE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, it has been a while of high-profile celebrity endorsements\u00a0\nfor candidate across the country but does the average American care about\u00a0\ncelebrities and whether or not they will influence their vote? And it's\u00a0\nFriday, it means it's time for our ladies' night panel here to weigh in,\u00a0\nthat's coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This midterm election, exercising your right to vote is\u00a0\nas important as ever. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are very close to election day, I just want to make\u00a0\nsure that everyone knows how important it is for you to get out and vote\u00a0\nearly. OPRAH WINFREY, TV HOST: Vote, vote! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going to do that. November 6th, please vote. WINFREY: Vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So those are just some of the celebrities that are pushing\u00a0\nvoters to get involved in this election, some of them even going door-to-\ndoor to spread their message, but can Americans really be persuaded by the\u00a0\ncelebrities showing up at your door? It's a question even comedy central\u00a0\nhad a little bit of fun with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How will I know that I should vote. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If celebrities don't tell me to? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does Emily Stone think I should vote? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What about John Krasinski? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you seen a quiet place? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, but that isn't what this is about right now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's about celebrities. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Telling regular Americans that they have to vote. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Many millennial Americans like us don't know what we\u00a0\nshould do until celebrities tell us what to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Here now ladies' night. Jenny Beth Martin, Bre Payton, and\u00a0\nMarie Harf. Ladies, so has there ever been a celebrity, anybody like that\u00a0\nwho sort of made you inspired to vote for someone? JENNY BETH MARTIN, CO-FOUNDER, TEA PARTY PATRIOTS CITIZENS FUND: Not for\u00a0\nme personally to vote for someone but I can imagine it might make an\u00a0\naverage voter, I would say not exactly average, because I live, breathe,\u00a0\nand sleep politics. MACCALLUM: What do you think, Bre? BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes. I'm going to say no. I want\u00a0\nto say a hard pass. I think this is condescending and I think that we have\u00a0\nproof of this. Taylor Swift came out and endorsed a Democratic candidate\u00a0\nfor Senate in Tennessee and it hasn't moved the needle at all. His\u00a0\nRepublican opponent is up by something about seven points according to Real\u00a0\nClear Politics average. Blackburn is leading that race over there. So, I think, you know, and this is supposed to like, melts everything, this\u00a0\nis supposed to be a game-changer there and it wasn't. MACCALLUM: Yes. PAYTON: So, I think it doesn't-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You know, they are just sending -- first of all, if Will\u00a0\nFerrell showed up at my door I would just laugh hysterically. And I would -\n- if he gives me that serious message about voting, I'm just thinking that\u00a0\nlike, somewhere in there he's kidding actually, because I think he's\u00a0\nhilarious. PAYTON: Yes. MACCALLUM: All politics aside. PAYTON: Yes. MACCALLUM: But Marie, you know, Oprah Winfrey was very powerful the other\u00a0\nday. MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO CO-HOST: Yes. MACCALLUM: I mean, I could definitely see her having an impact on that\u00a0\nrace. HARF: And we saw in actually 2008 Oprah endorsing Barack Obama and then\u00a0\ncampaigning during the primaries, particularly in South Carolina, actually\u00a0\nit appears to have made a big difference in that primary. People love\u00a0\nOprah. And she doesn't get out there and talk about the Democratic Party,\u00a0\nshe talks about the candidate and certain principles, so I actually think\u00a0\nthat Oprah in a race that is as close as it's going to be in Georgia might\u00a0\nmake a difference. And look, in Tennessee, I think it's still an open question. Tens of\u00a0\nthousands of new voters registered in the 48 hours after Taylor Swift-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes. But it was the last day -- I mean, it was the last day you\u00a0\ncould register right before she said it. HARF: That was -- sure, but we will see if -- she seems to have inspired-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: So we will see. HARF: -- a number of people to register. I think that a lot of these\u00a0\nraces, Martha, are going to be so close that even if celebrities only move\u00a0\nthe needle a little bit, a little but could actually matter. MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. I think there are going to be a lot of very\u00a0\ntight races. I think we're going to see contested races. HARF: Yes. MACCALLUM: I think a lot of races aren't going to be done on Tuesday\u00a0\nnight. HARF: I agree. MACCALLUM: Speaking of celebrities, Alec Baldwin got in trouble again in\u00a0\nNew York City. Now I'm sort of sympathetic because of someone steals your\u00a0\nparking spot in New York City, it's like, you can't do that! The president\u00a0\ncame out today, there he is. He always looks like he wants to punch\u00a0\nsomebody, right? Pretty much always has that look on his face, but\u00a0\napparently, he punched a guy over a parking spot. The president was asked\u00a0\nabout it today and here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Who was arrested? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alec Baldwin. He punched someone out during a parking\u00a0\ndispute. TRUMP: I wish him luck. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: And Alec Baldwin had this to say when asked to comment on what\u00a0\nhappened. He said, \"My comment is that my show aired Sunday at 10 p.m.\" MARTIN: You now, it would be, seem to be a little bit sympathetic, he's\u00a0\ngot four kids under the age of five, and there's a parking space in New\u00a0\nYork. If he didn't have a history of this, but he has a history of punching\u00a0\npeople, photographers flight attendants. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: This could get ugly for him. He could be facing as much as a\u00a0\nyear in jail apparently, Bre. PAYTON: Yes, I mean. Sadly, this is kind of a cycle for him. Whenever he\u00a0\ncatches a break, that he does something like this. I think the timing is\u00a0\nalso kind of interesting. You hear just as the show that launched, then\u00a0\nhe's out here doing this. I mean, I'm just saying, I think it's\u00a0\ninteresting. MACCALLUM: You think, he's like I think I'm going to punch someone today\u00a0\nbecause it will be good publicity? PAYTON: No, not on punching. I just think that this tends to happen\u00a0\nwhenever he catches a big break. I don't know if it's a self-destructive\u00a0\ntendency that he tends to have-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: it could be. PAYTON: -- words like, I'm doing well, got to mess it up. I don't know. HARF: I'm going to say, I am a hugely competitive parker in Washington,\u00a0\nD.C., which isn't as bad as New York, but I have never punched someone. But\u00a0\nlike you, Martha, I can sympathize with people getting very upset about a\u00a0\nparking spot. It is awful. MACCALLUM: Yes. I have to cut to a tiny bit of road rage at times. (CROSSTALK) HARF: Me, too. I'm with you. MACCALLUM: I can't help it. Somebody steals my parking spot, no, no! (CROSSTALK) HARF: I'm with you. MACCALLUM: But time to punch anybody so far. Thanks, ladies. Great to see\u00a0\nyou all tonight. That is our Story on this Friday night. We'll see you\u00a0\nagain here on Monday which is election eve. Have a great weekend,\u00a0\neverybody.

            "article_content": "The president and White House addresses outrageous headlines from mainstream media; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" May 17, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kimberly, Juan, Dana and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Media bias exposed. It's no surprise that the left-wing media hates President Trump, but this next story might be one of the most grotesquely irresponsible examples yet. During yesterday's sanctuary state roundtable the president was asked about the dangerous MS-13 gang. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: There could be an MS-13 gang members, I know that. If they don't reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about them. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have people coming into the country, trying to come in, we're stopping a lot of them, but we're taking people out of the country. You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals. And we're taking them out of the country at a level and in a rate that's never happened before. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: The mainstream press including the New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post, and many others took Trump out of context, suggesting he called all illegal immigrants animals, not just MS-13. The morning papers flat out misleading readers with headlines like this from the New York Times, quote, Trump calls some unauthorized immigrants animals in rant. And from USA Today, quote, Trump calls undocumented people animals, rhetoric with a dark past. The president addressing the outrageous reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You know I'm referring to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in. And I was talking about the MS-13, and also, if you look a little bit further on the tape, you'll see that. We have laws that are laughed at on immigration. So, when the MS-13 comes in, when the other gang members come in to our country, I refer to them as animals. And guess what. I'll always will. But we're getting them out by the thousands. But it's a big dangerous job, and they're able, in some cases, to come back in or new groups come in, also from the gangs. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Sarah Sanders also issuing this epic takedown of the liberal Trump hating media earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president was very clearly referring to MS-13 gang members who enter the country illegally and whose deportations are hamstrung by our laws. This is one of the most vicious and deadly gangs that operate by the motto of rape, control and kill. If the media and liberals wants to defend MS-13, they're more than welcome to. Frankly, I don't think the term that the president use was strong enough. MS-13 has done heinous acts. It took an animal to stab a man 100 times and decapitate him and ripped his heart out. It took an animal to beat a woman, they were sex-trafficking with a bat. Twenty- eight times indicting part of her body. And it took an animal to kidnap, drugged and rape a 14-year-old Houston girl. Frankly, I think that the term animal doesn't go far enough. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Dana, this is devastating for the mainstream media. This wasn't just a few outlets. These were some of the biggest, most credible media companies out there really just botching something that's pretty simple. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Well, and also -- it grew because of social media. So, I remember there were times when -- like an editor up here in New York would write a headline or a caption or choose a photo that was out of context. And you would actually have White House reporters -- let's just call the New York Times as a hypothetical. They would call up to New York, and I, woo, woo, woo, that's not what he was saying. That's not what he was doing. And I don't know what happened here. Possibly could have happened, but it can happen soon enough. And then, some of the outlets like the A.P. deleted the tweet which is better than nothing, but it does show you that immediately they heard animals and immigrants and they put it together without that context, and so that's unfortunate. I do want to make one point about this, it's not -- it does have -- the president on this MS-13 issue. But it also happened to somebody recently, Ed Gillespie when he was running for governor of Virginia, he was one of this issues -- one of his issues was MS-13. And the Washington Post had several headlines. I think if we have them here, we can show you about how Ed -- basically describing Ed as a racists, saying that Ed -- poisonous. OK. So, a month later and since, the Washington Post all of a sudden had a change of heart about MS-13 in their headlines, post-election, after Ed Gillespie loses, they talk about how MS-13 is terrible. They're -- the violence. Then, the talking feud, they show a couple of examples. But it's just very interesting that they -- the media tends to defend MS-13 in the strangest ways in order to help -- to hurt a Republican. It's an unfortunate set of events. But also, here's the thing, this helps Trump. WATTERS: It does helps Trump. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: You don't want this to happen to anybody, but, at the end of the day, he certainly won on this one. WATTERS: And like Dana said, Greg, some very strange things have come out of this. I saw some people on twitter saying, you know, even MS-13 members aren't animals. They are humans-- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- too seriously here. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: That's because they had to shift the -- once the story fell apart they had to find a new avenue, so now they're defending a murderous gang of rapists. Like I've said, MS-13 is now, yet, another victim class. PERINO: Right. GUTFELD: And if you go after them, you're the bad guy. And how dare you judge. They're just a misguided -- they're like a book club without the books. You know what this is? This is the Laurel-Yanny experiment writ large. You know, normal people heard what they heard correctly which was he was referring to a gang. The media heard racist. So that's the -- it's the Laurel-Yanny, except it's different because they're mishearing this on purpose. This isn't an accident. They are -- I guess, maybe because of their own confirmation bias they're selectively hear something. And then, you know what's the next strategy is? OK. So they know that they're wrong, they know they made a mistake, what they're going to say is, well, Trump has said bad things before, and he will probably say them again. So, it doesn't really matter that they're wrong here. That's the same argument that it's used defending hate crimes. Oh, that racist graffiti was fake, but somewhere around the country it is real. That's the last argument they're going to have to defend this, and it's going to be hilarious. This has been done a lot. I always credit -- well, give time to other people, but-- WATTERS: OK. As Sarah Sanders mentioned and did a very good job of mentioning, just the amount of heinous crimes committed by MS-13, Kimberly. I mean, you've had experience with them. I don't see how the Democrats can even go near a gang like that. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: No, absolutely. And just saying, over the years, and prosecuting and working as a gang crime specialist. I'll tell you this is by far the worst most notorious gang that I ever come across. And that's even with the Aaron brothers having a contract down on me to have me killed. It's expired. But when this-- GUTFELD: That wasn't my fault, by the way. I tried to talk them out of it, Kimberly. (LAUGHTER) GUILFOYLE: So this was a prime example of media bias exposed, right? Because you see a situation like this, because the level of vitriol that they have and the angst and upset towards the president, they just took it too far. They tried to say, oh, look, this is a situation where he's being racist talking about this. I don't think the president took a far enough saying animals and I'll tell you why, because when you see their handiwork and you're actually at the crime scene, you see these photos, you talked to the family members of MS-13 and other gang members, they commit these heinous atrocities, just vicious gangs and killing. Showing no regard for human life. Use of the machete. Another favorite is they love to put nails on baseball bats to beat people to death. The types of crimes they commit. The young girl who is a teenager who they felt disrespected. The gang leader's shrine to a demon. And family members not even able to identify their children because of the state that their bodies are left in dealing with these guys. You know what? Not even animals. Not wild animals even behave like this. So, when you really think about the facts and about what the president was saying, he was showing a respect for victims, respect for law enforcement, and a total -- you know, flat out, you know, saying I have no tolerance for heinous crimes committed, and I look to public safety and the law enforcement to do something about this. WATTERS: Juan, you've worked in the mainstream media before. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I have. WATTERS: Any excuse for something like this? Is it sloppiness or is it something more do you think? WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's called accuracy. WATTERS: Woo, what do you mean about that? WILLIAMS: Because it's accurate. I mean, saying about this is -- I'm loving this because you guys are like feeding the grievance on the right by saying, oh, yeah, that terrible mainstream media, how could they say -- this is so awful. They misinterpreted the president. You know what, the president called people animals. And then you say, oh, no, no, it wasn't people. He was referring, you know, to the Hannibal Lector's of the world is MS-13 gang. You know what? That's not-- GUILFOYLE: But they're growing. WILLIAMS: You do not talk about other people as animals. And I don't care who you are or who they are. You do not become a monster by demonizing your opponent. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Hold on. Hold on. I want to finish. And you know what-- WATTERS: They demonized themselves, Juan. WILLIAMS: I think they're terrible, but I don't think-- GUTFELD: Wait a minute, you called them terrible, Juan? How insulting are you. How dare you call them terrible. That's hurtful. Hurtful. WILLIAMS: I call you hilarious. Here's the thing. You have the president -- a president who says that people who are coming to this country who aren't white are coming from S-hole countries. You have the president talking about people coming from Mexico -- oh, murderers, rapists, right? WATTERS: Some of them are good people. WILLIAMS: Oh, some of them are good people. This is exactly the kind of excuse you hear from the right wing echo chamber. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, no, I'm telling you. You know, you guys are Trump apologists today, because the president-- GUTFELD: Oh. WATTERS: You're a fake news apologist, Juan. Because the basis of the story is the president is taken out of context. WILLIAMS: It was not. That's a distortion. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: You guys loved to make immigrants into the evil because it fires up Trump's base. WATTERS: We're not conflating MS-13 with immigrants. GUILFOYLE: Did you hear what dana said? (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: This Laurel-Yanny thing, which you're seeing, again, right here is Juan here is Yanny, which is sad because it's definitely Laurel. GUILFOYLE: I heard Laurel. GUTFELD: This is a valuable lesson. And I hope, somehow, we learn from this. Because a couple of weeks ago, something Chris Hayes did from MSNBC, which I thought was pretty admirable. Trump was talking to Paralympic athletes and he said he wanted to watch them perform but he found it hard. And so, there was a group of people that said how disgusting it was that he was saying how hard it was to watch people with disabilities perform. What, actually, what he was saying it's hard to watch because he's busy. As the president, it's hard for him to watch the Olympics or the Paralympics. Chris Hayes originally tweeted out that this was disgusting. And then, he watched it again and he goes the Yanny went to Laurel. And he goes, you know what? I was wrong. That he was talking about the schedule. And if people just go and they listen it's so obvious, he's talking about a gang. He's calling them animals. Everybody knows that. But you have to - -people have to learn that may be they have to step out of their own delusions, their own emotions and relies that your first initial response is incorrect. WILLIAMS: Do you think that anybody who's a criminal is an animal? GUTFELD: Well, I think that's insulting to animals. WILLIAMS: OK. GUTFELD: By the way, we're all animals. We're all animals, Juan. WILLIAMS: And I think in our society lots of people who are judged guilty of crimes later return, and we want them to -- we don't say they're animals. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, no, no, and I like what Greg said about -- I forget which host. Chris Hayes. Because I think people make mistakes. Remember when the Dr. King statue they say was removed from the oval office and they had to correct it. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: People in media make mistakes, but this is no mistake. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: It happens the other way too. And I don't know all of the details. But, Crystal is a CNN -- there was something this week about a graphic or something, and then the right media went crazy with it and said, oh, he put a target over President Trump, saying, no, I didn't, but it already, like, gone halfway around the world. So, it does happens on both sides. GUTFELD: It's just worse on their sides. (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: Yeah. And they're getting all these news stories wrong and they always damage President Trump. So, that's why they're not honest mistakes. So they never make mistakes about Democrats. GUILFOYLE: Take a moment and look at the context. WATTERS: That's right. Coming up, a bombshell new report claiming the FBI allegedly spied, spied on the Trump campaign. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Today marks the one-year anniversary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. President Trump firing back against the investigation today tweeting, congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in American history. And there is still no collusion, no obstruction. The only collusion was that done by Democrats who are unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money, end quote. Team Trump is also coming out swinging. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) RUDY GIULIANI, LAWYER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP: If we're in for a long investigation, we'll fight every single thing whether people think it's nice or not nice, or -- if you're innocent, you've got to fight back. The president is clearly innocent and he's absolutely right. He wants to get insulted, you get -- damn witch hunt. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: As the president likes to say, we'll see what happens. We'll see what the facts may reveal. But I think those who have been digging and conjecturing for over a year should be careful what they wish for. (END VIDEO CLIPS) WILLIAMS: This comes on the heels of a stunning New York Times report claiming the FBI allegedly spied on the Trump campaign. A lot of people are fired up about this, arguing the investigation was launched without evidence. Giuliani also reacting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: In this case, I think we're going to have to look into it whether we can challenge the legitimacy of the entire investigation. Maybe a special prosecutor -- special -- should have never been appointed. Not based on an illegal leak, not based on a set of facts that go back to -- I mean, I'm shocked to hear that they put a spy in the campaign of a major party candidates, or maybe two spies. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, it's one year. One year since Mueller started and, actually, if you go back to these -- what these latest reports reveal, it was all the way back to, I guess, October 2016, right before the election. So, the fact that it has lasted this long, is that evidence that it is misguided and a witch hunt? WATTERS: What a question. WILLIAMS: That's a fair question. Tell me. WATTERS: I would say happy anniversary, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. WATTERS: It's been long enough. This New York Times story-- GUILFOYLE: Are you going to give him a card? WATTERS: No. This New York Times story is pretty explosive. I see it as a confession. It's probably a pre-buttal by leakers at the FBI and the DOJ because they know the I.G. is coming out with some pretty damning stuff. And there is an abuse of power, I believe, in the way this whole thing started. When you look at how it started, Papadopoulos is a 28-year-old kid. He gets invited to an event at Cambridge in England. Who invited him? It's a good question. We're going to find out more about that later. At the event, some professors say, you know what? I've heard that the Russians hacked some Democrat emails. So, he then gets set up for drinks with the Australian ambassador. Set up for drinks, also interesting. Where he passes it along, he says, listen, you know, I heard that the Russians had some Democrat emails. Not that the Trump campaign had anything to do with the hacking or were involved at all. Just passed it on. And so, then, the ambassador calls the FBI, says this is want I hear. The FBI, guess who they send? They sent Peter Strzok, the infamous Peter Strzok over to London to check things out. And what do you know? They open up not a criminal investigation, which is important, a counterintelligence investigation because for a criminal investigation you actually have to have hard evidence of treason or espionage. Didn't have either of that, OK. So, they open up this thing on four members of the Trump campaign. Flynn, Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Manafort. To this day, none of these people have been charged with anything relating to collusion, espionage, spying or treason, OK. And what do they do? They use these highly secretive subpoenas. They're called national security letters, very controversial. Extremely secretive. To get information from computers and from phone logs. And they had at least one spy in their campaign. Now, I think I know who it is. I was talking to someone today about it. There's no way I'm going to say the name. I have enough problems already. But the name will come out, OK. And everybody -- it will be very clear. It will be very clear. So, to put it in perspective, the Obama FBI had spies in the Trump campaign a couple of months before an election, illegally surveilled, we believe, people in the Trump campaign based on political opposition research paid for by Hillary and gotten through Russian sources. And, any time you try to ask questions, they stonewall or put out this highly redacted nonsense, and all the people involved are Trump haters. Strzok, Page, Comey, Yates. Everybody involves hates Trump and are bias, and you can't get any straight answers. WILLIAMS: You know what, I just want to cry. PERINO: We've got to go to break now. (LAUGHTER) WILLIAMS: Dana, you look like you want to explode while I cry-- PERINO: I don't want to explode. WILLIAMS: -- because I just feel for the president, go ahead. PERINO: No, I don't want to explode. I'm actually quite entertained by Jesse using 5 minutes to watch over the whole thing. (LAUGHTER) GUILFOYLE: And the body movements. PERINO: I thought the New York Times thing was interesting. I do also -- it's always fun to see that that -- it depends on the day. If it's fake news media or it's an actual news organization that is reporting facts and information that they have. There's a lot here that we don't know. I do wonder about the whole issue and hope that we find out one day. The investigation about Russia wanting to influence election starts in the spring of 2015, before President Trump or anybody was really campaigning. I think Rubio have already announced. And so, how that fits into all of this, I don't know. WILLIAMS: OK. Kimberly? GUILFOYLE: OK. So, yeah, I think this is interesting because I agree with Jesse in the first graph out of his body, which -- this was a prebuttal in terms of trying to get ahead of it, preempt the story that's going to come out because of expectations as it relates to the I.G. report. It's going to be quite damaging. That's what they do, they're trying to get out ahead of the story to say, OK, this is what happen. By the way, Democrats, Republicans, independence, questioning, whatever you are, you should be really concerned that this level of spying and duplicity would be happening to any person in this country. There has to be facts and evidence to support it. You can't just have an open-ended investigation. There has to be scope, focus, evidences to back it up to make sure. And that's what I get concerned about as a former prosecutor. I mean, I've gone before judges. I would never go before a judge, for example, unless I had some very good specific, hard facts, pursuant to an investigation that my unit has conducted versus getting information from an outside source, from a dossier that came from a campaign that was from somebody who had, you know, foreign contacts, et cetera. So, when you look at this type of thing, it's worth the examination that's gone into it. Depends on the flip side, you see what Rudy Giuliani is saying, which is the president is innocent. He's been trying to prove himself innocent. This has been going on forever. It's a year now. What do you have? You can't just keep going and going and going to try to come up with something to get him to trip, because it looks like that your whole goal and focus is to try to undermine the president versus seeking justice. WILLIAMS: So, Greg, oftentimes you want to say something, but I have a real question. Do you want to say something, I'll quickly ask you a question, let me-- GUTFELD: Do whatever you think is correct, Juan. WILLIAMS: Well, no, I love what you do, so I don't want to get in the way. But I'm just saying, I think there's real news on two counts. One, Giuliani said that the Mueller people had told him the president cannot be indicted, and they agree. Now, he said that. We don't know what the Giuliani team. This comes from -- sorry, we don't know what the Mueller team. This comes from Rudy Giuliani alone. There's been no confirmation elsewhere. And the second thing is that, I think a lot of people are surprised that the New York Times did not report as a headline, but way back in October, oh, my God, the FBI is looking into a possible tie between Russia and the Trump campaign. That this was buried in some story. GUTFELD: It's an interesting thing. It's like -- this probe is supposed to somehow expose Trump and unseat a president, but it keeps coming out and hurting Democrats. It's like -- they're like -- the media, they're like pigs digging for truffles, but they just keep coming up with turds. You know what this is? Collusion -- this whole collusion narrative is like that jar of mayonnaise in your fridge that's nearly empty. And they're just trying to get in there and they can't get any more, it's almost gone. As it's almost gone, all this new great stuff comes out that makes Dems look bad. My favorite part of this whole story that we haven't talked about is the name of the secret investigation. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Cross fire hurricane. WILLIAMS: Because it's a Rolling Stone? GUTFELD: So, get this. These mid-level bureaucrats are so addicted to their emotional anger over Trump that they have a secret investigation called cross fire hurricane, a line from Jumping Jack Flash because in their heads they think they're Mick Jagger and Keith Richards when they're not. They're just some emotional bureaucrat trying to even a score, probably propelled by a mad affair. It's all emotional and it's all falling apart, I'm loving every minute of it. Cross fire hurricane. WILLIAMS: Wow, wow, wow, OK. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Trump rhetoric creating trouble for my fellow Democrats heading into these midterms? On The Five you'll get details, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUILFOYLE: The Democrats midterm poll numbers are taking another dip big. Well, the RealClearPolitics generic ballot edge is now just plus 4.7 percent, down from double digits earlier this year. So what is behind the slide? Is it because of comments like these? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: Men like Trump only wind up in power when democracies are already decaying. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you favoring the government actually regulating the relationship between CEO pay and the average worker? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's a very good idea, and I think we should start talking about it. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: And I resent the remark about making America great again. He's down here making a speech for this dishonorable president of the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIPS) GUILFOYLE: All right. So Dana, obviously, the left pretty fired up. You see a lot them, you know, pretty excited rhetoric coming from that side and then also sort of a mixed bag in terms of people saying, \"Listen, we better knock it off, slow it down,\" about talking about impeachment. Don't want to be alienating people. So what do you make of it? PERINO: Well, I do think that the Democrats have done this bat signal out to everybody, like, stop talking about impeachment. Stop talking about Russia. There was a piece this week from the left saying that the Democrats have an MSNBC problem. Dana Millbank, a columnist for The Washington Post, went to that conference that we were showing you. And he said this isn't going to cut it. I mean, you could win 2018 by being against President Trump, but this is not going to win you a presidential election. You have to have better ideas than that. So I do think that that is starting to catch up with them. Plus, conservative policies are actually proving themselves to work. So I think that, as people start to realize that, oh, wow, the country is doing a little bit better. They all feel better. It's not as if the Democrats don't have some things to focus on. Certainly, health care is a vulnerability for Republicans. They don't talk about it enough. They don't seem to have a plan. And then the other piece is, like, United Way put out a study today that said 40 percent of the middle class can't make ends meet. So there are things that they could talk about, but they are wrapped around the axle on the other stuff. GUILFOYLE: You just gave them all the ideas. Were you listening? Did you take notes? PERINO: No, they're not listening. Nobody's listening to me. GUILFOYLE: Great points journal. So you know, Greg, Dana touched on something here in terms of, you know, what works? The conservative, you know, different policies, the different practices that the president is implementing? We talked about it on this show, about inner cities or urban areas that are having a lot of strife, that have a lot of crime, that have a lot of unemployment, et cetera; and those are cities that have been run by Democrats. Right? So some of those policies have proven to fail in the past. And now the president is trying a new and fresh approach that seems to be working, certainly, as it relates to the economy. And if the economy and the numbers are good, people tend to vote in support of. GUTFELD: That was a great question. You know what the Democrats need, Kimberly? They need an asteroid to crash into Earth, because the biggest obstacle for the Democrats is good news. Right? It's Gutfeld's Law. I'm making it up right now. The more good news there is, the fewer Democrats there are. So as long as you have low unemployment, you have high optimism, you've got a hope for peace, there's no war, pestilence, there's no rain of frogs coming down. So the Dems might be in trouble. The Dems need an asteroid. They need something big and ugly so they can have something to say, \"Look at this world.\" But I don't think Republicans should be complacent. This story is designed to pump up the Democrats, to get them to panic and come out. That's why this story's around. GUILFOYLE: Get out the vote. GUTFELD: Right. WATTERS: I thought Gutfeld's Law was ribs for lunch and dinner. GUTFELD: That's Gutfeld's Law No. 2. WATTERS: OK. GUTFELD: And you left out breakfast. WATTERS: Sorry. GUTFELD: Which were rib tips. WATTERS: Rib tips. I would just quickly say, either consciously or unconsciously, President Trump, though his actions and rhetoric, has driven the left into crazy town. They've, over the course of the year, sided with Little Rocket Man, MS-13, Hamas, Iran, Farrakhan, and people that kneel during the national anthem. Not a good place to be in this country. That's just simple. And I would agree with Dana. When you have tax cuts giving people $2,000 extra in their wallet, and ISIS gone, you have safety, security and prosperity. He just needs to run on that. GUILFOYLE: And spending money. OK. Juan, do you dare to disagree with Professor Watters? WILLIAMS: With Jesse? I would never disagree with Jesse. I find it ridiculous. Why would I be -- why would I make myself the target of such derision in our audience? Because Jesse is the font of wisdom. WATTERS: Thank you. WILLIAMS: But I did listen to Dana Perino. Because I listen to Dana anyway, but I listen when she said that, you know, this report indicates 40 percent of Americans, right? What did you say, having trouble making ends meet? I think that's not a sign of an economy that's exactly serving everybody in the society. But the key point I take away from this, we can actually -- again, I go back to Dana Perino, because she sent some lovely articles around. About how you see a lot of the kind of more moderate Democrats not winning in the primaries -- PERINO: Right. WILLIAMS: -- that were held this week on Tuesday. Instead what you see is more of the people on the far left. GUILFOYLE: Progressive. WILLIAMS: And -- whatever you want to call them. Liberals, progressive, whatever. Far-left end of the party really carrying the energy. Because so much of the energy in the party is anti-Trump. People outraged that this guy is president. But I must say it is also an indication that on the far right, the things that stir up the base, the things that appeal to people, get people engaged are also extreme. And I just thought -- I think that's who we are in American politics today. I don't like it, but I think that's the reality. GUILFOYLE: But that's not good news for the Democrats. Because the far- left progressives have been polarizing, and they haven't been able to pull off wins against more reasonable candidates. WILLIAMS: Well, of course, they are energized to come after -- GUILFOYLE: We're going. We're going. WILLIAMS: OK. GUILFOYLE: A heroic school officer stopping a potential mass tragedy. The incredible story the media missed, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: An amazing thing took place Wednesday, but I bet you didn't hear much about it. A school resource officer in Illinois stopped a 19-year-old gunman at a high school, saving countless lives. When the suspect started shooting near the school gym, the officer confronted him, chased him, shot him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE HOWELL JR., DIXON POLICE CHIEF: I cannot be more proud of the police officer and the way he responded to the situation. With shots ringing out through the hallways of the school, he charged toward the suspect and confronted him head-on. Because of his heroic actions, countless lives were saved. We are forever indebted to him for his service and his bravery. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So the obvious question is: Why isn't this all over the news? After all, someone once said that news isn't just what happens, it's what doesn't happen. The problem is in this case, the media isn't interested in what doesn't happen. Lives were saved, thankfully, so the story didn't fit the narrative. And the press therefore moved on to other non-happening things like collusion. So obviously, it's good news that this wasn't a big story. But it's also bad news that it isn't a big story for its own sake, because in this non-news story, truth is revealed: That one can save lives by actually protecting people. For the duration of a gun attack is always dictated by the arrival of a second gun. And this incident is no exception: Look up the unpublished CDC report that indicates nearly 2.5 million defensive uses of guns a year. Didn't hear about that either? I did say it was unpublished. I wonder why. It's the way the press uses silence selectively to create only one story angle that carries the seal of media approval. Which is why I did this monologue in the first place, so someone might hear it, and you know the name of Mark Dallas. So K.G., Mark Dallas was the officer who -- GUILFOYLE: Yes. GUTFELD: I just find it interesting the media is interested in gun stories except for these kind. GUILFOYLE: Yes, well, they're not interested in where guns save lives and are used to put down somebody that, in fact, is trying to do harm. So I like the way you ended up, too. Because that's important. To know the name of the individual that actually committed, you know, a heroic act and saved lives, and that's the whole point. When we talk about schools and gun-free zones and things like that that are very, very vulnerable, they're soft targets, think about it over and over again. Like I said, I've responded to scenes of the crime when I was on the officer-involved shooting team. Any time there was a discharge of a weapon or a shooting like that, and the police had to go out on it. You see what happens. And you go to the movie theater, and you go to the school, and you go to these places and you say, \"If only someone had been armed there to be able to do something and act decisively, lives could be saved.\" So, you know, weapons are used in many instances and in wars to create peace, ultimately. GUTFELD: Dana, the left often uses every story as some kind of political tool. This is -- this is something that says -- is an argument for more guns in schools, but you don't really hear that. PERINO: Well, part of the reason is because it works. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: Like, the process that was in place for that school district worked. If the policy works, you often don't write about it. But I also think that it, in some ways, it can do what you're saying. Which is remember when Rahm Emanuel said never let an opportunity go to waste? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: So I think that this is actually true on the other side. Which is that if you're a local school district and you're worried about the possibility of a shooter in your school, having an armed resource officer could actually be your answer. GUTFELD: Yes. Jesse, should the officer not have been there with a gun? Should it have been a gun-free zone? WATTERS: No. GUILFOYLE: That was a trick question. WATTERS: So this officer did the exact opposite of what the officer did in Parkland. GUILFOYLE: Yes. WATTERS: Remember, he hid and cowered and waited outside. This one followed protocol and directly addressed to neutralize the shooter. But your point is exactly right. News isn't necessarily about what you cover. It's about what you don't cover. And your asteroid analogy rings true here. They don't always cover good economic news for the Trump administration. They don't cover news that might benefit the NRA narrative, and that's fine. Every outlet has to make their own editorial decision about what they do or don't cover. But when 90 percent of the media is liberal, and 10 percent isn't, there's a lot of impact about what that 90 percent does not cover. And it does a disservice to the readers and viewers who aren't fully informed before they can make a decision or have an opinion. GUTFELD: Juan, I'm sure my monologue changed your mind completely. GUILFOYLE: Hearts and minds. WILLIAMS: You know, it felt to me like someone had a gun pointed at me. I said, \"You know what?\" GUTFELD: You've felt that before. WILLIAMS: Yes, but the thing is, you know, what's interesting to me is not that it doesn't get covered. Because you're right. I think it's like, you know, the famous saying: we don't cover safe landings at national airports. GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: Right? So that's not typically what gets covered. But you make it into a policy argument about whether or not guns should be in schools and in classrooms and all over. And that's where I think I disengage, because to my mind, I look at Stoneman that Jesse mentioned, and there was an armed guard. I look at Columbine, Virginia Tech. I look at the Pulse nightclub. There were armed guards at all of these mass shootings. Did it stop them? No. And then you look and you say, \"Well, let's ask the people involved. Let's get away from a bunch of TV people. Let's ask the teachers in these schools. Do they think that there should -- they should have guns, that there should be armed guards?\" No. What about the parents? Parents love kids, I think we can all agree with that. The parents that know, parents say they don't want these guns in their schools. Maybe because they know when guns are around, more accidents, actually more fatalities. WATTERS: What poll is that that you're citing? GUTFELD: I've got to move on. Anyway, more guns, less crime. The CDC report, 2.5 defensive uses of guns. So that's facts, too. Big news for us on \"The Five\" -- hmm -- as we get closer to unlocking our family secrets. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: All right. I'm really excited about this segment. Off-camera we've all been asking questions about our heritage, and really I want to know, Italian or Swiss? Could Jesse's biggest fear of being French be true? Could Kimberly actually be a royal? And who knows? Maybe Juan and Greg are related. WATTERS: Ooh! PERINO: So we have decided to put the speculation to rest, and \"The Five\" is going to take ancestry tests. We're not going to do it on air, but we have them here. GUILFOYLE: Because we don't want to gross anyone out. PERINO: From 23AndMe. And so it's all going to happen. You're going to get this -- you're going to have to take the test, and then we'll get the results. And we'll reveal them on \"The Five.\" WATTERS: Oh, ancestry. GUILFOYLE: Health and ancestry. WATTERS: Yes, I don't want health. I just want ancestry. PERINO: Ok, well, I'll take health. GUTFELD: I have ancestry. PERINO: Want health? GUTFELD: I don't even want -- I hate identity politics. This is identity politics. It's like -- it's all self-absorption. People want -- I don't want to know about your heritage or ancestry. I don't care. GUILFOYLE: But you were willing to do this segment. GUTFELD: People talk about astrology or their vacation pictures. Now I'm going to be in the elevator and someone is going to say, \"Hey, I'm 18 percent Samoan.\" I don't care. The whole point is, we're not supposed to care. WATTERS: We're all American. Right, Greg? PERINO: We're very excited about this segment. GUTFELD: I am sitting this out. I refuse to be part of it. GUILFOYLE: Oh, my gosh. WATTERS: What if we find out we're, like, a little Native American? GUTFELD: Then run for president. WILLIAMS: Here's a better one. What if you find out you're the Golden State Killer? Remember that? That's how they found him. WATTERS: Is that right? GUILFOYLE: Now Jesse is more worried. Every day he's like, \"I hope I'm not French. I hope I'm not French.\" WATTERS: Yes, this can't ever be used against me in a crime. GUTFELD: Why are they different? WILLIAMS: What? GUTFELD: Why are they different? PERINO: This is health and ancestry. GUILFOYLE: It's like the \"The Five\" can't read unless the prompter says it. It says health and ancestry on everyone's boxes. GUTFELD: Thank God it's a saliva collection. WATTERS: As opposed to what, Greg. GUILFOYLE: Hold on. PERINO: We have health and ancestry. Well, I mean, I guess we'll find out who's healthy. GUTFELD: You're doing ancestry. GUILFOYLE: We're just doing ancestry. But I'm very curious. PERINO: We're curious. All right. \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: I heard \"Laurel.\" WATTERS: Time now for \"One More Thing\" -- Dana. PERINO: Still talking about Yanny and Laurel. OK. So you know my husband is British. I'm pretty into the wedding. He's not really into the wedding, the royal wedding on Saturday. But did you know that Meghan Markle has to take a citizenship test to become a British citizen? I'm going to ask you three questions to see if you could pass this test. All right. Who is this patron saint of Scotland? A, St. Andrew; or B, St. Patrick? WILLIAMS: Andrew. PERINO: Andrew, that's true. All right. Well done, Juan. GUILFOYLE: That was easy. GUTFELD: You know what their animal is? The unicorn. PERINO: Yes, that's true. OK. What is the title given to the person who chairs the debates in the House of Commons? A, Leader of the House; B, Speaker. WILLIAMS: Leader? PERINO: In the House of Commons. Speaker. WILLIAMS: Speaker. GUILFOYLE: Speaker. PERINO: Juan, you're pretty good at this British stuff. GUILFOYLE: You could be royalty. PERINO: In 1801, a new version of the official flag of the United Kingdom was created. What is it often called? A, the Royal Banner; or B, the Union Jack? WILLIAMS: I go with B. GUILFOYLE: Union Jack? WILLIAMS: Yes, that's what I would -- PERINO: Yes, of course, it's the Union Jack. GUILFOYLE: Only this end of the table knows things. GUTFELD: I thought maybe they changed the name. PERINO: It's not a trick question. WILLIAMS: It wasn't a trick. GUTFELD: I don't know. PERINO: All right. So good luck on that test, Meghan. WATTERS: All right. Kimberly. PERINO: Markle. GUTFELD: What if she flunks? GUILFOYLE: Oh, excuse me. Yes. OK. GUTFELD: She just stole your royal news, by the way. GUILFOYLE: By the way, snatched it. And now the crown must be passed on. Yes. Dana Perino. We have a new crown, by the way. OK. So everyone knows that I love perfect attendance. I love it. I had perfect attendance in law school. But I -- WATTERS: You weren't here yesterday. GUILFOYLE: That's correct, Jesse. My amazing record has been blown to shreds. Haven't missed a show since last year sometime. And anyway, I was out yesterday in Washington, D.C., and it was really fantastic. I got to spend time with Andy Card, who was former chief of staff for Bush 43, transportation secretary under Bush '41, and he served in the Reagan White House. And Jack Lew, who was former chief of staff for Barack Obama, as well as former treasury secretary. He was also special assistant to the president under Bill Clinton. What do they have in common? In fact, all three of us knew Dana Perino. That's very good to moderate a panel. PERINO: I could have used that, since that commercial break shock I took earlier. GUILFOYLE: It was a really good time. GUTFELD: Looks like a real barn burner there, Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: It's like, you know, we can get bipartisan. WATTERS: Very highbrow. GUILFOYLE: People from both sides. WATTERS: All right, Juan. WILLIAMS: So as you know, I'm a grandfather of twin girls, Pepper and Wesley, soon to be six. So when I saw this video, it went viral, had more than 5 million hits, there was a spark of recognition. Take a look at twins Caleb and Weston Lineman, showing them reuniting in the birth room after their February birth in Orlando, Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (BABIES CRYING) (BABIES CALM DOWN WHEN PLACED NEXT TO EACH OTHER) (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Twins. WILLIAMS: Yes. So the twin boys were born four weeks prematurely, but they're doing great, by the way. But what I noticed in the video was that, having grown together in their mother's womb, they had a connection like no other. As you can see, when there's skin to skin contact, they stop crying. Everything is good with Caleb and Weston as long as they can feel each other. And here they are with her sisters, Corinne and Amelia, who can't get enough -- GUILFOYLE: How cute. WILLIAMS: -- of their happy, healthy twin brothers. GUILFOYLE: How cute. WILLIAMS: They're very cute. WATTERS: Adorable. GUILFOYLE: Greg should have twins. GUTFELD: Yes, I already do, by the way. They're ferrets, though. Much more lovable. All right. I'm on Martha MacCallum tonight. I'm going to be talking about pot and commencement speaking. But first this. GUILFOYLE: Giving one while on? GUTFELD: Yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GRAPHIC: Greg's Celebrities on Holiday (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: \"Greg's Celebrities on Holiday.\" I love celebrities. I love holiday. I think we've got some pictures of David Spade in Tulum, enjoying the cool pool back there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (TAN DOG WEARING SUNGLASSES SWIMMING IN POOL) (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: You know, he just loves to hang out and just pick up chicks. It's incredible, David Spade. WATTERS: He looks pretty good. GUTFELD: Well, he does. He's fit. WATTERS: Looks great. GUTFELD: Do you know he's 73 years old? GUILFOYLE: Is he sitting while dog paddling? Quite interesting. WATTERS: OK. So they have this thing in Russia called the National Slapping Championships in Moscow. Let's take a look at these brutes. This is what they do for fun. PERINO: Oh, my God. GUILFOYLE: I don't like this. PERINO: This is terrible. WATTERS: It's supposed to encourage camaraderie. GUILFOYLE: Jesse, this isn't nice. WATTERS: And Yuri Guzman was crowned the king of the slappers and took home 25,000 rubles -- GUTFELD: This is great. WATTERS: -- which is only 400 U.S. dollars. He's not doing that well. GUTFELD: I love this. GUILFOYLE: Your \"One More Things\" are very different from Juan's. GUTFELD: They're fantastic. Watters: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" Bret Baier plays that all the time down there in the D.C. bureau. GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. WILLIAMS: Oh, my goodness. GUILFOYLE: Terrible. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: I miss you guys, I really do. WATTERS: We miss you, too. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" October 22, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: So, good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And as we just said, it's 14 days now until the midterm elections. Tonight, two live pictures tell the story. First, you've got the growing caravan of thousands of people headed towards the U.S. border. Who are they? Who is supporting them? And will the president put the military on our border to turn them back? Then, over to Houston at this moment, thousands of people lined up all day long to be part of the Trump-Cruz rally, which is now moments away as these former foes who traded the nastiest of barbs, now join forces in an attempt to hold the GOP Senate seat in Texas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRESIDEN T DONALD TRUMP: Lying Ted, lying Ted. \u00a0What's your name? My name is lying Ted Cruz. SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife. TRUMP: To me he's not lying Ted anymore, he's beautiful Ted. He is Texas -- I call him Texas Ted. MACCALLUM: So here now is the live look. We will take you there since that kept under way. The president is expected to call for the coming border showdown. He's expected to call it rather a national emergency. He will likely go after Beto O'Rourke, we expect Cruz's opponent. And also Democrats who the president blames for the situation at the border. Saying that the failure to vote and pass immigration reform is long overdue. About the caravan, the president saying this. TRUMP: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, they paid a lot of money. Every year, we give them foreign aid, and they did nothing for us, nothing. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACCALLUM: So, in just a moment, we will be speaking with Univision anchor Jorge Ramos for his perspective on the ground in Mexico. And we will talk with Newt Gingrich who sees the caravan as, \"an attack on America.\" We begin with Fox News correspondent William La Jeunesse, who is live alongside the caravan. Good evening, William. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. You can see that people now are just jamming into here, but I want to take you right over here. Anything with wheels on it people are trying to get on. OK? There got another two hours left in their trek to the next town they're trying to go to. And people are exhausted. They're hot, it's been a really long day. A lot of people only have flip-flops, they've been nursing blisters on their feet. I'm going to tell you guys, anything that stops, right? A lot of local Mexicans are helping these people out with food, with water, obviously clothing and transportation. So, if truck stops, this is exactly what you see. So, you know, people talk about, Oh, it's an organized caravan and that -- I haven't seen that. I have people who don't even have enough money to put socks on their feet. They're dealing with blisters and so forth. But as you said, the caravan itself is growing, OK? Which started out as maybe two or 3,000 crossing the Honduran border. Now, we're up to over 7,000. That's according to the people who are part of this caravan, as well as the Mexican government. Now in terms of what's happening with Mexico, the government itself is not been able to stop. They were simply overwhelmed by the number. And they're letting them go through. In fact, they told the presidents of Guatemala and Honduras that they were going to offer them safe passage. So, you've got this caravan going on for literally miles in both directions. They stopped traffic on a major highway. Now, in terms of what's happening next, right? So, there's a town north of us about 80 miles. They're doing about 20-25 miles a day it's called, Arriaga. They may be able, some may catch a train there or maybe a bus. \u00a0The risks, the dilemma for them is that they fear is they get on those buses, Mexican agents will come on and deport them. Basically divided into port. So, they kind of strengthen numbers, so they stay together. On the other hand, the heat was so intense today. Crying babies, baby strollers. \u00a0People just trying to find any kind of shade they can. It's really humid, it's really hot. People were dropping, literally, all over the place. \u00a0They couldn't make it. And many of these people are not going to be able to make it. Definitely not another 1,400 miles, and potentially 60 to 90 days. It's not just going to happen. So, I think for the message, and you know what I'm hearing Martha, and all I'll wrap it up for you. But you know, these people, frankly, everyone I've talked to, they've just want a better life. You know, it isn't -- it isn't about the sovereignty of U.S. borders and Mexican borders. They could care less. What they're trying to say, is they have no job, they have no hope, they have no wages, people working in the Highlands, growing coffee, there's no money in that anymore. So, if America doesn't want illegal immigration, it's got to get its own house and order because the people are coming. And in fact, we have been reports that back down at the river, about 50 miles behind me, more people are on the banks of that river to cross into Mexico. OK? Back to you. MACCALLUM: Very interesting. William, thank you very much. So, for more perspective on the ground in Mexico, I'm joined by Jorge Ramos, Univision news anchor and the author of Real America on Facebook Watch. Jorge, thank you very much for being here today. You know, I want to -- of report today from the Washington Post -- JORGE RAMOS, NEWS ANCHOR, UNIVISION: Great to be here and -- MACCALLUM: So they -- glad to have you with us. That many of the people that they talked to -- that the Washington Post talk to. They told the reporters that they had already been deported several times from the United States. And that they were going to try to make it back in again, many of them, to try to meet up with family members. They said that they would try to run in between the border guards, at places that they know, are poorest along the United States border. And one of them was quoted as saying that's how it is, they catch you and you try to get back. What kind of system is that? RAMOS: Well, maybe they're only talking to people who speak English. Yes, of course, I've talked to some of them who have been deported, but the majority -- (INAUDIBLE) None of them have been in the United States before. So, some of them, yes, have been deported but the majority not, Martha. And something really important is that the vast majority of these people are not criminals, they're not terrorists, and they're not even immigrants, they're refugees. And as a nation in the United States, we have to choose what kind of nation we are and treat them with respect. We cannot prejudge them. We cannot say all of them are criminals, all of them are rapists. That is not true. So, what we have to do is to listen to them. Hear their cases, and if they do sort of political asylum, then, grant it to them. MACCALLUM: You know, I mean -- there, according to one estimate by the Gallup World Poll 57 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean would like to come to the United States. But you simply -- I mean, do you -- do you recommend that they should all be allowed in? I mean, at what point is there -- you know, a lot -- I mean, how is this going to work? Leave the border open? Everyone, just out of the goodness of everyone's hearts, welcome in 57 million people eventually? RAMOS: No. MACCALLUM: So, what would you recommend? RAMOS: No. I am not for open borders. I understand what you're saying, Martha. But I am not for open borders. I think that the immigration system that we have right now is simply not working, is not working for everyone. Trump's immigration policy is a complete failure, it hasn't worked. \u00a0Enforcement only, it doesn't work. And what we need is a legal immigration system that really works. Now, despite the optics, I know that if you are in the United States, and you are watching this -- MACCALLUM: Right. RAMOS: You might think, oh, we're going to be invaded. That is not true. \u00a0There is no invasion here. We're talking about 7,000 right now, maybe a few thousand more trying to cross the border between Mexico and Guatemala. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes, but Jorge -- RAMOS: Some of them are going to make it to Texas. Some of them are going to make it to California. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I understood. But this is -- you can't just walk -- RAMOS: But at the end, this is -- this is the truth. There's only 11 million people in the United States who are undocumented. MACCALLUM: Only. RAMOS: And that has remained stable for the last decade. Martha. MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, but the problem is that it's -- you know, it's a law-breaking environment. You're not allowed to just cross the border. \u00a0You're not allowed to go up and find to the openings at the border where there's no Border Patrol agents and sneak your way through, and you know, put your foot on the property, and then become the responsibility of the U.S. government. It simply doesn't work. And what's being asked is for Latin America and Mexico to take their share of the burden and to manage this problem. And perhaps, to find a way to improve their own economy so that everybody doesn't want to flood out. RAMOS: I agree with you. And I think, Mexico has done his part. \u00a0President Pena Nieto, unfortunately, for many immigrants, Mexicans and Central Americans. The Mexican police has become -- and the Trump's immigration police. That's the truth, and many people see this, we don't agree with that. What President Trump is (INAUDIBLE) (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: What do you mean by that? We watch the fence -- no, hold on -- hold on. We watch the fence between Guatemala and Mexico, he overrun. And it doesn't appear that there was any attempt by the Mexican police to really handle this situation. RAMOS: No. No, no, what I'm telling is that Mexican police -- Mexican police try to prevent -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Well, it doesn't seem like they're up for the top now. RAMOS: -- some immigrants to pass by. And you know, immigration is through it. And instead of going through a bridge, they use the river, and here they are. So, it didn't work and President Pena Nieto try to become Trump's police and just simply didn't work. What President Trump is trying to do right now -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Why doesn't he be Mexican police? Why not Mexico's police? \u00a0This is your problem -- I'm sorry. RAMOS: Threatened foreign aid, to cut foreign aid to Honduras and Southern Guatemala. Is the worst he can do because -- let me just finish this and I let you talk. MACCALLUM: OK. We have a delay, I'm sorry. RAMOS: Simply because -- simply because if you put more pressure on Central America, more people like this are going to try to come to the United States. MACCALLUM: Yes. Well, you know, obviously there's a -- there's a big problem with the economy and with the Mexican ability. It's not Trump's police, and I mean, Mexico has its own Police Department. They have a responsibility to deal -- they -- you guys in Mexico they deport tens of thousands of people every year back across that border. But let me ask you this, in terms of the people that are coming now, the caravan which just keeps growing and growing, why now -- why now? Why did this all come to pass and this group growing in numbers by the day? Why now? RAMOS: Well, I think it has to do -- it started with social media as if it would happen in any other part of the world. And it's so interesting because I didn't see any conspiracy here or any collusion or Democrats or Republicans participating in this. Absolutely not. What happened is that once people in Central America, especially, in Honduras, once they learn that one caravan was going north, they decided to join for two reasons. For safety. They are not risking being raped or being vandalized on their way from Central America to the United States. \u00a0And then, it has to do with money, Martha, simply money. If you live in Honduras or Guatemala, and you want to go to the United States, you got to pay up for a coyote or a smuggler, maybe $6,000, maybe up to $7,000. But if you are part of this caravan, you won't pay anything. \u00a0So, I think it has to do with safety, and it has to do with money. And that's what we have right now about 7,000 people in Mexico already. And a few thousand more waiting at the Guatemala border. MACCALLUM: Yes, very interesting. Jorge, thank you. Thank you very much in Mexico with us tonight. Joining me now, Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, and a Fox News contributor. You wrote this piece that calling this an attack on America. Newt, your thoughts on what we just heard from William La Jeunesse, the reporter and Jorge Ramos on the ground as well. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Well, I look, I think it's pretty clear. If you use Jorge Ramos' numbers, there are, at least, nine or 10,000 potential people if you count the ones on the Guatemala border or the one who come north. The easy question asked is this, let say we open the border, we welcome all of them. That picture goes out across the whole planet. How big do you think the next convoy is, and the -- and then a caravan after that? And the caravan after that? And you get to the question, you either going to control the border, or you're not going to control the border. And as an American, I'm -- we have -- we have the most generous legal immigration system in the world. We have over a million people a year legally becoming American or be getting American right to be in America. Most of them go on to become American citizens. So, it's just a -- it's just a dishonest lie to suggest that we don't have a serious immigration program that's legal. Now, the problem we have is we have a lot of folks who want to break the law. And if you ever had open borders as you pointed out, the Gallup World Poll -- I think the number for all of Latin America and the Caribbean was 179 million people would like to come to the U.S. It's just unsustainable. So, the question becomes what are you going to do about it? And the president who has inherited a disastrous immigration system between court orders, bad congressional laws, federal regulation, it's a total disaster. He's trying to get this right. I think it's important to stop this caravan in part to send a signal to the rest of Latin America, \"No, you're not going to be allowed to come in. And in part, because in the process of stopping it, we're going to learn a lot about the laws that need to be changed. And frankly, Congress may be in the lame-duck session. Ought to be challenged, it's not comprehensive reform, but let's take the 10 dumbest things. Let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our border. MACCALLUM: Yes. I just want to play this clip from \"The View\" today. An animated conversation about this, and get your thoughts. Let's put it up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW,\" ABC: Is this straight up fear- mongering? I mean, when did -- when did he start putting the Middle Easterners in? I thought he was just -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are they walking? Are they walking here? GOLDBERG: Well, I don't know. BARBARA WALTERS, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW,\" ABC: You know what, he makes up everything. He'll tell you as Usama bin Laden is marching. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Are they referring to the fact that the president suggested that there might be some criminals. And he said that people from unknown Middle Easterners are mixing in. Your reaction to that, Newt. GINGRICH: Well, first of all, the Secretary of Homeland Security said yesterday that we have to recognize there are probably people from the cartels among the seven to 10,000 that there are probably other people who are involved in human trafficking. Remember, a lot of those pictures you saw of a man and a young girl. He wasn't her father. He was the guy bringing her into cellar into human trafficking. So, let's be clear, the most of these people are just folks who'd love to get to the Promised Land, they'd love to have Christmas, they'd love to have Christmas. They'd love to have a chance to live like we live. But there is a substantial set of people who are lawbreakers, who are dangerous, who were MS-13 members. And if you were a terrorist and wanted to get in the U.S. and you saw 10,000 people trying to get in the U.S., how unlikely is that you might decide to join them? MACCALLUM: Pretty good way to get in. Yes, there's a huge upsurge. They used to have a lot of single young men crossing the border and now more than ever they are arriving with a child in tow and the Department of Homeland Security should say has a really hard time identifying that child and whether or not they're supposed to be with that adult which is a potentially very scary situation for these young people. Newt Gingrich, thank you. Always good to see you, sir. Good to have you here. GINGRICH: Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So tonight former rivals now allies as President Trump travels to the Lone Star State in hopes of helping Ted Cruz keep his Senate seat. We're going to go there live. But first, is the media trying to tell a particular narrative about the death of Jamal Khashoggi? Judith Miller and Howie Kurtz here to set the record straight. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So any moment we expect President Trump to take the stage at this big rally in Texas tonight for his once rival and now friend Sen. Ted Cruz. We're going to take you there live as it gets underway because we do expect that news will be made with regard to a number of stories, the caravan and also the growing mystery surrounding Jamal Khashoggi and what happened to him in the consulate in Turkey. A lot of questions as we continue to go through this story. And some corners, the Saudi columnist has been described as a champion of freedom, others questioned some of his ties. Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to President Trump wrote a piece on this over the weekend and he said this. People die every day. It's our lot. \u00a0Some deaths attract more attention than others, some for good reason, sometimes for nefarious and dishonest ones. So what about Jamal Khashoggi? \u00a0Yes, it is now clear that Saudi -- that the Saudi Arabian man was murdered, but what are the facts of his death and do they matter to you or to America? First things first. It is important to understand that Khashoggi was neither an American nor was he strictly speaking a journalist. Joining me now is Judith Miller, Fox News contributor and former New York Times reporter and Howard Kurtz, host of \"MediaBuzz.\" Good to have both of you with us today. He's making a point here, Judith, and I know that you find it very distasteful what he said. JUDITH MILLER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. MACCALLUM: However, in terms of looking at this as the news story and the amount of attention that it gets is there you know, is there parity in terms of other things that happen in the world? Is this the kind of thing that happens in the Middle East in -- at a greater pace than it happens in other places? Why has this garnered so much media attention and what do you think of what he wrote? MILLER: Well, I think that this story is obviously an important story. It is --- his murder is a gruesome, barbaric affair carried out perhaps yet to be determined, but most people who follow the Middle East think that it was ordered by a prince, by the man who's going to be the next leader of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, a rupture in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia is a story that goes far beyond the murder of one man. And surely Mr. Gorka who supposedly is a counterterrorism expert should understand that. MACCALLUM: You know, it's interesting Bret Baier over the weekend interviewed the foreign minister. He said basically that you know, they still think it was a plot that was gone awry. They're still trying to figure it out, still trying to investigate. The President was interviewed about this on the plane on the way to Houston. He echoed that phrase that it was a plot that gone awry. The President didn't seem to know about the bone saw according to these reports and he said that the Prince and the King were not involved. Howie, let me turn to you now in terms of the coverage of this story because some of it has been geared towards pointing a finger at President Trump and using this in some regard against him, against his policies your thoughts on that. HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, Martha, I'm the first to admit the journalists care more about the fate of one of their own, a Washington Post contributor, than some of the random dissidents who were sometimes disappeared by the Saudi regime, that they have make Khashoggi assemble, and at the same time you know, it is getting an awful lot of coverage. But for having said that, this is a genuine international crisis for several reasons. There were blatant and repeated Saudi lying about the situation, the gruesome nature of the crime itself, and the fact that it could disrupt U.S.-Saudi relations. And these efforts by a few people on the right Sebastian Gorka included to minimize the magnitude of this murder by either smearing Khashoggi or questioning his support of the Muslim Brotherhood are nothing less than an attempt at political deflection. Nobody deserves this fate, not a 60-year-old writer living in Virginia. MACCALLUM: Yes, I want to show the video of you know, when we talk about the gruesome nature of this of someone who appears to be one of the 15 according to these reports who carried out this murder leaving in Khashoggi 's clothing. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At first glance, this man could almost pass for Jamal Khashoggi, and that's the idea. Take a look, same clothes, same glasses and beard, similar age and physique, everything except the shoes. But a senior Turkish official tells CNN that the man on the left is a body double, one of 15 Saudi operatives sent to kill Khashoggi and then cover it up. (END VIDEO CLIP) MILLER: You know, the other reason that this story has such power is the way in which we're learning the details of this gruesome murder. A double, a body double sent in along with an autopsy forensics expert who may have been overseeing the dismemberment of this writer. This is gruesome stuff and we're getting it day by day by day. When you're in a hole Saudi Arabia stop digging, that's what they're doing by continuing to lie and cover up what actually happened inside the consulate in Istanbul. MACCALLUM: I mean, the problem is you know, you think about what happened in with Russian spies being killed in London, you think back to you know, some of the other stories with ricin, you know, these are the kinds -- this is the behavior that you expect from certain governments around the world. \u00a0Saudi Arabia is trying to prove that it's not like that anymore, that it's reforming, that women are driving, that women are going to the movie theater. We get endless video of all of these things happening and yet, Howie, this is a big black mark against that idea. And that seems to me to be the most important point here that you know journalists on all sides of this equation need to recognize that there failing the test for membership. KURTZ: Right. There's been a tremendous effort by the Saudi regime through some in the media in the U.S. to paint the Crown Prince MBS as a reformer and yet it's not clear whether he knew about or authorized or acquiesced in this horrible murder. And sure, the way in which it's unfolded, when a Russian spy or somebody else is killed, often it's a two or three days story and the person is brought to justice. Remember, the Saudis spent more than a week saying, oh he walked out of there. He walked out of that consulate and now have to admit that that's a lie. That has given the story legs and also the Trump administration's response to these lies. The President now using the words lies and deception to describe the case. That has provided the narrative fuel as well. MACCALLUM: Just one last quick thought, Judith, when you know, you look at Benghazi, you look at some of the stories that many reporters have not been as interested perhaps in as they should have. Is that a fair criticism that they you know, might be milking this story to some extent because it works for a narrative against President Trump? MILLER: I think some journalists are biased, some journalists would believe that this story will play to President Trump's detriment but I don't think that's what's driving this story. I don't think anyone who's followed the story thinks that's its power. What's at stake here is the future leadership of Saudi Arabia and America's relationship with it and the kind of country not only they are but the kind of country and people we want to be. MACCALLUM: Yes, Jared Kushner out there today, saying that he is pushing for transparency and encouraging the Prince to be completely transparent and that this is a very serious issue. We'll see where it goes next. \u00a0Thank you both. Good to see tonight. MILLER: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So we are now moments away from President Trump taking the stage in Texas with Senator Ted Cruz. We're going to take you there as soon as that gets underway, looking for some news that will be made there on that stage tonight. Also, lawmakers harassed and heckled in public over politics. The latest target -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Jessica -- Charlie Hurt and Jessica Tarlov coming up next on that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: We are back. Any minute now President Trump is set to take the stage in Texas for a rally in support of Senator Ted Cruz. We will go there as soon as he comes out. But first, we begin with the story that Senator Cruz knows all too well. One, less than one month ago he went to a dinner with his wife in D.C., and this is what they had for an appetizer. Hecklers chase them out, chased out by protesters. They did eventually come back in but we understand that now it's happening again, this time in Kentucky where the target of public harassment was one of the top Republicans in Washington Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trace Gallagher has the story from our west coast newsroom. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It appears Mitch McConnell is kind of getting used to this behavior because during the entire time that he was being yelled at by a small group of protesters while he dined with his wife, McConnell stayed calm and kept sipping his drink. His wife on the other hand, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao decided to stand her ground. Watch some of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why don't you get out of here. Why don't you-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave her alone. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: You see the senator kind of sipping his drink, Elaine Chao kind of yelling back at them. You can see the other diners by the way also stepped up to let the protesters know they were out of line. The woman who took this video obtained by TMZ says she didn't start taping until after a protester slammed his fist on McConnell's table and threw food out the door. This, by the way, is a fourth time in four months McConnell has been publicly harassed. And he certainly not alone as you mentioned, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and his wife were harassed last month in a D.C. restaurant during the height of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process. And back in June, Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was harassed and shouted down at a D.C. Mexican restaurant. Most of these incidents target Republicans, but Democrat certainly are not immune. During a campaign stop last week for Florida, Democratic House candidate Donna Shalala, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was bombarded with a flurry of expletives. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You don't belong here (muted) Get (muted) out of here! (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And the beeps go on. The protesters reportedly included the proud boys, a right-wing group accused of being in several violent scuffles. And we should note GOP Congressman Steve Scalise who was shot and nearly killed last year by a liberal activist condemned that behavior saying, if you want to stop Pelosi's policies, don't threaten her, vote. That's how we settle our differences. Martha? MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, that is why this is so scary because it can escalate so easily. GALLAGHER: Yes. MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. Here now with more, Charles Hurt, opinion editor at the Washington Times, Jessica Tarlov, a senior director of research at Bustle.com and both are Fox News contributor's. Havana Rumba, you know, you do a (Inaudible) a Margarita with his wife and they are throwing food out the wind -- out the front door there. I mean, you know, true to character, true to form, right, Mitch McConnell is like, I'm just going to sit here and sipped my drink. CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, But the strangest part of that is throwing the food out the door. I don't-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You were -- was it there food that's thrown out there. HURT: It's completely unclear. But you know, I mean, I think it's great for -- you know, democracy is a noisy affair, and I have no problem with that. But honestly if you're going out to a dinner, going out to a restaurant, and you could spend like the evening with your family and enjoying a good meal, and instead your idea of a good time is to get up and start screaming at somebody about politics. There's something wrong in your life, something is terribly out of whack. I mean, it's like you wouldn't show up at church wearing a bathing suit and a cocktail. MACCALLUM: This is true. HURT: It would be very awkward for everybody, you know. And people would think that, and people would reveal -- would realize something is probably out of whack. And you ought to get help. I think these two which needed help. MACCALLUM: Perhaps they do. I want to play I like Elaine Chao because she really stands up for her man. And you saw what she did there. And this is from June. Remember this one. Watch this woman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you separating families? ELAINE CHAO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: Why don't you leave my husband alone? (CROSSTALK) CHAO: Back off. You leave him alone. Leave my husband alone! (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: In that tape she gets it right in that in their face, leave them alone! Meanwhile, he's in the car saying, come on, Elaine, we're running late. Let's get out of here. (CROSSTALK) JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I also did really like that clip. I think there are two issues at play here. MACCALLUM: Yes. TARLOV: So, one, first of all, if you are a public servant and the public is paying your salary, and you are out there, whether people have the right to come up to you and talk to you in a respectful manner about policy. (Inaudible) as Senator Sherrod Brown, for instance, just came out over the weekend and said, we believe that when we are in public because we are public servants that we should talk to people, if they have something to say. And you know, you need to be respectful obviously, you should address that. The throwing of food and the real disruption approach or the ejection from restaurants, that doesn't really work for me. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Like saying to Nancy Pelosi-- TARLOV: Terrible. MACCALLUM: -- you are a blanking commie. TARLOV: Yes. MACCALLUM: And by the way, that room that she open the door to where she went in, that wasn't where she was going, it was like a closet. (CROSSTALK) TARLOV: She had to get out of the way. MACCALLUM: And they had a way until soon they left. TARLOV: It's horrible and I do appreciate Trace doing my Democrat vetting for me and pointing that out before anchors, I got to get to Nancy Pelosi thing in here. So, it's not just-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes, it's horrible on both sides. TARLOV: It is horrible on both sides. MACCALLUM: It's a lack of civility. Hillary Clinton has been calling for more that though actually. TARLOV: I wouldn't say that she wants what's happening to Mitch McConnell or to Nancy Pelosi, I don't think that's the point she was making and certainly not the point that Eric Holder was making about how what kind of politics we need to put forward in the final days before the midterms. I don't think that anyone wants that to happen and I appreciate lawmakers on both sides saying this is simply unacceptable. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: I haven't heard honestly, though, when you think about it, you know, you have her from Republicans that they, you know, that this is uncivil. HURT: Yes. MACCALLUM: Because this, clearly is sort of the unfortunate for both person for what can happen and what it can lead to. HURT: Yes. And all of it reveals something that I think is very troubling, and that is that politics has become like 90 percent of people's lives it seems like. MACCALLUM: Yes. HURT: They have become absorbed with it-- MACCALLUM: So much. HURT: -- obsessed -- on both sides obsessed with it. And it's really not supposed to be like that. We are supposed to have our families and our jobs, everything we do. Politics is not supposed to dominate our lives. That's not -- that's not what this experiment is all about. TARLOV: No, but that trend has been going on for decades and it's been building. That's why we have become more tribal. Obviously, people are not associating with those on the other side because we feel that our values are so disjointed from those that we politically aligned with. The 24-hour news cycle that you have it coming at you all the time, what socially affects social media has on you. MACCALLUM: We will take a break so we can get back to the 24/7 news cycle. (CROSSTALK) TARLOV: Yes, we'll be right. MACCALLUM: And politics that people can argue about. Stand by, you guys for a moment. So we're away now for President Trump's rally in Texas. Because we are not going to talk about your top 10 favorite movies, Charlie, or which is on Sunday. We are going to go back to the rally. The president will be there to endorse his new friend Senator Ted Cruz. They have a very good relationship now, when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: To me he's not lying Ted anymore, he's beautiful Ted. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: beautiful-- TRUMP: He is Texas, I call him Texas Ted. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So, a Fox News alert as we wait for this rally getting underway, that is Brad Parscale, he is the 2020 campaign manager for President Trump's campaign, he was sort of the guy behind all the data and al the metrics in the last campaign and he is leading the way this time around. So, they are all there to support Senator Ted Cruz tonight who is in sort of an unexpectedly tighter race than he thought he would be in, although he's up by about seven points right now in the Real Clear Politics average. But as you remember, President Trump when he was candidate Trump, and candidate Cruz, kind of went at it. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CRUZ: I don't get angry, but if you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that will do it every time. Donald, you are a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone. TRUMP: In the case of lying Ted Cruz, lying Ted lies, he lies. You know, Ted he brings the bible, holds them high and puts it down, lies. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Remember those? Those are some of the greatest hits. OK. But here is the Texas Senate race, 52-45 right now. Ted Cruz, we understand is making his way onto the stage. Are we going there now? Let's watch a little bit of this this. HURT: One thing in politics when former primary rivals have to then get together-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You're a sniveling coward! HURT: It's a great -- it's a great American political (Inaudible). TARLOV: I mean, your father was involved in JFK's-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Yes, there was that. TARLOV: And you're the zodiac killer. MACCALLUM: But politics to nothing is not pragmatic, right? And at this moment President trump needs Cruz to win. HURT: Let's hear those. CRUZ: God bless President Donald Trump. TARLOV: It must really gunk. (RALLY) MACCALLUM: All right. So here comes the president. Just a new piece out there the president saying that he would send all of the troops necessary to the U.S.-Mexico border to block the growing caravan of Central American migrants calling their attack an assault on our country. Here is the president in Texas. (APPLAUSE) MACCALLUM: So, this is all the, you know, applause at the moment before the president starts to speak. I remember at the RNC, one of the most stunning moments was when Ted Cruz was on the stage not endorsing President Trump at the Republican national convention. In the middle of Ted Cruz's speech, the president and his entire family walked in, in the back and the spotlight was on them as they came down and sat in their seats. So, all of the attention was pulled away from the stage and on to the Trump family. So pretty amazing. Full circle as we see often in politics. TARLOV: Yes. HURT: So, I think they (Inaudible). (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: It looks like it. TARLOV: At least for the next two weeks. HURT: Yes. And I think Texas is going to like Trump. (APPLAUSE) MACCALLUM: OK. Looking it all up in Ted Cruz tonight. The president has really been on a non-stop rally tour across America over the course of the last couple of weeks. In 14 days to go. He's also, you know, simultaneously launching his next presidential election campaign it appears. And the president will take over and then after this Tucker Carlson on the other side.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" October 15, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Pete Hegseth, and she jogs on Google Maps, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren just released a campaign ad disguised as a DNA test or maybe it was a DNA test disguised as a campaign ad. In it she ladles her DNA results with somber relatives in music and even includes me. I'm touched. But that happens every time I take the subway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hear some of you are Republicans. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I am a Republican registered. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think of him calling her Pocahontas? UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I think it's ridiculous. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah. I think it's silly. GUTFELD: What does Warren translate into Cherokee as? Spreading bull? UNINDENTIFIED MALE: We did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than 100,000. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: You know, the president likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say? UNINDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have Native American ancestor in your pedigree. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: So, her Native American ancestry may date back six to ten generations. She's potentially 1/1,024th Indian which is 0.09 percent. Using such standards, I'm Asian which is why I can't get into Harvard. (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: So, no wonder she had to rely on sentiment and victimhood. But this isn't really about history but her story, and fixing it because it's a mess. Did she or did she not list herself as a minority in law school directories when it suited her, then removed it when it didn't? It's not about her background, it's about cheating. She's a white woman of vast European ancestry who went to the buffet of identity politics and took seconds then thirds. Warren is Native American because she said so. She wins the 2018 Rachel Dalziel award. So, if we all do the same test as hers and find similar percentages, aren't we also eligible to claim the experiences of an oppressed group and their past grievances too? Her results now become the standard for anyone choosing a past that offers an edge, who can now skip ahead in admissions or jobs in places where diversity trumps experience. And so, DNA tests become the new affirmative action, but at whose expense? Maybe no one because if we're all a little oppressed, we're all good. Goodbye, identity politics. If everyone is a minority, then nobody is. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Silver lining. GUTFELD: There's a silver ling. I think she did the nation a service. We're all now Native American. Interesting fact from Michael Aaron -- Aries -- what's his name? The GOP spokesman. Dana, it used the New York Times sourcing, the average European-American is .18. So the average European-American is actually more Native American than she is. PERINO: Wow. GUTFELD: Did this backfire? PERINO: I think a little bit. It is interesting that a lot of the media were treating this as her response to Trump, but remember she's going to have to get through a Democratic primary. And I imagine -- if it got down to the top ten. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: . that her opponents were going to use this -- Donald Trump wasn't going to have to do anything. So I think she's overreacting a little bit. To your point, she has never actually had to answer this question. Why did she not listed when she was applying to lower tier schools? Only listed it when she applied to the higher tier schools, and then did not list it after she had tenure. That is the part -- even if you are Native American, why did you listed when you only thought it was going to help you get an edge? GUTFELD: Good points. Juan, do you think that this is about Trump or is it about the people she's going to have to face before Trump? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: No, I think it was about the effectiveness of the Trump attack, calling her Pocahontas and ridiculing her in that way, and so I think she wanted to respond. And now, I think it's like jiu-jitsu. She thinks that she has put the pressure on Trump. The key thing here for me is that when the papers then ask the folks at Harvard, did you, in fact, consider this when you hired her, they said no. And look at the University of Pennsylvania, in fact, I think they said at the University of Pennsylvania they filled out a form explaining why they hired a white woman over minority candidates. So the whole basis, the foundation of the Trump attack was, hey, you use this to get ahead falsely, right? And it turns out that's not true, in addition to which she has some Native American ancestry. KATIE PAVLICH, GUEST CO-HOST: I would disagree with you, Juan. WILLIAMS: OK. PAVLICH: You're shock. But in 1997, Fordham University, the lower view describes Warren as Harvard law school first woman of color. So they had that cemented in their legacy. The funny thing about this today though for me was looking at the way the media reacted to this, before really looking at the study and going through the numbers, it was Warren verifies that she's Native American. And the Boston Globe goes through a series of corrections because first they were saying it was 1/30 second, then they go all the way to correcting it due to a math error and it turns out to be 1/1,024. And so, she's going down the line of the impossibilities of the point that you just brought up, Greg, in the sense that she's less Native American than the majority of Americans. WILLIAMS: So do you guys think that she's owed a million bucks by Trump? GUTFELD: I would actually say -- well, Pete, I would say -- I think it would be good for Donald Trump to donate that money, write it off, and then thank her -- thank her for saying -- she points out everyone in America is a Native American. She's done a service. PETE HEGSETH, GUEST CO-HOST: Thank you for doing the work for me. GUTFELD: Yes. HEGSETH: She's got the money, do it. Why not? GUTFELD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. HEGSETH: And I can see the campaign t-shirts now, you know, wearing it. I'm black. I'm Hispanic. I'm Jewish. I'm whatever. And on the back it's just like .09. GUTFELD: Yes. HEGSETH: 1.3, 2.4, whatever you want to be. To your point, it is exploiting minority status. She did it. She did it time and time again. And what the president did was devastatingly lay out how she used it for own advantage. Continues to use it for own advantage. And now, she thinks she's getting ahead of it. No, no, no, no. She's creating more of a problem for herself. She can't get past it. This will make it worse. PERINO: Also, she just have terrible political timing. So, 22 days until the midterm election, the Democrats are losing ground with many Republicans, but they still have an edge, especially in the house, not in the senate. But they're losing ground, but they have all this money. So they have all this -- they could have used all day today, all this week they could have been talking about that, but instead she had to release this today? Why couldn't you do it the day after election? HEGSETH: They think it's great. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: I don't think so. Most of the Democrats that -- like, Jim Messina, for example, who was Obama's communications person like pulling his hair out saying why would you do this today? It doesn't help any of the Democrats that are on the ballot. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: What I'm saying is that -- the story about the DNA test came the day after a Washington Post story about how great she's been to all these Democratic candidates. Once they win their primaries, she's there with a phone call of support with money. And so that was basically saying, well, like she's doing a lot to try to build up a lot of support within the party and then she does this. PAVLICH: Well, and the thing is too, she's having serious problems on the left. If she thinks this is going to help her by claiming with unsubstantiated evidence really that she has minority status. On the left, that a problem with the intersectionality argument, the white woman trying to represent minority argument. So when she's up against people like Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. And on the right people are saying, look, you're a liar. You exploited this to get ahead just by you claiming that you didn't. There's all this evidence and a number of law reviews saying that you were chosen essentially, or at least stated on the fact that your name was listed as a minority as professor before you got to Harvard law. So she has problems on both sides of the aisle both in the primary for 2020 and in a general election. WILLIAMS: But I must say on -- from the Democrats' perspective, I don't think you're right. But it's interesting to listen to how you Republicans are responding because. PERINO: I was quoting Jim Messina. WILLIAMS: No, no. Messina was saying the timing might be an issue, but not all of this, kind of, piling on. I mean, I think it's interesting, to my mind, what comes out is here's another Trump fallacy. Oh, Pocahontas. He likes to ridicule people. HEGSETH: It's a 1 percent constitutes your ethnic background? WILLIAMS: I don't care what it is. The fact is. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Because her family history -- her family history was that her great-grandmother was. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: She lied about it anyway. (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: I don't think you can tell a folktale about my background and then pretend like it's true. WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. I'm just saying that was her family story. She didn't know, obviously, that's why. PAVLICH: She knows now. GUTFELD: Look, my 23 and me, to your point, has me at 2 percent Native American, which is actually more than her, so I'm welcoming her to my family. But to the point, and it's actually a bigger point. Is this the next step in affirmative action, DNA testing? So that every single person, when you're applying for college, you get the 23 and me. PERINO: You don't just get to check the box. You have to send in your results. GUTFELD: You have to send in your result. Yes, scary. PERINO: I'm 1 percent Albanian, remember that from the 23 and me. GUTFELD: That is true. PAVLICH: I was too scared. I was actually sitting at my desk last night about to do that test that was sitting there for a year, and I got freaked out reading the terms of service, and I put it back, in fact, on the desk. WILLIAMS: We always talk about identity politics at the table, but if you are applying, you really want to be white upper-class. GUTFELD: Maybe not have gotten into the Harvard. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Harvard said that's not true. By the way. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying, University of Pennsylvania, Harvard say the same thing. And you said, oh, but Fordham listed said, oh, guess what, we think this woman -- but it didn't impact her ability to get. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: We're going to probably see how Harvard really thinks in this Asian discrimination case. We're going to see how they treat people for real because we're going to be covering that I think wall-to-wall, aren't we? PERINO: It's going to be amazing. GUTFELD: I know. All right. Some in the media are blaming President Trump for the disappearance of a foreign journalist. That's ahead. And don't forget to check out our social media for more behind-the-scenes action on \"The Five.\n\u00a0We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: President Trump has ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Salman about the disappearance of a Washington Post columnist. This comes as investigators have begun inspecting the Saudi consulate in Turkey where Jamal Khashoggi was last seen entering nearly two-weeks ago. The president vows to get to the bottom of what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are going to leave nothing uncovered. That being said, the king firmly denies any knowledge of it. He didn't really know. May be, I don't want to get into his mind, but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows? (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: Meanwhile, CNN's Brian Seltzer suggest the president may be to blame for the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: To lower someone to a consulate to dismember the body and to take it back to Saudi. It is a crime of a different caliber. I wonder if you look at what happened in the last 12 days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric, not just from President Trump, but also then from other world leaders, has anything to do with this, anything at all. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right, Katie, let me go to you first because President Trump, obviously, I think, taking it very seriously and that he's sending Secretary of State Pompeo, like, don't pack your bag, pretty much you're on the plane, right now you're headed to Saudi Arabia. Mike Pompeo probably on the ground. PAVLICH: Absolutely. The stakes are extremely high. The Middle East has changed in terms of the alignment of where things are going. Saudi Arabia is depending on us in terms of the Iran deal. There're lots of things at stake here. And I have a feeling that Secretary Pompeo is going to go ask a lot of very serious, pointed questions. And if the Saudis did this, I know there's some reporting coming out from another network and the Wall Street Journal saying that the Saudis are now preparing a report saying that he came into the building, to the consulate, they wanted to interrogate him and accidentally end up killing him and never made it out of the consulate. Now, we still have to verify that here at Fox. But the point is that this could have been ratcheted up to an even higher level than what we've already seen. The stakes here are high both economically and in terms of national security and that's why Pompeo was sent on the plane this morning as soon as President Trump talk to King Salman from Saudi Arabia who denied it. So we'll see what happens. And I have a feeling we're not going to know all the details in the end of exactly what went down. PERINO: But the Turks and the Saudis are supposedly working together on this investigation, Pete. And the thing is, like even with the Turks, sometimes, well, you don't get to pick your allies necessarily. Sometimes you have to have. HEGSETH: Actually, the Turks are our allies at all. PERINO: Well, that's my point. HEGSETH: Yeah. PERINO: That they are part of NATO which is the alliance. HEGSETH: Which is part of the reason why NATO has become less and less relevant. Not that the whole alliance is but when you let in a country that's increasingly becoming a dictatorship and an Islamist country, -- you don't have a real alliance. PERINO: But if you have an alliance with Saudi, I mean, is the same thing. My point is that sometimes your allies do things to you that will disappoint you. HEGSETH: I don't think we know the two or three layers underneath this. I think it's not fair to call this a journalist pulled in and killed. We don't know what this guy may or may not have been doing on behalf of governments or not. He should have been killed either way. But any cover story that we're going to interrogate him and then we've accidentally killed him? Having been in interrogations, it takes a lot to accidentally kill a guy. So clearly that's a bad story to try to cover up. Clearly, something that was intended towards this guy from the regime. PERINO: And if this story is the one that they eventually come out with, Greg, that they had lied to the world and to the president for about ten days beforehand. GUTFELD: Yeah. I was more interested in, of course, the Stelter angle because -- you know, I remember President Obama mocking Romney about -- saying that Russia was a threat and then -- remember the whisper that was on the hot mic with Medvedev or whatever his name was, about, hey, don't worry. This was happening, you know, while Russian journalists were being murdered in scores, dozens. PERINO: Apartment buildings. GUTFELD: Exactly. I just don't remember Stelter blaming Obama for that. And also it bothers me because the Saudis have done a lot of bad things and we've talked about it on The Five, their treatment of gays, the treatment of women, obviously, they didn't start driving until this year. Thank you, Trump. It's a joke. The way they treat Jews, Christians, they myriad human rights abuses, these have been conveniently ignored. But then they get outraged because it's a journalist. It's one journalist. But what Stelter did was he revealed why. He could leak it to Trump. Like, if he could not link it to Trump, would he have actually brought this up? I don't think so. I'm more interested in Raif Badawi, do you remember him? He was the blogger who had a religious freedom website and he was imprisoned for that by the Saudis. And he's been sentenced to ten years and a thousand lashes. Again, in Saudi Arabia, they still do the lash, OK? So while the journalists are really upset about this one guy, they've been doing this for a long time. And Raif is still in prison. He doesn't get enough attention. He's just a blogger and he's alive. And I think it would be great if Trump sent Pompeo and brought that guy back. PERINO: Right. Juan, your thoughts. WILLIAMS: Well, I thought, you know, to my mind, this is about money. And you see already big American corporations pulling out of the conference that was to be held in Saudi Arabia. And then you see the response coming from the stock market over there. The stock market over there went boom, went way down. And I think there's lots of concerned that the Saudis who now say that if there are threats against them, they will retaliate even more severe terms, Dana. And I think what they're talking about is economic retaliation against not only, potentially, the U.S., but the Germans, the French, who have said this is unacceptable. I think. PERINO: It's not like the Saudi economy has a lot of room -- a lot of flexibility there. WILLIAMS: No, but they have money and they can redirect their resources. But I don't know exactly how much they can do. Clearly, there's a deal on the table that I think concerns President Trump greatly to sell them some airplanes -- I'm sorry, armaments. PAVLICH: But the bigger picture there is Iran, right? WILLIAMS: So that. PAVLICH: It's bigger than just the economy. WILLIAMS: . on the table even as we're talking about American values killing your political critics. It's just wrong. PERINO: They're threading the needle. All right, we've got to run. Trump touting a red wave in the midterms as some Democrats are now fearing a possible 2016 repeat. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Three weeks from tomorrow voters head to the polls in one of our nation's fiercest midterm battles ever. President Trump touting Republican enthusiasm during his campaign blitz in battleground states. The president also ramping up his attack against Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: If Nancy Pelosi -- (PEOPLE BOOING) TRUMP: . crying Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats take over congress, they will try to raise your taxes. They will immediately restore job killing regulations. They will destroy your second amendment and the Democrats want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs. (PEOPLE BOOING) (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Speaking of Democrats, their new concerns the party overconfidence heading in to November. Some Democrats reportedly worried that they could see a repeat of 2016. Well, you know why that is because nobody predicted that Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary. What do you think? PAVLICH: Well, there're a few people who did. So I want to give the people. WILLIAMS: Who? I don't know. Who, the professor? PAVLICH: Few people who did predict that he would beat her. WILLIAMS: Did you? PAVLICH: I did not. The majority. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Terry Sheppard. WILLIAMS: I know that guy at American University predicted. But he also predicts that. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: What is the question? PAVLICH: To answer your question, the majority of polling outlets had Hillary Clinton winning with a percentage of like 87 percent in terms of the chance she had to win. Those same polling firms like 538, they're saying the same thing today about Democrats beating Republicans. Now, that may be accurate, maybe they've change their. PERINO: Well, that polling -- like there's no Electoral College in the midterm election. So the Electoral College was what? Helped President Trump get the victory because he knew what the actually game was and his team plotted out that version. So there's no Electoral College that can help the Republicans. They've got to do it on their own, but they're doing a lot better that they were. PAVLICH: So the point is that the polling could be more accurate because it's per district, it's not for state across the country, the Electoral College. So that being said, there are lots of questions about what people are saying and who they're going to vote for. Independents are still very split. President Trump's numbers are up in terms of his approval. And it's very clear that based on his schedule, when the White House announced a couple of months ago he would be on the road three, four times a week doing these rallies, it was like, OK, it's a lot but it's paying off and people are paying attention. And his polling numbers are not only going up personally but he's actually polling up in numbers in a lot of these districts that he's targeting. WILLIAMS: So, Pete, he's talking a lot about Brett Kavanaugh, a little bit about the economy. Not so much the tax cuts. What do you think of his rhetoric on the. HEGSETH: No, I think he's setting the terms of the 2018 debate. I mean, you saw the gubernatorial candidate in Georgia talk about how undocumented immigrants are going to be part of the blue wave. And he looks at that and says no, no, no, no, we still believe in borders and citizenship and we're going to throw down on that and support our police and stand for the anthem. I don't think this -- the economic results are in and they're good for this president. This election is not about the economy in my opinion. It's still a cultural battle that's being fought. People feel like they're losing their country. They saw what happened to Kavanaugh, they're galvanized by it, 2018 feels a lot like 2016 because the elites are telling us that the polls are for the Democrats, but the pulse on the ground is that their still a belief that this president can deliver. It will be interesting to see in certain houses and senate races watching candidates who kind of technically support Trump versus candidates who have embraced him in suburban districts in which way it actually goes. I'm of the belief that embracing the president means you ingratiate yourself to your base which you need. And independents are more with Trump than we think. And trying to play the tap dance game never works. WILLIAMS: All right. Dana, just picking up on what Katie was talking about. So we see in the Washington Post-ABC poll, the president's numbers went up. PERINO: Yep. WILLIAMS: I think they went up from 41 percent to -- from 36 percent to 41 percent. But that's still -- he's still underwater, 56 percent -- 54 percent disapproval. PERINO: Right. But remember he won the presidency with the same approval rating. And Hillary Clinton -- he and Hillary Clinton had about the same approval rating going into 2016. Actually, I'm going to disagree a little bit, the poll actually show the Republicans are doing better in almost every way. And certainly. HEGSETH: In news cycle than 16? PERINO: Yes. And only in the last four or five weeks and that is partly because Republicans were a little bit late to come home than to focus on election. But in those states where the senate Democrats are running for reelection where Trump won, North Dakota, Missouri, Tennessee, the Republican are starting to pull away. And so, I think, that those things look a lot better. There's one poll today that shows the Republicans are actually right neck and neck with Democrats for the house seats as well. So, who knows what will happen. And that's why we'll be here to bring it all to you. But the polls look a lot better for Republican today than they did a month ago. WILLIAMS: Greg, culture wars? GUTFELD: I think so. I don't think it's about policy or politics, the personality because the policies are working, and so the Democrats have to boil it down. So what if he's made America great. He's still a big jerk. I don't know it that's going to work. The hard part for Republicans a Trump presidency is like -- is measured in dog years. It's like for every one thing that happened in the Obama White House every day, there are seven things that happen every day in a Trump White House. So Obama might have eaten a dog, but Trump is a dog. And he's always out doing something. And -- and that's people are going to tend to forget about the Kavanaugh stuff, maybe in two weeks. PERINO: I don't think so. I think it was -- I -- David French had a piece this weekend that the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation was more divisive than the 2016 election. GUTFELD: Perhaps. PERINO: Because it shone a bright light on where the divisions actually are. And I think that it did bring a lot of Republicans -- it reminded them why they were Republicans in the first place. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: And I think they that are starting to see that especially in those Senate races. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yes, I think enthusiasm on the Republican side is definitely up. Although I saw a poll today -- I think it was The Washington Post -- that had Democrats in the generic up 11, which again would be a jump, so -- PERINO: It could happen. WILLIAMS: We don't know. We don't know. PERINO: And also they -- and also the Democrats have registered a lot more new voters. PAVLICH: True. WILLIAMS: Hillary Clinton facing backlash from both sides of the aisle for dismissing her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky. How can this be? Details straight ahead on \"The Five\".\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAVLICH: All right. Well, Hillary Clinton's shameless hypocrisy is hitting new heights, as if we thought that couldn't happen. The self- proclaimed feminist is making controversial comments that fly in the face of the #MeToo movement. Clinton is now defending her husband's infamous affair with former former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In retrospect, do you think Bill should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal? HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Absolutely not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It wasn't an abuse of power? CLINTON: No. No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are people who look at the incidents of the '90s, and they say a president of the United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern. The power imbalance is too great. CLINTON: Who was an adult. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAVLICH: So Dana, your response? PERINO: Well, I just remember -- I'm going to date myself a little bit but in 1997 when this was going down, I was a staffer on Capitol Hill, and I remember thinking, \"Wait a minute. She was the intern. And I took -- this was wrong.\" And I knew that it was wrong. And I remember the feminist organizations not defending Monica Lewinsky. Remember, of course, how they tried to discredit not just Lewinsky. They called her a looney tunes. Not to mention Juanita Broaddrick and the other accusers. I also feel like she undercut the abuse of power position that has been used in sexual harassment cases in the workplace that was the entire basis of the #MeToo movement. And I think she's been on record saying how important that movement has been, but she undercut the entire thing. Look, her road-show with Bill Clinton is going to be fascinating. And we will be able to get, probably, a block out of it for the next 365 days. PAVLICH: Greg, your thoughts? GUTFELD: Well, first of all, I read that Bill Clinton was also about to do 23andMe until he found out it wasn't a dating site. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: And this -- by the way, this whole thing with Monica Lewinsky isn't a first. If you Google Mimi Alford, similar story happened under JFK. It was an intern that he deflowered, I guess, in his swimming pool. Am I right? PERINO: I think that sounds right. GUTFELD: If not, I probably dreamt it. PAVLICH: I'm not going to fact-check that, but I will assume you're correct. GUTFELD: To your point, no feminist would agree with what she said, because in the mind of the feminist, it's all about the power structure, not about age. It's that, you know, here you have a very powerful man and a powerless woman. But you're talking to the wife. And a wife has a different way of looking at things. She's -- she's thinking that it's entirely possible that the 22-year-old knew what she was doing. That's how a wife would look to defend her husband. So I also see that; I see her point of view. I can't believe I'm actually defending Hillary here, but she's basically saying that that woman -- \"that woman,\" to quote Clinton, had a choice. She had a choice in this matter, too. PERINO: That's a hypocrite. GUTFELD: No, it is. But you know what? Humans are hypocrites when it comes to this stuff. When it happens to you, you and your wife, or you always change the rules. PAVLICH: But Pete, the question is, you know, the power structure, of course, is a problem. The definition of sexual harassment is using a position of power to get what you want sexually out of someone who has less power than you do. The president of the United States with an intern, even if she's an adult, of course is a perfect example of that situation. But as we've seen on the left, the power structure only really matters depending on the political outcome. The reason why feminists defended Clinton in the '90s was because he believed in abortion, so they defended him. And now that we have, you know, different scenarios and different situations, they tend to have a different view of things. And so I'd like your opinion on how you feel about this -- HEGSETH: It's actually amazing, how much of it comes back to those cultural flashpoints. PAVLICH: Right. HEGSETH: Where do you stand ideologically on the things that I say I believe in? And as a result, I'll decide whether I believe you or don't believe you. So Hillary Clinton says, \"I believe all women except those women who -- who said that they were raped by my husband. And I'm not going to believe them, and I'm going to deny them. And not only am I going to deny them, I'm going to shame them publicly,\" which she did multiple, multiple times. Of course power dynamics are here. She made a bargain a long time ago. \"I stay with my husband. I get to run for president. I get to lose twice. Now I get to go on tour with him and continue to pretend like I'm happy to be there.\" Listen, it's all speculation. I hope they have a great marriage. You know, I'm not -- I don't disparage them that. But that bargain was made, and she every day has to walk that line. And it looks like blatant hypocrisy. PAVLICH: Juan, what about Hillary's role? Because every time Hillary opens her mouth, it's a gift of the Republican Party, especially before a midterm election. She's not being helpful on the #MeToo issue at this point. So what's the end game for her? Is it all really just about herself, or do you think it does benefit the Democrat Party in some way? WILLIAMS: No, I don't think it benefits Democrats. And I think people -- we were talking about timing earlier with Messina's comments about Elizabeth Warren. But I think David Axelrod was onto this one when he said, hey, this is not what Democrats want to be talking about. I think my -- my point here would be, look, I think she was asked if her husband should resign. And she said definitely not, because -- and this is according to Monica Lewinsky -- it was a consensual affair. Nobody ever said this was sexual harassment. This was Monica was interested in -- PAVLICH: But I have to -- Monica Lewinsky came out in a piece for the Vanity Fair and said, look, at the time, yes it was consensual, but there was -- looking back on it now -- WILLIAMS: Yes, that's what -- PAVLICH: -- the power structure of it doesn't exactly make it consensual. He really doesn't. WILLIAMS: No. I think -- well, I agree with that. Well, that's what -- you have to look back, though, Katie. Right? So she said at the time it was consensual. That's why it didn't fall into that larger category. But I'm of a mind that, if you go back to the Kennedy -- go back to just throughout history. People have different responses at different times. We're at a Me Too -- hashtag #MeToo moment right now. Remember Kavanaugh, in the midst of his hearings, he was blaming the Clintons. He said, \"Oh, this is payback for the Clintons.\" That was nonsense. GUTFELD: But you -- the point that you're making is, I think, really important. It was a consensual relationship and when things are consensual, the luxury of then changing your mind looking back. It's not fair. To your point, if two people are in a relationship and then all of a sudden, years later they go, \"Looking back on it, I was in -- \" PAVLICH: I think that -- I think that's a fair point to make. However, the bigger argument of feminists at the time and still today, fighting sexual harassment on the definition of someone with power -- PERINO: Yes. PAVLICH: -- using that power against someone who doesn't have any. And when you have the president of the United States against an intern. WILLIAMS: Not against. PAVLICH: Setting the bar. WILLIAMS: I don't know about \"against.\" PAVLICH: Of course against. WILLIAMS: Look, you could argue she was interested in having access to the president. PAVLICH: He was leveraging -- he was leveraging his power to -- against a young woman, as he did against many women. WILLIAMS: But I think that women can also absolutely be entranced by a powerful man. PAVLICH: But the boader problem, I would argue -- and I'll let Dana get the final word -- is the feminist argument of what the definition of what sexual harassment is and excusing it for Bill Clinton while not -- PERINO: Well, let's be very clear. If I had said this or let's just say if Ann Coulter had said this, everyone on the left would have come out and, like, wanted her head on a stake. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: Hillary Clinton says it, and all of them are silent? That's ridiculous. GUTFELD: Good point. PERINO: And that's been going on since 1997. And they have to keep revisiting it, because they didn't deal with it then. They didn't deal with it appropriately then. They're not dealing with it appropriately now. Every single interview that they give they have to answer for it again. So once -- over and over again. Why do you think you lose? This is exactly why you lose. I've been mad since 1997. PAVLICH: -- about it often, so says a lot. But coming up, anti-Trump celebrity Alec Baldwin ratchets up the rhetoric by urging fellow Democrats to overthrow the government. Up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC) HEGSETH: I can't name this song, but I should be able to. Greg? GUTFELD: I don't know either. HEGSETH: No, I don't either. All right. After rolling out his Trump parody again on \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend, Hollywood hothead Alec Baldwin -- that's an official title -- headed to a Democratic fundraiser in New Hampshire to double down on the left's divisive rhetoric. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEC GUINNESS, ACTOR: We need to overthrow the government of the United States under Donald Trump. Not -- not in any violent or unlawful way, but it must be overthrown nonetheless. Let's make America great again by making Donald Trump a casino operator again. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEGSETH: So a lawful overthrow? Juan, I'm going to go to you. So whether it's regime change or harassing or confronting or an illegitimate administration, the left finds every verb they can do to define this administration. Are they going too far? WILLIAMS: No. No, he's very careful. In fact, he said the way that we overthrow governments in this country is at the ballot box. HEGSETH: Why didn't he just say, \"Then vote\"? Why is it always \"overthrow\"? WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Pete, in the age of Donald Trump, you're complaining about hyperbole? PERINO: Yes. HEGSETH: That's a fair point. Fair point. But what do you think? I mean, this is -- Alec Baldwin plays Trump on \"Saturday Night Live.\" He makes a caricature of it. And he walks out in a serious way on the campaign trail and makes a similar argument. PAVLICH: I will say, asking for civility or political correctness in terms of language is one thing, but we have a record now of Democrats, a Democrat shooting up a baseball field. Republicans who have -- Democrats like Maxine Waters telling people to get out in the streets and get up in the faces of Republicans. When we see them -- we've seen Ted Cruz attacked at a restaurant. A number of officials in the Trump administration. And that's the problem here. It just adds onto this frenzy of real physical behavior that we've seen. And he's not doing anything to help kind of bring the temperature down, tell people to get out to vote. We don't really want violence. Just condemn the violence that we've already seen. So you know, that is where we are. WILLIAMS: You should mention this to your \"lock her up\" friends. PAVLICH: Which ones? Which ones? HEGSETH: Well, she's not currently locked up. (CROSSTALK) HEGSETH: -- but some of us. Anyway, this kind of rhetoric, OK, out-of-bounds, inbounds? What do you think? PERINO: Well, I'm not -- I don't really judge the rhetoric that badly. Basically, it's saying overthrow nonviolently, which means, like basically, get out there and vote. I do think that it was instructive. He's in New Hampshire. He's doing a fund-raiser. Because we are -- we are talking about the midterms, but we're actually already talking about the 2020 election. They're in New Hampshire for a reason. Mike Bloomberg was there. He's planning to run as a Democrat in 2020. They could have 35 candidates. So, you know, get ready -- PAVLICH: Buckle up. PERINO: -- for your rhetoric meter to be off the charts. HEGSETH: Pegged, absolutely. So Alec Baldwin says if he ran for president, Greg, he would win. GUTFELD: See, this is the thing that bugs me. Like, I agree with Juan. I don't have a problem with heightened language. Because drain the swamp, it's an analogy. It's not like D.C. is filled with alligators, but he's saying that there are Republicans and Democrats who are swamp rats, and swamp creatures. So I'm OK with it. And the only issue is that, because the left traffics in radical revolutionary rhetoric -- PAVLICH: Right. GUTFELD: -- overthrow probably not the best term. But still, it's just heightened rhetoric that is tied to the ballot box, as you say, I don't see it as a big deal. However, I'm tired of him saying that, if he ran, he would win, because he's a real wuss, if he believes that to be true. That's my heightened rhetoric. He is a wuss for saying that he could win and then not running. Because if you believe you can win, throw your hat in the ring, Alec. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing for him. It would be exciting and interesting, and he's kind of outside of the box. He's their Trump. He says a lot of incendiary things. He's had TV shows, talk shows. He foments controversy. PERINO: He never said he was Native American. GUTFELD: He never said he was -- and he is more Native American. PAVLICH: Because we're all Native Americans now, according to the data. GUTFELD: And what a great first family if he wins. HEGSETH: It would be amazing. GUTFELD: Stephen Baldwin showing up. HEGSETH: Juan, what do you think? I mean, add him to the list on the Democratic ledger? WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I mean, entertaining. I think what Greg is saying is that this would be a wildly entertaining contest. And so there was a piece I saw today that's talking about, oh, so that's where we are. We're in the age of celebrity politics. So you could have the Rock. You could have Oprah Winfrey and Alec Baldwin, right? But I mean, what does this say about us as a country? That's who we pick to be our leader? You love it. You love it. HEGSETH: You don't have to raise $1 billion to raise your name I.D., but you already have 100 percent name I.D. That's a pretty good advantage. I mean, that is where we are. We live in a media world where people have to know where you are. WILLIAMS: So the media landscape determines your leader. It's like the tail wagging the dog. It's like, you know, you guys are so hard on Avenatti, that lawyer. Avenatti says this -- HEGSETH: You'd rather just compare old-fashioned resumes? GUTFELD: We have \"One More Thing.\" HEGSETH: We do? GUTFELD: Yes. HEGSETH: Let's do it. Up next, \"One More Thing\" on \"The Five.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: All right. Halloween is upon us. I hate Halloween costumes. They're so boring, and they objectify my body. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: So I thought we'd have some costumes. This is from \"The G.G. Show\" that we offered that are fair and balanced. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Introducing the FOX News Favorite Faces costume collection. Like the Brian Kilmeade. This costume comes complete with dark jacket, light shirt, khakis and a bold but tasteful tie. Or how about the Steve Doocy? With this awesome-looking dark chocolate, light shirt, khakis and a bold but tasteful tie. We've even got Tucker Carlson with his one-of-a-kind dark jacket, light shirt, khakis and a bold but tasteful tie. Then try the Greg Gutfeld. (GUY IN A SWEATER VEST, ON HIS KNEES) (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: That was mean. All right. Juan. WILLIAMS: Well, it's a fun Saturday afternoon for me in Washington, D.C., this weekend. I spoke at the Newseum about my new book, \"What the Hell Do You Have to Lose? Trump's War on Civil Rights.\" Here are some pictures from the event. As you can see, I was interviewed by John Maynard of the Newseum. It was a great turnout, people from all over. Fans of \"The Five\" a major presence. Thank you so much. Here I am signing books, talking to some folks. In addition to enjoying the book talk, though, lots of people had questions about the Newseum and the state of American journalism today, covering President Trump. It's difficult. Anyway, it was a great afternoon. My thanks to the Newseum and to John Maynard. GUTFELD: Great. PAVLICH: Very cool. GUTFELD: Dana. PERINO: OK. So Chris Stirewalt has two boys, and they came to visit me last week and brought me these amazing things. Like, the seasonal flavored M&Ms. So I went and I got some for everybody. This one here would be Neapolitan. OK? You can open these up and try them here. We've strawberry nut. GUTFELD: Strawberry nut? PERINO: Let's see, which one's this one? No. 3, raspberry. Greg, I'm going to get you these, because I think you're going to like these. Mint chocolate chip. GUTFELD: Oh, yes. That's going in my pocket. PERINO: Those are really good. Espresso, anybody want espresso? GUTFELD: Those are great. PERINO: And how about this? White pumpkin pie. Anybody like that? GUTFELD: White? PERINO: White chocolate pumpkin pie. GUTFELD: That's very alt-right. PERINO: I'm 2 percent pumpkin pie. I don't know what that is. Can I have some of -- wait, you took them? GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: We have to share them. Anyway, they're really good. I can't get enough of the mint ones. Thank you to the Stirewalt boys. GUTFELD: All right. What, did they make them? PERINO: No, they bought them and brought them to me as a gift. HEGSETH: If you made M&Ms in your basement, you might have copyright problems. Just a little bit. GUTFELD: Exactly. Pete, you're next. HEGSETH: Am I next? GUTFELD: Yes. HEGSETH: All right. So I've never been to a Foo Fighters concert, but I'm a big fan. I'm told the concerts are always a big -- full of surprises. They were at the Sprint Center in Kansas City. And they pulled up a 10- year-old -- his name is Collier Rule -- onstage to play Metallica, watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC: \"ENTER THE SANDMAN\") (END VIDEO CLIP) HEGSETH: Juan's asking the right questions. That's just a 10-year-old from the audience. PERINO: Wow. HEGSETH: Handed -- Dave Grohl handed him his guitar. He immediately started playing, \"Enter Sandman.\" PERINO: Wow. HEGSETH: And the band played it with them. The kid says, you know, \"Metallica knows who I am now. Foo Fighters know who I am. Dave Grohl gave me his guitar. I played in front of the Sprint Center. I think my bucket list is done.\" Amazing! PAVLICH: A multi-million contract now. HEGSETH: But they gave him the guitar, and he just started to play. GUTFELD: Do you think that's because they learn from the Internet now? They just learn From YouTube? HEGSETH: \"Guitar Hero.\" GUTFELD: \"Guitar Hero\"? PAVLICH: Maybe. WILLIAMS: We need more guitar players. GUTFELD: Yes, definitely. Katie. PAVLICH: All right. So last week I was in Israel visiting the borders of Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. So I have some photos for you. I was there for a fact-finding mission through the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Here's the separation wall with the West Bank and -- and Judea Samaria. This is obviously the Western Wall and the Al Aqsa mosque. This is a view into Lebanon. Those hills you can see in where Hezbollah has lots of rockets pointed at Israel. This is a sign next to the Syrian border. And also, we have some photos of a fence. We went to a kibbutz, which is a little neighborhood right next to Gaza. And as you've seen with the reporting from Trey Yingst there in Israel, there has been lots of rioting. And they think things are going to start heating up even more than they already have. So we were there getting some interesting information and briefings from officials as things get heated up, as we like to say. So thank you to FDD for taking us on that trip and giving us some information. HEGSETH: Cool. GUTFELD: All right. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 failed 2016 presidential run resigned Wednesday, raising concerns of a racial strain within the organization, a report said. Our Revolution former co-vice chair Catalina Velasquez, an undocumented immigrant and transgender activist, said she left the group because it was insensitive to Latino and immigrant issues. The departure fueled worries of tension between Latinos and African-Americans within the group, Politico reported. \u201cFor the past month, we have been fighting divisive narratives targeting immigrants and pinning us against other oppressed peoples,\u201d Velasquez wrote in\u00a0a letter\u00a0she posted on Twitter. \u201cI have faced this with little to no support from the organizational leadership.\u201d Activists within the group had reportedly complained that issues important to one group, such as immigration reform or Black Lives Matter, have failed to become a focus for the other. Additional complaints reportedly lodged against the organization included its transparency concerns in making endorsements, a drop-off in fundraising and a failure to influence major elections. Velasquez\u2019s resignation came a month after the departure of Lucy Flores, the group\u2019s former political director, who left after claiming the group ignored Latino issues, the outlet reported. Insiders have labeled these issues as \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in the transition from presidential campaign to grass-roots organization. Our Revolution was formed by Sanders\u2019 top campaign workers after his 2016 presidential primary loss, in a bid to keep his grass-roots army ready for a potential 2020 presidential bid, according to Politico. Sanders, who was criticized in 2016 for failing to connect with black voters and earn their votes in Southern states, announced Monday that he will seek re-election to the U.S. Senate. The move has been largely viewed as preparation for the 2020 campaign. While Sanders has attempted to energize support across diverse groups, skeptical parties say he \u201cstruggled then and clearly now\u201d reaching black voters. \u201cThe guy\u2019s from Vermont, it\u2019s not like he has a massive [black] constituency,\u201d Ray McKinnon, a black pastor from Charlotte, N.C., told\u00a0Vox\u00a0about Sanders, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cHe failed to connect on a visceral sense.\u201d Sanders will travel to California in June to meet with trade unionists and rally with Black Lives Matter activists.

            "article_content": "What are sanctuary cities and why are they so controversial in the illegal immigration debate? Most churches have what is called a sanctuary \u2013 a designated, sacred area for worship. But for many undocumented immigrants, these religious buildings are becoming their own sanctuary. As the Trump administration continues its\u00a0\u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy, more congregations are adopting so-called \u201csanctuary church\u201d programs in an effort to help or support undocumented immigrants in the community. Cristo Rey Church in\u00a0Lansing, Michigan, announced Monday it would become such a place. Father Fred Thelen said the Catholic parish decided to become a sanctuary church for immigrations after two years of \u201cprayerful consideration, discussion and education, testimonies and dialogue,\u201d MLive reported. Father Fred Thelen announced Cristo Rey Parish in Lansing, Michigan, will offer sanctuary to illegal immigrants. (Cory Morse/The Grand Rapids Press-MLive.com via AP) Trump has decried the concept of sanctuary cities, and his administration has threatened to rescind federal funding from those places. Read on for a look at what sanctuary churches are and the history behind them. There are no stringent legal specifications for what makes up sanctuary cities \u2013 areas that limit just how much local law enforcement officials can comply with federal immigration authorities \u2013 and the same can be said for sanctuary churches. From providing legal advice and prayer to giving undocumented immigrants a place to stay when facing imminent deportation, many churches tackle their sanctuary status in different ways. For Shadow Rock United Church of Christ in Phoenix, Arizona, sanctuary churches \u201copen their doors and provide a living space to an individual and/or family that is facing deportation. The purpose is to provide additional time for their cases to process through the legal channels,\u201d its website states. If a church does not have the physical space to house an immigrant, it can provide other forms of sanctuary with laundry services, meals, doctor visits or companionship, according to Shadow Rock, which has provided sanctuary since 2014. WHAT ARE SANCTUARY CITIES? In December 2016, the Anglican Diocese of Los Angeles adopted a new resolution and encouraged its congregations to become sanctuary churches, which it described as \u201cplaces of welcome, refuge, healing and other forms of material and pastoral support for those targeted by hate due to immigration status or some perceived status of difference.\u201d Cristo Rey Church will provide housing for undocumented immigrants without criminal records, according to MLive. The church will also work with lawyers to help their case. Vicky Chavez walks with her daughter Issabella in the First Unitarian Church, in Salt Lake City. Chavez, a Honduran woman who came to the U.S. four years ago seeking asylum from an abusive boyfriend, says she'll continue taking sanctuary in the church where she's been for the past six months with her two young daughters despite being ordered to leave and exhausting her appeals. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does have \u201csensitive locations\u201d agents will typically avoid carrying out enforcement actions, according to the federal agency. Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and other places of worship are considered sensitive locations. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT SEEKS SANCTUARY AT SEATTLE CHURCH However, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warns that ICE\u2019s protocol on sensitive locations \u201cprovides no absolute protections\u201d in guidelines it has published for sanctuary churches. Sanctuary Rock said it informs ICE when it brings \u201ca guest into sanctuary.\u201d The ACLU warns that federal law prohibits the harboring or transporting an undocumented immigrant while knowing of his or her legal status. HONDURAN WOMAN FEARING DEPORTATION GIVEN SANCTUARY IN CHURCH \"There is a law against harboring people who are here illegally and shielding them from deportation,\" Jessica Vaughn, director of public policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for tighter immigration restrictions, told Fox News. \"Most churches that are acting as a 'sanctuary' are very careful to avoid breaking that law,\" she said, adding that for many churches, the \"point is to make a political statement\" about immigration laws. No. The Sanctuary Movement was established in the 1980s as Central Americans, particularly from El Salvador and Guatemala, entered the U.S. illegally to flee wars in their countries. Churches banded together to provide support and asylum for the refugees. The New Sanctuary Movement was created in 2007 by religious leaders in California, Chicago and New York City, according to its website.",

            "article_content": "DOJ inspector general's report calls former FBI director James Comey 'insubordinate' and reveals new Strzok-Page text that says 'we'll stop' Trump; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" June 14, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Marie Harf, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Breaking news, we're awaiting a press conference from FBI Director Christopher Wray in response to the scaling Justice Department inspector general reports. We'll bring it to you when it happens. Among the many new revelations, the I.G. report blasts former FBI Director James Comey for how he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe, saying he broke protocol. The White House is responding to stunning developments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president was briefed on the I.G. report earlier today and it reaffirms the president's suspicions about Comey's conduct and the political bias among some of the members of the FBI. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: All right. Let's bring in Special Report anchor Bret Baier. Bret, I'm sure you have not read the entire thing or you're probably -- BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you know how many trees were killed, Jesse? We're all printing it. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: And I'm sure you're all reading it. (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: So tell me -- what really jumps out at you so far from what you've seen from the report? BAIER: One, the big loser, James Comey. This I.G. really goes after the former FBI director for his decision-making. Two, the other loser, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and those text messages that are -- that surfaced, more of them, in this report. The biggest of which will be, I'm sure, grasped upon by President Trump and his supporters and that is seven words that -- is an answer to attacks from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok, Trump is never going to become president, right, right? And Strzok then responds no, no, he won't. We'll stop it. Well, that, in and of itself, even though we don't have the full context of what they're talking about there, just that in a vacuum will create major fuel to the issue of what was happening behind the scenes. The other thing though to note is that overall at 30 thousand feet, the I.G. says that they couldn't document political bias within the FBI on the decisions made early in the Clinton email case. It does raise questions, though, about the bias that they did find and how that affects the case after July, when the FBI Director Comey comes out with that news statement. WATTERS: Yeah. And it seems like the report really teased up the next I.G. report about the Russia investigation, especially off of these new Page-Strzok texts. Let's take it around the table, Kimberly Guilfoyle. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: All right. So, you know, Bret, I think there was a lot of, you know, people saying there's going to be significant evidence in here. It's obviously quite voluminous. But, in terms of the level of discussion that preceded this, do you think that the take away of what you're hearing from behind the scenes is that this was something that they overpromise, under-delivered, or how would you characterize it? BAIER: Yeah. I think, first of all, depending on your political point of view, if you're just talking pure politics, you look at this and there'll be people who say, oh, it's a nothing burger. And the other people will say it's really chock-full of damning things. I think what you'll hear from the FBI Director Chris Wray is that this is a big problem within the FBI. And they're going to probably announce some kind of action that they're taking. GUILFOYLE: They should. BAIER: If you look at Trey Gowdy and what he put out in this statement that he put out, he says he's alarmed, angered, and deeply disappointed, and goes on to detail in pretty scathing terms what he sees. And he's a guy who has defended the FBI, even in the most recent spy-gate stuff. WATTERS: Well, Juan Williams took a really good day to takeoff. And we have Marie Harf in his place. Marie, take it away. MARIE HARF, GUEST CO-HOST: Hi, Bret. Well, Jim Comey already responded in the New York Times op-ed where he endorsed the I.G.'s efforts, but that he disagree with some of the findings in it. What do you think is next for Jim Comey? Does he keep speaking out? Does he go quiet? Is he investigated further by DOJ? What happens for him next? BAIER: I bet he kind of goes into the night. It's interesting that he's out of the country at the time the I.G. report is coming out. He obviously made his rounds on the media, including on Special Report. He made the book tour. He kind of laid the groundwork for his defense and, obviously, has this letter to the New York Times. But the stuff in here suggests that he made some big mistakes in the eyes of the inspector general of the justice department. And no matter if you look at it from a Clinton perspective, that there are folks who think he cost Hillary Clinton the election, or a Trump perspective and how he dealt with President Trump after the election. WATTERS: I mean he took it on the chin. I mean, they said he committed serious violations of FBI policy and process, and did damage the credibility of the investigation and the institution itself. So, pretty tough stuff coming out of the I.G. report. Dana? PERINO: Well, Bret, in Jim Comey's statement, in reaction to this, right away, first a tweet and then an op-ed in the New York Times, he says, look, I respect the I.G. I think they did a great work here. Reasonable people can disagree. So, he's moving on. Now the Strzok attorney, he did put out a statement as well. But he didn't address these text messages, and I'm curious if you think that might happen? And then, my other question is Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, had a lot of bipartisan support, lot of credibility across administrations. Congressman Radcliffe said today that he has read the report, he's been briefed on it, and he still maintains confidence in Michael Horowitz, which I guess means that this next I.G. report which is on the actual Clinton emails themselves and that investigation would, at least, have some credibility. BAIER: Yeah. And I think these are questions that I'm going to ask Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte, and they'll be on the next hour on Special Report. I think that there's a lot here that tees as Jesse mentioned, the next iteration of the I.G.'s effort. And the second text, the part that says no, no, he won't be president. We'll stop it. That was just released last -- in the past few days, weeks. And the first part where the question was asked, will he be president, was released but the second part was not. You know, that tells you something about transparency and where this document back and forth is going up with Capitol Hill and oversight. I think, to your point, people will look at this and there'll be Republicans who look at it and say it just didn't deliver. And I think others will look at it and say there's a lot in here yet to be mined. WATTERS: OK. Now from The Five's inspector general, Greg Gutfeld. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: This is a stunning read, Bret. It's blowing my mind. Hey, I heard a rumor that the FBI is going to change their name to FWB, Feds with Benefits, is that true? BAIER: There is a section -- GUTFELD: Yes. BAIER: -- in the I.G. report that deals specifically with that about tickets from organization and invites to golf outings. Yes. GUTFELD: I do have a serious question. There was a part there where we found out that Comey used his private email to conduct -- I think it was non-classified business, which maybe why he couldn't damn Hillary for doing the same thing because it's like mutually assures destruction. Everybody is guilty of doing the same thing. Could that be part of the reason why he decided not to proceed further? BAIER: I tell you what, these -- you're trying to be funny, but these are -- GUTFELD: I'm serious. BAIER: -- are really good nuggets of the report that had not been put out there. Comey is using a private email, even though it's unclassified, to deal with the email investigation of Hillary Clinton. And the I.G. says that's not a good thing. I've got the Gutfeld diaries over here and I've been looking through them. GUILFOYLE: Frightening. GUTFELD: You're on Page 70. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You do not want to be on Gutfeld's diary. That's the last place you want to be. But nice job with the interview the other day, the president, and we'll be looking forward to 6 PM for another great Special Report. BAIER: All right, see you guys. WATTERS: All right. Kimberly, like we've talked about, some of these nuggets that are coming out and it's going to take probably another 24 hours to get all of them. Her emails were penetrated by a foreign agent. And, that, we really didn't know because Comey himself said it was possible that that happened, and now we learned that it actually did happen. And, one of those emails was considered secret, which means disclosure of that email reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security of the United States. GUILFOYLE: Yeah. I think this is significant because much was made at the time. Well, it's possible but there was no nailing it down. But, obviously, they knew and were not honest about it. And, essentially, what I call that is a cover-up. Like, why if you knew that in fact that they've had been penetrated and he'd been read, etcetera, by or accessed by a foreign agent, that is significant. It is a security breach of the highest order, and something that is very disconcerting for us for national security. But, there you go, Hillary Clinton, the rules of law do not apply to her or to Mr. Comey. Birds of a feather flocking together. WATTERS: Right, another weasel move by the director. Marie, some of the nuggets that I'm really interested deal with Strzok, because they keep coming, the, we'll stop it, meaning we'll stop the Trump presidency, when you pair that with, we need to protect the country from Donald Trump, and we need an insurance policy in case he is elected, and now FBI agents are calling Trump supporters retarded, at least 5 FBI agents exchanging anti- Trump, pro-Hillary text messages. The I.G. says there was willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. That sounds pretty serious to me. HARF: It does. And I think they demonstrated incredibly bad judgment. But the I.G. also found that there was no evidence of political bias or improper motivation affected the Hillary email investigation. So, what I've always said is, these people should not have been doing this. It was stupid. It looks bad. And the I.G. actually found that, that it looks bad, it called into question the investigation impartiality. But there's no evidence that their personal views impacted -- WATTERS: Yeah, because they're not dumb enough to leave a paper trail -- (CROSSTALK) HARF: Jesse, you and a lot of folks on the conservative side have been waiting for this report, and basically putting a lot of faith in what comes out of it. They've found very clearly -- WATTERS: I think we've been downplaying it. We said it was probably going to be, you know, a big air ball, but go ahead. HARF: I think it's important -- selective history, fake news. I think that it's important that they did not find evidence of political bias impacted the investigation. They've also found that they had no way, no ability to prosecute Hillary Clinton under the five statutes they've examined. So, I'm not in a tree, but the department of justice looked into the question that a lot of Republicans and Trump supporters keep bring up, and found, in fact, that they did the right thing here. WATTERS: That's actually not true. What the I.G. report says, Dana, is that witnesses, meaning prosecutors of the DOJ or FBI investigators, didn't think that this would be a prosecutable case. It doesn't mean the I.G. concluded that that was the fact. It just meant some attorneys disagreed. PERINO: Well, to further that, I think what one of the things Comey did was -- so the I.G. says insubordinate or insubordination, but who did that really benefit? It benefited Loretta Lynch who was the attorney general, because he then took it out of her hands for making a charging decision that I'm sure President Obama and Loretta Lynch did not want to do to their nominee. WATTERS: Of course. PERINO: But this gets me back to the original point of how do we even know any of this? Why we've spent so much time and so much money on all of this? And it goes back to Hillary Clinton's decision to subvert the process, to have her own email system, to have a private server, and we -- so that was in 2015, and is now 2018 and we have spent 500 Pages. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: What you might say is that at least she uncovered, you know, the Strzok and Page email situation and their bias against the president. I don't know. WATTERS: We've been moving backwards for a long time on the show. GUTFELD: I remember we've said -- I don't know when it was, she was like talking about gender. It's not about the female. It's about the email. That's what we kept saying. A couple of points -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Yes, it is -- (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: How amazing it must be to be Anthony Weiner. He might be one of the few people who's happy he's in jail, because the fact is if it wasn't for his laptop and his lap, Trump wouldn't have been elected -- I mean, he kept -- we should be thanking Anthony Weiner. He kept Hillary out of office. That's really about him and Huma. GUILFOYLE: There they are. GUTFELD: Also, it is amazing -- again, this is more evidence that Donald Trump can turn people into emotional high school freshman. Strzok and Page they were like characters in the David Bowie song Heroes. You know, they're up against the wall. They're fighting -- they're going to stop Trump. They'll do anything they can. It was so deeply emotional for them. They were like star-crossed lovers in a romantic song. One final point -- GUILFOYLE: Hollywood starlets -- liberal Hollywood. GUTFELD: Exactly. I think it's weird timing that the day that this report comes out the media gets a gift in the state of New York suing Trump over the Trump Foundation. It's incredibly well played -- WATTERS: That's a coincidence. GUTFELD: No, it's not. It's party and media working hand-in-hand. And, it's just to me just so obvious and wrong. WATTERS: It is. And to Greg's point about Carlos Danger, they found that they sat on these emails for -- I think a month, and Strzok was behind the slow walking those up to James Comey's office. GUILFOYLE: Yeah. When you see this it's really sad, isn't it though? You know we read this and you become almost desensitize, but this is really egregious. You're talking about, you know, the FBI that is, you know, held to the highest regard in terms of justice and supposed to be truth seeking and fact finding without any ideological bent. And you see the people here that were only hell-bent on undermining the Trump campaign and preventing a presidency. You see a candidate in Hillary Clinton that completely just disregarded the law, destruction of evidence, and really just creating a situation that undermines the confidence not only in our political process and campaigns and elections, but in our highest investigatory agencies. And what you're seeing here is a modified, redacted report by Rod Rosenstein who is allowed to do this, and he's actually in the middle of all this. So, how is this, you know, coming out it with clean hands? We actually don't know what all the evidence is because some of it has been removed. WATTERS: Well, and I think some members of congress are trying to request the original draft of the documents before they were changed or allowed to have been looked at by other people. All right, more breaking develop on the DOJ's I.G. report coming right up. And we're also awaiting the FBI's press conference at 5:30. We're going to have that for you live. Plus, watch this White House reporter, they're screaming at Press Secretary Sarah Sanders over immigration. Packed hour of The Five, don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUILFOYLE: A day after President Trump labeled fake news the enemy of the country, White House reporter Brian Karem loses it on Press Secretary Sarah Sanders over separating undocumented children from their parents. Take a look at this tense moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRIAN KAREM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Come on, Sarah. You're a parent. Don't you have any empathy for what these people are going through? They have less -- SANDERS: Brian, God, settle down. I'm trying to be serious, but I'm not going to have you yell -- (CROSSTALK) KAREM: -- and they have -- these people have nothing -- SANDERS: Brian, I know you want to get some more TV time, but this isn't what it's about. I want to recognize you. Go ahead, Jill. KAREM: Honestly, answer the question. It's a serious question. These people have nothing. They come to the border with nothing, and these poor children in cages. You're a parent. You're a parent of young children. Don't you have any empathy for what they go through? (END VIDEO CLIP) GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. All right. So, getting a little intense there, Greg, in the press briefing room, so what do you make of this? GUTFELD: I was waiting for him to throw a shoe, but judging from his apparel, I don't think he wears them. He's the press club hobo. All he needs is just a little bindle. You remember the little bindle that hobos used to have? GUILFOYLE: What is in those bindles? They were very small. GUTFELD: You know, we were always told that Trump -- it's true, there was never anything you could put in the bindle. It's true. They always said that Donald Trump would be a terrible influence on his side, the Republicans, and they're half right. He's been a terrible influence on the media. I think they judge Trump's behavior and say -- you can say and do whatever you want now, including being a complete jackass, which he was. That was purely an emotional and a dishonest response in his part there. Kids are not being held in cages. Maybe you saw that as a meme on twitter, but that's not reporting, strange man. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: There's no policy about family separation. It just so happens -- if you're going to deal with the parents you've got to get up the kids away, and they're trying to get them to a relative, a living relative, or a friend in the United States. That's what they they're trying to do. GUILFOYLE: They've been careful. GUTFELD: They're not putting them in cages, you nut bag. Sorry. GUILFOYLE: Any other -- GUTFELD: No. I hope he does have shoes. GUILFOYLE: Yeah. PERINO: Everybody should. GUTFELD: Everybody should have shoes. GUILFOYLE: OK, Dana. GUTFELD: I'm pro-shoe. PERINO: I'm not -- GUILFOYLE: You like pink shoes. GUTFELD: I'm a fan of Elisabeth Shue. Should we move on? GUILFOYLE: Yeah, let's go to some common sense and intelligence, shall we. PERINO: Well, I do think that this issue of children being separated by their parents in one that you can go through all of the policy points and it's quite logical. You can see the laws, the executive orders, how HHS, Health and Human Services, and DHS, Department of Homeland Security, tries to deal with this issue. But, also, as Greg has talked about, there's the emotional part of it and it is strong. And you have it running rampant. I do think the White House needs to confront this a little bit, because that -- it wasn't just being a jerk, like, people are like, are you kidding me? You're ripping babies out of the arms of their mothers and this is crazy? You're ridiculous. That's fake news. I actually think that online, in particular, this is spreading quite rapidly -- GUTFELD: But they're using false pictures. PERINO: I agree. I think that -- your point that the president needs to give a speech. GUTFELD: Yes, half the citizen there. PERINO: And it should be on a teleprompter or whatever. It should be a detailed speech about what he is for and what he's not for. And he's signaled that he's willing to go for this new compromise that the house Republicans have come up with it that -- actually you know, it could pass and that would be very good. But the other thing is, again, I go to the root cause, the drug cartels are really fueling this. They have figured out a way to make a nice little bit of side money because it's not just like on the money that they're like, oh, we could get money by getting -- like your life savings and you'll give it to me, and I'll tell you how to go. And the coyotes send the people there. And that's what, actually, the problem. Like, we have to deal with the root cause of it, and deal with the fact that we have some people here that need to be taken care of and returned to their home country. GUTFELD: How dare you call them coyotes? WATTERS: Yeah, coyotes charge about five grand a head at the border. PERINO: Right. GUILFOYLE: They've taken advantage of these families. WATTERS: And how do you know if they're even related when some guy brings over someone else's kids. You don't know. You don't know if they're being traffic, so you want to separate them. They're trying to do what's best for the kids. Also deter people from bringing people across the border. You know what's a great deterrent? You never have to separate a family at the border, a wall. How about just building a wall. There won't be people coming across. You wouldn't have to separate anybody. This guy is an emotional wreck. He embarrassed himself. He doesn't belong in that room. It's like Acosta. I don't care if you have opinions like that. Be an analyst. Go debate it on CNN in prime time, but don't pretend to be a nonpartisan correspondent and then melt down like that and embarrass your integrity. These people don't belong there. They're jokes. They start ripping press passes away. If you're going to act like a wild animal -- GUILFOYLE: Right. WATTERS: -- you don't belong there. And if that was a Republican -- GUILFOYLE: Here we go with animals again WATTERS: Right. GUILFOYLE: When animals attack. WATTERS: if that was a, you know, conservative reporter yelling at a female Democrat press secretary -- GUILFOYLE: People would flip. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: -- the lead story will be completely different. Did James Rosa ever did that to you? GUILFOYLE: We have 45 seconds. HARF: So, I think that Dana is absolutely right. It is a very emotional issue. And I do think that Sarah Sanders needs a better answer than to ignore it. She needs to think about it and talk about it in a very compassionate way. And then, the president needs to take charge of it and do what Greg -- PERINO: I think Sarah Sanders just need -- they owe her better at the White House -- (CROSSTALK) GUILFOYLE: All right. OK, no personal attacks. Not nice. We're minutes away from the FBI's response to the DOJ watchdog report. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: Fox News alert, we're learning brand-new details from the DOJ inspector general report. Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is at the justice department with the latest. Catherine, I haven't talked to you in a couple of hours. Let's just check back in with you and get your thoughts. Now we are at 5:30 right before this press conference that the FBI is going to hold. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Dana, and thank you. This is the 500 Page report. It was 17 months in the making. And there are a handful of key takeaways. Number one, for FBI Director James Comey, the inspector general found that when he gave a statement in July 2016 about the Clinton email case and when he recommended against criminal charges, the inspector general found that when he gave a statement in July 2016 about the Clinton email case, and when he recommended against criminal charges, the inspector general found that that was insubordination, that he had gone outside the chain of command, he had not notified his leadership, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, her deputy Sally Yates. And that when he made that decision, it was not really his to make. That should have fallen to the Justice Department. No. 2, these text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, this really hung like a cloud over the Clinton email investigation. The inspector general found that there was no documented evidence that political bias infected the Clinton email investigation. So in other words, that it changed the steps that they took me investigation prior to Comey's statements in July 2016. But just last month, a new text message was uncovered between Strzok and Page where they talk about stopping Donald Trump. And the inspector general said that, in the latter stages of the email case, Agent Strzok made the priority the Russia investigation and not the Clinton emails, and that explained why there was such a delay to go through newly-discovered emails that had been found in late September on Anthony Weiner's laptop that he shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. On Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the inspector general found that she showed bad judgment when she met with Bill Clinton on that Arizona tarmac in June of 2016, and that she clearly did not understand the implications and sort of the bad optics it would have not only for the public confidence in the Justice Department and FBI but also for the integrity of the email investigation -- Dana. PERINO: We're about 45 seconds away from the press conference. We've gotten that they're almost ready. Can you tell me anything more about what Peter Strzok's lawyer said today and if we'll hear anything more from him, especially about that most -- HERRIDGE: Right. PERINO: -- seemingly damning text message. HERRIDGE: OK, so Peter Strzok's lawyer's position is that any delay in the final stages of the Clinton email investigation was down to just basic miscommunications between Strzok, deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe and Director James Comey. It was not because of political bias, Dana. PERINO: Catherine, I'm going to have to interrupt you and turn it over to Chris Wray, the FBI director. (FBI PRESS CONFERENCE) PERINO: All right. That was Christopher Wray -- he's the FBI director -- talking about the I.G. report from the Justice Department. One of the things he said is that \"Nothing in this report impugns the integrity of our workforce as a whole or the FBI as an institution.\" And then while we were watching that press conference, Hillary Clinton decided to weigh in, so I think we have a tweet from her. Let's see if we have it here. So Kyle Cheney is talking about how Comey used a personal email address to some business, and Hillary Clinton writes three words: \"But my emails.\" And Greg, you were sort of alluding to this earlier. GUTFELD: Yes, it was the question I posed to that young man, Bret Baier. You know what's funny about what -- Hillary doing that? Christopher Wray brought up tons of examples of the great work that the FBI does, all these cases that they've solved. And it underlines the tremendous amount of wasted energy and time -- GUILFOYLE: Yes. GUTFELD: -- invested in this scandal because of the tweeter, Hillary. \"But my emails.\" Yes, but your emails are the reason why this is happening. Oh, go to the woods. GUILFOYLE: And stay there, and Jesse will find you. WATTERS: I've already tried to hunt her down. She was nowhere to be found. I like this guy. He's a straight shooter, Chris Wray. He had to protect his agency. That's fine. He's going to take disciplinary action, probably against Strzok. I mean, this guy is a total catastrophe, and he's almost single-handedly, besides Comey, destroyed the reputation of the FBI. And they're going to retrain everybody and tell everybody not to leak. That's good. But the bottom line is, Hillary was never going to be charged. The Obama DOJ, they were never going to charge her. Hillary always skates. Bill Clinton always skates. She was the most powerful woman in the world, about to become president. They're not going to charge her. And that was never, ever going to happen. PERINO: Comey -- Comey should have made Loretta Lynch do it, then. GUILFOYLE: Yes. PERINO: Right? WATTERS: He should have punted it to her, and had her take the fall. PERINO: Then we wouldn't have this whole mess. GUILFOYLE: Yes, but that's part of his whole ego, is that, you know, he's smarter than everybody. He knows better than everyone else. So he appointed himself judge and jury; he usurped her power. It was inappropriate. It wasn't up to him whether or not to make a charging decision. So people are upset about this? You should be upset with Comey specifically, as well, because he's the one that put the fix in. He was the puppeteer of this whole thing. It's an obstruction of justice. It's -- it's filthy, the whole thing, how this went down. And it really besmirches the reputation of the incredible men and women that work at the FBI. Then you have people like Strzok and Page and Comey and these people that decided, you know, that they woke up one morning and someone made them God. HARF: And I am furious at Comey. I'm furious with him as a Democrat, because you read this, and some of the things he's being criticized for, the decisions, whether it was the July 5 statement about Hillary Clinton, the October statement said they reopened the investigation. Those decisions hurt Hillary Clinton and helped Donald Trump politically. So Comey, who already was not a sympathetic character to any Democrat or Republican that I know, I think comes out of this looking really bad. Really sanctimonious. He -- you know, Christopher Wray watching that, he's so -- he screams nonpartisanship; he screams confidence. That's the kind of FBI director Jim Comey wanted to be seen as. And now look at what's happened. GUTFELD: You know what? The other bad news about this: more training. Like, these are FBI agents. PERINO: They're like, \"We're good. We're good.\" GUTFELD: They're supposed to be solving problems, not -- they're going to turn the FBI into Starbucks. PERINO: Are we all done here? OK. I can't hear what you said in my ear. I'm sorry. There's all this chaos today. GUTFELD: You know what I mean? OK, what's the training? Don't sleep with your coworkers, right? Don't sleep with your -- don't leak. There you go. That's the only training. PERINO: How about just follow the protocol as it is? GUTFELD: Yes. Don't waste the agents' time. PERINO: Can I ask you about, you pointed out earlier that, in the report, there's -- there's an instance where James Comey says he doesn't know that Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner are married. HARF: Right. GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, don't you watch \"The Five\"? We talked about that, like, every single day. PERINO: And \"Red Eye\". GUILFOYLE: We focused on that, yes. GUTFELD: She should have canned Huma. I don't know. Right? She should have canned Huma a long time ago. Would have saved some trouble. GUILFOYLE: So much for canned. WATTERS: It's not Huma's fault. It's not Weiner's fault. It's Hillary's fault. But I think what's going to -- we're going to see this, and this is going to be one of the few I.G. reports. Right? And it's only going to crystallize when you look at this I.G. report and then the next one coming down the pipeline about how the Russia investigation -- PERINO: I think the next one is actually about her email -- her decision not to charge her on the emails. I think that's the next one. WATTERS: OK, and that's going to be enlightening. Then we're going to see the decision that they made -- GUILFOYLE: The unredacted ones, though? WATTERS: Right. And then we're going to see the decision that was made to open up this Russia collusion investigation; and we're going to see how differently the Hillary people were treated from the Trump people. Hillary was treated with extreme deference. Her people were given immunity. They destroyed evidence. There was no accountability there. And Trump and his team were treated like they were already guilty. And that's going to become clear. And we're going to see -- they've actually asked Strzok for his personal emails, and you know what he said? He refused to hand them over. So the disgusting and disparaging things he said on company email. Could you imagine what Strzok was texting to people on his personal email? It's going to be the worst. PERINO: Maybe because he was at home, maybe he wasn't. WATTERS: Well, you know, we'll see. That's why a lot of people think we need a special counsel to subpoena those, because -- PERINO: The text messages were to his -- WATTERS: -- the I.G. has no subpoena power here. GUILFOYLE: Yes. PERINO: Right, Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: Look, I've got no time for this guy. I think it's just terrible, and everybody, probably, in the FBI cannot stand him. But again, I would go higher than that. I would say it's Comey. I would go higher than that. I'd say it's Hillary Clinton, all of the above. None of these people should be proud of their actions. As a former officer of the couch, as a prosecutor, and I see what happens here and subverting justice and perpetuating a fraud on the American people. There really is just no justification for this. PERINO: Perhaps the only consequence, though, or punishment. It's like a slap on the wrist. GUTFELD: Well, I have a little bit of breaking news. We're talking about the foreign actor penetrating the Clinton emails. Turns out that it was Antonio Banderas. PERINO: Really? GUTFELD: Yes. Either that or Javier Bardem. They're the only foreign actors I know. WATTERS: They -- they did find that, when Hillary was in a hostile country, she emailed with Barack Obama, and they knew that. James Comey did. But when he released his report, he scrubbed Obama's name and just said \"an unnamed government\" -- HARF: Did Donald Trump ever use a personal phone or email? WATTERS: He probably does. That's what's so ridiculous about this. HARF: No, I just thought it was an interesting question to ask. What do you think? WATTERS: You know what? We don't know. HARF: There have been reports that he does. And so let's -- if we're so concerned about email security and what devices we use, maybe we should be consistent and make sure -- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: OK, if we're going to be consistent, maybe he should smash his BlackBerry with a hammer before he turns it over. HARF: I would love it if it meant he didn't tweet again. I would love to. PERINO: What would we talk about, Marie? Come on. You've got a whole radio show. You've got two hours. HARF: I know. PERINO: What would you do without the tweets. GUILFOYLE: Dan Scavino can tweet from his phone. HARF: No kidding. PERINO: Well, we're, like, basically trying to -- GUILFOYLE: Fill time. PERINO: Water from a stone. GUTFELD: I think there was a little something for everybody. HARF: That is true. GUTFELD: You know what it was? It was like a Vegas buffet. It's never as good as the actual pictures of the food. PERINO: I don't really like picture food. GUTFELD: You see the pictures. And it's not -- GUILFOYLE: Really? You love to eat those. GUTFELD: You've got the eggs benedict. You've got the pancakes. You've got the waffles. I'm really stretching this. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: And then, when you get to the buffet, it's never as good. PERINO: But do you like to go to restaurants where they have pictures of the food? I don't like to go to those. GUILFOYLE: That's usually a flag. That's usually a warning sign. I mean, except if it's McDonald's. PERINO: Right, right, right. Fast food is different. Jesse, final thoughts? WATTERS: Final thoughts. HARF: Are you going to read this whole thing this weekend? WATTERS: I mean, this is a lot of heavy lifting here. PERINO: That's what we do. WATTERS: It's going to get worse. I feel like they're going to find even more dirty nuggets in this thing. GUTFELD: Dirty nuggets. WATTERS: And by the time that's over -- PERINO: Don't you think they're already found? WATTERS: -- it's going to be onto the weekend. Look, we've gotten all this after three hours. Three hours. They're going to have a whole night of people reading this stuff, a bunch of staffers. There's going to be much more incriminating stuff. But we'll be on to some other story tomorrow. PERINO: Onto another story. That is true. Well, set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: You're looking live at the White House. Moments from now, the president is expected to address the issue of illegal immigration and border security, just as we're hearing now of a fourth -- that's right -- a fourth caravan of migrants making its way to the southern border. All this as the president is pushing to end birthright citizenship. Now, critics say he cannot do that under the 14th Amendment. But a constitutional law professor is here to say, not so fast. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. I would like to thank my buddy Charles Payne for filling in so ably -- in fact, too ably -- when I was out. Meanwhile, now to this immigration fight. We have got John Roberts at the White House on what we can expect to hear from the president of the United States -- John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil you back so soon? I thought you would have taken the rest of the week off. CAVUTO: Apparently, there was something going on with the market. I was - - but anyway, go ahead. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: So, the president will be giving us an update on where we stand on the border with immigration at 4:15, as he's on his way out to Columbia, Missouri, for a big rally tonight The president will be talking about the deployment of troops on the border. \u00a0And then he will talk in broad brushstrokes about something that we have been talking about here on FOX News for the last few days. And that is some changes to the process of claiming asylum in the United States. At present, if you go to a port of entry, you can claim asylum. If you cross the border illegally, and you're apprehended by the Border Patrol, you can claim asylum, but the White House wants to change that, so that asylum claims could only be made at a port of entry. So if you're coming across the border between the United States and Mexico, you would have to claim asylum at a port of entry. People who entered illegally across the Rio Grande or across the desert in Arizona or New Mexico wouldn't be able to claim asylum. They would remain in custody while their cases were adjudicated, and then they would be sent back to either their country of origin or, through a deal that is under negotiation with Mexico, maybe be able to be removed directly to Mexico. So the president will only talk again in generalities about this, because the White House still has not worked out the legal framework for how to do this. But I'm told, Neil, it would be a combination of authorities by the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the presidential powers to protect the country under Article 2 of the Constitution. And it's likely we won't hear about the exact plans for a number of days. \u00a0But the president really trying to keep immigration high up on the radar screen in terms of election issues. In many states across the country, health care is the number one issue, immigration further down the list, though still important, but the president putting that front and center. He did it last night at a rally outside Fort Myers, and he's going to do it again tonight in Missouri, and then in Indiana and West Virginia and every other battleground state between now and Tuesday -- Neil. CAVUTO: All right John, thank you very much. ROBERTS: You bet. CAVUTO: Now to the border, where U.S. troops are starting to arrive already, the president saying up to 15,000 of them could be deployed. Rick Leventhal in El Paso, Texas, with the latest. Hey, Rick. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil, we're outside the gates of Fort Bliss, one of several military installations in Texas, Arizona and California, serving as logistic and support hubs for those thousands of troops being deployed, at the request of the Department of Homeland Security, to support the bureau -- the -- excuse me -- Customs and Border Protection agents who will be deployed along the southern border, in some cases in very remote locations. And some of those thousands have already arrived. Many more of those military troops are on the way now. And they include aviation brigades, combat support battalions, medical companies, military police, logistics teams, and lots of engineering assets to set up lights and build fencing and barriers and temporary housing, not for the migrants, but for the troops and the agents tasked with keeping the caravans out. And it sounds like the soldiers who are headed this way are pretty pumped about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SGT. THOMAS OLESON, U.S. ARMY: I would just like to say that it's actually a really big honor that the Army has chosen us to come here and spearhead this whole operation. PVT. 2ND CLASS ROBERT MARSCHEWSKI, U.S. ARMY: Very excited. This is just another way to support my country and do what needs -- and do what needs to be done. As a combat engineer, we are very highly trained in obstacles. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL: There are a total of four caravans now, some with hundreds of migrants, others with thousands. And authorities have suggested that some of the migrants have already been involved in violent confrontations with Mexican police and could be more violent than others in years past. At their current pace, though, Neil, it will still be weeks before they reach the southern border with the U.S., if they do at all. CAVUTO: All right, Rick, thank you very much, Rick Leventhal. Now, what appears to be getting lost in this entire debate is, well, who's here legally and who is here illegally? So we tend to focus on illegal immigrants and not the legal ones who are already here. Is this an issue that could be a big one five days out? Vince Coglianese is with The Daily Caller. Vince, what is interesting about this is that better than 1.3 million of people are processed with green cards and ultimate citizenship in this country year in and year out, through this president, through a Democratic president, Republican presidents. And you would think right now in this environment, it just stopped, we shut down our borders, we shut down taking people in from all over the world, when, in fact, we have been -- we have been actually building up the number of immigrants we're getting, just, again, the legal immigrants we have been getting. Lost in the sauce. VINCE COGLIANESE, THE DAILY CALLER: Right. Well, there's a reason it's lost in the sauce, is because you have a lot of people for political reasons who are trying to conflate the two. Illegal immigration and legal immigration are, of course, completely distinct categories. But you often hear liberal opponents of the president conflating the two things. For instance, you commonly hear, well, immigrants commit fewer crimes the native-born Americans. And that number is constantly a conflation of both illegal and legal immigrants. It's a sleight of hand. It's dishonest, and it's meant to protect the status quo. And it shouldn't be done. Ask any lawyer legal immigrant about the status of illegal immigration in the country, it's hard to find more fervent opponents to the state of our immigration system right now and how illegal immigrants get across the border. It's an interesting dynamic that very few in the press are even willing to talk about. I'm glad you are. CAVUTO: You know, what's interesting about it is that, whatever you think of what the president's trying to do by sending troops to the border, and whether that could agitate things or not, we are still taking in record numbers of people from all over the world, either through green card processing, eventual citizenship. So you get the impression that whatever is happening with caravans, which is a recent phenomena, by the way, no one is coming into this country, and that gets little press attention, to your point. But I'm wondering, the danger with that, then, is we blur legal with illegal immigration. That's a big no-no. COGLIANESE: It's a tremendous danger and it shouldn't be done. And the president of the United States has shown no appetite to changing legal immigration, in the sense that he wants to get rid of it. Now, does he want to change it? Yes, he does. I mean, he's talked about how he wants it to be a merit-based system coming into the United States. \u00a0He thinks the idea that we have a diversity visa lottery and chain migration, basically forms of migration where we don't actually vet people based on what they contribute to the country, that needs to be changed. But is he saying we need to get rid of immigration? No. But that's not what you're going to hear from his opponents, who are constantly saying that he's anti-immigrant. They couldn't be farther from the truth, because the facts are really obvious here. Millions come in legally every year. CAVUTO: Right. COGLIANESE: And the president obviously is OK with that. CAVUTO: And what worries me the most about that is we got a false narrative set up here that -- then there's the racist charge and all of that -- again, when so many from so many parts of the world are coming in, and it loses sight of that and makes it appear that the United States... COGLIANESE: Yes. CAVUTO: ... has shut down to accept immigrants, when, in fact, that has never been the case, not only through this president, but his predecessor, through his predecessor, and on and on back we go. We are still netting gains of excess of a million foreigners coming into this country... COGLIANESE: Yes... CAVUTO: ... from all over the Earth. COGLIANESE: And Americans deserve a chance to have an opportunity to assess that system and say, OK, is it good for us and how many should actually come into the country? Very few people want to even have that conversation. Instead, we get mud slung at everybody about how somebody is anti-immigrant or somebody is not pro-immigrant enough. And that, of course, isn't the stakes of the debate. \u00a0That's emotional. That doesn't have anything to do with reason. It doesn't have anything to do with facts. And let me say one thing on these illegal immigrants. The idea that a caravan is moving towards the United States, how many people actually make it to the border, who knows? But know this. That is a symbol of the illegal immigration problem. The fact that troops are going to the border, it's not for one caravan. \u00a0Last -- in September, 17,000 people were captured by the Border Patrol trying to get into the United States. There are thousands of people every month trying to get into the United States. And something needs to be done in order to fix that problem. It's not good for the immigrants and it's not good for America. CAVUTO: And on the legal immigration side, it makes a mockery of their process to go through... COGLIANESE: Yes, it does. CAVUTO: ... the process, and to go through the process of getting a green card, getting your family on board as well, something the president will no doubt address. This other issue is going to be coming up with the 14th Amendment and whether he has the right to go about doing what he wants to do, and just go back to this notion that just because you're born here doesn't automatically mean you're a citizen here. That's a tough uphill fight. We're going to be raising that with a professor, but he runs into a buzz saw of criticism on both sides from that. COGLIANESE: A little bit, yes, he does. But I think if you just look at it from the perspective of, is this fair, I think there's a huge open debate within the United States of America among its citizens about the idea that illegal immigrant arrives in the country, has a child, and that kid instantly becomes a U.S. citizen, maybe even leaves the country and never wants steps foot on American soil, until they return when they're 18 years old. That's not a system that makes sense. And that's a system that probably needs to get a fix. And if it just means making sure illegal immigration is not happening, then that will be a fix I think that, ultimately, the president satisfied by. CAVUTO: Well put. Vince, thank you very, very much. We do have a constitutional expert, a professor on this, Hillsdale College constitutional studies professor Matthews Spalding. He wrote a very fascinating piece here exploring what the president wants to do here, essentially arguing that the 14th Amendment isn't as black and white as it would appear, noting that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" -- crucial words, according to the pressure -- to the professor -- \"are citizens of the United States, wherein they reside.\" Professor, good to have you. You argue that that leaves some room for interpretation, at a minimum, right? MATTHEW SPALDING, PROFESSOR, HILLSDALE COLLEGE: It leaves a lot of room. And, as matter of fact, that clause, \"subject to the jurisdiction,\" was added precisely to clarify. We don't put words in the Constitution, they're not there with no meaning. So the words \"subject to their jurisdiction,\" where there is a debate, does that mean ordinary laws, you abide by traffic rules when you're here, or does it mean, which is what they said and what the sponsor of the legislation in the Senate said, it means political allegiance, you're not subject to anybody else in terms of your allegiance? It implies something more. The idea that being born here leads to citizenship, the place, is not consistent with the ideas of consent and the rule law in the context of the United States. The idea of inheriting one's citizenship from one's parents stemming from their political allegiance is what is more important. Indeed, that's the dominant view of most countries in the developed world, all the countries in Europe, which we oftentimes like to emulate. CAVUTO: Yes, explore that, all the countries in Europe, because what they have is, they don't look at as a right of soil, in other words, where you were born... SPALDING: Right. CAVUTO: ... but the bloodline, the right of blood, that that is the distinction. Could you explain that distinction? SPALDING: What they mean by right of blood is not that you're dramatic or Italian. What they mean is, it's from parent to child. That is, before the child is capable of making the decision of whom they want to be allegiance to, they're not yet able to do so, they make it based on their parents. So if their parents are Italian, the child's Italian. If the parent is American, the children are Italian. So when John McCain is born in the Panama Canal zone to American parents... CAVUTO: Right. SPALDING: ... he's still an American because of his parents. That's what's consistent with the principles of the American founding. And I think that's pretty clearly what was intended by the writers of the 14th Amendment. Even the courts, the Supreme Court, who upheld this understanding several occasions, when they ruled in 1898, they were only dealing with the question of permanent residents. They were not dealing with people that are here on a weekend as a temporary visitor, and not at all dealing with people that were here not legally in the United States. This idea is something that just kind of came about and was assumed as we went forward. But there's no clear Supreme Court decision this, and the law doesn't say this, the laws of Congress, which is precisely why the president, for perfectly reasonable reasons, should issue executive order to clarify, so that those that are under him, his agents, the agencies, actors, do not do something that is inconsistent with clear -- clear -- clear Supreme Court mandate or the letter of the law passed by Congress. Without that, he should make sure they're not doing something wrong. (CROSSTALK) CAVUTO: Just to help me here -- and we're waiting for the president to clarify this at the White House right now. But when President Obama took executive action to shield hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants from deportation, this president is using the same argument to do what he's doing. Are they -- are they related? SPALDING: Good point, but very different things. What's the job of the executive, according to the Constitution? It's to faithfully execute the laws under which they are operating. In the case of President Obama, he wanted to do something that Congress specifically didn't do, indeed, they chose not to do it, and he wanted to do it anyway. \u00a0He was going contrary to law. In this case, there isn't law. The Congress has laws on who becomes a citizen. But in the particular here, all they do is say subject to the jurisdiction of. It leaves the 14th Amendment question open. The court has not clearly said what to do with someone who's here illegally or temporarily. This is exactly the case in which the executive, who's responsible for executing the law, should issue a executive order clarifying how to execute the law, consistent with the law. So he's not doing something that's -- that's against something that is there. The problem is, it's not clear. There's no clarity in the law, which I think is probably the better way to solve this problem. And, in the meantime, he should make sure that his own administration is not doing something, perhaps giving away citizenship, when they ought not to, according to the rules that Congress has established. CAVUTO: So, Professor, help me with this. I mean, I have talked to a number of legal scholars who say, I mean, no one has challenged the veracity of the 14th Amendment to accept those born in this country to eventually be citizens of this country, that you could come back and counter, well, our founders never would have envisioned the type of situation we have today, where many illegals come in, have a child, that child instantly becomes a citizen. They themselves, by extension, ultimately get to stay here, that that would have never been envisioned by our forefathers. Be that as it may, the Constitution stands, and they say, it has never, ever been picked apart to be denied. And you say? SPALDING: Well, I see your point, but we have to understand that the Constitution is actually written for future circumstances as well. It is very clear that, although the immigration laws we have today are much more complicated, the challenges that we ever much more complicated, the 14th Amendment comes along after the Civil War, mainly to do with freed slaves. Nevertheless, they wanted a citizenship clause, and they wanted to make sure that it included the right parameters. And they added this phrase, \"subject to this jurisdiction of,\" and told us what it meant, precisely because we do know they didn't want to give away citizenship. CAVUTO: All right, just to be clear -- I'm sorry -- you are a genius, and I am not. I just want to be clear. (LAUGHTER) CAVUTO: This came around 1866, so right at the Civil War. SPALDING: That's right. CAVUTO: It was geared to help those former slaves. SPALDING: Who were here, who were here, and had no jurisdiction. CAVUTO: Who were here already. And that's a very big distinction, right? SPALDING: That's an extremely large distinction. But, in doing so, they also knew that whatever definition they put out there would apply to everyone else. That's precisely why saying that you're born and naturalized isn't sufficient. They came back and added this other clause, \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" precisely to get out of that loophole, which is now playing out, I think, unfortunately, with people who come here sometimes on a weekend to have a have a child to give them citizenship that they might not even take advantage of until years later, when they want to get the benefits. That makes a mockery of this whole notion that citizenship means something in this country, and that naturalization means something, which as someone who actually supports the idea of immigration and immigrants becoming Americans -- it's what's beautiful about this country -- that belittles it by making it something small over which we are, the American people, have no consent, which is to say no ability to control. It takes it out of our hands. That makes immigration something less than it ought to be and historically what it has been. And it's no longer under our control. That's why he's hit on precisely the right issue. And I think, under the circumstances, he -- he's pointed out a loophole, if you will, where the courts have not clearly said something, and the Congress has not further clarified. He's driving this wedge in there and driving both his friends and his critics back to the Constitution, which is a great thing, for which I'm thankful. But that means there will be litigation and there will probably be congressional legislation. Lindsey Graham has already introduced legislation. And that's precisely the kind of constitutional debate we should be having, because behind here has nothing to do with disliking these immigrants or that immigrants. It's -- behind it is this question, what does it mean to be a citizen of the United States? How should we approach that question, or what are the rules by which you do that, how we're fair to people that want to go through this naturalization process? And I think this question over time has become something it was never intended to become by both sides, by the courts or Congress. CAVUTO: And we should point out, in the example of your -- that you mention your column and discuss, that this was based on those in Europe in a situation, let's say, like this. At least one of the parents came from that designated country. SPALDING: That's right. Or, in the case of myself, we have two beautiful adopted children. And the law was changed in the 1990s such that, when you adopted children in a foreign country and brought them back into the United States, they automatically became U.S. citizens. Congress in Section 5 of the 14th Amendment is given the power to carry out, to enforce the 14th Amendment, which means that it's Congress' responsibility to determine who becomes a citizen here. CAVUTO: Very good point. SPALDING: And what the -- what President Trump, I think, wants to do is kind of fill that gap, because Congress has not said, in this case, people who are here illegally or temporarily can be citizens. That's not what the court said. He's just pointing out, I think, what is an obvious thing when you study it, and wanting to issue an executive order to clarify, what do we do in those circumstances? CAVUTO: All right, Professor, thank you very, very much. The president of the United States will be addressing this entire issue here again. What are the bounds and the limitations here when you go ahead and say that you want to reconsider this? (NEWSBREAK) CAVUTO: All right, the president making it very clear in a sweeping series of remarks here that these caravans, up to four right now, that are coming to our border, he says they're not welcome here, they're not legitimate asylum seekers, these caravans are illegal, they are illegal. He says this catch-and-release program ends. He's saying that the typical behavior we have had in the past to take those in and then make a court date for them, they never return for the court date, that will end. It will just be catch right now. There will be no release. Now, analysis continues now on Fox News Channel, on cable and satellite, more later on your local Fox News station. I'm Neil Cavuto, Fox News in New York. All right, to the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, Lee Miringoff, on this. What is the impact going to be, Lee, a few days out of the midterms? The president is standing his ground here, says that there is no reason to entertain allowing these caravans into this country. They will have the asylum process and will go through that, but they will not be allowed to be released into this country. What do you think? LEE MIRINGOFF, DIRECTOR, MARIST INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC OPINION: No, I think look, it is very clearly, to me -- anyway -- not to sound too cynical about this -- but this was an attempt to reset the agenda. The last week was not a good one for the White House. And there were a lot of -- you don't like to talk about the shooting in Pittsburgh or the bombs that were sent in political partisan terms, but, right now, he's trying to get it back on his message. And this is the same president who comes down the escalator when he announced a candidacy and talks about Mexico. Now we have him as president, and he's come up with the policy which is going to be very controversial, certainly. It belies the fact that there were no comprehensive laws passed in the last two years. CAVUTO: But, Lee, you can think about it, that whatever -- both parties that are blamed for getting us to this stage. MIRINGOFF: Sure. CAVUTO: But the president seems to be betting that Americans are, by and large, sick of this. He pointed out that legal immigration has continued, over a million who got their green cards and/or final American citizenship, that he's addressing illegal here and these caravan. There's a right way to go about it and a wrong way to go about it. Do you think, whatever your personal views on this stuff, that that will resonate at the polls, or will it just be noise? MIRINGOFF: I think it's all -- no, no, I don't think it's noise. I think he's talking to his base again. I think he's getting a revved-up based. We're looking at a -- voters right now in America who are -- first of all, are already voting in record-breaking numbers for the early vote. CAVUTO: All right. MIRINGOFF: And then what we're talking about is the both Democratic base being mobilized, the Republican base being mobilized... CAVUTO: Exactly. MIRINGOFF: ... and then watching the independents and seeing which way they ultimately go. But the language in this, I mean, it -- if -- I would be more comfortable if he separated out the policy he's advocating from the elections. And yet I was counting. The word Democrat was five times. He ends up talking about the governor's race in Georgia and all the places he's going around the country. CAVUTO: Well, he was asked about that, about Oprah campaigning on her behalf. MIRINGOFF: Right. CAVUTO: But you're right, Lee. There's a lot at stake here. I apologize for the truncated time, with the president. MIRINGOFF: No, that's fine. CAVUTO: Lee, it's always a pleasure having you take the time with us. MIRINGOFF: Yes. CAVUTO: Do want to alert you to what's happened at the corner of Wall and Broad today, the first day of November, after a rocky October, stocks up, the Dow up about 265 points. A lot of technology stocks were up. Having said that, though, Apple after the bell out with earnings that handily beat the Street. The fact of the matter -- and this is a conundrum with Apple -- it sold only 46.8 million iPhones. Never mind it made oodles of profit on them, $793 a pop, vs. the expected 750 bucks a pop. That's weighing on Apple stock after the bell, so maybe some tough times for technology stocks going forward tomorrow. Let's get a read on what individual investors are thinking right now as we head into a month that maybe, they hope, will be friendlier than October. TD Ameritrade CEO Tim Hockey here on that. Tim, thank you. Good -- good to see you. TIM HOCKEY, CEO, TD AMERITRADE: Good to see you too, Neil. CAVUTO: Well, we started out better than we had in October. Is October behind us? Have we settled all this out, or what? HOCKEY: Well, who knows. CAVUTO: Yes, really. HOCKEY: I -- all I do know is that clearly there's a lot of retail engagement. The October ups and downs were what I would have thought would have occurred this late in the cycle, certainly a lot more volatility than we have seen in, arguably, years, certainly for a protracted period. But November certainly seems to be starting out strong. CAVUTO: What drove it? I know the concern about interest rates getting a little higher, where you can compete for a return on that -- on your investment with the full safety of Uncle Sam in that case. But is there something bigger at play we're missing? What do you think? HOCKEY: I don't think so. I think it's probably the maturity of where we are in the cycle. It's a series of what we just talked about, along with global trade issues, some of these same issues that have been percolating along. As you know, there's a very fine line between the tipping point between fear and greed. And markets do succumb to that. CAVUTO: Right. Right. Well, you are big in the retail community. Average folks relate to you. \u00a0They relate to TD Ameritrade. They're America, really. And I'm wondering, given the fact that we were going up, up, up almost uninterrupted, without so much as a pause, that now they're thinking, wow, I can lose my shirt here, or are they feeling that cooler heads have prevailed? HOCKEY: Well, what we're seeing is actually interesting. And we have two pieces to our business. We have our retail business, which is the average, as you say, American investor. But we also have a custodial business or institutional business for our RIA clients. What's interesting is, we're finding our retail clients are actually buying into these dips. They're seeing this as an opportunity to be a net buy position. CAVUTO: Is that right? HOCKEY: Whereas the institutional clients are actually selling. They're taking a little bit of money off the table. So... CAVUTO: Usually, the rule of thumb is, the institutional guys are the ones who have the smart strategy, the retail guys not so much. Usually, that's not proven out historically, but your thoughts? HOCKEY: Right, but the difference here is that the -- the RIAs are taking care of clients that themselves might not feel too confident in the market... CAVUTO: Understood. HOCKEY: ... whereas our average retail investor, the self-directed investor, they are actually quite confident in their own ability to read the market. And they actually tend to be savvy investors. CAVUTO: You know, Tim, what I noticed, that things were going hunky-dory today, we were up a little bit, but then we got news via presidential tweet that he and the Chinese leader talked very favorably on trade, maybe setting up high expectations that maybe this could be resolved. Stocks shot up over 200 points, ended up over 200 points. Trade does seem to dictate this market. The better it looks for a deal, the better it looks for stocks, the worse, the worse. What do you think? HOCKEY: Absolutely true. I think it's one of those things that you can't -- probably can't find any topic that economists generally agree on as strongly as, trade is good for the world. And so, therefore, markets react to that. So, if it looks like trade is going -- global trade is going to be better, as opposed to be disrupted, then, generally, I think markets reflect that sentiment. CAVUTO: You know, markets are preparing for the House switching party control. That seems to be a consensus. Others will argue that. The president is saying that's why the markets have been so volatile, fearing a Democratic House. I think that's been baked into the cake for a while, but what do you think? HOCKEY: I have no idea on the political swings of things. I tend to think it's much more fundamental to that. We are in -- long in tooth in a bull market. We do have some very large macro issues. CAVUTO: But there is no bear market to worry about here, in your eyes? HOCKEY: Who knows. I'm not a market prognosticator. But I do know that, if you just look back, instead of looking forward, this is a very, very mature cycle. And what you do see at the end of some cycles are this type of higher volatility. One of the interesting things for us as a firm... CAVUTO: By that, you mean we have had a record long nine-plus-year bull market. We're due. HOCKEY: Who knows if we're due. This is one of the longest in history, as you know. And so the question is, if history repeats itself, it's likely to turn the cycle at some point, which is why we spend a lot of time trying to educate our clients, because many of our clients have not actually invested in a bear market cycle. CAVUTO: But they have not cashed out? They are not all of a sudden cashing out? HOCKEY: They certainly have not cashed out. They certainly have not. CAVUTO: All right, Tim Hockey, the Ameritrade president and CEO. Again, just to review, virtually all sectors within the S&P 500 were moving up today, interest rates relatively stable today. So, the same thing that was sort of gnawing at markets last week eased a little on this first trading day of November. That doesn't necessarily mean that will always be the case. We got a big jobs report out tomorrow that could have a lot to say about the direction of the economy and still more earnings, seven out of 10 of which have handily beaten estimates. That is the wind at this market's back, and, the bulls hope, will continue to be. That will do it here. \"The Five\" is now.\u00a0\n\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

For the past two days, a Florida city has been littered with fliers accusing a local businessman of being a predator who profits from \u201csexual violence, physical abuse and the caging of undocumented people\u201d -- all because he rents office space to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Chuck Prather, of St. Petersburg, said protesters who are angry with the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance illegal immigration policy are targeting him because he leases an office complex in Tampa to the government. It\u2019s an agreement that goes back 21 years and was recently renewed. \u201cThey are trying to terrorize me,\u201d he told Fox News on Thursday. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices are housed at a Tampa building owned by a St. Petersburg businessman. (Google Maps) On Wednesday, dozens of fliers showing his image were posted around St. Petersburg\u2019s downtown area, where he owns several businesses, including the Birchwood Inn. \u201cI was taking my son to school yesterday when my elderly neighbor who walks dogs for a living came up to me and said, \u2018I need to talk to you,\u2019\u201d Prather said. \u201c[She said] there are posters all over town. It has a big picture of you and it says that you are a predator. What is going on?\u2019\u201d Prather added: \u201cThey were everywhere.\u201d This flier was posted around the St. Petersburg downtown area accusing Chuck Prather of being a 'predator'.

Chuck has earned his wealth through leasing property to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as other border control offices.\u201d And the harassment campaign didn\u2019t stop there. On Thursday morning, Prather woke up to find more posters plastered around his home, and the words \u201cEVICT ICE\u201d spray painted on the sidewalk. Protesters also spray painted 'EVICT ICE' outside Chuck Prather's house. (Courtesy of Chuck Prather) \u201cThis is all about ICE. This is nothing about me being a predator, which I am not,\u201d he said. Surveillance photos, provided to Fox News, from outside the Birchwood Inn show two people putting up the posters. Surveillance footage from outside the Birchwood Inn, owned by Chuck Prather, shows two people posting the fliers.

They are completely innocent [and] their livelihoods are being targeted.\u201d The U.S. government \u2013 not ICE, specifically \u2013 has leased the building complex from Prather since 1997, and he said he hasn't had any problems until the protests began last month. He said a few weeks ago he had to pay $10,000 to repair damage to the Tampa building caused by vandals. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg Police Department told Fox News on Thursday officials are looking at surveillance footage to figure out if any laws have be broken, adding freedom of speech is at play in the determination. Prather said he is looking at all legal avenues available to him.",

            "article_content": "Longtime Sen. John McCain died on Aug. 25 at the age of 81. (Reuters/Brian Snyder) John McCain was a U.S. senator for more than three decades. Before that, he was a congressman. And during his tenure in the Senate, he became the Republican nominee for president. McCain died Saturday at age 81 after suffering from glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. Before McCain was a politican, he served in the U.S. Navy in the Vietnam War. He was a prisoner of war for more than five years and suffered lasting injuries, including to his arms and right leg. Here's a look at some things McCain accomplished throughout his lengthy political career. While McCain's job as a liaison to the Senate was supposedly more of a \"glorified valet,\" according to the Los Angeles Times, the Navy veteran turned the position into what the newspaper called \"an apprenticeship\" that would help launch his political career. The Arizonan won his first campaign in November 1982 when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. McCain had\u00a0moved to Arizona\u00a0in 1982. He was re-elected to the House in 1984. McCain replaced longtime Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater in the Senate in a 1986 election. He would continuously be re-elected to the Senate until his death. The Keating Five scandal refers to a group of senators who were accused of meeting with federal banking regulators on behalf of financier Charles Keating Jr. Aside from McCain, the Keating Five included: Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Donald Riegle, D-Mich. The five senators allegedly attempted to pressure federal regulators on behalf of Keating \u2013 who was a massive campaign contributor to the five and would eventually spend time in prison for fraud related to his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The FBI and Senate Ethics Committee investigated. McCain was given a mild rebuke for his involvement in the scandal. At the time of his death, McCain was\u00a0the only one of the five\u00a0still serving in the U.S. Senate. McCain is credited with being instrumental in helping to revive a diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam. He also praised former President Bill Clinton for restoring that tie in 1995. Vietnam war veteran and Sen. John McCain shakes hands with a Vietnamese man on the banks of Truc Bach lake, where former Navy pilot McCain was shot down in 1967 during the Vietnam War. (Reuters/Jason Reed) \u201cHuman rights progress in Vietnam should also be better served by restoring relations with that country,\u201d McCain said in a 1995 statement. \u201cThe Vietnamese have already developed complex relations with the rest of the free world. Instead of vainly trying to isolate Vietnam, the United States should test the proposition that greater exposure to Americans will render Vietnam more susceptible to the influence of our values.\u201d McCain sponsored the\u00a0Veterans Hospice Benefit Act\u00a0in 1991 that, in part, created a pilot program that provided hospice care for terminally ill veterans. McCain co-sponsored\u00a0the\u00a0Agent Orange Act\u00a0in 1991 \u2013 legislation that affirmed certain diseases suffered by veterans could be the result of harmful chemical exposure related to their service. That recognition would make those veterans eligible for specific benefits. Following McCain\u2019s brain cancer diagnosis,\u00a0there was speculation\u00a0his illness could be related to chemicals he came into contact with while in Vietnam. McCain\u00a0would serve as chairman\u00a0of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation from 1997 until 2001. He would also resume the role from 2003 to 2005. The committee handles issues such as: aviation, communications, transportation security, fisheries, disasters, space, tourism, consumer issues and product safety, among many other things. TIME magazine named McCain\u00a0one of the \u201c25 Most Influential People in America\u201d in 1997. In Nashua, N.H., McCain\u00a0officially announced\u00a0his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president on Sept. 27, 1999. John McCain announced his first candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in 1999. (Reuters/Jim Bourg) \u201cI don\u2019t begin this mission with any sense of entitlement. America doesn\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI am the son and grandson of Navy admirals, and I was born into America\u2019s service. It wasn\u2019t until I was deprived of her company that I fell in love with America, and it has been my honor to serve her and her great cause of freedom.\u201d \u201cIt is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me that I am a candidate for president of the United States,\u201d he said. McCain would eventually endorse eventual President George W. Bush, but the two didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on issues, according to\u00a0reports at the time. McCain would eventually endorse George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nominee. Bush would win the presidency. (Reuters/Scott Olson) Bush said McCain as his primary opponent made him \u201ca better candidate.\u201d Along with then-Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., McCain introduced the\u00a0Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\u00a0\u2013 or the McCain-Feingold Act. The legislation enacted regulations of political campaign financing, particularly with soft money contributions. Sen. John McCain, along with Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.; walk across the Supreme Court Plaza after attorneys made oral arguments during a special session of the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law. (Reuters/Stefan Zaklin) McCain served as the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee from 2005 to 2006. McCain was part of the so-called \u201cGang of 14\u201d \u2013 a group of senators who worked together to end a kerfuffle over judicial nominations. Aside from McCain, the group included: Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Lincoln Chaffee R-R.I.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Mike DeWine, R-Ohio; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Mary Landrieu, D-La.; Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.; Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; Ken Salazar, D-Colo.; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; and John Warner, R-Va. Only Graham and Collins remain in the Senate today. Along with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., McCain\u00a0pushed for immigration reform\u00a0that would include, among other things, a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. The bill also called for Mexico to crack down on its own border security and take steps to combat immigrant smugglers, the\u00a0Washington Times reported\u00a0then. Sen. John McCain smiles during a rally in support of the 'Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of 2005' in New York. (Reuters/Seth Wenig) In 2006, McCain and Kennedy signed onto\u00a0another immigration reform bill\u00a0that would make it out of the Senate. This bill, too, would call for a strengthening of the U.S. border with Mexico and provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants. After teasing his announcement on news programs, McCain\u00a0officially announced\u00a0\u2013 again from New Hampshire \u2013 that he was putting his hat in the ring for the presidency. John McCain announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination from New Hampshire. (Reuters/Brian Snyder) Surprising many,\u00a0McCain picked then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u00a0as his running mate. Seen as a surprise to many, John McCain selected then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his presidential running mate. (Reuters/Joshua Lott) \u201cShe\u2019s not from these parts, and she\u2019s not from Washington, but when you get to know her, you\u2019re going to be as impressed as I am,\u201d McCain said then. McCain lost the presidency to Barack Obama, a senator from Illinois. Joe Biden \u2013 who is a friend of McCain\u2019s \u2013 was Obama\u2019s running mate. Republican presidential nominee lost the election to Democrat Barack Obama. (Reuters/Jim Young) McCain was part of the bipartisan so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who came up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. Aside from McCain, the group included: Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Bob Menendez, D-N.J.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Their bill passed the Senate but would die in the House of Representatives. It would also become a point of contention for Republicans in the future. McCain traveled to Syria in 2013 to meet with rebels in the conflicted country \u2013 becoming the\u00a0highest ranking U.S. official to do so\u00a0at the time. McCain also traveled to Egypt in 2013 and said the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsi was a \u201ccoup.\u201d Along with longtime colleague and friend Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., McCain\u00a0pushed for the U.S.\u00a0to \u201csuspend assistance to Egypt\u201d after the military removed Morsi from office. McCain traveled to Ukraine in 2013 and\u00a0talked to anti-government protesters\u00a0who wanted the country's government to align more with Europe than Russia. Sen. John McCain waves to pro-European integration protesters during a mass rally in Kiev in 2013. (Reuters/Gleb Garanich) \"We are here to support your just cause, the sovereign right of Ukraine to determine its own destiny freely and independently. And the destiny you seek lies in Europe,\" McCain said during his address. McCain served as the chairman of the Senate\u2019s Armed Services Committee since 2015. At the time, the\u00a0New York Times described\u00a0the opportunity as McCain\u2019s \u201cdream job\u201d and the \u201cthe only job in Washington, other than being president, that he ever wanted.\u201d McCain\u00a0made a secret trip\u00a0to Syria in February 2017 to \u201cvisit U.S. forces deployed there and to discuss counter-ISIL campaign and ongoing operations,\u201d his spokesperson later said. McCain came back to the Senate following his brain cancer diagnosis to deliver crucial votes on Republicans\u2019 efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s health care law. Sen. John McCain departs after returning to the Senate to vote on health care legislation on Capitol Hill. (Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein) He first voted to move ahead the debate on the law and was warmly received by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. But when push came to shove,\u00a0McCain voted no\u00a0on the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. \u201cI believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried,\u201d McCain said at the time. \u201cNor could I support it without knowing how much it would cost, how it will affect insurance premiums and how many people would be helped or hurt by it.\u201d McCain received the annual Liberty Medal award in Philadelphia for his \u201clifetime of sacrifice and service.\u201d The award is \u201cgiven to men and women of courage and conviction who have strived to secure the blessings of liberty to people the world over,\u201d the Constitution Center said. Biden\u00a0presented the award\u00a0to McCain.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on why the press are accusing President Trump of 'fear' and 'falsehoods' when speaking about the Central American caravan. President Trump has declared war on the Central American caravan, and the media have declared war on the president for doing so. That sounds stark, but I can't reach any other conclusion. It's quite obvious that Trump has seized upon the roughly 7,000 Honduran migrants who are heading north through Mexico, and using them to rouse his base on the issue of illegal immigration. But press accounts have gone well beyond that in slamming Trump just two weeks before the election, setting up the kind of classic confrontation that has come to define his presidency. Here is The Washington Post's coverage of the issue, starting with the main news story: \"Trump and Republicans Settle on Fear \u2014 And Falsehoods \u2014 As a Midterm Strategy.\" And here's a Post analysis: \"Trump's Embrace of a Fraught Term \u2014 'Nationalist' \u2014 Could Cement a Dangerous Racial Divide.\" Another Post analysis: \"Trump is Even More Hyperbolic About Immigration Now Than in 2016.\" And here's the New York Times news story: \"Trump and GOP Candidates Escalate Race and Fear as Election Ploys.\" It's perfectly legitimate for the media to point out that the president has offered no proof for his claims that the caravan includes gang members and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" The Times story called that \"a dark and factually baseless warning,\" saying that \"the unsubstantiated charge marked an escalation of Mr. Trump's efforts to stoke fears about foreigners and crime.\" In a related vein, the Post jumped on Trump for calling himself a \"nationalist\" at a Texas rally, while saying that \"a globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly not caring about our country so much.\" The piece added: \"A racially overt version of it \u2014 white nationalism \u2014 has been publicly ascendant since Trump launched his 2016 campaign\u00a0by attacking undocumented Mexican immigrants as 'rapists' and 'criminals' and later proposed a Muslim immigration ban.\" CNN host Don Lemon went further, calling nationalist \"a favorite of the alt-right and is loaded with nativist and racial undertones. And globalist. Well, globalist has been used as a slur of sorts, sometimes even against those in the administration, often with anti-Semitic overtones.\" That\u2019s reading a lot into two words. Look, immigration is one of the hottest of hot-button issues. And Politico says the Democrats are \"spooked\" by the daily images of marching Honduran migrants as the president's rhetoric has boosted the caravan into a major story. Look at this Trump tweet: \"Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms!\" Except the GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. If the immigration laws are so pathetic, why haven't they changed them? But the broader point is this: the use of fear as a weapon comes from a very old political playbook. When Barack Obama or Bill Clinton and the Democrats were in charge, they would warn ominously that the Republicans want to take away your Medicare, slash your Social Security, shred the safety net, \"turn back the clock\" on civil rights or women's rights or gay rights. That, too, is the politics of fear. And while it was covered, it was rarely called out as fear-mongering because many journalists believed those push-granny-off-a-cliff charges were basically on target. Trump deserves great scrutiny over his use of the immigration issue, especially when he can't back up his claims. But he's hardly the first president to try to scare voters at election time.",

            "article_content": "\"President Trump might be able to tweet whatever comes to mind, but he can't grant himself new authority because he feels like it,\" San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in November, after the city filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president's executive order defunding sanctuary cities. (Associated Press) When California Gov. Jerry Brown decided to support President Trump\u2019s call to put National Guard troops along the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out drug smugglers, human traffickers and gangs, I nearly fell out of my chair. So let me get this straight \u2013 the Democratic governor wants to keep these people from entering the state, but if they do sneak in he won\u2019t support deporting them? The hypocrisy would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so frustrating. I tried to follow the logic, but then realized that when it comes to President Trump, California Democratic politicians have lost all ability to use logic or reason. After all, senseless outrage gets more \u201clikes\u201d than reasonable discourse. Let\u2019s face it, if President Trump found a cure for cancer, you can bet that some California Democratic politician would find a reason to denounce him for it. I suppose even Gov. Brown realized how out of touch it would look to oppose putting the National Guard along our southern border since about 99 percent of all illegal drugs come from Mexico, not to mention the deadly business of an open border that encourages human trafficking. Gov. Brown won\u2019t support a wall along our southern border, but he desperately wants to erect one between federal and local law enforcement partners. So last month the governor coordinated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to accept federal funding to deploy 400 members of the California National Guard to the California-Mexico border. In his communication with DHS, Brown clarified that the California Guard members would \u201csupport operations targeting transnational criminal gangs, human traffickers and illegal firearm and drug smugglers.\u201d The fact that he is acknowledging a problem at the border is a good first step. Unfortunately it\u2019s campaign season, and I fear this will be the last rational act by Democrats, at least until after the November elections. Democratic politicians in California have almost universally opted for the same political playbook that consists of doing and saying anything to oppose the policies coming out of the Trump administration. While that may be a time-honored political tradition, we should draw the line when their actions threaten the safety of Americans. The passage of the sanctuary state law that places restrictions on the communications between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies is incredibly dangerous. There are a host of reasons and real world examples where collaborative communication between federal and local law enforcement partners made the difference in protecting the public. California State Sheriffs Association President Bill Brown illustrated the concerns by highlighting the fact that the sanctuary state law contains \u201csignificant liabilities, which include restricting our communications with federal law enforcement about the release of wanted, undocumented criminals from our jails, including known gang members, repeat drunk drivers, persons who assault peace officers, serial thieves, animal abusers, and other serious offenders.\u201d Gov. Brown won\u2019t support a wall along our southern border, but he desperately wants to erect one between federal and local law enforcement partners. Thankfully Californians see past Brown\u2019s irresponsible attempts to thwart law and order. Cities across the state, including the cities of Corona and Lake Elsinore in the 42nd Congressional District that I represent in the U.S. House, have taken action to oppose the sanctuary state law. I applaud them for their courage and leadership. Now it\u2019s time for California Democrats to step up and stop playing politics with the safety of the public. They need to put the interests of Americans and legal residents ahead of criminal illegal immigrants. It\u2019s obvious to anyone paying attention that their efforts to protect criminal illegal immigrants are nothing but a desperate attempt to re-litigate the presidential election they lost.",

            "article_content": "Future of immigration agency up for debate. With controversies over the\u00a0separation of families\u00a0and zero-tolerance of immigration law violations at the border still in the headlines, immigration advocates and a few Democrats in Congress are calling for the dissolution of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Conservatives have countered that ICE employees are law enforcement officers who keep Americans safe. While most members of ICE are indeed hardworking federal employees who investigate and apprehend criminals, under the Trump administration the agency has altered its focus. As a result, ICE should be thoroughly reviewed, assessed, and potentially restructured \u2013 and its senior officials reassigned. There is a common misconception that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a longstanding American law enforcement institution. In reality, ICE was formed in 2003,\u00a0after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. It is part of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was a consolidation of many agencies, with a variety of duties. Simple border security is technically not ICE\u00b9s role. That responsibility falls under the umbrella of\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection, more commonly known as CBP or the Border Patrol. ICE investigates\u00a0everything from terror cells to child pornography, and has 20,000 employees stationed in 46 different countries. The positive side of having all of these concerns under one umbrella is that communication between different agencies and specialists is streamlined. However, the downside is that the overall mission can get muddled. Some ICE agents are concerned that the Trump administration\u00b9s focus on immigrant families \u2013 an increasing number of which have no ties to drug cartels, street gangs, or other international criminal organizations \u2013 is obfuscating the agency\u00b9s primary objectives. Some ICE\u00a0agents are concerned\u00a0that the Trump administration\u00b9s focus on immigrant families \u2013 an increasing number of which have no ties to drug cartels, street gangs, or other international criminal organizations that would fall under the purview of ICE \u2013 is obfuscating the agency\u00b9s primary objectives. ICE was born out of concern that organized criminal factions could infiltrate our country. Some ICE agents now want to be separated from the immigration detention and deportation proceedings, and want ICE to essentially be dissolved into two distinct agencies. The frustrations of these agents are being heard along with the cries of immigrant families. Rep. Jim McGovern,\u00a0D-Mass., has called for the abolition of ICE, saying that the Trump administration has moved the objectives further away from getting rid of criminals. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., has called out President Trump and his team for misuse of ICE and plans to introduce an ICE abolition bill. The bill already has the support of Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Rep. Mike Capuano, D-Mass. Democratic U.S. House candidate\u00a0Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0in New York City, who stunned the political world by defeating Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary for his seat last month,\u00a0 is campaigning by calling for an end to ICE. While the Obama administration received its share of criticisms from immigration advocates, by the end of the administration the vast majority of the people deported by ICE had a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges. The Trump administration views crossing the border without authorization as a crime in and of itself and thus, sees the undocumented immigrants as criminals. From the\u00a0October 2017 to December 2017, 65 percent of ICE arrests were for people accused or convicted of crimes other than simply crossing the border. That was down from 82 percent during the last three months of Obama\u00b9s presidency. Between January 2017 and September 2017,\u00a0ICE arrested 28,011 people whose only crime was crossing the border. The Obama administration spoke of\u00a0pathways to citizenship\u00a0but was stifled by a deadlocked Supreme Court. Obama officials said their desire was to rid our streets of undocumented people who commit serious crimes. The Trump\u00b9s administration\u2019s view is very distinct. While the president often invokes the name of the murderous street gang MS-13, his administration views all undocumented immigrants as in violation of the law and criminal, regardless of how they live their lives. Trump administration officials have become even\u00a0more aggressive\u00a0than the Obama administration, which\u00a0set records for deportations. President Trump also has the benefit of a Republican Congress and a Supreme Court majority, which could get even larger given the advanced ages of Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There is not one person on the progressive left who wants to weaken our national security. On the contrary, they want to refocus on it. While abolition of ICE has been the recent rallying cry for some, the better description of what\u2019s needed for ICE is restructuring. We want ICE or whatever comes after it to protect us from cyber criminals, human traffickers, gunrunners, and international drug cartels \u2013 not farm workers, day laborers, college students and children. President Trump\u2019s dehumanizing rhetoric of the U.S. being \u201cinfested\u201d\u00a0by undocumented immigrants has damaged public trust in ICE and has demoralized some of its agents. Now is as good a time as any to restructure and rebrand the agency.",

            "article_content": " Plato once said that \u201ccourage is knowing what not to fear.\u201d In announcing a crackdown Thursday on immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S., President Trump made it clear that he disagrees with Plato\u2019s definition. Since America\u2019s founding, our country has been strong enough, determined enough, and courageous enough to serve as a beacon of compassion and safety to immigrants from around the world. For generations, we have prided ourselves on being a nation of immigrants. But in his remarks Thursday to reporters at the White House, President Trump showed that he no longer thinks America is that nation. For my part, I think we Americans are an exceptional, brave and visionary people who seek to welcome \u2013 in the words of Emma Lazarus at the base of the Statue of Liberty \u2013 \u201cyour tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d To meet this vision, we need not only security but compassion, so that immigration to the United States is in the best interest of Americans and our families. This is not impossible. Unfortunately, the president is manufacturing a crisis at a time when he should be offering real solutions to improve our immigration system. As a result, a manageable situation is becoming tense. Most dramatically, President Trump has surprised military leaders at the Pentagon by announcing there could be up to \u201c15,000 military personnel\u201d sent to the border. Former military and national security officials have criticized the move. The head of the Border Patrol union has criticized\u00a0previous attempts to militarize the border as ineffective and impractical. And the Border Patrol itself has been\u00a0unable to justify\u00a0its own desire for more agents, which currently number about 20,000. Important to note: In fiscal year 2017, the number of apprehensions of migrants along America\u2019s Southwest border between ports of entry was the lowest since 1971 \u2013 almost 50 years ago. The most recent caravan of migrants from Central America \u2013 the one that seems to have the president so worried \u2013 set out from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, a city plagued by\u00a0extreme violence\u00a0and murder rates that are\u00a0among the highest\u00a0in the world. As of yet, there is no verifiable evidence that those making the journey are, by and large, anyone other than mothers, fathers, and children fleeing violence and extreme poverty. Mothers and fathers are doing anything they can to protect their children. That is what any mother or father would do. As a nation, we should respond to humanitarian crises in other countries with compassion and common sense. Threatening those fleeing poverty and violence with military action \u2013 as President Trump has done this week\u2013 is neither necessary nor practical. It is a myopic reaction to a complex issue. And sending the U.S. military to the border fails to address the root causes that lead migrants to flee their home countries in desperate circumstances. It will not stop families from trying to come to the U.S. to escape life-or-death situations. In addition, vague, campaign-season statements less than a week before midterm elections about changes to asylum procedures are as dangerous as they are potentially unconstitutional. Establishing \u201ctent cities\u201d to detain families, as President Trump called for Thursday, is both inhumane and exorbitantly expensive. The Department of Homeland Security reports that family incarceration costs up to 60 times more than alternative close surveillance. And alternatives such as ankle bracelets not only cost less, but are 95 percent effective when paired with case management in getting immigrants to return for court dates on their asylum requests. And sending the U.S. military to the border fails to address the root causes that lead migrants to flee their home countries in desperate circumstances. It will not stop families from trying to come to the U.S. to escape life-or-death situations. In addition, if we want to stop the illegal drug trade, we should invest resources in securing ports of entry, where the majority of drug smuggling takes place. According to Shannon K. O\u2019Neil of the Council on Foreign Relations, foreign aid to Northern Triangle countries in Central America goes to \u201chelicopters, intelligence-gathering equipment, police training, health care, youth programs, job training, small business support, and a host of other programs to strengthen security, rule of law, and economic growth.\u201d Take away that foreign aid now provided by the U.S. \u2013 as President Trump has threatened \u2013 and Northern Triangle countries become less safe, more unstable and much less likely to be able to retain their populations. That means that cutting our aid to Central American countries would have the exact opposite effect President Trump wants \u2013 it would increase the number of migrants. In the end, trapping people in terrible situations is not a sustainable policy solution. But there is a three-part short-term solution to deal with migrants from south of our border if the president wants it: First, devote resources to independent immigration judges who will consider claims for asylum fairly and accept or reject them quickly. Second, increase rather than decrease U.S. foreign aid to invest in the economic and social rebuilding of Central American countries. And third, establish in-region refugee processing centers so people are not forced to make the dangerous journey to apply for asylum. These are practical solutions that keep Americans safe and live up to our values. In the long run, it is past time for Republicans and Democrats in Congress and in the White House to come together and make compromises needed to enact comprehensive, practical and effective changes in our immigration laws. These changes are needed to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country today and to deal with future immigrants. Let\u2019s set aside the poorly developed policy approach that President Trump has unfortunately advanced. If this is all just a political strategy, the president is very likely creating a caravan of voters fleeing the GOP. The independent and moderate voters who are going to determine the outcome of the midterm elections Tuesday want practical, compassionate solutions that keep us safe and treat families compassionately. But every day, there is more and more evidence that troop deployments, separations of families and vitriolic words coming from the president are turning these voters away from the Republican Party. In this case, bad policy may very well lead to bad politics. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The sensible center doesn\u2019t need to be ignored. People fleeing violence and poverty don\u2019t need to be scapegoated. America is a courageous nation. As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told the American people in 1933 during a time a real crisis \u2013 the Great Depression \u2013 \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d We know that desperate mothers, fathers, and children fleeing violence are not to be feared.",

            "article_content": " Over the past few years, many Fox News Channel viewers have asked me why I don\u2019t leave the Democratic Party \u2013 a party that some see as synonymous with socialism, \u201cthe resistance\u201d and angry mobs. They say I\u2019m too rational, too civil and too commonsense to still be a Democrat. So let me take this opportunity to explain why I am a Democrat and why I am sticking with my party. To provide some context, I am a former Democratic Ohio state senator who represented the heart of the Rust Belt. I come from the real world, one marked by a lagging economy, opioid addiction, food insecurity and a growing aging population. My views are not informed by polls, political theory or articles trying to capture the essence of Middle America. Like many of you, I arrive at my views based on life experiences. I had to make difficult decisions as a state senator. I believe in collaboration, not obstruction, and worked with my Republican colleagues to craft laws in Ohio. While both the Democratic and Republican parties are undoubtedly going through an ideological realignment, I still believe that my values are more in line with the Democrats. And here\u2019s why: I am not a party hack, a political strategist or a journalist. I am a former public servant who still focuses more on issues than blind ideology. But in a nation where we have only two major political parties to choose from, one must pick a side, especially if running for elected office. To me, Democrats are not the vocal minority depicted in the news media, or even the national party leaders trying to find a way to engage the new, more progressive wing of the party. My home community had been reliably Democratic for generations until Donald Trump came along. His message of fair trade and plain talk resonated with my neighbors. They are not Deplorables, but rather frustrated Americans looking for a way to turn things around. While many Democrats in Ohio voted Republican in 2016, in my neck of the woods they still hold on to many of beliefs of what I would call the traditional Democratic Party. The first time I voted was in 1996 \u2013 the year Bill Clinton won re-election. When you think back to what the Democratic Party was 20-plus years ago, that is the party I relate to most. In the late 1990\u2019s Democrats and Republicans worked together to balance the federal budget and pass welfare reform. They took a commonsense approach to growth while still embracing core party principles of inclusiveness, diversity, equal rights and economic mobility. While both the Democratic and Republican parties are undoubtedly going through an ideological realignment, I still believe that my values are more in line with the Democrats. And here\u2019s why: First, I fundamentally believe that our government and the laws it makes should give rights to our citizens, not take them away. That is why I support same-sex marriage and protections for LGBT rights, for example. That is why I think states should make it easier, not harder, for residents to vote. Second, I feel strongly that government has no place is regulating complex moral personal decisions. That is why I am pro-choice. I also believe government should not overregulate personal consumption decisions of adults. If you are over 18 and want to smoke and eat transfats, you know the risks. Government should not force you to make decisions its sees as \u201cright.\u201d Third, I want to see a comprehensive, commonsense approach to immigration reform. I understand that undocumented individuals violated the law to be in the United States, but most are hardworking people trying to do right. Separating families is cruel. I feel Congress must find a bipartisan solution that allows undocumented individuals without a violent criminal record to pay a fine and back taxes and earn a path to citizenship. Fourth, I believe labor unions and the right to collectively bargain have created the American middle class, as well as strengthened wages and workplace safety. I also feel that unions can coexist with pro- growth regulatory and tax policy. That has been our experience in Ohio. Fifth, I believe our social safety net is fundamental to lifting people out of poverty and helping provide access to health care. I have spent my adult life fighting to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. We can preserve these programs in a fiscally responsible manner, just as we have done with Medicaid in Ohio. As a social worker, I have seen the value of both Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act. I don\u2019t think the ACA (ObamaCare) should be repealed, but rather reformed. And sixth, I value diversity and see it as a trait that strengthens our nation. Learning from other cultures and embracing differences is what makes America great. But to me it\u2019s more than just throwing around politically correct terms; it\u2019s about practicing what you preach. Listening to our neighbors, regardless of their ethnic background or political affiliation, enables us all to be better Americans by seeing new perspectives. The Democratic Party represented by the Washington elite may seem a world away from what I believe, but I feel I am part of my party\u2019s silent majority. We must come out of the shadows if we intend to keep our party alive and inclusive of America\u2019s Heartland. And we must demand a return to civility by both Democrats and Republicans alike.",

            "article_content": "Migrants in caravan from Central America tear down border gate in Guatemala, rush toward border bridge into Mexico; Griff Jenkins reports. The caravan of about 4,000 migrants from Central America seeking to enter Mexico and then the United States illegally is attempting to invade and attack the U.S. This assertion will almost certainly be denounced by the usual sources as being hateful or offensive, but it is long past time we stop letting the left prevent us from using words that clearly communicate reality. The fact is: Thousands of people have openly stated their intention to break American law and invade our country. Other people, some of them Americans, are funding this deliberate effort to invade America. If you think \u201cinvade\u201d is too strong a word, watch this video of the caravan tearing down fences separating Guatemala and Mexico while waving the Honduran flag (the country these people no doubt plan to claim asylum from). How is this not an invasion? We cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated by the heart-wrenching pictures and misleading words the left-wing media will doubtlessly manufacture if this caravan arrives at our border. We also must reclaim our narrative from those on the left. We cannot allow them to demonize us and distort what we stand for and what we are trying to do. Let me be clear about where I stand. I strongly favor legal immigration. I am happy that America remains the most welcoming country in the world for legal immigrants. According to Pew Research, in 2015 there were a little more than 30 million legal immigrants in the U.S. This is higher than the population of Texas \u2013 our second-most populous state. I think this is a great thing that makes America stronger. It is simply a lie to say I oppose immigration. Furthermore, I have worked very hard to get sound, responsible immigration reform for decades. In October 1986, when I served in the House, I voted for the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform Act, which granted amnesty to about 3 million people (originally estimated to be 300,000). I voted for the bill in return for two commitments: to control the border and to establish a guest worker program. Similarly, President Reagan wrote in his diary that he would reluctantly sign the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s high time we regained control of our borders and (Simpson\u2019s) bill will do this,\u201d the president wrote. If Democrats really wanted to control the border, how do we have an estimated 11 million-plus illegal immigrants currently in the United States \u2013 and a system that can be gamed so easily that people have continued to brazenly and openly break the law? The harsh lesson of 1986 was that liberals took the amnesty for 3 million illegal immigrants and then broke their word on controlling the border and creating an effective guest worker program. Finally, on a personal level, I spent much of my childhood living in foreign countries (my dad spent 27 years in the infantry, and I now live part-time in Rome, Italy). I outline my record to make clear that I don\u2019t fit any of the nasty stereotypes with which the left smears those who threaten them (see \u201cthe Kavanaugh effect\u201d). And neither do the vast majority of Americans who want a functional immigration system that reflects American values. The very idea that thousands of people believe (or are being told) they have a right to invade America and demand that we take care of them tells you how sick the system has become. The time to draw the line and fight for an honest immigration and border control policy is now. The caravan is the perfect symbol of the arrogance \u2013 the organized effort to destroy the rule of law \u2013 and the contempt for the American system that the left exhibits every day. We have been so conditioned by a half-century of political correctness doctrine (developed and sustained by the liberal news media, college professors, and left-wing politicians) that we have forgotten how to tell the truth about illegal immigration. The truth is: Illegal immigration has substantially increased the risk for Americans. MS-13, the vicious El Salvadoran gang, killed 17 people on Long Island in New York in a 17-month period in 2016. The gang has an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 members in the United States. Fentanyl and opioids also come across the uncontrolled southern border. Last year, more than 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses \u2013 more than the number of Americans killed during the eight years of the Vietnam War. There is a substantial safety impact of uncontrolled borders and the routine breaking of the law by illegal immigrants. If America is to survive, we must win some key arguments about facts and prove that much of what left-wing politicians say \u2013 and what the liberal news media report \u2013 is simply wrong. If America is to survive, we must heed George Orwell\u2019s warning in his great essay \u201cPolitics and the English Language\u201d that \u201cpolitical speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.\" Nothing could more accurately characterize the left\u2019s speech about political correctness and the unending effort of the left to shut down language that exposes the hypocrisy and falsehood of its members\u2019 positions \u2013 especially when it comes to their animus toward American sovereignty and defending the border. As I wrote in my New York Times best-seller \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback,\u201d the liberal media have actively participated in creating propaganda designed to manufacture sympathy for the lawbreakers and delegitimize those who would defend American sovereignty and the rule of law. When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says to Harvard Kennedy School students that Democrats are for controlling our borders, she is simply lying. When she goes on to say, \u201cwe do need to guard our borders, and we do need to have immigration reform,\u201d you have to wonder how stupid she thinks we are. There is no evidence of any Democrat-backed program that would be effective in controlling illegal immigration. The Democrats oppose the border wall in any form. They would hobble or abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Democrats favor so-called sanctuary cities and states in order to shield illegal immigrants from the legal immigration process. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has introduced an open borders bill, which every Democratic Senate incumbent has co-sponsored. The national vice chair of the Democratic Party campaigns in a T-shirt that says in Spanish \u201cI don\u2019t believe in borders.\u201d Democrats only ever favor complicated, impossible-to-implement legal systems, which create opportunities for people to enter and stay in America illegally. Not only do Democrats oppose controlling the border and stopping illegal immigration, they welcome illegal immigrants as an offset to legal American voters. Consider what Pelosi said in El Paso to immigration rights activists: \u201cWe believe that we will have leverage when we win in November. And why is that important? Because it gives leverage to every family\u201d who came to America illegally. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, is even clearer in her commitment to illegal immigrants. In a recent speech, she said the blue wave is comprised of \u201cthose who are documented and undocumented.\u201d There could not be a clearer indication of the Democrats\u2019 belief that illegal immigrants are an integral part of their coalition. The San Francisco Democrats have even adopted a new regulation to allow illegal immigrants to vote in city elections. The caravan invasion is a useful starting point to insist on an honest debate about our future as a country. Every Democrat should be forced to answer these six questions before the election: If Democrats really wanted to control the border, how do we have an estimated 11 million-plus illegal immigrants currently in the United States \u2013 and a system that can be gamed so easily that people have continued to brazenly and openly break the law? This caravan attack is the right place to draw the line and say \u201cno more.\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is right. Congress should come back and pass the laws that would enable Americans to re-establish the rule of law at the border and protect our country with dignity and authority. President Trump is right. Stop the caravan now. If you want to defend America, let your House member and senators know how you feel.",

            "article_content": "Growing caravan from Central America gets closer to U.S. despite warnings from President Trump; reaction and analysis from 'The Five.' Is America the greatest nation in human history? Or is it the worst? If you listen to progressives, it\u2019s impossible to tell. That\u2019s because on the one hand, those on the left say our country is at its darkest moment ever, about to collapse under the weight of bigotry and prejudice. But on the other hand, they\u2019re cheering the roughly 7,000 Central American migrants now making the trek through Mexico toward the U.S. border, assuring them that the American Dream awaits. This doesn\u2019t add up. Progressives are talking out of both sides of their mouths, showing that they\u2019re cynics as well as hypocrites. If they actually believed that America is as awful as they claim, they\u2019d be acting as if this were an irradiated wasteland, warning non-Americans to stay as far as away as possible. In truth, progressives are playing a twisted political game. The migrants are genuinely destitute and the victims of corrupt, socialist governments \u2013 and their lives are being risked to score partisan points. They\u2019re being turned into unwitting pawns. And the migrants are being pushed into a physical and philosophical assault on our country, dismantling our border and our fundamental sense of fairness \u2013 an idea that for the left was once more than a bumper sticker slogan. The migrant caravan won\u2019t end well for anyone. Of course, that\u2019s what progressives are betting on to make President Trump and the Republican Party look bad in the days before the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Progressives accuse conservatives of killing the American Dream. Yet they themselves are the culprits. Flooding America with unvetted individuals threatens the safety of our people, while a big influx of unskilled laborers punishes American workers. Progressives can\u2019t stop \u2013 or won\u2019t stop \u2013 complaining about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the \u201cassault on our democracy.\u201d That\u2019s ironic. I\u2019m pretty sure that openly backing thousands of people intending to violate our territorial sovereignty, in coordinated fashion no less, constitutes a blatant assault on our democracy. What\u2019s happening here is nothing more than the latest glaring example of the left\u2019s hypocrisy. Sovereignty is only something to be protected when it serves the interests of the left. Progressives, in their unguarded moment, are disclosing their animosity toward borders. While some on the left have remained fairly silent, many have passionately supported the caravan. What unites them all, however, is fear \u2013 fear that they will violate their sacred tenet: Thou shalt not insult a \u201chistorically-discriminated-against\u201d group. Failure to be fully and sufficiently \u201cwoke,\u201d they\u2019re well aware, is a cardinal sin on the left. This is a major reason America chose President Trump. Few people believe that thousands of people stampeding over each other and climbing fences should be allowed to enter a sovereign nation, let alone become citizens of that nation. While I don\u2019t doubt many of the migrants would benefit from living in America and contribute in certain ways, a nation can only be a nation if it takes care of its own people first. To be a responsible nation \u2013 and to be one capable of preserving itself \u2013 distinctions must be made between citizens and non-citizens. It\u2019s astonishing how far and how quickly the left has fallen. Not long ago, in the days of President John F. Kennedy, it was patriotic. It believed that America, despite its flaws, was exceptional and worth defending. Then the left plunged into relativism. Anti-Americanism became its core tenet. Progressives claim not only that there is no such thing as a \u201ccitizen,\u201d but that the very notion of one must be undermined. The caravan is their way of doing it right now. A defensible border is the bare minimum of what makes a country. If progressives are willing to sacrifice laws protecting our territorial integrity, what other laws would they be eager to give up? I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t tolerate trespassers in their own homes. The reason the progressives don\u2019t care is because they won\u2019t be impacted. They\u2019re sitting comfortably in their offices in Washington, San Francisco and New York City \u2013 preaching, posturing and pontificating. But if the land on the border were their own, or it were their jobs and physical safety on the line, they would act differently. You didn\u2019t see some 7,000 people in well-organized fashion march northward when President Obama was in office. There\u2019s a simple explanation why: America is now great again, jobs are back, and the economy is growing at rates not seen in decades, thanks to President Trump. The whole world got that memo \u2013 except those on the far left who continue to loathe not just our president but our country itself. Their cynically engineered caravan of migrants is designed to make a mockery of our laws and values. Whatever the virtue-signaling progressives may think, the truth is that having open borders open to criminals, terrorists and refugees tells the world we\u2019re anarchic. Open borders tell the world we don\u2019t care about those who have gone through the proper channels, patiently waiting their turn and working hard to earn a place in America. Progressives once championed a melting pot of different people with similar shared values. Now they\u2019re hoping for a meltdown.",

            "article_content": "All eyes are on the battleground state of Florida as Puerto Rican voters once displaced by Hurricane Maria have become a key voting bloc due a dramatic increase in voter registration ahead of Election Day. For years, political analysts have been predicting that Puerto Rican voters would swing elections in the Sunshine State \u2013 this year that could actually happen ORLANDO, Fla. \u2013 A little over a year after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, forcing tens of thousands to flee the island for the U.S. mainland, the refugees have emerged as a key voting bloc in one of the country\u2019s biggest battleground states. Like hundreds of thousands before them, many of the displaced Puerto Ricans moved to Florida, concentrating primarily in Central Florida and \u2013 through their sheer numbers \u2013 have quickly reshaped the state\u2019s political landscape. There were about 1.2 million Puerto Ricans in the Sunshine State before Maria hit, including more than 400,000 in Central Florida, and estimates of newcomers in the months following the storm range from 50,000 to 200,000. The governor\u2019s mansion, a Senate seat and at least four congressional seats are up for grabs in Florida and candidates have been working diligently to court Puerto Ricans, who as American citizens are eligible to vote. But unlike Cuban-Americans \u2013 who have historically tended to vote Republican \u2013 Puerto Ricans who are recent arrivals to the mainland are more independent, tending to vote for candidates based on issues, not political affiliation, experts say. Puerto Ricans who have lived on the mainland for longer are for the most part liberal and left-leaning. For years, political analysts have been predicting that Puerto Rican voters in Florida would swing elections \u2013 this year that could actually happen. \u201cTheir numbers have increased a lot since the last election two years ago, and the main statewide elections in Florida are considered to be really close,\u201d said Aubrey Jewett, a politics professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. \u201cSo a small change in the electorate could make the difference.\u201d Florida's \"I-4 corridor\" has become a common political reference as it represents a region in the Sunshine State with the largest number of undecided voters. According to a recent article in The Orlando Sentinel,\u00a0The Hispanic Federation has registered 19,000 new voters; Mi Familia Vota 27,000; and Unidos US 17,000. A projection in Central Florida\u2019s I-4 corridor alone reached 75,000 new Hispanic registered voters before the Oct. 9 registration deadline, and its estimated over 50 percent are Puerto Rican. During the past decade, Puerto Ricans have become Florida\u2019s fastest-growing Hispanic group, bringing the total number of Puerto Ricans on par with New York. The group now makes up a third of the state\u2019s Latino voters. \u201cThe candidate who can come across as compassionate and\u2026knowledgeable about Puerto Rican issues, but who is also just hitting\u2026education, healthcare and the economy\u2014that\u2019s what Puerto Ricans are looking for,\u201d Jewett said, explaining that the economy is a very important issue to the group because \u201cthey\u2019re economic refugees in a sense.\u201d But Marucci Guzman, executive director of Latino Leadership, a non-profit that helps Puerto Rican families that relocated from the island, says voters can tell the difference between genuine concern and a talent for acting. \u201cI think the Puerto Rican community is astute. They know the politicians that travel to the island for photo ops and\u2026the politicians that have gone to the island to help make a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThey feel like the candidates haven\u2019t done a good enough job of letting them know who they are\u2014that you might just take it for granted that you can put an ad in Spanish and that\u2019s enough outreach to the community.\u201d Hispanics make up a record 16.4 percent of the state's registered voters, an increase from 15.7 percent in 2016, a presidential election year, according to\u00a0a recent report by the Pew Research Center. In Florida, as of Aug. 31, 837,000 Hispanics were registered as Democrats, 527,000 as Republicans\u00a0and 775,000 with no party affiliation, according to Pew, and much of the growth in Hispanic voter registration has been in counties with the largest Puerto Rican populations.

(Fox News) But even those who register become intimidated when they have to cast a ballot \u2013 because they are not familiar enough with the U.S. mainland\u2019s political process and structure. On the island, Election Day is considered a holiday, there are three major political parties, and the political structure is vastly different. \u201cI plan to vote in these elections. The reason many Puerto Ricans fear voting is because\u2026we don't know the ideological differences between the parties\u2014Democratic or Republican. I would like to vote, but I don\u2019t know a lot about the different candidates that are currently running,\u201d said first-time voter Richard Feliciano, a Puerto Rican who fled the island after Maria. \u201cI think the language barrier will also certainly impact some voters\u2026it might be a bit intimidating to see this huge ballot [with numerous ballot measures]\u2026it\u2019s very long and confusing, even if you\u2019re a native English speaker,\u201d said Jewett. \u201cIt\u2019s not an insurmountable problem, but it\u2019s definitely a hurdle.\u201d Both candidates in the state\u2019s highly-competitive Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, have courted Puerto Rican voters since Hurricane Maria hit, investing heavily in outreach efforts, each visiting the island multiple times and pledging funding for recovery and resources to get families acclimated to their new communities in Florida. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello endorsed both Nelson and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race, while Scott picked up support from Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, the island\u2019s nonvoting congressional representative. \u201cI think the major parties realize the importance of the Hispanic vote and they\u2019re each working on it on both sides,\u201d said Cowles. But whether candidates\u2019 extra attention will pay off at the polls remains unclear. October 9 was the last day to register to vote in most of the state. Orange County\u2019s early voting runs from October 22 to November 4.",

            "article_content": "Campaigning for Andrew Gillum, Sen. Bill Nelson and the Florida Democratic ticket, former President Obama is heckled during campaign speech in Florida. Former President Barack Obama derided the deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d by the Trump administration, as Obama rallied for Florida Democrats and found himself repeatedly heckled by protesters on Friday afternoon. \u201cThey're telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away,\u201d Obama said of Republicans, referencing the caravan of an estimated 4,000 Central American migrants headed toward the United States. \u201cThey're even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border,\u201d Obama added. \u201cThe men and women of our military deserve better than that. So they're just constant fear mongering to distract from the record.\u201d Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphatically denied that the deployment is part of a political stunt ahead of next week's midterm elections. \"We don't do stunts in this department. Thank you,\" Mattis said. Obama\u2019s comments on the caravan came as he was heckled multiple times during a rally in Miami on Friday afternoon with Democrats ahead of next week\u2019s midterm elections. At one point, Obama addressed a protester and said, \u201cSir, don\u2019t curse in front of kids. Come on.\u201d Obama flew to Miami to campaign for incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. Later Friday, Obama is scheduled to travel to Atlanta to campaign for gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and other Democrats. \u201cThis is what I look forward to -- is having a few hecklers to get me back in the mood,\u201d Obama said after one heckling. \u201cI enjoy that. You always got to have a few in order to know that you're on the campaign trail.\u201d Interrupted again, Obama told a heckler to attend a Republican rally instead. \u201cHere's the deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you support the other candidates, then you should go support the other candidates. Don't be here. One of the things I never understood was why if you're supporting the other guy, you come to my rally. Go to their rally.\u201d The Fox News Senate and Gubernatorial Power Rankings lists both Florida races as \u201ctossup\u201d contests. In the Senate race, Nelson is being challenged by Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis is running against Gillum in the governor\u2019s race. In his remarks, Obama called Gillum \u201cone of the most inspiring, gifted candidates\u201d running this year. He took aim at Republicans, saying \u201cAmerica\u2019s at a crossroads.\u201d \u201cMaybe most of all, the character of our country is on the ballot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn the closing weeks of this election we have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful. It's designed to exploit our history of racial and ethnic and religious division that pits us against one another.\u201d Obama also took credit for the improving economy under President Trump. \u201cRight now, Republicans are all, look, the economy is so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do you think that started?\u201d Obama also referenced the Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, and the indictments of former Trump associates for an assortment of crimes. \u201cThey promised to take on corruption,\u201d Obama said. \u201cInstead, they have racked up enough indictments to field a football team. You know, I didn't have anybody in my administration get indicted.\u201d Obama\u2019s attempt to energize voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote came on a day of dueling rallies with President Trump. Trump is campaigning for Republicans Friday in West Virginia, before holding a rally in Indiana. Fox News\u2019 Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" October 23, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Let's bring in our panel a bit early tonight: Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at National Review; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics. OK, I want to take a look at some of these full screens here. The early voting totals, you heard from Mike, total number of ballots cast as of today, more than 7.5 million ballots. A lot more people are voting early. And this is the NBC data analytics that Mike referenced. These are states where the early voting base on affiliation, party affiliation, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indicate, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, and those are showing GOP turnout in a place like Tennessee, 63 to 30. Mo, when you look at that what do you see? MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: I see a close election coming our way. And I think there is a natural tightening of races that typically happens in the final weeks. I haven't looked at all those states in detail. Florida is a state I know a little bit about and have done some work in over the years. And if you look at where they are today, heading into today, compared to this point four years ago in the last midterm, the Republicans last time had about a nearly 9-point advantage in the early vote coming into today. Right now they have nearly a 4-point advantage coming in today. So that shows that Democrats are narrowing the early vote gap in a major state like Florida which there is a lot of seats at play. And most people protect the Democrats will take the lead in the early vote after today's votes are counted. But let's make no mistake. Anyone on the Democratic side that thinks there's going to be a blue tsunami needs to check their expectations. I think Democrats are still poised to take back the House but by a narrow, narrow majority. It's going to be more like a mini-wave. BAIER: Mollie? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: I don't read too much into early voting. I remember in 2016 we were told that Hillary had a lock on Florida based on early voting numbers, and she ended up not taking Florida. So it is interesting that a lot of people are voting early, but I don't know how much we can take from it. But there is no question that the narrative has changed from there is going to be a takeover of the Senate and the House. Right now Democrats are on track to lose seats in the Senate. And the House, which was always assumed to be going to the Democrats, the average predicted number of seats that they will take is 25. Democrats need 23 to have a majority in the House. Well, 25 is a pretty narrow. That's just average. It doesn't take much for them to go either way in that direction. So anyone who says that it definitely is going to be a Democratic takeover of the House, I think they're making the same mistake they made in 2016. BAIER: The other thing that's amazing is the amount of spending on this midterm. If look at the stats here back to 1998, $1.6 billion. Now it is up to $3.7 billion, and we have 14 days from today, already spent on these midterms. That's astonishing. JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Yes, it just shows you the intensity. And one of my bugaboos is people who think that low voter turnout is a sign of democratic, societal decay or whatever, and poor civic virtue. Most people going to the polls are going to the polls because they are angry, one way or the other. It doesn't seem to be that high voter turnout is a sign that everyone is feeling the other party or politics or whatever. I think that what I see from a lot of that data is that it is clear, particularly in those swingy states, that Trump is an unalloyed benefit for Republican Senate candidates because it brings out to rural voters, people not in these contestable Congressional districts in ways that has put them over the top. Plus, the backlash of the Kavanaugh thing. What is interesting to me about the House races, and I still think the Democrats are going to take back the House but probably narrowly. They only need to win one out of the three of the competitive prices. But what's interesting is that in the competitive races, the generic ballot has basically evened out. The Democratic advantage in the generic ballot takes into account all of these intensely blue parts of the country where it doesn't matter whether they have a huge advantage or not. And the actual races where it is close, it is much more of a race. And I still think you'd have to bet, just not maybe bet a lot that the Democrats do it, but it's going to be close. BAIER: And a lot of these polls and the ones tracking some 75 races in the House that really are on the edge say it is tight on some of those swing states. Let's take a listen to the president on the issue of this caravan today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We cannot allow our country to be violated like this. I have very good information. I spoke with border patrol this morning, and I spoke to them last evening, and I spoke to them the day before. I speak to them all the time. And they say, and you know this as well as anybody, over the course of the year, over the course of a number of years, they have intercepted many people from the Middle East. There's no proof of anything. There's not proof of anything, but there could very well be. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Talking about the Middle Easterners being a part of that caravan. The vice president said he talked to the president of Honduras and said the caravan was organized by leftist organizations, financed by Venezuela. That's Vice President Pence in the Oval Office. Clearly the administration sees political gain in talking about this. ELLEITHEE: I think where it could help him the most and help Republicans the most are in the Senate seats that are at play where turning out the Republican base in rural areas can help in a statewide election. In a lot of the suburban districts where the most competitive House races are, I'm not sure that is going to work. BAIER: I don't see a lot of Democrats piping up on the other side, saying humanitarian issues. There's not a lot of speaking out about this caravan issue from the left, is there? ELLEITHEE: I think what you are doing is you're hearing a lot of Democrats point to the fact that this is a failure in the broader immigration discussion, right, that these are people who are leaving for humanitarian reasons and we're not doing anything at the source. But I also think what you are seeing is a lot of Democrats pointing out the fact that this president is just not being honest with some of this stuff. He's just not being honest when he's talking about Middle Easterners sneaking into the middle of this caravan, and point that out. And that's important because in a lot of the suburban House districts, where people have always been a little bit anxious about the president's personality, about his persona, this adds to their anxiety. This adds to their frustration as much as it helps him with his base, which had been a little bit depressed up until the past couple of weeks. And so in these statewide races, states like Tennessee, states like Missouri, states like North Dakota, I think could be helpful to him there. HEMINGWAY: I think there is a lot of room for disagreement on the immigration debate. And you have people who cover the spectrum there. But the idea that there aren't national security concerns with immigration policy or economic concerns with immigration policy, I think that is actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on. And when they see something like this, and I can't imagine a better visual for Donald Trump's argument that we need to have secure borders and orderly immigration policies and understanding of national sovereignty that does not allow just literally the flooding of people over the borders. BAIER: The thing that takes some explaining is our law about Central American migrants is different than if somebody from Mexico. We have to go through a process, and a lot of them, 90 percent plus, end up staying here. So it is a different thing when talking about Central Americans. I want to play one a soundbite very quickly, Jonah, and that is how powerful this issue is for Australia. In 2001, John Howard was running for prime minister. They had boats coming from Indonesia. He turned them around. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HOWARD, AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER: It is also about having an uncompromising view about the fundamental right of this country to protect its borders. It's about this nation saying to the world, we are generous, openhearted people, taking more refugees on a per capita basis than any nation except Canada. We have a proud record of welcoming people from 140 different nations. But we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: He ended up turning that election around and winning based on that issue alone. GOLDBERG: One of the things I am fascinated by is, and I wrote about this a lot in my book, the industrial advanced nations out there, the one that does not have a big populism issue roiling its politics -- Japan, because they have very limited immigration. It's hurting their economy, and it has all sorts of arguments about it on both sides. But the political science is fairly settled. It is not necessarily all about bigotry. But when you have large waves of immigrants coming in and there is a perceived sense of lawlessness or the culture being moved in a direction that people don't like, it roils politics in ways that few other issues do. Brexit, if you look at the polling data closely, it was very much about issues of immigration and the sense of the English culture was being lost. And Donald Trump plays into that. That this caravan thing is like manna from heaven for Donald Trump in at least for the Senate races. He says, the Democrats must be paying for it. The RNC should be paying for it, it is so good for Donald Trump and for the Republican argument. BAIER: We will see how it goes 14 days from now.

            "article_content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a cut in the annual refugee cap on Monday. (AP) The Trump administration announced Monday it will cut the maximum number of refugees allowed into the country next year to 30,000, citing national security concerns and the need to restore integrity to the system. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the administration is lowering the refugee cap from 45,000 in fiscal 2018 to 30,000 in fiscal 2019. It will be the lowest ceiling since the refugee program began in 1980. Former President Barack Obama raised the ceiling to 110,000 in 2017, and the U.S. allowed in almost 85,000 refugees in 2016 -- the last full year of the Obama administration. But the Trump administration has taken a much tougher line on immigration and refugee entry, focusing on the need to fully vet those coming into the U.S. Pompeo said even with the cut, the U.S. will continue to be the most generous nation in the world when it comes to immigration, and stressed the number should be seen in the broader context of other humanitarian programs. \u201cSome will characterize the refugee ceiling as the sole barometer of America\u2019s commitment to vulnerable people around the world,\u201d he said in remarks at the State Department. \u201cThis would be wrong.\u201d Pompeo said there was evidence that the previous vetting system was \u201cdefective\u201d and at least one Islamic State (ISIS) member was allowed to get in to the country, as well as others with criminal backgrounds. He also said a lower cap reflects the enormous backlog of outstanding cases -- consisting of 800,000 individuals in pending cases -- that needs to be dealt with. \u201cIn consideration of both U.S. national security interest and the urgent need to restore integrity to our overwhelmed asylum system, the United States will focus on addressing the humanitarian protection cases of those already in the country,\u201d he said. The move represents the latest step toward an oft-stated goal by the Trump administration to secure America\u2019s borders and strictly control who enters the country. While 30,000 is the maximum number the U.S. will admit in fiscal 2019, the actual number could be far less. So far this year, the U.S. has only admitted 20,918 refugees. The administration secured a win for its refugee and immigration policy this summer when Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Venezuela was upheld by the Supreme Court. In his remarks Monday, Pompeo said the U.S. is working to assist refugees as close to their home countries as possible, and prioritizing methods that allow refugees to return home when conditions allow. \"We can house, feed, and provide medical care for hundreds of thousands more refugees closer to their homes and do so more rapidly than we could possibly do here in the United States,\" he said. \"The ultimate goal is the best possible care and safety of these people in need, and our approach is designed to achieve this noble objective.\" Fox News' Rich Edson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump addresses release of House Intelligence Committee Russia Report. The team of opposition researchers behind the infamous anti-Trump dossier embraced by the FBI were paid big bucks to continue trying to dig up dirt on Russian meddling in American politics \u2013 even after the 2016 presidential election. That revelation, buried inside a 243-page report released by House Intelligence Committee Republicans last week, has sparked new speculation about the identities of the secretive donors who were funding the post-election project. According to the House Intelligence Committee report, Daniel J. Jones \u2013 the president of the Penn Quarter Group and a former staffer for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2013 \u201csecured the services\u201d of dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele \u201cto continue exposing Russian interference\u201d after the election. It also hired an associate of Steele\u2019s and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. That report doesn\u2019t list the donors. But Jones told the FBI that the Penn Quarter Group was being funded by seven to 10 wealthy donors, primarily in New York and California, who provided approximately $50 million to the firm, it said. Fusion and Steele originally teamed up during the 2016 campaign to compile a dossier of salacious and unverified allegations about Trump's connections to Russia, paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie. The dossier allegedly was used by the DOJ and FBI to obtain surveillance warrants to spy on a member of the Trump team. The post-election work presumably would have continued to look at any Trump team connections \u2013 with an eye toward publicizing their findings. The report said Jones told the FBI he planned to share any information he learned after the election with policymakers on Capitol Hill, the press and the FBI. He told the FBI his group was \u201cexposing foreign influence in Western elections.\u201d Trump has maintained there was no collusion with Russia during the 2016 campaign, and tweeted again on Tuesday morning that the ongoing special counsel probe is a \u201cWitch Hunt.\u201d Jones did not return a request for comment from Fox News sent to an address listed on the Penn Quarter Group\u2019s website. The Federalist first reported Jones\u2019 connection to Steele in February \u2013 ties that were confirmed in the House report. The Intelligence Committee report released last week redacts the full name of Jones in a footnote. But the report links to Jones\u2019 LinkedIn and firm online biographies, making clear he is the individual in question. Jones, who once worked for the FBI, also worked under Feinstein on the Senate Intelligence Committee. A Feinstein spokesman did not return a request for comment. Feinstein has played a significant role in the saga over Steele\u2019s dossier. In January, Feinstein made news when she released a transcript of the committee\u2019s interview with Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson. In that interview, an attorney for Fusion GPS claimed \u201csomebody's already been killed\u201d as a result of the publication of the anti-Trump dossier. \u201cHe wants to be very careful to protect his sources,\u201d attorney Josh Levy said during the Aug. 22 Senate Judiciary Committee interview of his client. \u201cSomebody's already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier and no harm should come to anybody related to this honest work.\u201d The release itself provoked controversy, with an aide to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, calling it \u201cconfounding\u201d for Feinstein to drop the transcript in the \u201cmiddle of an ongoing investigation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "While delivering the 2018 commencement address at Yale, Hillary Clinton holds up a Russian hat for the crowd. Early in her address to graduating Yale students at Sunday's Class Day, Hillary Clinton reached behind the lectern, pulled out a traditional Russian ushanka hat, and held it aloft. \"I mean, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\" she said as the audience laughed and applauded. The Russian hat gag, a nod to the student tradition of wearing extravagant headgear during Class Day, set the tone for a wide-ranging speech in which Clinton alternately cracked jokes about her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and warned Yale's Class of 2018 that \"we are living through a full-fledged crisis in our democracy.\" \"There are certain things that are so essential they should transcend politics,\" said Clinton, who never mentioned Trump by name during her address. \"Waging a war on the rule of law and a free press, de-legitimizing elections, perpetrating shameless corruption, and rejecting the idea that our leaders should be public servants undermines our national unity.\" HILLARY CLINTON TO GET HARVARD MEDAL FOR 'TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY' Clinton admitted that she still thinks about her defeat by Trump: \"No, I'm not over it. I still think about the 2016 election. I still regret the mistakes I made. I still think, though, that understanding what happened in such a weird and wild election in American history will help us defend our democracy in the future.\" \"Today, as a person, I'm OK,\" Clinton added. \"But as an American, I\u2019m concerned.\" Urged unity in the face of heightened partisanship. The former first lady, secretary of state, New York senator and 2016 Democratic nominee for president also threw in a call for \"common-sense gun safety legislation as soon as we can get it\" during a brief discussion of Friday's mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas. \"You don\u2019t need to experience gun violence to know that when a teenager in Texas who just survived a mass shooting says she\u2019s not surprised at what happened at her school because, and I quote, \u2018I\u2019ve always felt like eventually it was going to happen here too,\u2019 we are failing our children,\" she said. \"So, enough is enough.\" Clinton, who graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, cracked some jokes as well. She told students that she was thrilled for all of them, \"even the three of you who live in Michigan and didn\u2019t request your absentee ballots in time.\" She also joked about her audition to join Yale's famous Whiffenpoofs singing club, saying she had buried the tape \"so deep that not even Wikileaks will be able to find it.\" Democratic presidential nominee says declaring herself a capitalist during 2016 primaries 'probably' hurt her with voters; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' She continued, \"If you thought my emails were scandalous, you should hear my singing voice.\" Class Day is celebrated at Yale on Sunday the day before degrees are handed out. It includes the awarding of academic, artistic, and athletic prizes and the major address of commencement weekend. It also includes such traditions as the planting of the class ivy, awarding top academic and athletic prizes to students, and the singing of Yale's \"Bright College Years\" while waving a white handkerchief.

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen says there is intelligence the caravans include a limited number of individuals from outside the region and warned that the most vulnerable are pushed ahead to frustrate the military. Catherine Herridge has the exclusive interview for 'Special Report.' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News there is intelligence indicating the caravan of migrants making their way through Mexico includes a limited number of people from outside the region, including the Middle East. \"We absolutely see people from the Middle East, from southeast Asia, from other parts of the world -- not just from Central America,\" Nielsen said in a wide-ranging interview. The caravan started in Honduras last month. This week, hundreds of migrants have begun arriving in Mexico City, seven hundred miles from the U.S. border. President Trump, who has vowed to stop the caravan from entering the United States, tweeted last month that \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners\u201d are among the migrants. Democrats, as well as some Republicans, have accused the Trump administration of fear mongering. \"Now, in 2018, they\u2019re telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away,\u201d former President Barack Obama said at a campaign rally on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border. And our men and women deserve better than that.\" Speaking of the non-Central American migrants, Nielsen told Fox News, \"we don't always know exactly who they are.\" \"What I can tell you is we stopped 3,000 people last year at the southwest border who had patterns of travel similar to a terrorist,\" Nielsen said. \"We call them special interest aliens.\" The issue of special interest aliens, or SIAs, came to a head under the last administration. In June 2016, then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson convened a multi-DHS component task force called the \"SIA Joint Action Group\" with the primary task of developing a plan to \"counter threats posed by the smuggling of SIAs.\"\u00a0There is not a great deal of publicly available information, but the SIA designation is said to cover a collection of 35 countries where known terrorist groups operate. Meanwhile, Nielsen said the Department of Homeland Security is seeing real concern among the nations directly affected by the caravans. \"We are hearing from our partners in the region -- in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, in Mexico -- that they have some concern with respect to the timing and the particular organization of these caravans,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're not organic if you will. They're definitely organized or financed.\" NIELSEN: MIDTERMS WILL BE \u2018MOST SECURE ELECTION IN THE MODERN ERA' Nielsen said DHS \u201cvery seriously\u201d is attempting to determine the origins of these caravans. \u201cMass migrations aren't good for anybody and not safe for the migrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey unfortunately allow criminal elements to prey on vulnerable populations...those who might otherwise have a legitimate claim.\" Nielsen also echoed warnings from Guatemala\u2019s intelligence chief that the most vulnerable are pushed ahead in an apparent effort to frustrate border police and the military. \"They don't want to get into a confrontation with a child, more women and so they're almost being used as barriers at the front of some of these caravans, but what I will say is the other caravans coming up are mostly single males,\" she said. Latin America specialist Joseph Humire, who was on the ground with Guatemalan intelligence 10 days ago, said some caravans operate in a military fashion. \"What I saw was a high level of logistical organization,\" said Humire, the executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society. Based on his work, Humire said the caravans he documented are not using routes associated with drug smuggling or human trafficking. They are taking longer routes with more infrastructure to reach their destinations, he said. Migrants congregating in El Salvador on Oct. 27. (Courtesy of the Center for a Secure Free Society) \"What I learned from Central American intelligence is that there were at least 132 individuals that came from other parts of the world not from Latin America,\" Humire said.\u00a0In a follow-up phone call Monday, Humire said\u00a0the number of non-Central American migrants may be as high as 232 in Guatamala alone, based on new information he received from that country's intelligence service. OBAMA REACTS TO\u00a0CONTROVERSIES OVER MIGRANT CARAVAN Referring to an incident earlier this year, Humire said sometimes individuals lie about their identities and try to deceive immigration authorities.\u00a0However, officials are able to discover fraudulent claims through biometrics and the help of partner intelligence services who have access to databases. \"We have seen individuals they have lied about their identities and tried to deceive immigration authorities saying they are from Pakistan and turned out to be from [the Palestinian territories] or saying they're from Bangladesh and turned out to be from Syria,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "A breakaway group of migrants from the migrant caravan bound for the U.S. has reportedly reached the border with Mexico, just hours after President Trump threatened to use the U.S. military to secure the border if the migrants aren't stopped; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" October 18, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kennedy, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A breakaway group of migrants from the caravan moving through Guatemala has reportedly reached the border with Mexico. This comes just hours after President Trump threatened to send in the military to secure the border if the migrants aren't stopped. The president blaming Democrats for the new crisis on Twitter, claiming their support of weak immigration laws is making the situation worse. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is putting her foot down saying her party isn't planning on working with President Trump. Oh, she says, I'm sorry, I don't see any of us voting for wall funding. We have a responsibility to secure our borders. There are ways to do that that consistent with civilization, humanitarianism, and who we are as a nation. We have to remove all doubt about that. And with only 19 days to go until the midterms, a new Fox News polls shows what's extremely important to voters, 46 percent say is immigration. I just want to show this other poll, the Fox News poll with vote preference among those saying that border security is extremely important, the Republican candidate at 58 percent, the Democratic candidates at 35 percent, and with this new caravan, Jesse, moving its way north 19 days before the election, not good timing for Democrats. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: No. I mean, it really -- visually it has a big impact on voters when they see this. It's not a theoretical problem. \u00a0And it's just not this one caravan we're talking about. I mean, in terms of size, caravans like this are coming across the border all day, every day, and there's really not a lot we can do about it because a lot of these loopholes are baked into our immigration and asylum system. I mean, it's used to be adult male Mexicans crossing the border, and now it's mostly families and teenagers from Guatemala and from Honduras, and we can't turn them back. PERINO: The Mexicans you could. WATTERS: The Mexicans you could. But you have to bring in and take, when you apprehend them, into the rest of the country. And they're all claiming credible fear. Now, credible fear, that excuse, has spiked over the last couple of years. Yet, when they use it, the economy in Honduras is going up, yet crime in Honduras is going down. So, it makes me believe that these people are being coached. And you're hearing things like NGO's sending activists and lawyers down to Central American countries and they're helping them with the caravan. They're coaching them on what to say when they get to the border. And it's interesting, where do they get the cameras from? You know, we're hearing a lot of these NGO's are bringing these camera crews in, then all of a sudden the people get off the van, they walk when the camera crews come out. The camera crews stop recording, then they hopped back in the van. Then once they get to Mexico, they pay the drug cartels and the smugglers $5,000 per family unit to get them across. The drug cartels are the only ones making any money in this process. The drug cartels and the open border Democrats, they are on the same side. These drug cartels have made $2.5 billion in smuggling alone per year. That's on top of the drug profits, and that's a lot of money. So we have to change the immigration laws so that you treat people that cross the border, if you're from Central America, the same way you do is if you're from Canada and Mexico. PERINO: And, Kennedy, the other thing is in these caravans, what -- the Department of Homeland Security is reporting that the number of sexual assault happening along this route, and not just -- in the caravan, as Jesse was saying about 1600 migrants try to cross the border a day, they're finding repeated incidents of sexual assault for children even. I mean, this is happening across the board. KENNEDY, GUEST CO-HOST: Yeah. That's horrible. I mean, we saw some of that, unfortunately, in the shelters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. And it is, you know, an unfortunate aspect of human nature. \u00a0And, you know, we have to find a way to let really good people into the country, and keep really bad people like that out of the country. The government hasn't sufficiently done that. And I think part of this rest on congress because we've got a very confusing immigration system. And Democrats and Republicans, I'm convinced this is the one issue where they will never work together. But it's interesting because they have a president who actually -- even though he's a hard-liner rhetorically on immigration, I think there's a lot that he would give to Democrats in order to come up with a compromise. And I don't think you would see that with the Obama administration and Republicans in the same way, or with past Republicans administrations. So they need to fix that. And if you think about the kind of people you want to have in this country, you want people who are hardworking, people who are ethical, people who look out for their families and their communities, and people who are very physically strong. \u00a0So I think we need to set up an American ninja warrior obstacle course at the border, and whoever can make it -- they can't fake it, they get through. PERINO: The other thing is. (CROSSTALK) PERINO: The United States is, Juan, trying to help those countries with aid, also helping their criminal justice system. Crime, actually, is going down in Honduras and Guatemala, and yet the caravans still come. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I think its economic problems that lead families to decide that their best prospect is to come toward the United States. As we know, their economies have been suffering, so I think that's the principle reason. But I'm interested in this as a political ploy by Republicans because clearly immigration is not a big issue in this campaign. According to the polls it was like 7 percent of people say it's a big issue. The number one issue is health care. And, you know. KENNEDY: But according to the poll that Dana just show it was number 4 on the list. WILLIAMS: No, that's among extreme people who are extremely. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: OK. OK. So it's not -- the big issue is health care, and then you start looking and -- you know, the secondary issue is raining in President Trump, and the third one is people who want Democrats to control the House of Representatives. Those are the big issues. PERINO: But what about this issue in particular, though? Because we have time to talk about those other issues today, but what about, you know, Nancy Pelosi saying that they won't work with President Trump. To me, it's not a right-left issue. WILLIAMS: I agree with you. PERINO: The fact that you have a humanitarian crisis with children being sent to the hospital as they have to stop at these weigh stations. They're dehydrated. Some have been victims of sexual assault. If they get here -- it's not true? WILLIAMS: I said it's not good. PERINO: Oh, it's not good. So why would Nancy Pelosi already be signaling that they won't. WILLIAMS: No, no, she's talking. KENNEDY: Juan, I need to push back on you a little bit on something. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: Let me respond to Dana. KENNEDY: No, no. But this is an important correction because it wasn't extreme voters. It was actually a poll of likely voters. WILLIAMS: No, no, people who are extremely concern. PERINO: It is vote preference among those who say that border security is the most important. (INAUDIBLE) WILLIAMS: OK. So I think you have to understand is -- Nancy Pelosi is talking about the wall, Dana. And about the president's persistence -- I think yesterday, remember, we quoted her as saying it was a manhood issue for him. It's a political issue. He sees it as a promise he made to his base that he wants to deliver for his base. But if you go back in time, remember going back to President Bush, going back President Obama, you have Republicans and Democrats working on the immigration issue, working on border security, but Trump has made it all about the wall, and what Nancy Pelosi is saying, hey, this is not about the wall. It's not a good expense of money or time, and certainly not to be mean to people. PERINO: Let's get Greg in here because one of the things Nancy Pelosi says, and you hear this from Democrats a lot, is this is not who we are as a nation. GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yeah. It's a cop-out. It's actually disgusting. What happened to the Democratic Party, as Juan said, Bill Clinton, President Obama, understood that border security helps to find a country and -- like it or not, the wall is actually part of border security. How could it not be? We have fences. We have a president that's interested in putting up a wall. Again, like I've said before, if you're on safari and you're being chased by a rhino, you hop into the first truck you see. You don't wait for the fourth truck. So there's a huge dishonesty going on with the media here where they willfully ignore the land between Honduras and Guatemala and the United States. Imagine how many lives will be saved and how many rapes would be prevented if they actually -- were able to stop. Once they leave their country and lay claim to some land there rather than having to risk their lives making it to our border. That is a huge hypocrisy that somehow we're encouraging people to make this terrible, terrible journey for some kind of political optics. And I hate using the word optics. Lastly, to your point, you know, where is the Me Too movement? Like, where -- you are putting women in danger for this issue. This issue. Where are you? How can you allow this to happen? That's actually pretty disgusting. KENNEDY: Well, I think -- you really make a good point about Mexico. GUTFELD: Yeah. KENNEDY: And that's one of the things -- if you take some of the hyperbole and rhetoric out of it and you look at what the president is saying, he's appealing to Mexico, you know, aside from threatening to shut down the southern border. But they do have some responsibility here, and they do open up both borders in order to send people further north. So it is a humanitarian issue. And Mexico is a humanitarian country with people who care very much about their friends and neighbors to the north and south, then why don't they have better systems in place to absorb some of the refugees. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: The other lie is that economic problems make your life -- put your life in threat. It's like no. It's like -- stay in the country and deal with these economic problems. WILLIAMS: You know what? We have a history in America, people from Cuba getting on the high seas. GUTFELD: Oh, yeah. WILLIAMS: . risking their lives. We have people. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Wherever there's leftism, that's where people are in danger. WILLIAMS: Well, all I'm saying is there's a history of people putting themselves at great risk in order to reach our shores because they believe in America. They like the financial opportunity. GUTFELD: There's something between here and there. WILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying. GUTFELD: Mexico. WILLIAMS: . it's not -- believe me, we have a better, stronger economy than Mexico. GUTFELD: Oh, you now have a menu of options you can choose. WILLIAMS: No, I'm telling you that's what families are focused on -- I think they're really focused on their children, Greg. They want to create the greatest opportunity. PERINO: I want to go back to something Jesse said just for the last word and that is that the drug cartel -- apparently, there's not a single person that has come across the border that hasn't had to pay some sort of money as a family or as an individual to the drug cartels. And perhaps there's something there that you could find a bipartisan agreement on. Figure out a way to target those drug cartels, those leaders, and their finances, and shut them down. WATTERS: I mean, they're making fistfuls of cash every day from these smuggling operations on top of the profits they're making from heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. And the Democrats have to understand the position they're in by having open borders policies only empowers the drug cartels. \u00a0It empowers no one else, only the drug cartels. And I'm happy that Juan would admit that the Trump economy is so strong, people are risking their lives to come to America to get a piece of the pie. WILLIAMS: I said the American economy. WATTERS: Oh, OK. All right. All right. WILLIAMS: And by the way, I don't understand what you just said. You know, I don't get it. You know, you act as if there's nothing here that would attract people. WATTERS: I think a wall would prevent the drug cartels from profiting. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: . from smuggling. PERINO: OK, we've got to run because we lots of other stuff to talk about. \u00a0President Trump commenting on what he things happened to the Washington Post columnist and what his critics are saying next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It certainly looks that way to me. It's very sad. Certainly looks that way. UNINDENTIFIED REPORTER: Mr. President, what are you considering for possible consequences for Saudi based on those. TRUMP: Well, it will have to be very severe. I mean, it's bad, bad stuff. \u00a0But we'll see what happens, OK.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I'm very worried that the president seems to have a love affair with autocrats.

But now in that last bite that we just saw, it sounds like he's saying something is going on and the journalist is definitely dead. WATTERS: Yeah, I think the journalist is definitely dead. And it looks like this was a barbaric act. I mean, they used a bowing saw and acid to dissolve the guy, so they have to pay a price. With that said, though, I mean, we do business with a lot of unsavory characters around the world. \u00a0It's best when they're not throwing it in our face and remind the whole world of that. But at the same time, I wouldn't be canceling the arms deal and I don't think we destroy an alliance over that. We'll come up with some sort of sanctions or repercussions in order for them to understand this is not allowed in a civilized society. But as a news story, this is not having any impact on voters. People really don't understand the story or care about it that much. And the Democrats and the media are complete hypocrites, trying to score points off this. If this guy wasn't a journalist that had been killed, I don't even think the media would be covering this story. I remember -- how many people died in Syria that were gassed by Assad? Obama didn't even lift a finger after all of those people were heinously killed. I mean, come on. \u00a0And then you look at other Democrats saying, oh, you know, we have to do something about Saudi Arabia. We have to pull out of this, pull out of that. Is Hillary Clinton going to give back the $25 million the Saudi royal family gave her foundation? I don't think so. What this is about the Democrats don't like Saudi politics because it's all about oil. They've always tried to peel this country away from Saudi Arabia for energy issues. \u00a0And right now, whatever the president does, if he embraces an ally like he's doing now, he's criticized. If he antagonizes an ally like he's done in the past he's criticized. He can never win. WILLIAMS: All right. So, Kennedy, lot of people are saying this is about money. KENNEDY: It's always about money with the Saudis. WILLIAMS: OK. And the Saudis just send a $100 million fulfilling a pledge they've said that they would help the U.S. in terms of our efforts in Syria, the timing a little suspect. KENNEDY: Yeah, it is a little suspect. I don't trust Saudi Arabia. And I think there are other countries in the Middle East where we are better aligned. I think you're absolutely right about Hillary Clinton, and she would have done the exact same thing. And this political cronyism goes back so many administrations, further back than her husband, and American presidents have always protected this kingdom for one reason or another. \u00a0And the world is going to look very different when we're no longer reliant on oil. And I wish we were more self-reliant when it comes to our energy reserves. But, you know, you have environmentalists in this country who are -- they're very torn and hypocritical when it comes to who we accept energy from. We still need energy. We still need oil. We're not quite there yet. But hopefully we will use American brainpower in order to wean ourselves off that because it has made horrific strategic partnerships. WILLIAMS: Dana, where are you on this one? PERINO: Well, I want to talk about what Brennan said about the president. \u00a0I think it's unfair because you go back to the Obama administration, I don't think they would have handled it differently. I don't if they'll handle it better. Do I think that, immediately, President Obama would have sent John Kerry without even picking up a suitcase directly to Saudi Arabia? And when he gets back from three days, he comes back -- what's the first thing that happens, Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, meets with the president and Secretary Pompeo, and he pulls out of the Saudi conference. It's prudent, it's measured, and you just heard the president say there's going to have to be something severe that happens. So when you give him like half a second to try to deal with this. You remember when the congress passed a bill that would have allowed the 9/11 victims' families to sue Saudi Arabia and Khalesee Mohamad, and President Obama vetoed that bill. There wasn't a lot of complaining in the media at the time about that kind of action. But I do think that the Saudis are reckless and impulsive. You have an American green card holder with, you know, there are 18,000 of them serving in our U.S. military, like, you cannot do this. We turn a blind eye to Saudi. We do not give them a lot of grief for a lot of things. Human rights violations, the way they treat women. The punishment that they use, how they treat their guest workers. \u00a0We need them as an ally in the region but we're not idiots. We understand what's going on. I think the president is very clear eyed about that. And one of the things that is important is sending a signal that it's unacceptable, some of the things that might happen, we won't be able to see, OK. So these really rich Saudi people that might be involved somehow that want to travel over to the United States, make it a little hard for them to do so. We don't need to know all the things the administration is doing but we should trust them. WILLIAMS: So, Greg, I mean, what strikes me is, obviously, I think, the grisly details about what they did to this guy. I mean, it's just horrific. And secondly, you know, picking up on what Dana was just saying, the Saudis, they're principally involved in 9/11, and we never, ever said, hey, look, you know, you guys, you have to bear responsibility. GUTFELD: Well, I love that now the left cares, you know. We've been talking about the abusive gays, the abusive women, the spread of radical Islam and the consequences from that, including terrorism. But it wasn't such a big deal for the left because you couldn't blame it on the west. So here you have the death of a journalist and they're scrambling. They see this -- we can peg this on Trump. They don't care about the journalist. \u00a0They don't care how he died. They're looking at it as an opportunity to tie it to Trump because they certainly didn't care about all the injustices that you've listed about Saudi Arabia. I mean, they've done some horrible things. And also, to your point, for the better part of a decade, we've discussed the importance of being energy independent. We've talked on many segments on the phenomenal success of shale. We've talked about that. The people who are against shale, against fracking, are the same people right now screaming about the Saudis. The whole point of shale, the whole point of fracking is so we aren't reliant on psychopaths in the Middle East. But now the left has protected the psychopaths because they don't want us to do fracking. They don't want the shale. So there's a lot of hypocrisy going around. PERINO: Can I make one last point on the arms deal. It is about money, OK, right. So we get the money and the jobs. But it is about something else. If a country is buying arms from us, that means they're dependent on us for parts, for all the other things that go along with it. So we get a benefit out of that because that means we're the dominant player in the region. Do we want someone like Saudi Arabia to buy weapons from China or Russia and become dependent on them rather than us? No. That would be foolish. WILLIAMS: Well, I agree. But I just do think that we have some standing in terms of our morals, and we don't go around. KENNEDY: I agree. GUTFELD: Morals are overrated. KENNEDY: . they need us more than we need them, and we need to behave accordingly. WILLIAMS: All right. A debate raging over calling protesters mobs, that's ahead right here on The Five. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Remember Brooke Baldwin's brave moment when she faced down a lone voice in defense of the mob? It was like a reverse David and Goliath. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: When you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, you're not going to use the mob word. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: It's totally a mob. It is without a doubt. There's no other word for it. UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: \u00a0Matt, a mob? Stop, stop. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Stop. Tuesday, Baldwin played a home game on Colbert set defending her effort to ban the M-word to describe groups of unruly, intimidating people targeting one person. Sorry, I mean a mob. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: So when he brought the mob word up again, I called him out. And listen, like, I don't want to be the word police, and that was not my intention, but I also believe in calling out talking points. \u00a0And to hear him bring that up, I had to say something. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Get that? Any opinion Baldwin doesn't like is a talking point. \u00a0I wonder if media matters told her to say that. But it's funny she says that calling out a mob is somehow groupthink. Think about it. When you try to defend someone from a large angry group, you're really just a sheep, reminds me of the other M-word, moronic. And Brooke Baldwin isn't even related to Alec. Sorry it's not woke to portray a mob as protesters. When you offer excuses for harassment, you become its defender at airports, restaurants, campuses, the streets, online. But if you've never said anything that stood you apart from the crowd, how would you even know? And before you cite right-wing anomalies, that's merely fringe for the left. It's now main stream. There's a new one or two every day. Like the professor telling people to contaminate or steal the food of Republicans at restaurants. Just another miscreant inciting mob action built upon previous excitements by leftist leaders, celebs, and activist. I guess that's a protest too. I guess if the target is on the right, they had it coming. And anything else is a talking point. You know, Jesse, everybody has talking points. WATTERS: Yeah. GUTFELD: But it seems to be CNN had a talking point, like on every show, if you said mob, they were told you can't say that. So it sounds to me like she was projecting. WATTERS: Yeah. The word mob is not a talking point. If I were to go on her show and I were to say Trump is running on jobs and the Democrats are running on mobs, that would be a talking point. (LAUGHTER) WATTERS: And it would be a good talking point and she could call me out. \u00a0And I'll actually then prove her wrong with my facts. I don't mind Brooke Baldwin. I think she has a compelling show. PERINO: Excuse me? Come on. WATTERS: Dana beat her last night by 700,000 homes. GUTFELD: Did you? WATTERS: Doubled her audience overall. I looked at the ratings. You did. \u00a0Congratulations. And Brooke does beat MSNBC, but that's not that hard. She just has to be honest about who she has. She's acting like she's an umpire calling balls and strikes. She's not. She's an advocate for the Democratic Party, and she's playing word games to defend the DNC. KENNEDY: She's a (UNINTELLIGIBLE) WATTERS: She is. And the Democrats, Kennedy, ban words all the time. \u00a0Merry Christmas, Pocahontas, illegal aliens, radical Islam. They love doing that. Remember the CNN promo that they just ran? GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: This is an apple. Some people won't tell you it's an apple. \u00a0They'll say it's a banana. They're looking at a mob and telling you it's a banana. KENNEDY: If only mobs had that much potassium. It's really sad. My brother, who was in law enforcement for a long time, keeps sending me videos of protesters in Portland and how they're -- they're torturing and terrorizing people there. It's not OK. It means that you have given up on ideas. It means that there's an intellectual reversion in this country. We're reverting back to, essentially, people without rational brains and cerebral cortices. We are turning into people who use emojis instead of words, which are essentially hieroglyphics. WATTERS: There's words for that. KENNEDY: And it's funny. It's funny, because people think that this is a winning strategy and winning optics. But if you look at what's happening with the caravans and the visual you get from that; and if you look at what's happening with the mob, you've got to be kind of careful, because there are people who are secretly voting, going, \"Well, that scares the living banana out of me.\" GUTFELD: Dana. PERINO: I don't let people do talking points on my show. GUTFELD: That's true. PERINO: I don't invite people on to do talking points. Just kidding. Here's the thing. Matt Lewis, who she was talking to, he is not actually working for any candidate or a party. GUTFELD: No. PERINO: So he doesn't have to do anybody's talking points. GUTFELD: He's an independent thinker. PERINO: Yes, he has a great podcast. He's a good writer. Conservative. GUTFELD: All right, let's -- going a little too far. PERINO: So I don't think that -- it's one thing, if you had somebody who was on who was, like, a spokesperson for a group, then they usually give you talking points. Somebody like Matt Lewis is one of their analysts. GUTFELD: But I say, Juan, the difference is that a mob is, you know, about intimidation. Protesters are about dialogue. That's the difference, and a lot of those people aren't interested in hearing anybody else. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Well, I think you have two things here. One is that you said there's a difference between the fringe and the mainstream. \u00a0I think that, in fact, when I think of Charlottesville, I think of a mob. \u00a0That's a violent mob. When I think of people like those in Portland that you were talking about, I think these sometimes are people who are homeless, who are involved with drugs. And they pick up on this, because they see it as an opportunity to act out, in my opinion. But I don't see it as part of the mob. But I must say, I think the right has plugged into that word as a vehicle for saying to their voters, \"Hey, we're facing bad guys, a mob out there,\" and I think that's what Brooke Baldwin was doing. She was saying, \"Hey, don't just use that word helter-skelter because it fits the Republican talking points for the midterm elections. If you see a mob, call it a mob.\" But what he was talking about, they were people who were harassing somebody in a restaurant. KENNEDY: But you have some Democrats who were calling for mobs. WILLIAMS: What do you mean? KENNEDY: \u00a0That's the problem with the political discourse right now. \u00a0You've got people like Cory Booker and Maxine Waters and the professor at Ole Miss, which is a great school. GUTFELD: It is. I miss Ole Miss. We've got to go, because we have \"Fastest Seven.\" And I'm trying to help the producers here for once. Another Hollywood celebrity claiming Disney movies like \"Snow White\" are bad for kids. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KENNEDY: All right. Get ready for our brand-new segment: \"The P.C. Police.\" First, Keira Knightley banned her daughter from watching \"Cinderella.\" \u00a0Wow. what an authoritarian. And now Kristen Bell is blasting another classic Disney fairy tale over this scene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (PRINCE CHARMING KISSES A SLEEPING SNOW WHITE) (END VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: Isn't that a sweet moment? Apparently not. The actress is concerned that Prince -- the prince kissing Snow White without her consent sends a bad message to her young daughters. Like that's true. Jesse, you have young daughters, and I've been thinking about this. And I now share her outrage, and I've been looking back at some of the other Disney films that I've shared with my daughters. And I look at \"The Princess and the Frog,\" and I think to myself, here is a human woman kissing a reptile. That's bestiality. And don't get me started with \"Beauty and the Beast.\" WATTERS: Yes, I found the dwarves offensive in that scene. That's politically incorrect. GUTFELD: Imagine how I feel. WATTERS: I also think, listen, there's room for romance and the #MeToo movement. I mean, there's plenty of room for both. Romance shouldn't be a casualty of the #MeToo movement. And I have twin girls. And, you know, we showed them all types of movies. \u00a0And one of them is a pretty girlie-girl, and she loves pink and princesses and beauty and fashion. And the other likes sports and building things and, you know, wears Adidas track pants. So -- and then I know another young girl that was obsessed with dolls. All she wanted was a doll and play with princesses her whole life, and her mother kind of steered her away from that, because she didn't want to plant a gender stereotypes. And it actually, the course correction had a negative effect, and now she's desperate for dolls and girls; and it's a little too much. So there's other things you can show them. There's a movie called \"Brave\" that stars Meridia. And Meridia has -- PERINO: Merida. WATTERS: -- a bow and arrow, and she's pretty -- she's the star. You don't always have to go crazy. Let kids be normal, and they'll figure it out. KENNEDY: You know, maybe let them find what they want. It's funny, because Keira Knightley doesn't let her daughter watch \"Cinderella,\" because her big takeaway from it is a man saves Cinderella, when actually, it's a movie about anti-bullying. And a young woman who defeats the worst bullies in her life with kindness. PERINO: Exactly. And the other thing is, if Kristen Bell is worried about \"Snow White,\" you would think the scene she would have picked would have been the one where it's \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\" because of people getting upset and worried about how they compare to other people. And if they're pretty enough, they're beautiful enough. So I would have picked that scene if I were going to ban my daughter from watching -- but I don't have children. So I defer to you and Jesse, because those were very good points. KENNEDY: Greg. GUTFELD: Everybody's trying to out-woke each other, right? And what they're doing is they're actually undermining probably one of the most unifying things in the world that crosses all cultures. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: Which is fairy tales. If you look -- if you look at Russian literature, if you look at Japanese literature, African, it's filled with stories of love and sorrow, and warriors and princesses. You can't stop these stories from actually happening. And I guess you can't kiss your children when they're asleep. You can't kiss your spouses when they're asleep, because that's without consent. I would also add that, you know, her husband has done a lot of things without consent on his show \"Punk'd,\" where he actually used to walk around naked as part of a prank. And I would say that is probably, maybe worse than kissing somebody who's asleep. KENNEDY: Certainly. I mean, forcing that sort of a visual on unsuspecting people, especially when it's unwanted, that is not OK in this day and age. GUTFELD: I agree. KENNEDY: Juan, there's something to be said, you know, not only for fantasies and fairy tales; but the entire genre, superhero movies. \"The Hobbit.\" WILLIAMS: Yes, there are more superhero movies now that feature girls as the hero, as the protagonist, and I think it's great. I mean, I've got granddaughters. I hope they see it. You know, so I was paying attention, because I think the kind of cultural stereotypes about, for example, \"Beauty and the Beast,\" that the girl has to tolerate the beast; and she has to help the beast out, and then the beast becomes a good guy. You think this is fun. GUTFELD: It's true. WILLIAMS: What do you mean? GUTFELD: It's true. That's what women -- they make men -- they make men better creatures. WILLIAMS: Yes, but the thing is, then the onus is on her to be nice to -- GUTFELD: Women like to improve men. KENNEDY: Well, it's on her to not be -- GUTFELD: Until they can't improve them. Then you're out the door. KENNEDY: Or it's a commercial for Stockholm Syndrome, which is also incredibly problematic. WILLIAMS: I just think, so you guys are right, by the way, on P.C. I mean, I think if you have a story, fine. We do put girls into a lot of stereotypical position -- GUTFELD: We do the same thing with boys. WILLIAMS: Like what? GUTFELD: Boys have to be rough-and-tumble. They have to -- they're always the criminals. Come on. It goes both ways. The fact is, there are biological roles that happened because we're different. WATTERS: Juan, you held up a pink dress outside my office today in the wardroom department. WILLIAMS: Yes. WATTERS: You were experimenting. WILLIAMS: I was? I was experimenting with you to see -- I don't know if you would, you know -- you know -- KENNEDY: Sensitivity trailing really helped. All right. The left now using witches -- that's real -- to resist Brett Kavanaugh. That and more spellbinding stories in \"The Fastest Seven,\" up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Welcome back. Time for \"The Fastest Seven.\" First up, is \"Teen Vogue\" using its social media to expose young readers to socialist propaganda? The magazine's Twitter account posted a link to an anti-capitalist article and included the caption -- ready? -- \"Can't End Poverty Without Ending Capitalism.\" And retweeted this morning, \"Good Morning. Capitalism is Still Bad.\" \"Teen Vogue.\" Sound like Karl Marx over here, Kennedy. KENNEDY: It's interesting, because 80 percent of extreme global poverty was eradicated between 1980 and 2006, and in that time period alone, the number of people who were living on less than a dollar a day was staggering. And 80 percent of them were lifted out of poverty because of capitalism and free trade and innovation and entrepreneurship. Conde Nast, a multi-billion-dollar company, owns \"Teen Vogue,\" and that was tweeted using an iPhone. I'm certain of it. WATTERS: That's a good statistic. What do you think, Juan? WILLIAMS: I just think that's, you know -- I hope it's just one person and not representative of the whole company. But the other day -- and I may have mentioned this earlier -- I heard somebody talk about how capitalism is bigger than religion, bigger than geography, boundaries, anything else. That everybody in the world can benefit from capitalism. WATTERS: I guess capitalism isn't in vogue anymore over there. PERINO: So \"Teen Vogue\" is, like, the best example of capitalism. All the ads in the magazine are meant to get teenage girls to go to their parents to get money so that they can go and buy things that they don't need. KENNEDY: Exactly right. GUTFELD: I will go further and say that \"Teen Vogue\" is advocating for the death and suffering of millions and millions of people. I believe that, because they don't -- they are actually saying that the one engine that saves lives is evil. So I put a challenge to the CEO. Robert Sauerberg is the CEO of -- he should go and pay a visit to \"Teen Vogue,\" if they have any offices, and ask them why they're a propaganda operation meant to brainwash kids into believing in horrible, horrible ideas. It's disgusting. \"Teen Vogue\" is crap. And I used to subscribe. WATTERS: Wow. I thought you still did. Oh, it was another one of those magazines. PERINO: That was for the articles. WATTERS: Up next, Democrats and mobs -- mobs, Juan -- of screaming activists couldn't derail Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court. So now the left is brewing up something different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BETTE MIDLER, ACTRESS: Twist the bones and bend the back. Itch-it-a-cop- it-a-Mela-a-ka-mys-ti-ca. Trim him of his baby fat. Itch-it-a-cop-it-a- Mela-a-ka-mys-ti-ca. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: That's right: witches are reportedly planning to put a hex on Kavanaugh to resist and cause a lot of suffering. And by the way, \"Watters' World\" will be featuring one of these witches Saturday night, 8 p.m. GUTFELD: Of course you will! WATTERS: So make sure to tune in. Kennedy. KENNEDY: Don't make them mad. You are not supposed to do this. I mean, talk about \"The Fastest Seven.\" It is said in witchcraft if you cast spells negatively, that energy comes back at you seven times. So it is -- so for those witches who are engaging their time and energy, just be careful. And I'm a superstitious person. So no way. WATTERS: Juan, these are your people. WILLIAMS: My people? I don't know. WATTERS: Just like Kavanaugh. WILLIAMS: So by the way, who's doing this? WATTERS: Witches, Juan. WILLIAMS: I mean, like, there are witches in the world now? WATTERS: Yes. These are witches. WILLIAMS: You believe in witches? WATTERS: I don't believe in them. PERINO: They call themselves witches. WILLIAMS: I don't know. KENNEDY: Ninety-nine problems and a witch ain't one, right? WILLIAMS: What? KENNEDY: Ninety-nine problems and a witch ain't one. WILLIAMS: I don't know anything about this. I mean, it just looks like craziness to me. WATTERS: Yes, Juan, way to prep for the show. PERINO: Yes, exactly. You know what I say? Knock yourselves out. Just, like, spend your time doing that, it's fine. WATTERS: All right. GUTFELD: They're ignorant. If -- witches were actually part of the first witch hunt, believe it or not. That's where witch hunts came from. PERINO: Yes. That's -- Lizzie Borden [SIC]. GUTFELD: Yes, you'll get -- Lizzie Borden? PERINO: Lizzie Borden, I'm sorry. GUTFELD: The Salem witch trials -- the Salem witch trials executed 20 people, and they weren't witches. They were targeted by a mob who forced them to prove their innocence. What does that sound like? Kavanaugh. \u00a0They should be defending Kavanaugh. WATTERS: Gutfeld bringing his A-game today, guys. And finally, Buffalo Wild Wings is updating its fall menu. You ready? \u00a0Pumpkin spice wings. The chain debuted a pumpkin ale sauce earlier this month. But is it gross or great? All right, guys. What do you guys think? What do we think of pumpkin spice wings? No one looks like they even want to try them. PERINO: I can smell it from here, and it's just -- no. (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY: -- celiac. WATTERS: You know what? This is -- just the smell alone, is that what's turning people off? GUTFELD: This is the downside of capitalism. We talked about the upside of capitalism. Capitalism causes people to find solutions for things that maybe we don't need. I don't know if we need this, but they're trying to squeeze something out of a tired, boring gourd. \"What else can we do with a pumpkin?\" And so we get this. WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. WATTERS: But people do like pumpkin spice lattes, right? GUTFELD: I don't. PERINO: Why don't you try it? WILLIAMS: Yes. GUTFELD: Mr. -- WATTERS: Do I have to? WILLIAMS: Wait a minute. You were making fun of people a minute ago. KENNEDY: You got the bucket. WATTERS: It's still chicken on the inside. WILLIAMS: I see, I see. WATTERS: Not bad. WILLIAMS: You know what? This is capitalism, Greg, exploiting our poor friend, forcing him to eat something he doesn't want to eat. WATTERS: All right. I'm going to finish these after the break. \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: It's time for \"One More Thing.\" I've got a big announcement. On Monday, \"The Five\" is going to hit the road. We are going to Dallas. \u00a0We're talking all about the midterms. We're going to be in Dallas on Monday, October 22. Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz, you know they're battling it out there in one of the most watched races in the country. There's many more big races happening in Texas. And Dallas native Lawrence Jones will be joining us for the show. It's going to be held at SMU, Southern Methodist University. We'll also be answering questions from students. That's going to be fun. And for Jesse and Greg and Juan, they'll be enjoying a local barbecue hot spot yet to be named. So we're very excited about that. Hope you watch the show. Juan. WATTERS: Yes, don't chase us out of the restaurant, mob. Let us eat in peace. GUTFELD: That doesn't happen in Texas. PERINO: Juan. WATTERS: Maybe (UNINTELLIGIBLE) will be there. WILLIAMS: \u00a0Normally when people see me walking on the street, they stop me and they want to talk politics but not today. It was all about the home run that wasn't. Take a look at this video from last night's Red Sox/Astros game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right field. Back there. That's at the track, he leaps! And it is out! It's off a fan! (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: You can see the ball seemed destined to be a home run, but the umpire rules fan interference. This reminded me of 2003 when Steve Bartman, a Cubs fan, intercepted a ball that could've been an out for his team. Bartman later said the moment changed his life for the worst forever. Houston Astros fan Troy Caldwell says he's afraid the same fate awaits him and he's going to be known as the guy who caused the Astros to lose. PERINO: Not good. Greg. GUTFELD: Don't touch other people's balls is what I say. All right. Let's go to this. KENNEDY: Very classy. GRAPHIC: Greg's Cat-Off GUTFELD: \"Greg's Cat-Off.\" OK, real quick, we've got three cat videos and you guys are going to vote which one is the best, that video. Let's go to No. 1. Here we've got a cat opening a door. Look at him try. \u00a0He can't quite do it, can he? But then he starts thinking there's got to be a better way. So then he gets down there, and then he says, \"I'm going to come up from below.\" And he opens the door. All right! Go, second cat. This is a cat that's looking for a place to rest. What does he rest? On another pile of cats. That's right. He's got a cat sofa. KENNEDY: Aww, cozy. GUTFELD: Isn't that great? He probably ate them later. All right. Last cat video, here we go in slow mo. An adorable cat just leaping. Very fuzzy little kitten there. And that is your three cat video choices. Kennedy, your vote? KENNEDY: I go for the one who's leaving, so the one who gets out the door. GUTFELD: Juan. WILLIAMS: I like the slo mo. GUTFELD: Slo mo. WATTERS: Slo mo. PERINO: I'm going to go with the opening the door. Very talented. GUTFELD: I'm going to say opening the door, and that breaks it. Opening the door wins. PERINO: All right. Very good. Jesse. WATTERS: OK, so everybody wants to do this. You want to hit a half-court shot at a basketball game. It happened last night at the Nicks game. \u00a0Check out this guy, for 10 Gs. PERINO: Wow. KENNEDY: That's great. WATTERS: Pretty good. Not bad, right? And I think the Nicks just signed him to a 10-year -- 10-day contract. PERINO: Do you think it's easier to get that -- I mean, is your chance of hitting that more than winning the lottery? WATTERS: No, I'll hit that shot. By the way, my lottery ticket will be called on Friday. So maybe on Friday, it might be the last time you guys see me. PERINO: Will you still go to Dallas? WATTERS: No. PERINO: Kennedy. KENNEDY: Well, I was disappointed in the pumpkin wings, but these are gluten-free, dairy-free pumpkin cheesecake that I made this afternoon. \u00a0Those of us with food allergies oftentimes don't get to enjoy the fruits of the season. Pumpkin cheesecake is delicious. GUTFELD: What's it made out of? KENNEDY: All you have to do is substitute tofu cream cheese for the cream cheese. You still use eggs, and instead of heavy cream, you use coconut milk creamer. GUTFELD: Wait, there's coconut in it? KENNEDY: Don't say that. GUTFELD: I'm allergic. KENNEDY: Don't say that! No. And the crust is granola and coconut oil. PERINO: Is there a doctor in the house? No doctor in the house? Oh, well. WILLIAMS: It's delicious. PERINO: Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" is up next. I'm going to eat my cheesecake -- Bret. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: You guys have all the good food. Thanks, Dana.

She will be the first Somali American to serve in Congress and one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) MINNEAPOLIS \u2013 Fresh off of becoming the first Somali-American elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar said Wednesday that she's still enjoying being known for her firsts. In 2016 the one-time refugee became the first Somali-American elected to a state legislature in the U.S. when she won a seat in the Minnesota House from Minneapolis, which has a large Somali community. Her victory Tuesday in Minnesota's 5th District also makes her one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, along with Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who won a Detroit-area seat. \"It's wonderful. It is a great opportunity. But really I am not going from a first to another first,\" Omar said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I'm going from the state House to the opportunity to serve in Congress, and serve the people in the Fifth, which is a great honor and a great opportunity. ... It is something that is exciting to a few people, but, you know, often times it is important for us to own the moment, celebrate it, and then move on.\" Omar said she's looking forward to going to Washington \"to join a very diverse, bold progressive caucus\" and work to expand funding for infrastructure projects, expanding the availability of health care and strengthening education. And she said she plans \"to hold this administration accountable and be a true check and balance.\" While she said there will be opportunities for Democrats to find compromise with President Donald Trump on some issues, such as infrastructure, she added, \"there is a real opportunity for us to make that sure that we have a Congress that does its job.\" While Nancy Pelosi is positioned to return to the speaker's office after Democrats took back the House, Omar, like many Democratic candidates, has been publicly reticent about committing to support Pelosi. She said she admires Pelosi for her \"wonderful work ethic\" and looks forward to conversations within the Democratic caucus about electing a leader \"that will help us implement the bold, progressive policies that we ran on. ... I will see who that turns out to be.\" Omar will succeed Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, who was elected as Minnesota's next attorney general on Tuesday. Like Ellison, she said, she will probably use a Quran for her ceremonial swearing in.",

Click here.\n\u00a0\nDeveloping now, Friday, Oct. 19, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - PLAN IN PLACE FOR A CARAVAN OF THOUSANDS: U.S. and Mexican officials have agreed on a plan to handle the approaching migrant caravan making their way up from Central America, a senior administration official told FOX News on Thursday ... Under the deal, which was developed over the course of several months, Mexico requested that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) establish shelters along its southern border with Central America, the official said. If an individual manages to evade the new system and travels through Mexico to eventually cross the border into the U.S., Mexico will now allow those persons to be returned to Mexico, the official told FOX News. At the established shelters, U.N. officials will vet the refugees to decide which ones have legitimate claims for refugee status, the official told FOX News. At a campaign rally in Montana on Thursday night, President Trump accused Democrats of supporting the caravan of migrants because they \"figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.\" The caravan, which started in Honduras last week, is currently bound for the U.S. As of Thursday, a migrant shelter located on the Guatemalan side of the border with Mexico said that hundreds of the caravan\u2019s migrants had reached the area, according to The Associated Press. \u00a0Earlier Thursday, the caravan drew the ire of President Trump, who threatened via Twitter military force and a closure of the U.S. southern border. TRUMP CONTINUES WAIT AND SEE APPROACH ON SAUDIS: President Trump on Thursday said it \u201ccertainly looks\u201d like missing activist and writer Jamal Khashoggi is dead ... Before departing for a campaign rally in Montana, Trump was asked if Khashoggi was dead. He replied: \"It certainly looks that way. Very sad.\" Khashoggi\u2019s whereabouts have been unknown since entered the Saudi Consulate in Turkey on Oct 2. The president didn't elaborate on his conclusion but he said the consequences for Saudi Arabia \"will have to be very severe\" if they are ultimately found responsible for Khashoggi's presumed death. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that he suggested that Trump allow Saudi officials more time to complete an investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance. Trump's remarks come after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Twitter that he would not be attending a conference in Saudi Arabia next week. ROSENSTEIN TO BE GRILLED IN SECRET: The top lawmakers on the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees plan to interview Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein next week about reports that he once suggested wearing a \"wire\" to secretly record President Trump and discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office ... Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., announced late Thursday that they and the top Democrats on both committees would interview Rosenstein on Oct. 24. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus will be left out of the meeting. Goodlatte and Gowdy added that the interview will be held in a secure room and that a transcript will be released after the intelligence community reviews it for classified information. The Rosenstein interview was announced hours after Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called on Rosenstein to resign after the deputy attorney general declined an invitation to testify earlier this month. THE UNCIVIL LEFT - NOW IT'S ROSIE'S TURN: Rosie O'Donnell, a longtime, notorious critic of President Trump, said Thursday she wants to have U.S. armed forces remove him from the White House ... \"I want to send the military to the White House to get him,\" O'Donnell said on MSNBC, as host Nicolle Wallace discussed Trump's threats to have the military \"close\" the U.S.-Mexico border amid reports a massive migrant caravan is en route to the area. For years, O'Donnell and Trump have partaken in a bitter, back-and-forth feud. FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE - RUSH LIMBAUGH MAKES MIDTERM PREDICTIONS: Rush Limbaugh, in an exclusive interview with FOX News\u2019 Sean Hannity, predicted Republicans will hold both houses of Congress next month \u2013 defying the Washington wisdom that Nancy Pelosi is in line for speaker ... \u201cWe hold the House and increase the Senate,\u201d the conservative talk radio host predicted in an interview Thursday night on \"Hannity.\" He added, \u201cI think the Democrat Party deserves to lose in the biggest single electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime because of the actions they\u2019ve taken just in the last month.\u201d The party out of power in the White House historically picks up seats in the first post-presidential midterms. And polling has suggested 2018 will be no different. Limbaugh is skeptical. \u201cI don\u2019t trust it. It hasn\u2019t been right consistently enough for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople doing these surveys desperately want Trump gone. I don\u2019t know how they can take that out of their work.\u201d ARE YOU IN IT TO WIN IT? - Who wants to be a billionaire (or something close to it)? Despite insanely long odds \u2014 one in 302.5 million \u2014 someone with an unparalleled gift for picking numbers \u2014 or an astonishing amount of good luck\u2014 very well could match all six Mega Millions numbers on Friday, and win a jackpot that currently stands at a mind-blowing $970 million ... Officials raised the estimated jackpot Thursday for the second time because of strong sales ahead of Friday night\u2019s drawing for what would be the second-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history. The largest U.S. jackpot was about $1.6 billion, for a 2016 Powerball contest, and it was shared by the holders of three winning tickets. No one has matched all six numbers and won the Mega Millions grand prize since July 24.

The shift has really hit the fan -- the president is shifting so fast.\" \u00a0\u2013 Neil Cavuto, in his \"Common Sense\" monologue on \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" warning President Trump that it is not politically or civically advantageous to habitually shift blame when things don't go his way.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. President Trump takes credit for cooling a trade war with Europe and heating up the U.S. economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions. Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world. WALLACE: But is the spike in our GDP sustainable? We'll discuss that and the president's hard sell to the heartland. TRUMP: We will not let anybody bully our wonderful American farmers. WALLACE: With Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, it's a \"Fox News Sunday\" exclusive. Then, the confrontation between President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, escalates over taped conversations and claims the president knew about that Trump Tower meeting with the Russian lawyer. We'll discuss what it means for the special counsel investigation with the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Plus, getting to the bottom of what happened in Helsinki. SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D-NEW JERSEY: Did he tell you what -- whether or not what happened in those two hours? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, the predicate of your question implied some notion that there was something improper about having a one-on-one meeting. I completely disagree. MENENDEZ: I didn't ask you a predicate. I asked you a simple question. WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about Secretary of State Pompeo's hot seat in a Senate hearing. All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. The gloves are off in a fight between President Trump and his former attorney, Michael Cohen. The president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, will be here later to talk about why the joint defense agreement between Mr. Trump and Cohen is no longer in effect. But, first, the Republican plan to hold on the control of Congress relies heavily on a growing economy, one President Trump took full credit for on Friday. The president says the 4.1 percent growth in GDP in the second quarter shows his policies on trade and taxes and deregulation are working. But some economists disagree, warning these are only short-term gains. Joining us now for an exclusive interview is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday\". STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: Thank you, and it's great to be here with you. WALLACE: Let's start with the strong GDP numbers, 4.1 percent growth in the second quarter, and some very bullish talk from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These numbers are very, very sustainable. This isn't a one time shot. LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR: This is a boom that will be sustainable, frankly as far as the eye can see. This is no one-shot effort. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: So, Mr. Secretary, can we count on 3 percent growth in this year, 2018, which would be the highest annual rate since the great recession, and President Trump talked late this week that he could see 8 percent or 9 percent growth, is that realistic? MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, we've been very clear since the campaign, the president's economic plan has always consisted of tax reform, trade relief and regulatory relief and we said we were going to achieve 3 percent or higher sustained GDP, and that's where we are. The 4 percent, 4.1, was a terrific order, but we are very focused on the long-term sustained economic growth, which our plans have had. WALLACE: So, do you believe it will be 3 percent this year and going how far into the future? MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, we can only project a couple years in the future, but I think we are well on this path for several years. So, I don't -- I don't think this is a one or two year phenomenon. I think we definitely are in a period of four or five sustained -- four or five years of sustained 3 percent growth at least. WALLACE: As you know, some economists say this 4.1 percent figure in the second quarter is more of a blip than a trend. I want to put up some of their reasons. They point to a surge in farm exports in this quarter before the president's tariffs kicked in and they note that the Federal Reserve projects 2.8 percent growth this year and back to 2 percent by 2020. Is the Fed wrong, sir? MNUCHIN: Oh, Chris, again, you've got to go back to last year. Everyone was projecting 2 percent growth, we were projecting 3 percent growth and everybody gave the reasons why we couldn't get to three and we came up with the reasons and the policies. So, I think you are beginning to see projections go higher. Our 10-year projections are at 3 percent and we are comfortable we're hitting these numbers. WALLACE: Speaking of the Federal Reserve, both the president this week and Vice President Pence today on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" rather are speaking out against the Fed raising interest rates and potentially slowing growth. Here they both are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I don't like all of this work we are putting into the economy and then I see rates going up. MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We don't want policies, whether Capitol Hill or elsewhere, that diminish the tremendous energy that we have in this economy today. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Mr. Secretary, what happened to respecting the independence of the Federal Reserve? MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, I think they do and we as an administration absolutely support the independence of the Fed and the president has made it clear that this is the Fed's decision. So, these are really more just comments saying as interest rates are going up, it's something that the president has a concern. But let me be clear, he absolutely respects the independence of the Fed, and the issue is the market expects interest rates to keep going up. So, the only question is how far, and for how long? And we think the Fed will be very careful in managing the economy. WALLACE: I mean, in fact, isn't it responsible as the economy heats up, when we've had these incredibly low, artificially low interest rates when the economy was chugging along at one or 2 percent, isn't it responsible for the Fed to increase interest rates? MNUCHIN: I think it is in the market expects it. The Fed has been targeting 2 percent inflation and obviously with 2 percent inflation, we have to have at least slightly higher interest rates to manage through that. WALLACE: I want to ask you about another potential drag on the economy, and that is the drop in some tech stocks, especially this week. Facebook dropped 19 percent on Thursday. Twitter fell 20 percent Friday. And Intel and Apple also fell. Mr. Secretary, are you concerned about investors souring on tech stocks, especially those tech stocks involving social media, which is I think you would agree, have been big drivers of growth in the economy and big drivers of rise in the markets? MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, I've always believed that diversified portfolios of U.S. stocks are great investments and will continue to be. As you can see, the market is not efficient. The fact that you could have a one-day correction of these magnitudes just goes to show you that in the short term, the market is not necessarily efficient, but I'm not concerned about this at all. And again, investors should have diversified portfolios. The tech stocks have obviously had an incredible run. And, you know, kind of -- you look at the Nasdaq, you look at the S&P, you look at the Dow, the markets obviously doing very well. WALLACE: Let's turn to trade. President Trump announced what he called a, quote, breakthrough agreement on trade with the European Union this week. But, sir, isn't he exaggerating a bit? There were no tariffs removed in his discussions with the European Commission, there were few specific commitments. There was one on soybeans, and there was no timetable. In fact, Mr. Secretary, all that the president and the president of the European Commission agreed on is to start talking. MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, that's actually not the case and let me just step back for a second. These talks started with the president of the G7 saying let's have no tariffs, no barriers, no subsidies. Those talks continued with the G7. I was at the G20. I met with my counterparts. And then when we had the Juncker, the president of the E.U., we specifically did go through a detailed discussion. We had several hours of kind of negotiating back and forth on an outline of an agreement and now, we have the hard work. But we've said, the first step is going to be to resolve the steel and aluminum tariffs and when we do that, the retaliatory tariffs will come off, but this was also an agreement to reduce tariffs significantly across the board and we have about a trillion dollars of trade. So, this is a -- this is a very big opportunity to do things. WALLACE: But, Mr. Secretary, let me give you one example of where the president and the administration makes it sound like there is a deal and the E.U. makes it sound like there isn't. Here's what the president said to farmers in Iowa this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We just opened up you're up for you, farmers. If you are not going to be too angry with Trump, I can tell you. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But as soon as he said that the spokesperson for the European Commission gave this response. Quote: Agriculture is out of the scope of these discussions. We are not negotiating about agricultural products. Mr. Secretary, you are at odds, the president is at odds with the European Union before the talks even start. MNUCHIN: Chris, I was in the room and we had specific conversations about agriculture and the need to break down the barriers on agriculture and have more opportunities for our farmers. We specifically talked about soybeans, but we specifically agreed we'd look at these other markets, and it was very clear that our objective as part of this whole agreement is the Europeans have to open up more opportunities for our farmers and our agriculture. So, I can't comment on their comment. This will be an important part of any agreement we reached. WALLACE: But let me just ask you directly because this is on the record. The spokesperson for the European commission said, let me quote it again, we are not negotiating about agricultural products. So, are you right, or is she right? MNUCHIN: Again, let me be clear, we had specific conversation about soybeans, that was step one. We discussed other areas. And, again, this is all part of a negotiation. It's -- we will have an agreement, so it will be in accomplishing agreement. We want to drop tariffs and barriers across the board. That's what we are focused on doing. WALLACE: Forgive my skepticism and the skepticism of other people on this, Mr. Secretary, but I don't have to tell you, there's a big difference between trade talks and a trade deal. Here you were in May, here on \"Fox News Sunday\" talking about trade with China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MNUCHIN: We are putting the trade war on hold. So, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But within weeks of your making that declaration on their show, President Trump announced $50 billion in new tariffs, or tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. So, you know, what looked like a truce one minute can fall apart the next. MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, you're right, these are complicated negotiations and these have to be turned into a real agreement that's literally hundreds and hundreds of pages. So, we're going to go part by part with Europe. I was down in Mexico last week. We had a terrific meeting with the new administration. The NAFTA talks are back on track. That's our number one priority now, to get NAFTA done. We are going to negotiate piece by piece with the E.U. And, you know, we continue to have conversations with China. And we'll see where we get, but you're right, these things have to be negotiated because the president is very clear, he doesn't just want talk, we need our counterparts to follow through and deliver, breaking down barriers and creating better opportunities so that we can reduce our giant trade deficit. WALLACE: Finally, Mr. Secretary, in response to farmers concerned about getting hit by tariffs, the administration announced this week a $12 billion package in emergency aid. I looked back to the record and you have spoken out several times against corporate welfare. So, when did handouts to farmers become strong, good, solid, conservative policy? MNUCHIN: Well, Chris, I don't think these are handouts. So, it would be one thing if we were just subsidizing markets, and that's not what we are doing here. This is a -- this is a short-term solution to deal with the retaliatory tariffs where you have people who put tariffs, which, by the way, are against WTO rules and unfair and targeting our farmers. So, we are sticking up for our farmers so that they don't get hurt in these trade discussions. These are not long-term subsidies for the industry. WALLACE: And what do you say to some Republican senators who balked at this idea this week and said they need trade, not aid? MNUCHIN: Well, we agree with that. The focus is trade, not aid, and that's why we're focused on negotiating these agreements. But again, the president is not willing to live with the status quo where other countries have taken advantage of the rules and had free trade here and our companies and our workers can compete fairly, and it's just not fair that China has complete open access to our markets and we have virtually limited access to their markets and forced joint ventures. And we are focused on, as we said, free and fair trade, let's take down all the barriers. WALLACE: Secretary Mnuchin, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you, sir. MNUCHIN: Thank you, Chris. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what the good economic news will mean for Republican control of Congress come November. Plus, Rudy Giuliani thinks someone played with that secretly recorded Trump-Cohen tape. The president's lawyer joins us at the bottom of the hour. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've turned it all around. Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world. When I meet the leaders of countries, the first thing they say, invariably, is, Mr. President, so nice to meet you. Congratulations on your economy. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: President Trump in full salesman mode, touting the news of strong economic growth this spring. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Jonathan Swan, who covers the White House for \"Axios\", and Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner. Jonah, how big a deal is this 4.1 percent number GDP growth in the second quarter, and is it enough for Republicans to hang their hats on as they try to hold onto control of the House in November? JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Historically, normally, you would think it would be, and it is a big deal -- 4.1 is a big number. The problem is, is that for the Republicans are suffering most are among essentially white college educated women in suburban districts. They seem to be immune to the boom in the economy and the gender gap is unprecedented for congressional candidates. And so, the idea that the economy alone is what these women are going to vote for when they are going to be the ones providing the margins of difference whether or not they are going to hold onto the House I think is unlikely and is probably very worrisome to the White House. WALLACE: Mo, there has been a lot of talk about a blue wave this November, a big Democratic pickup, may be control of the House, maybe even control of the Senate. But I think you would agree in the absence of where the economy is always the top issue and when you got strong economic growth, when you got historically low unemployment number, isn't that a pretty strong record for Republicans to run on? MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: Look, first of all, we should all be celebrating 4.1 economic growth. That's a good number, a strong number. It also would have been the fifth strongest number of the Obama administration, right? The Obama administration -- this is the continuation of economic recovery that began in 2009 and 2010. That strong economy wasn't enough to save Democrats last time. It's not enough to say it will be enough to say it would save Republicans this time. I think Jonah's point cannot be overstated that for a lot of these voters, particularly suburban voters where gas prices are going up, where they are a little bit more uncertainty around health care. Add to that, some of these working-class voters who are getting hit by the results of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, who are getting hit by agricultural voters who are getting hit by issues like soybeans. There's enough economic uncertainty that even with the strong number I think Republicans are still facing a headwind. WALLACE: Let's turn to the other big economic story this week and that was the so-called trade truce between President Trump and his administration and the European Commission and the president and the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, talked about that. So, here they are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: This was a very big day for free and fair trade. Very big day indeed. JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION: I had the intention to make a deal today. And we made a deal today. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Jonathan, you heard my conversation just before the last segment with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin. What are your sources at the White House telling you about any real dialing down of tariffs with European Union? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, there is no dialing down of tariffs or intention, I mean, the tariffs all of remain in place, the steel and aluminum tariffs, and the retaliatory tariffs. And if what Secretary Mnuchin told you is true, which is the White House will only accept an encompassing -- I think he used the word encompassing deal, which includes agriculture, well, they're going to have some problems because every country, every bloc of countries has its pet political issues that they don't want to touch. For Germany, it's the cars. That's why cars weren't in that agreement. They were explicitly excluded. Non-auto industrial goods. Agriculture -- a big issue in Europe. Again, they are protected industries. So -- WALLACE: And particularly in France. They explicitly said, we do not want to lower agricultural tariffs. SWAN: Right. So, if the demand is we want zero tariffs across everything, which by the way was the objective of the TTIP negotiations that Obama was -- WALLACE: Explain what that is. SWAN: TTIP was the predecessor to this. This was Obama -- the Obama administration negotiating with Europe for a free trade deal. That was the objective. You've got the objective page, zero tariffs on all industries. This is basically a narrower version of TTIP in the goals. And guess what? It's going to be really hard, like any massive trade negotiation. So, look, I don't have any indication that they are going to withdraw the steel and aluminum tariffs, but I do know that the Republicans on the Hill are putting immense pressure now on the administration quietly because they are worried. Your whole first conversation about the economy, Republicans on the Hill see the trade agenda as the biggest risk to that for the midterms. WALLACE: Gillian, I mean, let's take a bigger look at the president's trade policy. There is no deal with European Union. In fact, talks haven't even started. There's no deal on NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, although there has been a report of some progress in that area, and there is certainly no deal. In fact, relations are tense and have gotten worse with China. So, how do you see the president's trade policy and specifically, his policy on tariffs? How do you see that playing out? GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: So, as everyone has now pointed out, not a lot of specifics in the deal with Juncker. But I want to just say that doesn't mean it wasn't a valuable exercise. The whole exercise of him coming here, meeting with the president and doing this joint press conference. Sometimes conflict resolution 101 tells you that when you have these really contentious negotiations, the two sides are really far apart, they are not agreeing on anything, this battle sort of reaching the tipping point where it becomes a war, the best thing to do is to just to agree to agree later on and to a certain extent, that was what they achieved coming out of this. And I don't think it was in -- a worthless thing. GOLDBERG: There's a problem with that, in that this entire crisis, to the extent it was a crisis, Donald Trump created it, right? He's like a fireman who goes and sets fire so he can then be the hero. So, he creates this trade crisis and then he talks -- he backs off from it and we get back to the status quo ante that we had before he created the crisis in the first place. I don't know that there has been anything legitimately productive coming out of this whole chapter, even though I do think Trump should declare victory at this E.U. thing so we can move beyond it. TURNER: Well, to be fair, they are -- they did agree to hit pause and not institute an escalation. GOLDBERG: Right. TURNER: No more new tariffs. (CROSSTALK) TURNER: I'm not saying this follows everybody's problems, but it is something worthwhile. WALLACE: I want to ask you, Jonathan, because the president has been something on a Twitter roll today and he just tweeted, and I got it up here. He said he would be willing to, quote, shut down the government if he doesn't get everything he wants on immigration. He wants a wall. He wants an end to the visa lottery or a change in that. He wants an end to the chain migration. Is he really willing to see a shutdown, which would be on September 30th, it would be one month before the midterm elections? SWAN: So, this is -- I mean, I have to say, that sweet kind of shocks me, and that -- not much actually shocks me from this president. But the conversation I've had with his senior advisors as recently as a few weeks ago on this very subject was they were of the impression that they had convinced the president that it was not in his political interest to shut down the federal government six weeks before an election. So, I don't know if this is just bluster, bluffing that he feels dissatisfied that in the negotiations he's had with members of the Senate that they haven't given him more or said to them is going to get what he wants for his wall. We all know how angry he was with the omnibus bill, the last bill that didn't give him his wall funding. I would still be surprised if President Trump shuts down the federal government that close to an election. WALLACE: All right, panel. We have to take a break. We'll see you a little later in the program. When we come back, Michael Cohen once boasted he would take a bullet for his boss. But now, Donald Trump's former attorney and fixer is looking like his biggest enemy. The president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, joins us next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Coming up, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gets grilled on the Trump-Putin summit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ, D-NEW JERSEY: Did the president tell you that he discussed relaxing Russia sanctions or not? Yes or no? MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The president is entitled to have private meetings. WALLACE: We'll ask the Sunday panel about the criticism and prospects for another summit, coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: The confrontation between President Trump and his former fixer, Michael Cohen, continues to build. Cohen leaked a conversation with Mr. Trump he secretly taped about hush money for a Playboy model. Trump's legal team had experts review the tape for tampering and Cohen said he'll talk to special counsel Robert Mueller about the president's denial that he knew anything about that infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Joining me now, the president's lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Mayor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\". RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEAD LAWYER: Thank you, Chris. Good to be with you. WALLACE: I want to start with Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, his former fixer. Here is what you said about him a couple of months ago and the possibility that he might talk to special counsel Robert Mueller. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: I expect that he is going to cooperate with them. I don't think they'll be happy with him because he doesn't have any incriminating evidence about the president or himself. The man is an honest, honorable lawyer. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Honest, honorable lawyer, but now you say Cohen is, quote, your words, a pathological lawyer -- liar -- GIULIANI: Right. WALLACE: Pathological lawyer, a Freudian slip. A pathological liar who's been lying for years. So what happened? GIULIANI: Well, here's what happened. I mean I found out, as everyone else did, that he was surreptitiously recording his clients, which is a disbarable (ph) offense. Obviously, I -- obviously if I knew that, I would never have said he was a reputable lawyer. I'd have said he was a scoundrel. I -- I found of he not only taped lawyers, but he fully intended to deceive because he had a conversation with one of your colleagues, Chris Cuomo, in which he made up big show of putting his phone in a drawer, Cuomo's phone in a drawer, and said, we'll be off the record, no recording. He then proceeded to record two hours of that conversation. It makes him a total liar. I didn't know that. And now I've listened, unfortunately, fortunately from my client's point of view, to many, many hours of tapes and the man is a pathological manipulator, liar. I didn't know that. I didn't know him well, but I had -- I knew nothing bad about Michael Cohen until all of this started to happen in the last couple of weeks. WALLACE: Mayor, how angry is President Trump about being betrayed about -- by a man that he worked so closely with? And what does it mean, this talk now that the -- their joint defense agreement is over? What's the practical effect of that? GIULIANI: Well, first of all, the president feels disappointed. I think the anger is over. You know, we've -- we've assured him, in a very strange way, this is a very good development for us because we do have all these tapes and these tapes are -- completely demonstrating the president did nothing wrong. Cohen is on record over and over again stating his position. It would be hard for him to contradict that now. And he's done so many despicable things, his credibility is not an issue. I -- I -- the joint -- the joint offense (ph) agreement is in effect over because he's -- he's making it clear that he's going to try to hurt the president. We can't give him information. And he, obviously, isn't going to give us information. That's all that existed. WALLACE: Cohen's latest so-called revelation is that he reportedly is prepared to tell the special counsel that -- Robert Mueller, that he was witness to a conversation which President Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting that -- that Don Junior and Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort were going to meet with a Russian lawyer. And that contradicts what President Trump told the New York Times last summer. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know at the time that they had the meeting? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I didn't know anything about the meeting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you didn't -- TRUMP: It must have been a very important -- it must have been a very unimportant meeting, because I never even heard about it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Now, the president repeated this week he did not know in advance of the Trump Tower meeting. GIULIANI: Correct. He did not. WALLACE: But let's explore this for a moment. If, I repeat, if he did know, if, in fact, he did lie to the New York Times\" last summer when he said he didn't know, is there anything wrong with that? GIULIANI: Well, yes, I guess there's something wrong with it on a -- on an ethical, moral basis. Nothing -- if you got prosecuted for lying to the newspapers or the press, my God, I mean Cohen -- Cohen should go to jail for a thousand years. His tapes are filled with lies, including the most basic of all, he wasn't recording it. But, no, he didn't like to them. Cohen, I -- is a reported -- this is a leak now, so I don't -- he may change it. Cohen -- you have to pick the day to figure out the story. So Cohen said that he was present at two different meetings. He was present at a meeting with Donald Junior, Jared, a group of other people, in which they talked about the meeting two days later with the Russians. Then he said he was present at a meeting, the day of the meeting, in the president's office, in which either Donald Junior, Jared or a few people came in and told the president. Every other participant in both those meetings say it is not true. There was no such meeting in advance. There was no such interruption. If he taped everything else, why the heck didn't he tape this? It's not on tape. And he's capable, I think, unfortunately, of doctoring tapes. Hasn't done that. It would be hard to do that now since we have an expert all over it. So it's just flat-out untrue. And what -- are you surprised he's lying? I mean I would have been surprised back then, but now that I know all this about him, it seems to me his default position is to lie. He's a bad liar because he lies in contradiction to tapes and he lies in contradiction to what I just said is probably supported by anywhere from two to five witnesses. WALLACE: And is it fair to say -- I mean you have not been shy in what you've said here -- that you're at war with Michael Cohen now? GIULIANI: I don't know. I don't think we're at war with him. You know, obviously the real test here is the investigators, the Justice Department and the American public. He doesn't get to decide this case. I -- you know, I -- I should say I feel sorry for him, but nobody will believe me. He's destroyed himself, Chris, as a witness. I prosecuted, you know, 5,000 cases. I'd never prosecute a case on this guy's testimony. First of all, he talks to the press. He may be taping me. Second, he's contradicted so many times that, I mean, you began your cross examination by saying, which set of lies are you going to tell today, Michael? Let's go through them now. WALLACE: All right, let me -- let me pick up because there was another big development this week, and that was the tape that Michael Cohen secretly recorded, a tape, a conversation in 2016 that he had with Donald Trump before the election in which there was a discussion of paying money to buy the rights to the story of Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, who says -- claims that she had a relationship with Donald Trump. Here's a portion of that tape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: And I've spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up -- DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So what do we have to pay for this? COHEN: With funding. TRUMP: One fifty? COHEN: Yes. And it's all the stuff -- TRUMP: I was thinking about that. COHEN: All the stuff. Because here you never how where that company -- you never know what he's going to be -- TRUMP: Maybe he gets hit by a truck. COHEN: Correct. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: You say that Cohen violated attorney-client privilege by secretly recording a tape of his own client and then making it public, but -- but Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, came out last night and said, well, you've been talking about the tape and since you talked about the tape you have waived any attorney-client privilege. GIULIANI: Well, you've got to get the cart before the horse here. I mean the reality is they -- they leaked the tape and then we quite clearly responded, which we're allowed to do under the court order. And the New York Times reporters who got the leak have confirmed that, which is unusual for them to do that. Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt. That leak did not come from us. The court order allows us to respond without waiving any privilege. Well, it's not my privilege, it's the president's privilege. If we have to defend him. That's exactly what we were doing. And it has been very helpful to us because now we've been able to put out the whole transcripts, which contradicts several things that Lanny Davis says. He's almost as bad as Cohen. I mean he's said that Cohen didn't intend to deceive when he did these tape recordings. What is it to take a phone, put it in a drawer and tell somebody you're not recording them if it isn't an intent to deceive? I mean these people tell Quentin-like lies, lies that can be contradicted by tape recordings. WALLACE: I want to ask you about this -- it's going to seem a little off topic, but I will get -- it will -- it will become relevant, Mr. Mayor, about Brett Kavanaugh, who is President Trump's nominee now for the Supreme Court. In 1999, Kavanaugh said of the case in which the Supreme Court ordered Richard Nixon to turn over the White House tapes, quote, maybe Nixon -- the Nixon versus U.S. case -- was wrongly decided. In a 2009 article, Kavanaugh wrote this, like civil suits, criminal investigations take the presidents focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president. Question, is Judge Kavanaugh out right the law? GIULIANI: You know, I've looked at the law and I don't -- I really can't say those are legal opinions. Those are really just things he's saying. We don't see the authority. We don't see -- I mean I believe that the Constitution is clear that the president cannot be subpoenaed, or if he is subpoenaed he has a right to challenge it on the grounds that they haven't exhausted all other possibilities, that they don't have other ways to get the information. There's a case, the Espy (ph) case, closest one that you can find. He was a cabinet officer. And they said he could only be subpoenaed, in essence, taken away from his duties if there was no other way to get the information. So the president would at least have that privilege. Where he has the complete privilege and therefore can't be investigated at all, I really would have to do more research. I mean there's a good argument that that's the case. Other law review articles have said that. It does exist as the law in most countries, the head of state has immunity, until after he's out of office. But other countries it does. So that requires more analysis. WALLACE: So given the fact that that is Judge Kavanaugh's opinion and given the fact that a legal dispute between President Trump and the special counsel might end up before the Supreme Court, would it be useful to have Judge Kavanaugh be Justice Kavanaugh? GIULIANI: No, I don't know Brett very well. I just know he's a person a very high integrity. I was a law clerk to a federal judge. I argued in the Supreme Court. And I know that these off-the-cuff opinions like this, when somebody sits down and starts looking at the law as I was just doing, he may very well go in the other direction. So I wouldn't count on Kavanaugh's vote on this. This is a question of first impression. And the Trump situation is very different than the Nixon situation. So I don't think we get an edge one way or the other. I think the Supreme Court is about as straight as you're going to get in our country. And this is going to be a case that they're going to have to decide in the first instance. And it doesn't happen if they don't subpoena him. And no president has ever submitted to a subpoena. Even Clinton, who was subpoenaed, they had to withdraw it before he would testify. WALLACE: Mayor Giuliani, thank you. Thanks for sharing your weekend with us. GIULIANI: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: Please come back, sir. GIULIANI: Thank you. Thank you, sir. WALLACE: Up next, Michael Cohen gives increasing signs he's ready to cut a deal with the special counsel. What would you like to ask the panel about Cohen potentially flipping on President Trump? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: When it comes time for the financing, which will be -- DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: What's that (ph)? What financing? COHEN: We'll have to pay (INAUDIBLE) -- TRUMP: Well, we'll pay with cash. COHEN: No. No, no, no, no, I got this. No, no, no. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: A portion of the 2016 conversation between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen that Cohen secretly recorded about a potential payment for a Playboy model's story. And we're back now with the panel. Jonathan, this Trump-Cohen story is part Shakespeare, part soap opera, part Kafka. From what you hear, how angry is the president about Cohen apparently flipping and how worried is the president? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: I can't speak to his level of worry because it's not something that he would project to people that I talk to there. He might have that conversation with, you know, Melania or someone like that. His anger level is probably 12 out of 10. And if you take Rudy Giuliani as a vessel for that anger and sort of, you know, going out and calling Cohen a pathological liar, et cetera, et cetera, I mean that's a pretty good proxy. But as a -- as -- as regards how much exposure he has, the one thing I will say is, people do misconceive Michael Cohen's role in Trump world. He was this sort of off the books kind of lawyer, as you can see from that tape recording, but it's not like he had full visibility over everything. I often see it stated as fact that Cohen knows where every body is buried. Actually, he doesn't. He knows where like, you know, maybe like 20 bodies are buried. But -- but there's probably, you know, whatever -- however many more. It's really Weisselberg, the lawyer who's been with Trump for decades, who actually started working for Trump's father, Fred Trump, who's just been subpoenaed, he's the guy who really has visibility. So on the hierarchy of concern, he -- he should be much higher. WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook from Danny Thibeaux who writes, if Cohen is telling the truth, how bad could this be for President Trump? Jonah, how do you answer Danny? JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Well, it depends what the \"this\" is and what -- what Cohen is saying. I think, you know -- whether or not, you know -- as you said, when you're subbing in for \"Special Report\" this week, whether or not you lie -- lying to the New York Times is not a crime, right? But when Cohen says that Donald Trump knew about the meeting in Trump Tower, what that does is -- and also when we have this stuff about the payments, this wipes away a vast swath of the defenses at the White House and its biggest supporters have been making for a very, very long time. They can't keep saying things are fake news when the media is not even part of it, when it's a taped -- taped interview or a taped phone conversation and it -- it shrinks the circle of plausible deniability across a vast array of things. But, at the end of the day, it still depends what Mueller actually finds. And I don't know that Cohen is this -- is the silver bullet that a lot of anti-Trump people want him to be. WALLACE: Let's turn to the continued fallout from the Trump-Putin summit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified before a Senate committee this week and I think it's fair to say he got hammered about President Trump's failure to confront Putin, at least publicly at that news conference, about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB MENENDEZ, D-NJ, RANKING MEMBER, SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS: In his conversation with Putin, I hope the president laid out the consequences of interference in the 2018 election. But I know you can't tell me that. So you actually -- MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Actually, I can tell you that -- MENENDEZ: Oh, you want to share that one with me? POMPEO: I can't -- no, I can't -- MENENDEZ: That one you want to share with me? POMPEO: No, senator, I can tell you that because the president has disclosed that. MENENDEZ: OK. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: And it went downhill from there. Gillian, while the Trump team is still trying to clean up from what happened in Helsinki, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov was asked about it this week and I want to -- I don't know how you say it in Russian, but he described the Helsinki summit as, quote, \"better than super.\" So I'm not sure that's particularly helpful for President Trump when the Russians seem to be so happy with how it went. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It's not a good sign. And I think particularly on the topic of election meddling, which was the exchange we just saw back and forth there, that is still the administration's -- the weakest spot in the administration's apple because whenever you've got the secretary of state and the president disagreeing on a -- on a policy issue, it creates a major problem. I'm referring specifically to President Trump saying that he wasn't sure if he was going to take the intelligence community's assessment at face value that they -- that the Russians had interfered in the election. Pompeo said in that hearing a few moments after that exchange that the president did take the intelligence community's assessment at face value. That's a major sticking point. On the bigger issue of the Helsinki summit, he's almost having -- the president's almost having a little bit of a Barack Obama moment. Remember, in 2011, 2012, nobody wanted President Obama to be talking to the mullah's in Iran. Nobody in Congress. Nobody -- the American people didn't want this. And he wanted a deal. And he said, I'm going to do this anyway. I'm going to court Iran anyway. And I think that's what President Trump's doing now, amidst all this blowback he's saying, I want a deal with Putin, I'm doing this. WALLACE: Mo, there was a curious development on the whole Putin-Trump relationship this week because the White House, which had invited Putin to come for a summit in November, which it seemed surprisingly quick, John Bolton, the national security advisor, announced that, no, they're going to put it over until at least early next year until, as he put it, the witch hunt, by which he meant the Robert Mueller special counsel probe, is over. But then Putin announced on Friday or Saturday, he was in South Africa, that they have invited -- the Russians have invited Trump to come to Moscow and have a summit at the Kremlin. I don't know whether the sequence is that that would be before or after the Washington summit, but that just makes things even as clear as mud, doesn't it? MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE: The president invites Putin. The Russia's formal response was, ah, don't know. This might not be the best timing. So the president rescinds the invitation and then the Russians say, well, you know, you can always come to us. It's like Putin's just sitting there like a cat playing with a toy, right? He's just -- he's -- he is having the time of his life with this president of the United States. When the president -- and Gillian's point is right -- when the president is out there saying that he doesn't necessarily accept the intelligence community's assessment, and forced them to backpedal on that and say, no, I do, but then tweets within days that once again that it is a hoax, Putin is getting everything he wants out of this relationship and that is not a good thing for the United States. WALLACE: Jonathan, does the president still think, after all the blowback from Helsinki, does he still think that he can make progress with Putin? SWAN: My understanding is yes. I mean that's what I'm told by senior officials there, that he has always believed that and he still continues to believe that. He thinks that he can get a deal in Syria. I don't know what the deal looks like. Obviously, the official U.S. position is they want to get Iran as far out of Syria as possible. Whether Putin's willing to provide pressure, I think we should all be pretty skeptical about that. The one country that's actually quite happy with Trump's conversations with Putin is Israel. The Israelis are actually pretty happy with them having these discussions and they are wanting to push the Iranians as far away from their border as possible. And, of course, Bibi Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, actually has a pretty decent relationship with Putin. So, look, I think it's going to be very hard both -- because of domestic politics and, you know, the general public, but also Capitol Hill. These members are now getting pretty aggressive on Russia and wanting to sanction them further. So I think Trump's going to have a lot of trouble cutting anything that's -- WALLACE: And, Jonah, we've got less than a minute left. There was an announcement of a meeting, I think it was Friday, that the president had with the National Security Council and we were told this was a meeting about election meddling in 2018. And -- and what surprised me is to the best of my knowledge -- there may have been other meetings -- but this is the first one that they had announced. One would think that they would have done this some time ago. GOLDBERG: You would. You would. And I think that might be in part to provide some political cover because this is going to be a bigger issue and they need some more talking points to push back on it. I also think that one of the lessons of the week from the Pompeo testimony on down is that there are a bunch of very committed, serious people in the Trump administration who want to say the real policy is what we're doing, not what the president is saying. WALLACE: Well, it's interesting -- interesting times. (INAUDIBLE). Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday. Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" the remarkable woman who took these powerful pictures on the front lines. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: If you ever read the New York Times or National Geographic or Time magazine, chances are you have seen her work. As we told you last December, she takes riveting photographs that bring the savagery of the front lines into your home. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNSEY ADDARIO, PHOTOJOURNALIST: I never consider myself brave, I just consider myself very sort of committed to the story. And that takes me to places that are dangerous. WALLACE (voice over): Lynsey Addario is one of the great photojournalists of the last two decades. Just listen to where she's worked since 9/11. ADDARIO: I've covered Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Darfur, Congo, South Sudan, Somalia. WALLACE (on camera): Question. Why? ADDARIO: There are great injustices that go on in war zones and its fundamental for someone to be there to document that. WALLACE (voice over): Darfur, 2004. ADDARIO: There were skeletons across the desert. People fleeing for their lives. We witnessed villages that had been burned to the ground. WALLACE: With U.S. troops in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley in 2007. ADDARIO: I woke up, I put on my night vision, took this picture and fell back asleep. WALLACE: In Pakistan's no-man's-land tribal area with the Taliban in 2009 for a story that won the Pulitzer Prize. ADDARIO: If they invite you to their home, they will not kill you. They will protect you with their lives. So we knew that -- or we hoped that once we got there, because we had been invited, they would not kill us. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York Times says four of its journalist reporting on the conflict in Libya are now missing. WALLACE: But Addario's luck almost ran out when she and three colleagues were taken prisoner by Qaddafi's forces in 2011. ADDARIO: They were about to execute as and we're literally -- at one point I looked over and I saw each one of my colleagues literally begging for -- for their lives. And I remember, I could barely speak, and I just said, please. And at that moment a commander came over and said, you can't kill them, they're American. WALLACE: Addario and the others were beaten and held for six days, but then finally released. Two months later, she went back to work, not on the front lines, but still in Gaza and Afghanistan and Senegal. And by now she was pregnant. WALLACE (on camera): Did your family, did your friends, did you question what the heck you were doing? ADDARIO: The fact is, I was pregnant and I was surrounded by pregnant women and, oh my God, it was the most natural thing. I always feel like I'm in the wrong place. When I'm here, I want to be there. When I'm there, I want to be home. WALLACE (voice over): Addario's son, Lucas, is now six. When she comes home, he sits on her lap while she edits her pictures, sometimes of war refugees. ADDARIO: And he asks about war. And I say it's fighting and some people get killed. And he said, well, then, mommy, can't you get killed. And, to me, that's like, how do I answer that, because I can't just lie to him. And so I just say, I'll be fine. WALLACE: So why does she do it? Why has she risked her life these last two decades? Why does she keep risking her life with Lucas waiting for her back home? ADDARIO: I don't need to take pretty pictures anymore. It's not at all about the -- you know, just being there to travel and take a picture. It's really about the storytelling, about journalism, about truth, about telling people stories about making people care about things that they wouldn't necessarily care about. You know, I just keep working. I think that this, for me, is my calling and my mission and that's what I believe in. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: This fall Addario will release her first book of photography. It's called \"Of Love and War.\" And that's it for today. Have a great week.

This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 24, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and CNN's New York office, all received what appeared to be pipe bombs in the mail this morning. That news spiked a massive investigation that news sparked a massive investigation to the obvious question, who sent these explosives, and why? None of the devices exploded or harmed anyone. Details remain sparse but Fox's Trace Gallagher has been covering this story from the very beginning and joins us with the very latest. Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS: And Tucker, a law enforcement source tells us, the choice of pipe bombs and packages is unusual because there's no easy or obvious method of detonation but authorities also say that while these pipe bombs were rudimentary, they appear to be functional and at least one contained projectiles including shards of glass to inflict as much damage as possible. The FBI says, the packages were mailed in manila envelopes with computer printed address labels and they all had six forever stamps on them, those are stamps that can be used any time regardless of price changes. And all of the devices had a return address of Florida Congresswoman and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sources also tell us there is strong evidence that these attempted attacks are the work of one group or individual. Over the past two days there have been ten reports of suspicious packages, four have been ruled out, one is still being investigated and five have now been confirmed including to the Clintons, the Obamas, billionaire liberal donor George Soros, Former Attorney General Eric Holder and Former CIA Director John Brennan. Brennan's envelope was delivered to CNN and New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill says, investigators are reviewing security video to see if they can identify the courier who delivered the CNN package. Today President Trump condemned what he called acts of political violence but Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said, \"President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.\" Of course, the GOP has blamed Democrats for inciting numerous acts of violence against Republicans. The FBI, by the way, warns more packages could be out there, Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that. Well, those pipe bombs of course are one of but many examples of attempted and actual political violence we've seen over the past few years. One of the most notable was an attempted massacre at a Congressional baseball practice in the summer of 2017. Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana was gravely wounded in that shooting. In response to the pipe bomb mailings today he tweeted this quote, \"These attempted attacks that have been made are beyond criminal, they are acts of pure terror. Violence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society.\" Congressman Steve Scalise joins us. Congressman, thanks very much for coming on so what was your first reaction when you saw this news today? STEVE SCALISE, (R) U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, LOUISIANA: Well Tucker, it's anger you know, this isn't the way that we should expect America to be turning. I mean, you're seeing more and more of this and clearly, you've seen it on both sides. We all need to be calling it out. Obviously we need to find out what happened and the FBI is in the process of doing it. I feel very confident that our law enforcement officials are ultimately going to find out who did this and if it's one or multiple people, to bring them to justice and do it as swiftly as possible. CARLSON: So the President condemned these acts and was immediately rebuked by the Democratic Party for condemning the acts not quite enough, what do you make of that? SCALISE: I thought that was a mistake on their part to criticize the President, you know, I think it was important that the President did come out with this statement the way did strongly. I heard silence a lot of times when Republicans were under attack from Democrat leaders, we all should be calling this out. When a Republican or Democrat is under attack, first of all we don't even know who did it, we should be trying to find out who did it but we should be criticizing the act, whether it's a Republican or Democrat. Some people only criticize when it's a Democrat under attack and the media by the way, was under attack too and there's no place for that either. CARLSON: How do we deescalate this? Things seem to be moving in a direction that's ominous and so what do our leaders need to do in things they have control to pull us back? SCALISE: I think the most important thing is to get back to what made this country great. Our founders didn't set up some kind of system where everybody had to think the same way. In fact they challenged their government and they wanted a system where individual people can speak their views and even speak out against their government and they put the First Amendment ultimately in the Constitution to ensure that right. But the difference is, we all have you know our disagreements, you shouldn't ever make those personal and you should never think that violence is a way to settle our political differences. We settle them at the ballot box, we have an election in 13 days, that's where we settle our differences. Violence is never an answer to somebody's political disagreement with somebody else. CARLSON: And so why - it's an interesting point you make so you're saying that people feel less free to express their opinions now than they have in previous generations and that's part of the reason, things are so volatile? SCALISE: Well, you know, when somebody tries to use threats or intimidation, it's like the schoolyard bully you know. If they don't want to confront their own demons, they try to threaten you and scare you away from just living your everyday life and that's not who we are as Americans. You saw it after September 11th when our very way of life was under attack by people who had a totally different viewpoint of America and what it stands for and we came together as a country and we said, we're not going to back down. We're not going to change who we are and we shouldn't do it here either but we should be equally vigilant, Republican and Democrat, no matter who is under attack, that it's wrong for whoever did the attack. Let's find out the details, don't try to deflect blame and try to blame somebody else who had nothing to do with this, let's actually go after the people who did it, that's what we should do and coming together as Americans and again, I mean, it's not about philosophy. I'm a conservative. I have liberal friends, I have disagreements with them but I don't make it personal and none of us should make it personal, we should want to find out who did it, let's get the facts. Don't go trying to blame people that had nothing to do with this, let's all be focused on coming together and finding out who did it and bringing them to justice. CARLSON: Coming from a man who was very close to being murdered for his political beliefs, your words carry weight on that for sure. Congressman, thank you. SCALISE: Always great to be with you, Tucker. CARLSON: The massive caravan of migrants moving northward toward our border is growing exponentially, tonight. Now it's more than 14,000 people strong. No nation other than ours is trying to stop them. Why is that? Kris Kobach joins us next. And we're monitoring the Trump rally underway in Wisconsin, this evening. We'll take you there immediately live if news occurs and it may. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES: - but other people just march right in. It will not happen to us. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach says illegal immigration is a 'problem we can solve.' CARLSON: Well, the massive migrant Caravan headed for our southern border from Honduras is getting more massive by the day. Reportedly, it is 12,000 to 14,000 people. Despite the hundreds of millions of dollars that American taxpayers hand out to Central American countries and Mexico, no government in the region seems interested at all in stopping the migrants as they move toward Texas. Once they arrived in Texas cross the Rio Grande River, the group will inevitably be met by Left-wing lawyers who specialized in manipulating our dysfunctional immigration system and they're all but ensured permanent residency in this country if history is any guide and that of course, is the main reason so many of them are coming now. One of our major political parties strongly supports all of this, that's not speculation, they say it out loud often. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, SENATOR (D), CALIFORNIA: We are a country that our strength has always been that we are a tolerant country, that we are welcoming in particular of those people who have fled harm. BEN CARDIN, SENATOR (D), MARYLAND: People of Central America, many are at risk. If they qualify for asylum, we believe there should be a process in which that case can be heard in a fair manner protecting the individuals. FOX NEWS ANCHOR: What's the Democratic Party's message about the caravan? TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: We are a nation of laws and the laws that are on the books deal with issues of refugee and asylum status and our laws require that people be treated with dignity and given that process. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: A nation of laws that must be ignored. Disagree with any of that, by the way? Do you think nations need borders in order to be nations? Did you imagine that as an American citizen, you should have some voice on who comes into our country? The cable news geniuses have a message for you. Shut up, racist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICK WILSON, GOP STRATEGIST: It gets Trump's nativist base very, very excited every day and they look at these people as less than human. They believe that those folks are less than human and they believe that they don't deserve asylum. They believe that you know, the kids in cages was a net benefit for this country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Donald Trump wants you to know that he hates the same people you hate, if you hate Muslims, if you hate black people, if you hate anyone who lives South of the Rio Grande. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Rick Wilson, for the record, maybe the dumbest person ever to appear on television. Kris Kobach meanwhile, is a Republican, he's running for Governor of Kansas, he does believe in borders and he joins us tonight. So thanks very much for coming on. I think most people when thinking about immigration, have thought in terms of barriers. How do you strengthen the border? But this appears to be this caravan, a perfect example of what's actually happening, which is people who have no right to be here leveraging our legal system against us. Something that border walls can't stop. KRIS KOBACH, GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, KANSAS: That's exactly right, Tucker. You know, what I think they're attempting to do is, they - you're right as you said in the intro, they're going to be met by all kinds of liberal lawyers and they're going to try to claim asylum and the thing is they have no basis whatsoever for claiming asylum. They do not face persecution by the government in their home countries which is the essence of asylum but because they under our laws, at least get a hearing, a credible fear hearing and we don't have enough detention beds to detain 14,000 people while they get those hearings, many of them probably will be let go with a slip saying please come back on such-and- such a day. And they won't come back or they may try to come back and try to fake it through the hearing but it is absurd how they are abusing our asylum system, abusing our laws and they are aided and abetted by the American Left. CARLSON: Well, so it's a little disingenuous because they can't be held because then it would be you're holding human beings in pens like animals, you racist. They can't be returned to New Mexico because they're not Mexican nationals, they're from Central America and so we don't have a choice under the rules written by the people complaining, that we're inhumane to do anything but let them free. And so basically they're subverting our law with the assistance of people who solemn-faced are telling us, we just want to obey the law. I mean, it's like Orwellian. KOBACH: Yes, it is Orwellian and you know, you mentioned earlier the Democrats, how they're talking about this. Let's just think about this, in the ninetieth - this is like the third stage of open border psychosis. In the 90s the Democrats wanted to enforce the law. Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform Act which is all about enforcement. Then in the 2000s, they were like OK, now we want amnesty, we're not for enforcing the law, we want amnesty. But now in 2018 they're going beyond that and they're saying we want to bring in more illegal aliens, we're not content with the millions here already. We're for bringing people in from outside of the country who have no basis for coming to the United States. CARLSON: At some point doesn't this raise questions about what democracy is. I mean, if every poll for 50 years demonstrates that most Americans of both parties want real borders. They want to have a say in who comes and lives here and benefits from our society and consistently, they have no voice at all, then what do you start to wonder about democracy? Maybe it's fake. KOBACH: You know, the it's quite clear that the political Left in America is not listening to what the people are saying and you're absolutely right, the polls constantly show that Americans don't want to be giving tax payer benefits to illegal aliens. They don't want Sanctuary cities. We have been rewarding illegal immigration against the will of the American people for too long. This is a problem, we can solve. If you want to stop illegal immigration, stop rewarding illegal immigration, that's one of the most important reasons why I'm running for Governor in Kansas. But the political Left doesn't want to do that. CARLSON: And if you want to keep people tolerant and pro-immigrant, then let them decide who gets to come here and what they're doing is making people who are basically for immigration, anti-immigration because it's so unreasonable that reasonable people are getting disgusted. I mean that's - it's - Kris Kobach, thank you for being a consistent and clear voice on this issue, I appreciate it. KOBACH: My pleasure, thank you. CARLSON: Immigration of course, was one of the decisive issues and maybe the decisive issue in the last Presidential election. What does the caravan mean if anything for the 2018 midterms, thirteen days from now? Dana Perino hosts the Daily Briefing, she served as press Secretary for President George W. Bush. She's seen this topic emerge and evolve and she thinks deeply about all this stuff, all the time and she joins us now. So does this Dana, I mean, I can't exactly tell where this is going or maybe Republicans are overstating its effect or understating, I mean, what effect is this going to have, do you think? DANA PERINO, HOST, THE DAILY BRIEFING: Well, it's possible that Republicans are overstating this issue and understating health care but the truth, that could also be said for Democrats. That they're overstating healthcare and under reporting on immigration. Look, I think for - if you just look at the Senate, the red state Democrats that are running for a re-election, this is not good news for them. Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly in particular, Missouri in Indiana, these are states that President Trump won by over 20 points. Immigration was one of their number one issues for those voters so this issue being talked about in the last two weeks before the midterm election, which is very close anyway, that's probably not good news for them. Conventional wisdom in Washington DC would say that it's not good for Republicans to talk about immigration in the way that you and Kris Kobach were just talking about. However, look at some of the purple states, Dean Heller in Nevada, the incumbent there, the most vulnerable Senate Republican running for re- election, he has opened up a six-point lead in Nevada. Martha McSally in Arizona now has a lead over her opponent there. So the Democrats really want to focus on and talk about health care and they could be right. On election night, I think that could be the main reason that people come out to vote but this immigration issue with all of these visuals, it's not like it isn't happening. Getting the word out, Republicans getting the word out could have a difference in these - some of these coin-flip districts as well. CARLSON: I've always thought that Republicans lied to themselves with the popularity of universal healthcare, people actually want their healthcare taken care of, whether they should or not. But if you're taking that position which is the Democratic position, how do you square that with your immigration views? Letting in tens of millions or more people who also get that healthcare, doesn't that dilute the promise of the government, I mean how could you make that? PERINO: Well, they don't - that's not of their concern, that is something that Republicans ought to worry about later on and then they try to fix it and then they're the mean ones that have to deal with it. I was also thinking about in another way because you talked about reasonable people on immigration, I'd like to say that you know, I would - most people will say, she's probably one of them. I have a real soft spot for refugees, the refugees who are being persecuted by their governments, hounded by their governments. Basically treated terribly, sometimes kidnapped, sometimes targeted for murder, for their political beliefs, that is not what's happening here. CARLSON: No. PERINO: The best way to deal with economic migrants is actually practice capitalism in those countries. That is what's made this country strong. I'm for helping them in way but I feel like Democrats are missing the picture. I would like to have more refugees, actual refugees be allowed into this country but if you allow economic migrants into the country and they take up those spaces, you're actually hurting the very ideals that we're country was founded on. CARLSON: This level of lying is making us all cynical, including me. I'm trying to fight it but it's having-- PERINO: You're never cynical. CARLSON: Yes, I'm trying. Dana, it's great to see you and thank you for your measured and thoughtful analysis as always. PERINO: See you soon. CARLSON: Several Russia investigations have failed so far to prove that Trump got elected because of Putin but the Democrats are promising to launch another investigation if they retake Congress. Alan Dershowitz does not think that's a particularly good plan, he's here next to explain why. We're also monitoring the President's rally in Wisconsin for news, there may be some. If there is, we'll bring it to you immediately. Here's what the President just said about today's bomb scares across the country. Watch. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself. No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion or control. We all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted. We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it. We can do it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: After two full years and several separate investigations have so far failed to prove that Russia 'hacked our election.' Democrats are pledging still another Russia probe if they retake the House of Representatives. But that's not their only goal. The vast majority of Democratic voters according to opinion polling say, they want the Democrats to impeach the President, if they retake the Congress. Alan Dershowitz is an emeritus professor at Harvard Law School and the author of the case against impeaching Trump and he joins us tonight. Professor, do you think that we need another Russia probe? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, EMERITUS LAW PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: No, I don't think we do. I think, we'll learn a lot from the report that Mueller will release. If we did need a probe, it should be a nonpartisan 9/11 type of objective probe. The last thing we need is a partisan probe that's - whose purpose it is to demonize the other party and to try to gain partisan advantage. That's not what the American public needs and I think the Democrats will shoot themselves in the foot if they fritter away their power as a check- and-balance if they do regain the house by looking to the past instead of looking to the future. CARLSON: So that kind of is the question actually, do you get partisan advantage even by talking about Russia? Well, presumably if you're a Democrat, there's lots of things you disagree with that Trump believes, why not argue about those, why still Russia? DERSHOWITZ: It's ridiculous I think and I do think that in the end, they would get short term partisan advantage but in the end, I think, the long term disadvantages would be obvious. We saw that happen when Clinton, Bill Clinton was impeached, it turned a very negative on the Republicans. And I think, even those who participated in the impeachment now regret that and I think that the Democrats should learn the lesson. If they are fortunate enough to regain the House, they should use that as a way of checking and balancing and exercising their constitutional authority. Trying to work with the Republicans and come up with some compromise programs that won't satisfy anybody 100% but that's the nature of a divided government. You come up with compromises. Think back to the days you know, when Ted Kennedy would work so closely with McCain and others. I think we need to see that happening again and if the Democrats regain control and they're smart, they will try to reach out to moderate Republicans and try to come up with some programs that help the American public rather than just achieve short-term partisan results. CARLSON: The impeachment talk strikes me as strange. I mean, you're the constitutional scholar here, obviously. But my understanding is you need three quarters of the Senate to vote for conviction in order to remove a President with impeachment. That's not going to happen so given that it's not going to happen why are they considering it? DERSHOWITZ: Well, for the same reason that they consider it with Bill Clinton, the House could conceivably get a majority to impeach, it's very easy to impeach. It's not easy to impeach constitutionally but the House can act unconstitutionally. Maxine Waters has already said the criteria for impeachment is anything the House wants, she wants to impeach not only President Trump but Vice President Pence as well. It would just be a show trial and they might get enough votes, I don't think they will. I think there'd be enough sensible Democrats to understand that this would not be a positive thing for the Democratic Party. Certainly the leading up to 2020 and as soon as the midterms are over, 2020 begins and I think it would be a way of frittering away the advantage the Democrats have gotten by taking over the House. And also even the talk of it now hurts their chances of winning the House. I don't think Americans want to vote for an impeachment, I don't think they want to vote for more investigations of Russia. I think they want to vote for candidates who will move the country forward. CARLSON: And you see it in the polling even, the Democrats who are doing unexpectedly well are talking about health insurance you know, healthcare questions you know, actual economic matters. This is an obvious nonpartisan point that you're making, I'm agreeing with you. Why is it not obvious to Democratic leaders? DERSHOWITZ: Well, I think it is obvious to some Democratic leaders, the problem is the leaders today don't have control over the party because the successes have come from young radicals who are winning small elections in obscure places that don't represent what Americans really think. I think most Americans are centrists and the movement to the Left of the Democratic Party does not represent the mainstream of the Democratic Party and I would hope the leaders would recognize that. The same thing is true of Republicans. The extreme, extreme Right wing which is winning in a few places doesn't represent the core of the Republican Party. I think the Americans benefit when both parties move to the middle, when there are great debates between conservatives and liberals, that's the where the debate should happen, instead of screaming matches between the radicals on the Left and the radicals on the Right. That's not the America that made us great. CARLSON: Professor Alan Dershowitz, great to see you tonight, thank you for that. DERSHOWITZ: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, before the recent re-emergence of identity politics in this country, candidates were typically held to account if they were say, caught taking bribes or burning flags not so much anymore. Two prominent Democrats, both accused of those things that are still polling at the same level or better than they were previously. That's because identity politics has shifted the burden for politicians rather than campaigning on results and substance and issues and ideas, they seem to make appeals to what you look like, who your ancestors were. That's a topic that's addressed in great detail in a new book called Ship of fools available for purchase on tuckercarlson.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) A California court orders the eviction of Michael Avenatti's law firm from its offices for skipping four months of rent. CARLSON: Well, the creepy porn lawyer certainly has lived a glamorous life it turns out. During the few waking moments, he hasn't spent on cable television, he has raced cars with a Saudi prince, he's flown private to visit 5-star hotels in the French Riviera. He once owned a seven-million-dollar home in Southern California. It's good being the creepy porn lawyer but with a first name like Creepy, it's no surprise that Mr. Porn lawyer financed that lifestyle in part by simply refusing to pay the money he owed other people. According to an extensive and fascinating report in The Daily Beast, CPL and his businesses have millions of dollars in unpaid state and federal taxes. Earlier this year creepy porn lawyer's law firm was ordered to pay $10 million dollars to a former partner whom he apparently stiffed on profits from the firm. The firm did not pay up so today the creepy porn lawyer was hit with the personal judgment of $4.8 million dollars. Not even the creepy porn lawyer's landlords are getting a cut of that though. In a court in Santa Ana California convicted his law firm, evicted rather the law firm from its offices for simply skipping four months of rent. Nobody from the firm even bothered to show up at the hearing, maybe that would have been different if the hearing had been held inside a CNN news studio. Well, rising stars of the Democratic Party have been the subject of seemingly endless fawning media coverage. When we say fawning we mean fawning treacly. Now two candidates running in competitive races in Florida and in Georgia are consumed with pretty serious scandals, that's something you probably didn't read about in the latest gushing magazine profile of them. We'll bring you up to date anyway. Consider first, the case of Andrew Gilliam, he's the socialist Democrat running for Governor of Florida. He was the mayor of Tallahassee. He was confronted about free gifts he received while he was Mayor during a debate, last night in Florida. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, (R) U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, FLORIDA: You went to a Broadway show with an undercover FBI agent, you went to Costa Rica with the same lobbyist and guess what happened? The lobbyists that wined and dined Andrew, they got a $2 million grant. ANDREW GILLUM, (D) U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, FLORIDA: My wife and I take vacations and we pay for our own vacations. I didn't get anything in life for free. DESANTIS: Did you pay for Hamilton? GILLUM: Then he ought to check himself. DESANTIS: Well, Andrew, did you pay for the trip? GILLUM: You took your time, I will take mine. DESANTIS: Because you won't answer the question. GILLUM: I will take mine. DESANTIS: The question is did you pay for the Hamilton ticket or did the undercover FBI agent pay for the Hamilton ticket? Did you pay to stay in the villa in Costa Rica, where are the receipts. You have not proven that you paid for anything and that's the problem. GILLUM: So here's the direct answer. I don't take free trips from anybody. I'm a hardworking person I know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do but I worked hard for everything that I've gotten. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Your description of what people like me do. OK, but what about the undercover FBI agent and did he give you free tickets to Hamilton or didn't he? Well, Gilliam explained that asking questions about FBI bribery investigations is needless to say you know, the answer racism. Many Florida voters seem to agree with that, they're at least unbothered by the corruption allegations. Gilliam leads tonight by nearly six points in the Real Clear Politics polling averages. Meanwhile in Georgia and the governor's race there, another Democratic all- star Stacey Abrams admits to burning the U.S. flag - the flag of the state of Georgia. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACEY ABRAMS, (D) U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, GEORGIA: 26 years ago as a college freshman, I along with many other Georgians including the Governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial divisiveness that was embedded in the state flag with that Confederate symbol. I took an action of peaceful protest. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So you didn't like the flag, just burn it. Well in the current era of political harassment, it should be no surprise that Democrats like Abrams are unashamed of their radical past. She openly admits she once opposed among other things free markets. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABRAMS: We can educate bold and ambitious children but our fundamental responsibility is to take care of the least of these. Especially the least of these are working families who only want a little bit of access to healthcare. And I'm sick and tired of hearing about the free market being the solution to this problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Well, there was a time like about 25 minutes ago, that burning flags and attacking markets would be enough to sink a candidate in Georgia but not this year. Two years of anti-Trump fever on the Left has encouraged increasing radicalism in the candidates and that's why Abrams seems OK even with illegal immigrant voters. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABRAMS: Blue wave is African-American. It's White, it's Latino, it's Asian- Pacific islander, it is law enforcement, it is veteran, it is made up of those who have been told that they are not worthy of being here. It comprises of those who are documented and undocumented. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So the undocumented are now participating in our elections. Federal crime, whatever. Lisa Boothe is a senior fellow at Independent Women's Voice and she joins us tonight. LISA BOOTHE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: Hi Tucker. CARLSON: Thanks Lisa for coming on so the Gilliam race seems interesting, especially interesting because there's this addition of apparently an FBI corruption investigation in the middle of it. Is that - what is that, exactly? BOOTHE: Well, there's actually two investigations so there's a State investigation into some trips that Andrew Gilliam took and then there's also this FBI investigation. But the reason why all this has come into the fold in the media as of late, is there's this document dump of about a hundred and fifty pages basically showing that Andrew Gilliam has been lying about accepting these a Broadway tickets to Hamilton which he had accepted from an undercover FBI agent. And that's what these documents demonstrate is that he did knowingly take this ticket from a guy named Mike Miller who was the undercover agent, who he thought was you know, a business guy who was looking to do a deal with his city, when he was Mayor. So that's what we know now and then we also-- CARLSON: OK but wait, I just want to point out just to warn our viewers that Andrew Gillum has explained it's racist to bring that up. BOOTHE: Well, right and if you would look at our very you know storied history in the country of people of all different races coming under fire and investigations for corruption you know, it knows - corruption knows no race here. So I think this is sort of an excuse he's trying to use and look he's - with the big problem with the FBI investigation if he's saying that he's not a target but we honestly don't really know that and if you look at one of his close friends, this long-time lobbyist Corey Adam. He is at the centre of the FBI investigation and so is one of his businesses or a couple of his businesses and one of them which at our - Gilliam was on the City Commission that you know voted to approve the deal. CARLSON: So one of the reasons that we're all so upset here in Washington about Russia hacking our election is that foreign nationals aren't supposed to be influencing our political process. Period. It's actually against the law at a federal level. Stacey Abrams is saying she wants undocumented as part of this process. Has she explained what she meant? Does anyone care? BOOTHE: Well, the problem is, I mean, look Democrats keep trying to say that they're not the party of open borders but all you have to do is go back to you know, a speech that was released with WikiLeaks with Hillary Clinton in 2013, talking about her desire for open borders. You have people like Keith Ellison walking around with shirts saying that he supports open borders so it would not be a surprise that this is sort of the you know - would not be a surprise that Stacey Abrams would be trying to say something like this. CARLSON: Yes, it's just there's a difference between saying open the borders and then saying that people here illegally should be playing a role in our political process, that's reserved for citizens, I thought. BOOTHE: It is Tucker, but also remember the fact that Hillary Clinton gave a voice to undocumented illegal immigrants during the DNC convention so does it really surprise you that much? CARLSON: No, it doesn't at all and that's where this has always been going, of course. You're absolutely right but it's still surprising. Anyway. Lisa Boothe, thank you for those updates, we appreciate them every time. BOOTHE: Thanks Tucker. CARLSON: Well most of the news is bad news as you know, it's the first thing we thought we saw in the newspaper this morning. That's why we're so grateful that Mike Rowe here because he says we are overlooking a lot of good news and he's here to talk about what that news is and that's next. Plus, we're monitoring the Trump rally in the state of Wisconsin, we'll take you there live. If news occurs, good or bad, stay tuned. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) Americans are more united and altruistic than the media is reporting, says Mike Rowe, former host of 'Dirty Jobs.' CARLSON: Well, if you spent the day marinating in news as we do, you probably concluded that it's over. The economy is tanking, the country's disintegrating, the sky is falling but we know that's not true and so there's one man we could think of to remind us of the upside of America. Man who knows his country very well. Former Dirty Jobs hoes Mike Rowe and he joins us tonight. Mike, we sent out a distress call to you this morning, we broke the glass in case of emergency literally on our call. We got to get Mike Rowe to remind us what's so great about this country we share. MIKE ROWE, TV AND PODCAST HOST: Dogs and cats living together. What's going to become of this? Your producer's hysterical. Kelly sent me the email. She was like, we're just - do you have any good news going on in your life? I'm like, what are you talking about? She said, anything. CARLSON: Yes, I knew you would. ROWE: Like what do you got? CARLSON: Exactly. ROWE: I'm like, well, you know, I got this show called 'Returning the Favor' that has absolutely steeped me in bloody do-gooderism for the last year and a half. I spend my weeks, now I'm not kidding you, I know you know this but I'm literally - I fly all around the country, meeting people who are slightly better than you and me, figuring out what makes them tick, giving them a surprise to allow them to continue doing whatever altruistic thing they've been doing, that makes me feel small and then look huge. And they cry and we laugh and then I go to the next place and it's the feel-good hit of the summer. It's got 300 million views and it's so - it's warped me so badly and turned me into such an absurd Pollyanna that I literally have to come home and put on cable news in order to feel regular again. It's completely backwards for me. CARLSON: So it just sounds like the greatest job ever and the greatest show ever so what have you learned about Americans in doing it? ROWE: Same thing I learned on Dirty Jobs, we - look, fundamentally we're still united more than we're divided, you're not going to find it in your newsfeed and you're not going to find it on cable unfortunately. But work you know, the work that we do, the stuff we do for money, you know Dirty Jobs is still on it's been out 15 years, never once do you hear the words Republican, Democrat, ISIS, riot. You might hear hurricane if we're down doing a clean-up or something but nobody talks about any of that stuff in real life and on 'Returning the Favor,' it's the same thing. Oh my God, that's my baby picture, that's so weird. We essentially highlight decency the same way we used to highlight work. It was really just an experiment. We wanted to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the country still was full of people who woke up and went out to make their community a better place. And now my newsfeed, I'm not kidding it is literally overrun with people saying you got to meet my brother, my uncle, my cousin, my sister, my mom, you got to meet my neighbor, wait till you see what they do. So look, for what it's worth, we're going to be OK and if we had social media back in the day, I mean pick your favorite century. If we were reporting on the state of things today, the way they existed once upon a time, it'd be enough to depress a hyena. Are you kidding me? We're living - this is the absolute best time to be alive ever. Any food you want can be delivered to your door, you can fly across the country in a steel tube, any song you want, all the information in the world is right here, it's accessible. It's not as bad as you think. CARLSON: So the one question I have and the one worry that I have is related to it. I've always loved about America that Americans are kind to strangers. Are they still? ROWE: Yes, yes, they are but it's not news, it's not headline news you know, man holds door for women weighed down with bags. That - no. Look, manners is maybe back on its heels a little bit. I mean, I don't know why people don't stand anymore when women walk in the room but these are little things. Fundamentally, fundamentally, I don't think - I think we're the same basic species, we've always been. Look, just 20 minutes ago, I narrated the foreword to my mom's book, my mom at 80 years of age has written a book about optimism and it's literally flying off the shelves. I'm so proud of her because two weeks ago on Barnes & Noble, 'Fear,' Bob Woodward's book was number one. She actually eclipsed it for a couple of hours. For a couple of hours hope trumped fear. CARLSON: I know that feeling. Mike Rowe, you have cheered us up as always as we knew you would and we're grateful for it. ROWE: I'm here to help Tucker. CARLSON: Whenever you get bored, please come back on because we need it, thank you. ROWE: I'm going to bring my mother, next time and you're going to love her, I promise. CARLSON: Done. I can't wait, thanks man, see you and now back to the rest of the news. Breaking news on those pipe bombs mailed across the country, we'll bring you the latest when we return. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Packages that apparently contained pipe bombs were delivered to the Clintons and the Obamas this morning; a separate package was sent to CNN. The Federalist Mollie Hemingway has been following the story since the beginning and she joins us tonight. So, Mollie, we've been keeping coverage of the story, and a lot of us are losing track of what we know and what we don't know. So please bring us up to speed on it. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Well, I sure think most of us don't really have any information at all. We know that there were packages that were sent to people and we know that they had devices that appeared to look like bombs, and that's about all we know. CARLSON: Right. HEMINGWAY: And so, it's been interesting that there's been so much discussion of what this means and the significance and the motivation. CARLSON: Right. HEMINGWAY: And we actually don't have any information about that at all except knowing who they were sent to thus far. CARLSON: So the application was, on the other channels I was watching this afternoon, that the President sent these. HEMINGWAY: Yes. CARLSON: We don't know that is what you're saying. HEMINGWAY: Yes, there has been a lot of blame being placed literally on President Trump and with no reason, literally no reason. We do not know who did this, if it was an individual or group of individuals. We don't know their political motivations other than that their targets were these Democrats, but we don't know what the meaning was behind the targeting of these people. We don't even know if it was an American citizen-- CARLSON: Right. HEMINGWAY: --or a rogue actor from a different country. So we need to find out who was involved and if it was an individual or it was group of individuals and what they were trying to accomplish, and that would be good to do before we place blame. CARLSON: It would seem that way, because - here's what we know, the packages were threatening, whether they posed actual threat or not we are not sure. HEMINGWAY: Right. They were made to appear as bombs, but they were not. CARLSON: They were sent to Democrats exclusively, as at this point it seems that way. But to assign blame when we don't know who's to blame is corrosive, is it not? HEMINGWAY: I think it's wrong always to assign blame for -- people are responsible for their own actions. And even if other people have done things that they find insightful, people are responsible for their own actions. There's no consistency on this though. A couple of weeks ago, when ricin was sent to the Pentagon and The White House, I don't think CNN said we did it, you know, we did it because we attack Trump all day every day, and they shouldn't have because they weren't responsible. CARLSON: So they didn't do it. HEMINGWAY: The individual who did it was responsible. CARLSON: Thank you for -- Steve Scalise said that (inaudible). Mollie, thank you. We have got Fox News alert for you, a postal facility in south Los Angeles has been evacuated tonight. Workers discovered suspicious package addressed to Congressman Maxine Waters. KTTV Fox Los Angeles Bill Melugin joins us from outside that complex. Bill, what do you know? BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX 11 LOS ANGELES: Yes, Tucker, good evening. What we know is very limited so far, but what I can tell you is that earlier this afternoon, our newsroom got some phone calls from employees here at this postal facility telling us they were being evacuated because of a suspicious package that was found here that was addressed to Maxine Waters. Now, let me give you a live look at the scene right here. LAPD's bomb squad is on scene right here. We understand they have the robot out, and from people watching our chopper cam, I understand some of the bomb technicians have gone inside to take X-rays of this device, which is still inside of the building. Now, we've been talking to some of these employees leaving the facility. Some of them are very confused about what's going on here. Some of them are telling us they weren't evacuated. Others telling us they were. But they all know that this package did in fact have Maxine Waters name on it. One telling us that she believes that the package had very similar markings and ID stuff on it, just like the other packages that were found throughout the day. Now, this would be the second package found today addressed to Maxine Waters. This would be, if it's confirmed that it is some sort of explosive device, this would be I believe the seventh bomb. So right now, LAPD's bomb tech's on scene here investigating. Again, a second package addressed to Maxine Waters here in South LA. We will send it back to you guys. CARLSON: Bill, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Our hour is over. We'll be back tomorrow at 8:00, we are the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Good night from Washington.

            "article_content": "GOP pollster Justin Wallin discusses the races to keep an eye on. Primaries Tuesday showed the power of President Trump\u2019s endorsements continued to help Republican candidates triumph, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., lost a key lieutenant \u2013 Rep. Joe Crowley \u2013 in a New York City race that suggests internal divisions among Democrats are more serious than people might think. In addition, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who lost to President Obama, staged a political comeback by easily winning the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Utah held by the retiring Republican Orrin Hatch. Romney seems headed for victory in November in the heavily Republican state. Democratic divisions between the leftist insurgents who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his unsuccessful campaign against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 make it less likely that a big, blue wave is coming that will sweep Democrats to majority control in the House and Senate. The insurgents have the potential to change the Democratic Party over the long term into something more in line with left-leaning parties in Europe, rather than continuing to remain within the uniquely American spectrum where both parties agree to one degree or another that market forces should continue to play a role in setting economic policy. President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers are holding steady somewhere in the mid-40s. The percentage of voters who feel the country is on the right track is now up near 40 percent \u2013 double where it was at the beginning of the year. The only way this feels like it\u2019s a \u201cchange election\u201d is on the Democratic side, where younger voters and women seemed determined to \u201cBernie-fy\u201d the party and have it stand for such things as rolling back the Trump tax cuts, free college for all, Medicare for all and \u2013 in essence \u2013 a transformation of the United States into a full-blown version of a European-style welfare state. That pitch might work in the big cities, which seem to be the only power base the party of the Clintons and Obama has left. But it\u2019s not clear that voters in the suburbs and rural areas will vote for candidates on the far left. And, thanks to the recent outburst from liberal entertainers and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters \u2013 who has urged those on the left to harass Trump administration officials wherever they might be found \u2013 the Democrats may be in the process of losing whatever advantage they might have had on the civility question. That might actually be one place where President Trump is truly vulnerable. In New York City, voters in 56-year-old Democratic Rep. Crowley\u2019s Queens congressional district tossed him out in favor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former Bernie Sanders organizer. Ocasio-Cortez represents both a generational and ideological shift in one of the city\u2019s more moderate boroughs. The defeat of Crowley, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a potential successor to Pelosi, suggests the divisions between the older liberals currently running the party and young insurgents who transferred their allegiance from President Obama to Bernie Sanders in 2016 may be deeper and more permanent that many analysts believed. That spells bad news for Democrats in the November election. In addition to the surprise defeat of Crowley in New York, a closely watched race in the state saw the winner of a House Republican primary on New York City\u2019s Staten Island helped by an endorsement from President Trump. Rep. Dan Donovan, who had the president\u2019s backing, defeated former GOP Rep. Michael Grimm. Grimm\u2019s campaign \u2013 claiming his conviction on tax fraud charges that forced his resignation from Congress was the result of a kind of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy \u2013 proved unpersuasive. In New York\u2019s 24th Congressional District near Syracuse, Democrats nominated Syracuse University Professor Dana Balter as their candidate against Republican Rep. John Katko. While New York Republicans are thought to be an endangered species, Katko \u2013 who won re-election to second term in 2016 with 61 percent of the vote \u2013 is the only one occupying a district carried by Hillary Clinton in the presidential electioni. In other primary results: UTAH Romney\u2019s nomination is interesting, as pundits \u2013 at least those on the GOP side \u2013 say he\u2019s running to become the voice of opposition to Trump from within the party. That would mean taking over the role now played by Arizona Republican Senators Jeff Flake, who is retiring after a single term, and John McCain, who battling brain cancer. Even if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s a dubious proposition. Romney was never as intrinsically popular among Republicans who supported him as Trump is among his supporters. Any love the Republican rank and file felt for Romney was based on his winning the nomination to go up against President Obama, whom Republicans greatly desired to see beaten. The former Massachusetts governor may think he has some kind of moral authority that can act as a temporizer to President Trump\u2019s excesses, but that\u2019s only if his audience is the New York Times, CNN and the rich elites who accepted him as one of their own in a way they will never accept Trump. SOUTH CAROLINA Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who was endorsed by President Trump, turned back a challenge from businessman and first-time candidate John Warren to win the GOP nomination for governor in a runoff. McMaster \u2013 who was lieutenant governor until he replaced Gov. Nikki Haley when she became America\u2019s U.N. ambassador \u2013 was one of the first statewide elected officials anywhere in America to endorse Donald Trump for president. The president repaid the favor by traveling to the state for a last-minute \u201cget out the vote\u201d rally for McMaster Monday night. MARYLAND In Maryland, former NAACP President Ben Jealous defeated Prince George\u2019s County Executive Rushern Baker and will face GOP Gov. Larry Hogan in the fall. Jealous promised to run a Sanders-like campaign against the popular Hogan, who the polls indicate is an early favorite for re-election. This makes him something of a rarity in the heavily Democratic state. In the contest for U.S. Senate in Maryland, incumbent Democrat Ben Cardin easily won re-nomination against six opponents, including Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army solider convicted of leaking sensitive information and later pardoned by President Obama after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence. MISSISSIPPI In Mississippi, Democrat David Baria emerged from the runoff as the winner for the right to take on Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in the November election in something akin to a quixotic challenge. In the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Republican Michael Guest defeated Whit Hughes in the runoff for the seat held by retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Greg Harper. COLORADO In Colorado, progressive Democratic multi-millionaire Jared Polis and Republican Walker Stapleton, a member of the Bush political dynasty, will face off against one another in the race for governor. In the race for Polis\u2019 open congressional seat the Democrats nominated attorney Joe Neguse, whose campaign relied heavily on his life story \u2013 he is the son of African refugees \u2013 to make a personal connection with voters. In the state\u2019s 6th Congressional District, conservative GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn beat back four challengers to win renomination for a seventh term representing the residents of Colorado Springs and its environs. OKLAHOMA In Oklahoma, Republican former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett and former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson emerged from a multi-candidate field to win their respective party nominations for governor. In the heavily Republican 1st Congressional District in Tulsa, the GOP\u2019s Tim Harris won the nomination in the race to follow former Rep. Jim Bridenstine, now the NASA administrator, into Congress. Overall, the primaries Tuesday saw few surprises \u2013 with the exception of Crowley\u2019s stunning upset \u2013 and saw no clear trends emerging save for the continued popularity of President Trump among Republicans in Republican areas.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" October 29, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE CO-HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Brian Kilmeade, Dana Perino. \"The Five.\"\u00a0\nWell, that didn't take long.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, D\u2014CALIF.: No one sets the tone more than the president of the United States. And the tone that he sets is one of division, often one of hatred.\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: This has now become a struggle about good versus evil, and the president of the United States is evil.\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: This man was -- flames of his hatred were fanned by a president who kept talking about this caravan of refugees as if they were terrorists.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So as they blame Trump's words for violence, do they realize they're excusing the violent acts themselves? While, offering a case for leniency for the actual perks. If the actions of evildoers are out of their own control and nothing else could have led to the violence, then how can you even begin to punish these creeps? It's wrong. Meanwhile, for both the bomber and the shooter, President Trump, Mr. Law and Order, pushes the death penalty. There is no ambiguity there. He places the blame firmly on the dirt bags. And like most Republicans seeks out the stiffest penalty, literally, the stiffest. This contradicts the media who see Trump as a hateful ringleader who sympathizes with such cretins. Speaking of those suspects, they were total losers. Failures in life who placed their rage on others and anyone with an opinion could provide a trigger because words can influence. It's why there's advertising. But that's a scary path to take especially for Hollywood, rap stars, and video game makers, or even people paid to speak carefully and thoughtfully.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN: The president of the United States is racist.\u00a0\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: Even Albert Einstein may have ended up in a Nazi concentration camp with Donald Trump's viewpoint on immigration.\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: If you vote for Trump, you, the voter, you and Donald Trump are standing at the border, like Nazis, going, you here, you here.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So you want hate? You spend two years calling a guy Hitler, a racist, a traitor, and insane, and then you blame for violence because of nicknames? No lectures from you, kids. But even more, to cite words as the cause eliminates the suspect's entire history, and the slew of variables that brought him to commit his crime. It makes no sense legally or morally, but politically, I guess that's another story. After all, why let a crisis go to waste? Except that he'll make another one far worse.\u00a0\nAll right, Lisa, we didn't waste any time. I mean, I guess we saw it coming that they would pin the blame on Trump.\u00a0\nLISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, actually, if you've been paying any attention to the media over -- since President Trump even announced. But, look, there's obviously a complete double standard in the media. We know this. When something happens to Republicans, the media and the left say that we need to have stability on both sides. When something happens and it's directed at Democrats it is purely Republican and President Trump's fault. But it's also just intellectually dishonest because if you look at the mail bombing suspect, this guy has a rap sheet going back to 1991. He made a bombing -- terrorist threat in 2002. And then, if you look at the synagogue shooting, this guy hated President Trump because he didn't think he was an anti-Semite. So if you actually look at the facts it doesn't drive the narrative that the media's driving, but the only reason they do it is because the midterms are around the corner and they want to hurt President Trump.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Juan, can I play Sarah Sanders responding to a reporter about the whole mess? Go.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: Why is he out there when he says he's trying to unite the country? Why is he out there?\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The very first thing that the president did was condemn the attacks both in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs. The very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts. You can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime. He's delivered on the promises he's made. And if anything, I think it is sad and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media, 90 percent of what comes out of the media's mouth is negative about this president.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So, Juan, my question to you is, I think you can hold two opinions that Trump's discourse you will say is divisive, and I can say that, that because he's pugnacious, so you know it's divisive. But also, mass killers are responsible for their actions alone. Don't you think that tying that together and putting it on him is politically opportunistic? I lead you with the answer.\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE CO-HOST: No, but I want to engage you seriously because I think this is a serious topic. But I think that you're right, they're two thoughts and they can be held simultaneously.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: In other words that, in fact, you have to hold the culprit responsible for his individual actions. It's also the case that the president engages in divisive speech. And that's the problem here. I think he's upped the ante in terms of divisive speech. So part of it, and what I heard in your monologue and from Lisa is blame the press, that the press is not fair to him. And he's gone back now to the press is the enemy of the people. But I think this goes, from my perspective, beyond that because his rhetoric is so intense that I think it has, you know, sort of created an atmosphere of more kind of dissidence and vitriol than we're accustomed to. To my mind, you know, what we've seen in the last week or so, it makes me wonder, is this America? How did we get to this point?\u00a0\nAnd then over the weekend, you know, just, you know, put me aside, because I just worry that you'll say, oh, well, that's Juan Williams. There's the press again. But here's 35,000 people, Greg, saying the president will not be welcome in Pittsburgh unless he denounces white nationalism. And here's words from this group, this is a Jewish group, then the ark, they say for the past three years, your words, your policies have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement. You, yourself, called the murderer evil. But yesterday's violence is the direct culmination of your influence.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: OK. I don't know much about that group, but I do know -- I think we have tape from CNN when they were actually asking this specific rabbi from that synagogue about whether Trump was welcome there. I think we have that. I'm talking slow enough so you can set it up. That work?\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this. Do you want him to come?\u00a0\nUNINDENTIFIED MALE: The president of the United States is always welcome. I'm a citizen. He's my president. He's certainly welcome.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: There you go. Kilmeade, what are your thoughts on -- if you care to respond to Juan about his feelings?\u00a0\nBRIAN KILMEADE, THE FIVE CO-HOST: I don't know any of those groups. I don't know any of those groups. But it sounds like Democratic talking points. Sounds like something Tom Steyer said on CNN on Sunday who I didn't -- beside the ads the he bought and the money he made. I was just stunned. If you ask me when this happened, first the bomber is discovered, two, the shooting of the synagogue, I thought maybe by Sunday, on a Sunday show, some pundit looking to get a network contract would go ahead and say I think the president is to blame. I did not know, the same night, the same day, within an hour, they said, ha, ha, look at what you see. What the president does and it works to his detriment is he watched everybody talk about all this. And it had him seething, as if we were sitting outside the glass listening to The Five talk about us. For him -- he's outraged. So what does the president do? Exactly what he did his entire life, at the Trump organization, and as a candidate, and as president, I'm going to go tweet out. I'm going to speak out. And you guys are blaming me for this. You're making it worst. The way you treat me has my 60 million who voted for me, and maybe more, seething, ready to go. Now that's nothing to do with that lunatic in Florida, and that nutcase in Pittsburgh. But I do think that there's a sense out there that Trump and his supporters have been categorized, like, as white nationalist because they voted for him and they're tired of it, and he's speaking for them.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't think it's about voting for him. I think that if you look back at some of the actions, not only the bomber and then the shooter, but, I mean, go back to Charlottesville, proud boys, and all these kinds of stuff that there's a growing white nationalist rage in this country.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: You do realize though that President Trump's daughter is Jewish. His son-in-law is Jewish. His grandchildren are Jewish. I actually think President Trump has a special spot in his heart for the Jewish community. You see that in his actions as well, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, being the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall. So, I think, that it's often not talked about in this national dialogue is the fact that this is so close to the president.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: One of the things, Lisa, that really bugged me about Charlottesville. Everyone put it in terms of the confederate statues, black, white. But, you know, they had guys with Tiki torches and automatic weapons standing outside a synagogue so the Jewish people had to exit to the back door, and those same guys said, oh, what a shame that Mr. Trump would allow his beautiful daughter to marry a Jew.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: They were universally condemned.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Let me get Dana in here. The media, oddly enough, didn't mind Louis Farrakhan's tweets earlier this week when he compared Jews to termites, but we'll not go there. You had Andrew McCarthy on your show, and I made a really important point that back in the 70s, the United States was a much smaller country. I don't know how many by million, but had many, many more of these kinds of attacks. So.\u00a0\nDANA PERINO, THE FIVE CO-HOST: And, in fact, it was the New York Time, yesterday, had an amazing report. It was on their website, like really well done. I'd point anyone to it. It's actually talking about 1968 because it was the 50th anniversary and we're looking at this now that in 1968 just how divisive things were. I do think we've all have to keep in mind that keeping a redline speech and violence is really important. That's how America was founded.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\u00a0\nPERINO: I also feel like the president could figure out a way to read the room a little better, and by that, I mean, like the country, right? Like take a couple of minutes. Like, tap the brakes just a little bit because for better or worse, people tend to look up to leaders, and they want to feel better about the moment. And the moment becomes about him and the media treatment of him, then we're just right back down into it. And then somebody is going to have to step forward and do something.\u00a0\nCan I just add one last thing? I know we've got to go. And that is the issue of radicalization of people. We've talked about this a lot during the war on terror. How does it happen, right? Where you have hopeless people, purposeless people, people who are ignorant, and then they find purpose in something that they find somewhere. Now it's online. You have radical Islamists. How do they find it? And there's something -- there's always -- there's something. I don't necessarily think it's speech, but there is a culmination of it. And if you look at this guy's background, Boyers's background, he certainly had it, right? He turned evil and vile into violence. And what we should be talking about as the president says, I'll do everything in my power to stop it from happening again. OK, so what is it in your power to do? And that some pretty comfortable conversations about privacy and the ability to -- we can prosecute very well. What we don't seem to be able to do as well is to prevent.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Right. And you think about what prevented institutionalization was there for unstable individuals. We don't have that anymore. There are a lot of unsavory, unstable people. We don't know where to put them. And this other guy, the bomber, everybody -- he was hiding in plain sight, apparently.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nPERINO: Five minutes before he left, he posted, I can't take this anymore because he couldn't take any more refugees coming in -- supported by the Jewish community. So there's 5 minutes before. There's 5 minutes from posting to shooting.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: As composed as Barack Obama is, his charismatic, great speech. I get it. But if he was blame for the South Carolina shooting, to the Kathy Gifford shootings, he was blame for Sandy Hook. He might go fly off the handle too.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Are you kidding me? What you've got there is a contrast between someone who talked about hope and change and someone who presses the fear button and demonizes the immigrant caravan.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's not the language. We've got to go. Another caravan coming towards the U.S., and the Trump administration sending 5,000 troops to greet them. That's next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nPERINO: Fox News confirming the U.S. military will be sending over 5,000 troops to the border as early as tomorrow, in anticipation of the migrant caravan moving across Mexico toward the U.S. This comes as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen offers a very direct message for all migrants trying to get into the country illegally.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: There's a legal way to enter this country. Those who choose to enter illegally will be stopped. My general message to this caravan is do not come. You will not be allowed in. There is a right way to immigrate to the United States and this is not it.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nPERINO: Brian, 5,000 troops. That's no joke.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: It's no joke. I'm not sure what they can do, but I love the deterrent. I hope they arrive with barriers and blockages, so people get the message. This is all about sending a message. I don't love the price tag. The department of defense got a lot of money to do a lot of important things overseas. I didn't think it's going to be at the southern border of Mexico, but somehow we have to send a message. And taking the children away from the families, I don't know if you heard, not a good move. It was meant to be a deterrent and ended up being horrendous. So in this aspect, I like the move. I like the check that was signed. It shows he's taking action. What I find stunning from a political point of view is I don't hear any outrage from Democrats. Senator Schumer. Where's Nancy Pelosi saying I prefer the illegals come in here? What I saw was the mocking tone of Barack Obama saying as if people are scared. People aren't scared of these people coming to our border. We understand their plight. We think that we should come up with a better way to maybe expedite their admission or evaluation. But this is not the way to get here.\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, the other thing is that this is also going to cause some consternation with what the troops are actually allowed to do. And it could be that the president makes a speech this week saying that he's going to take executive action to try to figure out a way so that the troops can do more than just support. We don't know that for sure, but it could be coming.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: The hard part about is defining what the plight is. What is the plight? Hot air had a piece yesterday about how the caravan is denying assistance for asylum in Mexico. So that makes me think that their status as refugees might be slightly exaggerated because, you know -- if you're a refugee, you don't turn away help when you really need it, when you're with your family, unless they just don't like Mexico, which isn't very nice for a country that close to you when you're turning down. That doesn't make any sense. The logical collusion here is that you waive caravans through, more will come. So that's why you have to be a hard ass in life. That's the sad part. This isn't happening. This caravan is not going to happen. And encouraging it is a really sick joke.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: There's another one coming.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I know. But we're talking about -- we've talked in the A-block about how rhetoric can lead to action or influence action. These people are being encouraged to do something that is not going to end well for them. The crowd is getting angry. There's already a story today about them chasing some fellow because they thought he was a kidnapper. So you're going to end up with a large, hungry, sleepless, angry group.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yeah, not good. Juan, do you think the Democrats are not talking about it because they want to just keep the focus on health care for the next 8 days?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yeah. You know, I think that the Democrats need a stronger, clearer message on this, Dana. And I'm disappointed that they don't have it because I think the message could be that this is a humanitarian crisis and that America has always been a nation of immigrants and that we are a compassionate people, conservative or liberal. And that there should be an effort to make sure that this -- the source of this problem is dealt with back in Honduras, back in Guatemala. But to me, what you're seeing here is the president, I think, ramping up. Remember, last week, it was he's going to send some troops to the border, about 800, I believe. Now it's up to thousands. And I think this is all about his upset that the bombing, the shooting are dominating coverage in the American narrative at the moment as opposed to his demonization of these immigrants as some kind.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nPERINO: Maybe they have found that because the caravan keeps growing and because it's not just the caravan but they have over 650 attempts to cross the border illegally every day regardless of the caravan. Your last thought.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: And it's kind of hard to not address this when you have thousands of people coming to the United States trying to exploit our laws. And the reason why Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer aren't talking about this is because immigration has been a losing issue for the Democrat Party. You had liberal groups like the center for American progress sending out a memo to Democrats in competitive districts telling them to avoid this issue, don't talk about it. Sanctuary city attacks pack a punch. So that's why Democrats aren't talking about it. But I think President Trump should give this speech tomorrow and talk about the laws that need to be changed because you have Central American migrants that are coming to exploit laws, like loopholes in the 2008.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Because of loopholes in the 2008 antihuman trafficking law which makes it more difficult to send Central American unaccompanied minors back. Unlike -- it's much more easier to send Mexicans and Canadians back. You also look at things like the florist decree. Seeking asylum is really easy. The threshold is way too low. You've got 80 percent of people will pass their first initial interview, but only 20 percent will be granted asylum in immigration courts. I think President Trump should take this opportunity to address all that and talk about why those laws need to change so we avoid this thing initially in the future.\u00a0\nPERINO: And we have to do something about the drug cartels. OK, the midterm elections are just over a week away, so how all of these developments that we've been talking about impact voters? We're going to debate that next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: This election is about borders, and this election is about jobs. In less than two years' time, we have created over 4.2 million new jobs and lifted over 4 million Americans off of food stamps.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Just eight days until the midterm elections, and President Trump, he's loading up on campaign rallies. The president planning to hit several states in the final stretch with stops in -- here I'm going to list them for you, Montana, Missouri, Tennessee, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, and two visits to the great state of Florida. As you just heard him say, his focus will be on the economy and the border. So while Trump is hoping his push drives voter to the polls, a new report in The Hill says Democrats continue to sound alarms that their party lacks a persuasive message. Greg?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah. They lack any message. But you know why the rallies are interesting.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: OK.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's part of the reciprocity. Rough weekend. Trump comes out to your town to entertain for free, so the very least you can do is vote. That's kind of how it works. He's always a salesman. He's the guy who comes to your house to show you the encyclopedias, so then you sit there for a couple hours. You know what? I'll buy the encyclopedias. And that's important. I think because -- it's a difference between -- there might be 1 to 2 percent people, Republicans, who might not vote, sitting on the couch, but because he came out there, you know, he'll go and do it. He's like a political personal trainer. He gets you out of bed, full of caffeine, and sends you to the polls.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Dana, as you heard Brian say, some people think the Democrats message is health care. Nancy Pelosi said health care, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking money out of politics. What do you say?\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, it is health care for the Democrats and they're not wrong. Look at Claire McCaskill in Missouri, she's in a tight race against Josh Hawley. She's a little bit behind there in Missouri. She came up with her closing argument is your health care, your vote. So they're all in on this. They're not going to pay attention to the caravans, etcetera. We are past the persuasion stage. We are completely get out to vote. And also, the other thing is the Democrats have so much money, tons of money flowing into all these congressional districts. One of the things that's happening for the Republicans is they're realizing that the Democrats map is expanding in the house in very tight races, now they have to put money into them and they're trying to figure out how can we, actually, try to match this money that the Democrats have. They probably can't. So the president going out there is good, especially for the senate. But it might not be able to help them save the house.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Lisa, one of the ads being put out by the president's team, Brad Parscale, his 2020 manager, put money into an ad that says basically the economy is better. Things are getting better, folks. That's the message.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Yeah, it's all true. Well, the point is drawing a contrast and saying, look, the economy has gotten better. Do you want to go back to days before that? And that's what would happen if Democrats get elected and take over the house because ultimately the government would be at a standstill. So that is a great message. My understanding is President Trump is not on the ad which is probably smart too because there are 24 districts where Hillary Clinton won. So you've got a lot of these districts that might not take to the president being in ads, so I think that's a smart decision in their point. I think in the senate -- I feel pretty comfortable where things stand, but the house is tricky just because you've so many Republicans that aren't running for reelection. You have a lot of open seats which are more difficult to win. And there's just so many competitive seats. The Democrats only need to net 23. So, I'm a little bit worried about the house. But the fact that we went from talking about this big blue wave to now real clear politics listing the house in totality as a toss-up and not being able to call it is probably a good sign for Republicans.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Five, thirty eight said -- what is it? Eighty five percent chance that the Republicans lose the house, but they also had a 79 percent chance that Hillary Clinton will win the election. So, can you say fallible? Number two is, I do know two prominent Republicans who have both said they've very concern about the money from -- the money from Michael Bloomberg that is coming in late, that is going right into their smaller -- smaller races.\u00a0\nBut my thing is, if you said that everybody is decided, it's about getting out the vote. Is an ad making your guy look like the worst -- or your woman look like the worst thing ever, going to actually change somebody's mind?\u00a0\nAnd we're going to find out soon if everyone has been scared underground to admit that they're voting for President Trump. Most people said, \"You know what? I don't need the blowback. I'm not going to tell anyone who I'm voting for. I'm just going to keep my mouth shut. I'm not going to talk at Thanksgiving.\"\u00a0\nAnd then when the vote comes in, if it again goes to Trump's direction, I don't know how Democrats get up the next day.\u00a0\nPERINO: Also, could I just say that the Democrats are really counting on young voters and Latino voters? Both of those groups tend not to turn out for the midterm, and so they're counting on something that might not be there.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: All right. So you know what still surprises me is the low level of impact the economy and the tax cuts are having for the Republicans. Clearly, they've made the decision that's not the winning ticket, and that's why we see the caravan.\u00a0\nBut us the caravan as powerful as saying to people, \"Hey, the economy is not that bad. Your wages aren't great, but come on\"?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You know what? I do think that the economy -- here's the -- here's the challenge that Trump has. So many things are going so well that you have to, like -- it's like OK, so nobody is taking about the economy, because it's great.\u00a0\nNow as for the caravan, it's a visual representation of a larger issue. Many people may say, \"Why do you care about the caravan? It's 1,100 miles away.\"\u00a0\nBut what it is, it's a promise, it's a threat that it's coming here. It's a visual representation of the fragility and vulnerability of your border. So if you believe in strong borders, that's your visual representation. That's why it's powerful. The wall is visual.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No question. But the thing is, it seems like more culture wars and, you know -\u00a0\nBOOTHE: The economy will have --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Borders aren't cultures. Border is your country.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: The economy will have a bigger impact looking ahead at \"20/20\" and the presidential race. It's -- for your midterm elections, it's your base issues. What's driving out the base? For the left, it's health care. For the right, it's immigration.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Eight million people have already voted, which they say is on level, judging by the population proportion, as the highest for a midterm turnout since 1914. Which that -- we're looking for good news? That's good news.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yes, I think people are highly energized, because this is an election about Donald Trump.\u00a0\nBy the way, I don't know how many of you voted this weekend, but I had a sticker that said, \"I'm an early voter.\"\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Good for you, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I feel virtuous.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'm going to vote on the actual day, because I believe in that.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: When is it? I don't even know. I don't even know where I'm supposed to go.\u00a0\nPERINO: I can show you how to find out.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think the Republicans thought you were black and sent you one of those messages.\u00a0\nHillary Clinton increasing speculation about running for president in 2020. What she said over the weekend. Boy, she's raising eyebrows. Stay with us on \"The Five.\"\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Oh, this is my block.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: The overhead shot happens to be my favorite on the show.\u00a0\nHillary Clinton apparently not ready to let go of her dream job. In an interview over the weekend, she was asked about running for president. Guess what she said?\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to run again?\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: No. No.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a pause.\u00a0\nCLINTON: Well, I'd like to be president.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKILMEADE: But if she doesn't run, Democrats may have another interesting option: anti-Trump attorney Michael Avenatti. According to a new Politico report, titled \"Avenatti Quietly Builds a 2020 Machine,\" he has a team of veteran Democratic advisors, some of which are Clintonites, by the way, helping him plan a presidential campaign. It will start -- he'll make a decision by January 1.\u00a0\nBut let's start with Hillary Clinton. What did she mean by that, Dan?\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, she -- it's like travel. How you -- I like to be in places. I don't like to travel to places. So she would like to be president without --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I can help you.\u00a0\nPERINO: I know you have that idea.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nPERINO: She wants -- she would like to be president, but she doesn't want to go through the -- she doesn't want to go through the difficulty of running for president.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: could I -- could I add to that and interrupt?\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: She doesn't want to run, but she wanted to be president, so essentially 2016.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's exactly -- exactly.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: so it -- this is the ultimate arrogance. She's saying, like, \"Just make me president.\"\u00a0\nPERINO: Right. Well, because it was her turn.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nPERINO: That was one of the knocks on it.\u00a0\nBut also, if you look at somebody like a McCain or a Romney. They lost. OK, McCain decided to run for reelection in the Senate. Romney, he lost the presidency, took some time off. And he said, \"I still want to serve,\" so he's running for Senate. He'll be the next senator for Arizona.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: What about Al Gore? \"Hey, I lost a heartbreaker, and I'm it -- that's it.\"\u00a0\nPERINO: But the other thing is, every time she does this, it prevents somebody else from being able to emerge.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Absolutely.\u00a0\nAnd here's the thing. She's --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Avenatti.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Tell me if this sounds familiar, Juan Williams. She's going to be on a 13-stop listening tour or speaking tour with her husband. That sounds a lot like \"I might run for Senate. I'm going to take a tour with Pat Moynihan and just go on a listening tour and find out what the people of New York state want.\" And don't give me that, but that's a side note. But this sounds like she's laying the groundwork for another run.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think your fantasies are out of control on this Monday.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: What about you? What do you think?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, she's not -- she clearly said she's not running. But she said -- and I thought it was an expression of truth, that she wishes she was president. She wishes Donald Trump had lost. I mean, that's -- that's the truth.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: But you know, too, that she also told -- said she wasn't going to run when she was secretary of state and was asked on the Sunday shows.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That's more run up, but I mean, the situation has changed.\u00a0\nI am curious about Avenatti.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Because I just don't see he -- I mean, the only -- Avenatti got in trouble last week for saying it has to be a strong white male to take on Donald Trump. But you know what? He thinks he's the strong white male.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: How do you feel about that, Greg? Avenatti running. He says, \"I'll decide by January 1.\" He's putting a team together. He only owes $4.3 million and has an ex-wife that wants $200,000 a month.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Could he be their Trump? Could he be the out-of-nowhere, you know, dark horse? I'm going to say no, because I don't think he has any talent. He's -- fashions himself as a bare-knuckled brawler, but when he gets out into the street, he loses every fight. Every single fight, he loses.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Exactly. He's not clever or interesting enough to be 2020's President Trump.\u00a0\nBut look, regarding Hillary, Greg is absolutely right. She's entitled, and this is what it speaks to. I don't think she actually likes campaigning. I don't think she actually likes being among people.\u00a0\nIf you go back, even remember in 2015, when her and Huma went into the Chipotle; and they had sunglasses on, and they couldn't be bothered to talk to anyone. I think that was her problem all along.\u00a0\nI actually wrote a column about this in 2014 for FOXNews.com, saying she was going to be 2016's Mitt Romney. In the sense that just like Mitt Romney, he was -- even though he was a really good guy and we all know that and he's a good person, he just had this inability to connect with voters and be among the people. And Hillary Clinton had the exactly same problem.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: She's more of a staffer, more of a staffer. Put her secretary of state, secretary of commerce, but don't make her run for that position.\u00a0\nLet me ask you: Avenatti, who Dana, is it true or false? Right now they kind of like the fact that he took on Trump and had some early victories, but these Democrats are going to turn on him quickly. Don't you think?\u00a0\nPERINO: I don't think Democrats think much of Avenatti. Yes, they might have liked that for a while, but I think that they recognize the dangers of it. We talked in the commercial break about the problems the DNC has right now. That they are looking at the possibility of 30 candidates or maybe 35 candidates that think that they could all be president of the United States. They have much bigger problems than just worrying about Avenatti.\u00a0\nBut I do think it's pretty interesting. He's already hired staff, like Democratic staff.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: These are established people.\u00a0\nPERINO: The Democrats, I mean, they're very good at cutting people off for other opportunities. They should probably deploy.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Get rid of him.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You know what this is, Brian? This is part of the fact that American politics is not your daddy's American politics. And that people are now looking for someone who is a, what would you call it, an alley fighter. Back --\u00a0\nBOOTHE: You don't like Avenatti, do you?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, that's what I'm saying. But I think if you -- if you said what is positive about Avenatti?\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Nothing.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You would say, \"Oh, this guy, he'll get up and he'll get in Trump's face.\" Remember Biden saying --\u00a0\nBOOTHE: But he loses, to Greg's point.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What?\u00a0\nBOOTHE: He said he loses.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, but I'm saying --\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Trump wins.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What you want is somebody who is as bellicose, as bullying as Donald Trump.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I think think so, Greg. I think the winner of this -- tell me what you think of this theory, and don't be afraid to agree with me. I know it's a weird place for you to be.\u00a0\nI believe the person -- the person that runs successfully against Trump does not fight him. Compliments on things he's done, say, \"I wouldn't have done things different.\" Because Trump is not great, if you don't put your chin out --\u00a0\nPERINO: If you're nice to him.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: If you don't put your chin out, he doesn't really hit you. If you come out and just respect what he's done but say, \"I don't like the tone,\" he might be or she might be successful.\nPERINO: Interesting.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So that was basically a long-winded opinion fashioned as a question. You're just telling -- you were just telling everyone what you thought.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: What do you think? What do you think of my theory?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Honestly, I zoned out. I'm thinking about ribs. It's 5:42.\u00a0\nPERINO: It's not Tuesday.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: No, I'm looking forward to Chinese ribs, extra sauce.\u00a0\nPERINO: OK.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: That sounds delicious.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: You had -- you had a chance to agree with me and changed the narrative.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Exactly.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Brian, I feel for you, because normally, he goes after me. But that was a low shot at my man Brian here.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'm worried about his ADD. Three sentences.\u00a0\nAll right. Let me tell you what's coming up next, because my prompter is on, and the camera is looking right at me. Parents, listen up: your kids could get arrested for trick-or-treating. We explain that next. That wasn't much of a tease.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nBOOTHE: All right. Well, kids all across the country are getting ready to head out trick-or-treating on Wednesday night. But how old is too old for the sugar-filled tradition?\u00a0\nSome cities are now banning anyone over the age of 12 from trick-or- treating. And one city in Virginia says you could be found guilty of a misdemeanor and also sent to jail.\u00a0\nAll right. So Greg, how old is too old for trick-or-treating?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's never too old. But my feeling is, I changed my mind on this.\u00a0\nIf you are not hurting anyone --\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Right.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: -- and you want to participate with people in a positive way, rather than sit home on your computer and troll people, but you actually might want to go outside and see your neighbors, why narrow that opportunity?\u00a0\nBut I know what this is about. This is to dissuade tricksters, not trick- or-treaters but teenagers who go out and, you know, throw eggs and stuff that Kilmeade used to do.\u00a0\nMy really issue, though, is I think we need to introduce more trickery. When people go up to your door and the say, \"Trick-or-treat,\" no one ever gives them a trick. They only give them a treat. I think we have to change that, and there has to be a risk involved, some kind of trick. And I'm not going to say what it is.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You got that backwards. You got that backwards.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What do you mean?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: The trick would be that, if you don't give me a trick, I'm going to -- if you don't give me a treat, I'm going to play a trick on you.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Wow, that could explain it it.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Greg -- Greg --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: That's why the police arrested me last year.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Greg took some swipes at you. Would you like to defend yourself?\u00a0\nKILMEADE: No one listens to me.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: By the way, I love your costume.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I would say this: I am so into this talking point, because I believe that Halloween is totally out of control.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Why?\u00a0\nKILMEADE: You do not want to sit in the audience at a children's show; if you don't want to go to \"Romper Room,\" if that's still on; if you don't want to go watch \"The Electric Company,\" if that's still on, or \"Wonderama.\" If you're too old for those shows, he should not be trick-or- treating. It's for kids.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: This is a war on Halloween.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: It is a war on Halloween.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Dana, isn't -- but isn't 13-year-old a kid? I mean, 13 --\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes. I think, look, when you're 13, 14, I think that you could still, like, maybe go trick-or-treating.\u00a0\nI -- I lived in Washington, D.C., on Capitol Hill for a long time. We did the whole thing one year. We really wanted to do it up. We got all sorts of candy. And it was a really bad scene, because there was hardly any children that were under the age of 15. And it was just -- became a nightmare, so that in the future, what we did as I got home really early, and then I went upstairs and turned off all the lights.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Yes. Leave a bowl in front of your house.\u00a0\nPERINO: But I like little kids. I like to see them dressed up.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: That's fun. It's a kids' holiday. If you're an adult, you should not be celebrating Halloween.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What is your -- why do you take such strong stances?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But you know what the problem is, Brian? It's become an adult holiday. Not even for the older teenagers.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I can't wait for November 1.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I'm just telling you, boy, the parties now, the adults, and this weekend, this past weekend. People in fancy costumes and the clubs. It's big. But here's the thing, I think --\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I was in New Orleans over the weekend. Everybody was dressed up.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying. OK.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What were you doing there?\u00a0\nKILMEADE: \"Battle of New Orleans.\" It's now out on paperback.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: OK.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: That was good. But I will say I think this -- it oftentimes, at least in my neighborhood, becomes an income thing. Because I think what you see is that the poor older teenagers come out, and they're having fun. But a lot of people are like, \"Hey, why is this kid knocking on my door?\" It's late at night.\u00a0\nPERINO: They're not even dressed in costumes, and that's a problem.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So I mean, but I think that's what --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Way to blame the poor, Dana.\u00a0\nPERINO: Oh, God.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: They can't afford costumes. \"Why can't poor people dress up better on Halloween?\" By Dana Perino, FOX News.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'll be fired tomorrow.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: There was a funny opinion piece in \"The New York Post,\" and the guy writes, \"We're not arresting 50-year-old men who dance awkwardly in clubs or a 30-year-old woman who still screams 'woo' when they drink too much.\" So basically, just saying, I mean, look, you're 13, 14 --\u00a0\nPERINO: I don't like it that they're going to give them a misdemeanor. You don't need to give a 13-year-old a record.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Lock them up. Lock her up.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: There's also laws if you're looting, and it seems unnecessary to me.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Now you can't loot?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Now you can't loot.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: You can't have any fun anymore.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Remember the good old days?\u00a0\nBOOTHE: Everything is ruined.\u00a0\nAll right. Well, you know what is not ruined, \"One More Thing.\" Because that's up next. Stay tuned.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right, Dana, let's get after it. \"One More Thing.\"\u00a0\nPERINO: OK. All right. Today, it's a special day at Fox News. We've just announced the launch of our new premium subscription service, Fox Nation. It starts November 27. It's an on-demand service with daily live opinion shows and documentaries, features exclusive content from your favorite Fox News stars.\u00a0\nAnd for a limited time, we're offering a chance to become a part of Fox Nation by signing up as a founder.

You click on Fox Nation Election Experience for more info.\u00a0\nAnd it's very exciting. We're excited about all of the hard work that's gone into this, and it's about to bear fruit. And also, you're not going to want to miss \"The Five\" tomorrow, because Jesse and I went to this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Why do I -- why I have to go first? Dana, can you go first?\u00a0\nPERINO: No, I can't. I'm so scared.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Please.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nPERINO: The worst part about it is we had to wear GoPro. And so you have a picture of our faces the entire time. I was a terrible colleague and hid behind Jesse. But you'll see that whole package tomorrow on \"The Five.\"\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right, so I've got to plug my book signing. It's going to be at this event.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What day is it?\u00a0\nPERINO: November 27.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: November 27. I'll be there. I don't think Brian Kilmeade will be there, because his book isn't that good.\u00a0\nPERINO: No, it's Election Day. No, Election Day.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Election Day. Jeez Louise!\u00a0\nKILMEADE: It's a little different. It's a little different, Dana.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: A week from tomorrow.\u00a0\nPERINO: The streaming starts on the 27th.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: The 27th. But I'll be there to sign books on Election Day.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Either that or three weeks from then.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes, all right. Let's do this.\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Greg's Drone News\u00a0\nGUTFELD: \"Greg's Drone News.\" I think drones are adorable, but what's more adorable than regular drones? How about tiny drones that joined together to help make the world a better place?\u00a0\nThese are little drones working together to open up a door. And they're actually -- the door weighs 40 times -- or actually, it's 40 times as large as -- larger than these little drones.\u00a0\nPERINO: Why are you showing us this?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Because I just like to show you what drones can do. They're not opening up doors for each other. And then what you don't see is once they go in, they steal everybody's underwear.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: It's a happy tale. Drones helping drones.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Drones helping people. Speaking of drones. No, I thought it was Brian. It's actually Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: What? Oh, all right.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: I'm droning on.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Did you ever think of a banana as a fortune cookie? Well, one cafeteria manager in Virginia Beach, Virginia, had just that idea.\u00a0\nStacey Truman started what she calls talking bananas. She's giving kids inspiration at Kingston Elementary School by writing uplifting messages on the banana peels before she hands them out.\u00a0\nHer motivational messages include \"Never give up,\" \"Smile,\" \"You are loved,\" \"Keep on trying.\" Truman says most of those messages came from what she tells her own children or what you'd want to hear herself.\u00a0\nSo what happened? The principal, Sharon Shewbridge, posted pictures of the fruit on Twitter. And it all went viral. And now the principal says she wants other schools to follow and inspire kids to new heights of confidence and achievement.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I have to say, those messages have quite an appeal. Why am I alive? Brian.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: All right. So over the weekend I had a chance to promote, because it just dropped on Tuesday --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It dropped? Somebody's hip.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: \"Andrew Jackson: The Miracle of new Orleans\" is now in paperback. And I put a new afterward in, and I had a chance to do something I should have done with the hardback but I didn't have time.\u00a0\nPERINO: Like go to New Orleans?\u00a0\nKILMEADE: And that's go to, actually, New Orleans. I had a chance to speak at an event with Ryan Drez. He's a decorated Marine who might be the premier historian in the country. And I had a chance to talk there on a beautiful afternoon. That's what we look at when we stand next to each other. He's taller.\u00a0\nAnd then, I had a chance to actually go out and meet three nuns. Ursuline nuns came here in the 1730s, and it was Andrew Jackson who visited them. And they said, \"If you win, can we stay?\"\u00a0\nAnd he said, \"Absolutely.\"\u00a0\nThey said, \"We're going to pray for you to win.\"\u00a0\nAnd Andrew Jackson believed that the Ursuline nuns' prayers during the battle gave them the unfathomable victory where we defeated the British in 45 minutes and did something Napoleon couldn't. Napoleon lost.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Get to the point, please.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: This is the point. Then of course, we're going to be at Grand Rapids, Michigan, as well as Elkhart, Indiana.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You know, there's one person after you.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: And that will be on --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: This ain't no \"Fox & Friends,\" OK? Lisa.\u00a0\nPERINO: Grand Rapids and Elkhart, Indiana. We'll be there.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: All right. Well, I think we've a picture of cutie named Blake Mumford from Ohio, who's 5 years old. He was born with spina bifida and has been wheelchair-bound most of his life.\u00a0\nWell, he loves school buses so much that his grandfather put together a costume for him and turned his wheelchair into a school bus. He absolutely loves it, and his grandfather called it Blake County Schools.\u00a0\nAnd his mother loves it, because the photos and videos have now gone viral. And she loves it, because it's bringing attention to spina bifida. So --\u00a0\nPERINO: Nice.\u00a0\nBOOTHE: That's a happy Halloween, Blake.\u00a0\nKILMEADE: Great Halloween.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: set your DVRs. never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" \"Special Report\" up next. He's my favorite talkie, and he's currently in Milwaukee.\u00a0\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: nicely done. Thank you, Greg.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "Former President Obama campaigns in Gary, Indiana. Former President Barack Obama made his closing arguments against the Trump-led Republican Party in a fiery campaign push that stretched into Monday\u00a0\u2013 capping an extraordinary political intervention that saw him crisscross\u00a0the nation stumping for favored candidates. The president popped into a northern Virginia campaign office Monday for Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, to support not only the front-running Senate incumbent but Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, who's in one of the biggest House battles this year\u00a0against endangered Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock. \"Make sure people vote to start making things better,\" Obama told the crowd. \"Let's get to work.\" It was a low-key finish to an otherwise\u00a0high-profile campaign swing that broke with the tradition of most past presidents largely refraining from blasting their predecessors' agenda on the trail.\u00a0Obama railed against President Trump and congressional Republicans throughout his stops, accusing them of using \u201cpolitical stunts\u201d to rally support. Friday's remarks in Miami were among the most fiery, as Obama mocked the Clinton email controversy of 2016 and blasted Republicans warning about the approaching migrant caravan. \u201cIn 2014 they said Ebola is going to kill all of us, shut the borders. In 2016, it was Hillary\u2019s emails. They were all wound up about that,\u201d Obama said during a stop in Miami to stump for Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. Nelson is fighting a tough reelection campaign against Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Rick Scott, while Gillum is locked in a tight battle with former Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis. Obama added: \u201cNow in 2018 they\u2019re telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away. They\u2019re even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border.\u201d The former president also said that Tuesday\u2019s midterms \u201cmight be the most important election of our lifetimes.\u201d \u201cPoliticians will always say that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut this time it\u2019s actually true. The stakes really are that high. The consequences of any other staying home really are more dangerous.\u201d Just as Trump and Republicans have made the caravan of Central American migrants making their way through Mexico a central talking point in the closing days of this election season, so did Obama. \"Don't be hoodwinked. Don't be bamboozled. Don't let them run the okey-doke on you,\" Obama said Sunday during a campaign stop in Gary, Ind., for Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. \"Because while they are trying to distract you with all this stuff, they are robbing you blind,\" Obama added. \"They'll be like: 'Look, look, look! Caravan, caravan!' Then they're giving tax cuts to their billionaire friends. 'Look, look, look! Whatever is the thing scary.' And then they're sabotaging your health care. You can't fall for it.\" Obama over the weekend also campaigned in his hometown of Chicago for businessman J.B. Pritzker, the Democrats\u2019 nominee for Illinois governor in his race against Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. It\u2019s been a battle of wealthy titans spending their way through potentially the costliest gubernatorial campaign in U.S. history. Stumping for Pritzker, Obama\u00a0asked the rallygoers to mobilize at the polls. \u201cWe are in this together, and we rise and fall as one nation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGoodness and decency are still out there, kindness is still out there, generosity is still out there, hope is still out there, we just have to stand up and speak for it. The former president also brought up Trump\u2019s claim that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and compared the legal problems of his administration with those of the current White House. \u201cThey\u2019ve racked up enough indictments to field a football team. No one in my administration got indicted,\u201d he said of the Trump administration. The current and former presidents crossed paths over the weekend in both Florida and Georgia, where Obama hoped to help Stacey Abrams become the first African-American woman elected as governor in the U.S. Obama lambasted the Republican gubernatorial nominee, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, for his record on voting rights, while praising Abrams as the \"most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race.\" \"How can you actively try to prevent the citizens from your state from exercising their most basic right?\" Obama said of Kemp, before turning to Abrams: \"She is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this.\" Fox News\u2019 Frank Miles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The president speaks to supporters in Lebanon, Ohio. President Trump is headlining his latest\u00a0\u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Friday night, another stop on his campaign swing through competitive states ahead of next month\u2019s midterm elections. Trump could address a number of topics during the rally, including his recent Oval Office meeting with rapper Kanye West and first lady Melania Trump\u2019s much-buzzed-about interview with\u00a0ABC News, as well as the upcoming elections and the recent, bruising confirmation battle over newly minted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The rally is set to unfold\u00a0at the Warren County Fairgrounds in Lebanon, northeast of Cincinnati. The county is a GOP stronghold, and Trump won two out of every three votes there in 2016 as he decisively carried Ohio and ultimately captured the White House. U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot, a Cincinnati Republican whose district encompasses Warren County, is in a hotly contested race with Democrat Aftab Pureval, the Hamilton County clerk of courts. Trump's pick for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Rep. Jim Renacci, is in an uphill battle to unseat two-term\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown. Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine and Democratic former federal consumer watchdog Richard Cordray are in a tight race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. John Kasich, a frequent Trump critic who unsuccessfully challenged him for the 2016 presidential nomination. Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates last month in Cleveland. Obama carried Ohio twice. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "FILE -- Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses a meeting in Ankara, Turkey. (Kayhan Ozer, Presidential Press Service, Pool photo via AP) Turkish citizens will go to the polls for snap parliamentary and presidential elections Sunday, putting the world at the doorstep of another decade-long, dangerous problem: a re-elected and empowered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Some voters have the hope of an opposition victory as the result of Erdogan\u2019s lackluster campaign and a spiraling currency crisis. It\u2019s more realistic, however, to start thinking about the problem that his victory is bound to cause for the rest of the world, and especially for the U.S. Pollsters recalculating the probability of a victorious or defeated Erdogan forget one important feature of Turkey\u2019s so-called democracy: it isn\u2019t one. Erdogan has already stacked the cards for his own success in this election. After the fixed outcome arrives, Erdogan will lead a Turkey that is more militarily interventionist throughout the broader Middle East and more willing to cooperate with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the cost of the U.S. interests, and those of NATO and the European Union. Erdogan will also have more authoritarian tools at his disposal. These snap elections trigger the full implementation of constitutional changes passed in a controversial referendum in April 2017. This new system will codify executive powers granted to Erdogan under state of emergency laws, including the issuance of presidential decrees as law. It will also erode what little leverage remains with the Turkish Parliament or the political opposition. The net result: Erdogan is poised to remain in power until at least 2028, with a deeper megalomaniac desire to expand his regional footprint at others\u2019 expense. This will quickly drive deeper wedges into Turkey\u2019s partnerships with the U.S. and NATO. Erdogan will continue, for example, to balance cooperation and competition with Iran, even at the cost of U.S. fines for evading economic sanctions against dealings with Tehran. He has also bristled at the U.S partnership with anti-ISIS fighters affiliated with a Kurdish militant group that he sees as a threat to Turkish sovereignty. The U.S. has cut tactical deals with Turkey in Syria, but these cannot satiate Erdogan\u2019s drive for expanding Turkey\u2019s sphere of influence beyond the historic borders of the Ottoman Empire. The U.S. and Turkey recently agreed on a framework for the status of the mixed Kurdish-Arab city of Manbij, which is contested by Turkey and the U.S. partner force in northwestern Syria. This agreement fails to repair the damage done from years of mutually destabilizing Turkish and U.S. policies, absent a roadmap for broader U.S.-Turkish cooperation in Syria. Meantime, Erdogan\u2019s response has been to deepen Turkish cooperation with Salafi jihadist groups, including Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria. Additionally, Erdogan will make good on threats to expand military operations abroad. He\u00a0 abandoned negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization waging a decades-long insurgency inside of Turkey, and has attacked PKK-affiliated militants in northwest Syria without much consequence. He will likely continue targeting similar fighters elsewhere in Syria and in Iraq. Erdogan\u2019s attempts to silence the pro-Kurdish domestic political voice renders future Turkish-Kurdish negotiations even more difficult to reignite, virtually guaranteeing further instability and violence. For the likes of Putin, Erdogan\u2019s victory will be an opportunity to continue subverting NATO\u2019s unity and weakening the alliance\u2019s southern flank. Turkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system will throw a technical wrench into NATO partners\u2019 interoperability. Russia also enabled Turkey\u2019s operations against the U.S. Syrian Kurdish ground partner in Syria, triggering an operational pause to anti-ISIS operations in March. Putin\u2019s cultivation of Erdogan will attempt to stymie NATO\u2019s effectiveness further from within. Erdogan\u2019s attempts to secure even more absolute rule at home will cause additional international problems. His paranoia on the heels of a failed coup attempt in July, 2016, fuels a vendetta against alleged coup plotter Fethullah Gulen, who resides in Pennsylvania. Erdogan fashions Westerners traveling in Turkey as diplomatic bargaining chips. American Pastor Andrew Brunson has remained behind bars in Turkish custody for over a year, even as the U.S. State Department has said that Turkey has not presented any credible evidence for detaining him. Worse yet, thousands of Turkish citizens also remain imprisoned \u2013 many for the \u201ccrime\u201d of voicing political dissent \u2013 with uncertain futures. The pace of Erdogan\u2019s post-coup purges outside of Turkey also shows no indication of slowing. Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency serves as the expeditionary arm of the Turkish state, reportedly seizing 80 Turkish citizens from 18 countries by March 2018. One of the biggest weapons for destabilization that Erdogan wields is migration, as he has more than 2.6 million Syrian refugees to host or expel as he pleases. The plight of these migrants will continue to prove useful for Erdogan\u2019s diplomatic maneuvering with Europe. Erdogan habitually threatens the implementation of the Turkey-European Union deal that attempts to stem the flow of migrants to the EU in exchange for an advantage in bilateral economic and political negotiations. However, the victory of Erdogan\u2019s presidential system positions Turkey as far away as ever from the distant dream of EU membership. In the longer run, phony electoral victories will not save Erdogan from himself. Among other things, he will face mounting pressure to resolve a currency crisis that he created. Turkey will continue to feel the full effects of Erdogan\u2019s economic mismanagement after the election as he threatens the Turkish Central Bank\u2019s independence. In sum, Erdogan\u2019s post-election grip on power will drive domestic crises, destabilize Turkey\u2019s foreign partnerships, and ultimately undermine the very position he is attempting to secure. For everyone else that means more headaches, more violence, and more instability in a part of the world that definitely does not need it.",

I\u2019m going to make you famous\u2026 and it\u2019s not going to be in a good way.\" \u201cWhen I\u2019m done with you, you will beg me to ease up. I\u2019m going to make you famous\u2026 and it\u2019s not going to be in a good way,\u201d Ojeda wrote in a Facebook message to the lawmaker. Phillips is a Democrat-turned-Republican who ran for the party\u2019s nomination for U.S. Congress but lost to Republican Carol Miller \u2013 Ojeda\u2019s opponent in the upcoming midterm election in November. He shared the threatening message in a Facebook post on Sunday. Ojeda initially blocked Phillips on Facebook after sending the message but unblocked him after the messages were posted by Phillips. Messages sent by Richard Ojeda to Rupie Phillips In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, he said the threat from Ojeda was prompted after Miller attended an annual craft beer tasting and a chili cook off festival in his area where he introduced her to the local crowd. \u201cWhat boils down to, [Ojeda] had some family members at the cookout and they\u2019re talking about me taking Miller around to his hometown and introduce her to people. I guess he thought he could scare me and I guess I hurt his feelings,\u201d Phillips said of what could have prompted Ojeda to send him the message. The Ojeda campaign did not deny the message was sent by the candidate, but pushed back against its meaning. \u201cThis is absurd and obviously not a threat of physical violence,\u201d the campaign\u2019s spokeswoman told Fox News. \u201cRichard was speaking about exposing Del. Phillips for his corruption in the West Virginia legislature. \"This is absurd and obviously not a threat of physical violence.\" \u201cRichard has stood against corruption in government from the beginning of his political career and that will never change. It\u2019s truly sad that families in our communities are being ripped apart my opioids and devastated by poverty and Delegate Rupie Phillips has chosen to focus his attention on this. It\u2019s obvious where his priorities are and it is not with the people of West Virginia.\" Phillips claims this isn't the first time Ojeda has targeted him. In August, the Democratic candidate suggested he was a bootlicker by sending him a cartoon of a character licking a boot. \u201cEver since 2014 when I wasn\u2019t supporting him when he ran against [Democrat Rep.] Nick Rahall for U.S. Congress, he\u2019s been against me,\u201d Phillips said, noting that he\u2019s never engaged with him. Rupie Phillips, a Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates since 2013. (Facebook) \u201cHe has verbally attacked me many times on his social media over the past four years and I just bit my tongue, being a bigger person and going down the road,\u201d he added. The local lawmaker said he read the message as a threat of physical violence and called Ojeda a \u201cschool yard bully\u201d who doesn\u2019t \u201cknow what to do when someone stands up to him.\u201d Ojeda is running in a district that Trump won by 50 points. Despite the deep-red district, Ojeda has been making gains, with the latest poll claiming he\u2019s leading his Republican opponent by five points. An earlier poll, meanwhile, said Miller is leading by eight points. CANDIDATE RUNNING AS 'TRUMP DEMOCRAT' SLAMS PRESIDENT, BACKS CITIZENSHIP FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS His campaign carries a populist theme, including his support for the coal industry and hopes of seeing Trump succeed as the president. But despite such comments, he also made numerous anti-Trump remarks. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done s---,\u201d Ojeda told Politico about Trump, expressing regret at having supported the Republican presidential nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s been a friggin\u2019 circus for a solid year,\u201d he continued, claiming that Trump hadn\u2019t changed anything for the people. \u201cAll he\u2019s done is shown that he\u2019s taking care of the daggone people he\u2019s supposed to be getting rid of,\u201d Ojeda added. COLORADO SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIM'S FATHER ACCUSES GIFFORDS SUPER PAC AD OF 'POLITICIZING' DAUGHTER'S DEATH Ojeda has also flip-flopped \u2013 around the time he started running for U.S. Congress \u2013 on his views regarding whether illegal immigrants are exploiting the welfare system. \u201cWhen you hear about illegal aliens getting benefits and you have people here starving to death and can\u2019t get nothing, it\u2019s just a slap in the face,\u201d Ojeda told the\u00a0New Yorker magazine in 2016. \u201cWhen you start talking about bringing in refugees and when they get here they get medical and dental and they get set up with some funds \u2014 what do we get?\u201d He added: \u201cSo when people hear Donald Trump saying we\u2019re going to take benefits away from people who come here illegally and give them to people who work, that sounds pretty good.\u201d Over a year later, Ojeda dismissed any suggestions that illegal immigrants have access to a social safety net, calling it a \u201cmyth.\u201d \u201cYeah, most immigrants don\u2019t receive food stamps or welfare.\u00a0 That\u2019s a myth, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Ojeda\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook. \u201cIf they\u2019re in this country, for the most part, and they\u2019re not here legally, they\u2019re trying to get through it? Guess what?\u00a0 They don\u2019t get them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidate John James gaining momentum against the Democratic incumbent with the help of President Trump. Underdog Republican Senate candidate John James appears to be gaining momentum in Michigan, as the latest polls show the political newcomer cutting incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow\u2019s once-comfortable lead in half. James, an Iraq War veteran, is now trailing the incumbent by roughly 7 points, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls. The split is similar to the race in Texas, where Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke is trailing incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Like O\u2019Rourke, James remains the underdog. But unlike in Texas, the polls in Michigan reflect a steady tightening.\u00a0Stabenow, D-Mich., for months had led by double digits. As of mid-October, Stabenow was 16 points ahead of James, according to an MRG poll. But an EPIC-MRA poll from late October showed Stabenow with just a 7-point lead, an Emerson poll showed her up 9 points\u00a0and a new Mitchell Research & Communications poll showed the incumbent\u00a0leading by 6 points. \u201cJohn James is giving 43-year politician Debbie Stabenow the fight of her political life and there is zero question she\u2019ll be running scared these final days,\u201d Tori Sachs, James\u2019 campaign manager, told Fox News in a statement last week. Much like Republicans in Texas, Democrats are taking the Michigan challenge seriously, with even former President Barack Obama visiting the state to campaign. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful, Michigan,\u201d Obama told a crowd of 5,000 last week in Michigan. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that despite all the noise, despite all the lies, we\u2019re going to come through all that. We\u2019re going to remember who we are, who we\u2019re called to be. I\u2019m hopeful because out of this political darkness, I\u2019m seeing a great awakening.\u201d James has seen support from prominent Republicans as well, with President Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Vice President Pence traveling to Michigan to make the rounds in the hopes of upsetting Stabenow\u2019s chances for another term. James is the first black Republican to run for statewide election in Michigan in four decades. JOHN JAMES FIRES UP GOP BASE WITH UNDERDOG MICHIGAN SENATE BID, AS POLLS TIGHTEN \u201cHe\u2019s a star, an absolute star,\u201d Jake Davison, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, told Fox News. \u201cHe has the base really fired up.\u201d But his bid remains a longshot. Despite the praise for James, Davison claimed he \u201chas no chance of beating Stabenow. \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t make any mistakes and that is why she wins,\u201d Davison said. \u201cShe is a machine.\u201d Meanwhile, in Indiana, Republican candidate Mike Braun is gaining a slight lead in the polls over incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. Braun, an Indiana businessman who has served in the state legislature, was initially trailing Donnelly, but said last week that \u201ceverything started to pick up.\u201d The midterm map continues to reflect a solid Republican advantage in the race for Senate control. Fox News\u2019 Power Rankings puts 50 seats in the Republican column (including those likely or leaning Republican, and GOP seats not up for election this year), and 45 in the Democratic column, with five races rated as \u201ctoss-up.\u201d Democrats continue to hold the edge in the race for the House. The Real Clear Politics map shows 205 House seats tilting Democratic, and 200 tilting Republican, with 30 in the \u201ctoss-up\u201d column. Fox News\u2019 Power Rankings similarly puts the split at 207 seats for Democrats and 197 for Republicans, and the rest up in the air. It takes 218 seats to claim a majority.

Developing now, Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - TRUMP WARNS AGAINST KAVANAUGH 'GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT' APPROACH TO SAUDI ARABIA: President Trump is cautioning against blaming Saudi Arabia for the disappearance of activist Jamal Khashoggi before an investigation was completed ... \u201cI think we have to find out what happened first,\u201d Trump said in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cHere we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned.\u201d Khashoggi, who had written critically about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the Washington Post, disappeared two weeks ago during a visit to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have said they feared Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate. Saudi leaders have denied any knowledge of \u00a0\nKhashoggi's fate or with being involved in his disappearance. Multiple media outlets reported Monday that the Saudi government may reveal publicly that rogue intelligence operatives murdered Khashoggi by mistake inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul earlier this month during an interrogation that went wrong. President Trump said he has talked to Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and both denied knowing what happened to\u00a0\nKhashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Saudi leaders on Tuesday, including the king and crown prince, and said he stressed the need for a \u201cthorough\u201d investigation. The Saudi leaders \u201cstrongly denied any knowledge of what took place in their consulate in Istanbul,\u201d Pompeo said in a news release from the State Department. He arrived in Turkey early Wednesday for talks over the Washington Post columnist's disappearance. FOX BUSINESS EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP VS. THE FED RESERVE: If you ask President Donald Trump, the biggest threat to his presidency isn\u2019t special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, or a potential insurgency by Democrats in the November midterm elections: It\u2019s the Federal Reserve ... \u201cMy biggest threat is the Fed,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday during an interview with FOX Business\u2019 Trish Regan. \u201cBecause the Fed is raising rates too fast, and it\u2019s too independent,\" he complained. So far this year, policymakers have already voted to hike short-term interest rates three times, and are poised to do so again in December, staying the course they laid out late last year. The Fed also forecast an additional three rate increases in 2019 and one in 2020. FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: FREED PASTOR REFLECTS ON 'A VERY DIFFICULT TIME': Evangelical Christian pastor Andrew Brunson, who was released from Turkish imprisonment on Friday, spoke to Sean Hannity on Tuesday night about his detention and his meeting with President Trump ... Brunson, who was at the center of a Turkish-U.S. diplomatic dispute that even had sparked outcry from American evangelical groups, was released to house arrest after almost two years in jail. The pastor, who was accused of terror-related charges, was convicted Friday yet released from custody for time served. Brunson told Hannity he was \"shocked\" to be charged with terrorism and explained what it was like to be held in an overcrowded prison cell. \u201cIt was a very difficult time. I was surprised because I had never considered prison as a possibility and the costs for that,\u201d the pastor replied. \u201cI was isolated by culture and by language but especially by religion. It was very difficult to be the only Christian among them.\u201d POCAHONTAS RELATIVE SLAMS 'FAUXCAHONTAS' WARREN: A descendant of 17th-century Powhatan princess Pocahontas called on U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to apologize for appropriating Native Americans' heritage for political and occupational gain ... Warren released DNA test results on Monday that she said proved her Native American ancestry. But President Trump and other Republican critics mocked the results as questionable at best, and some Democrats slammed Warren for taking the party off-message before the crucial midterm elections. Debbie White Dove Porreco said Tuesday on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that she is glad that Warren took the DNA test. Porreco asked that Warren do so in a May 1 appearance on the program. \"It did prove that she wasn't the Cherokee Indian that she was claiming to be for so long,\" she said. \"I think she's guilty of claiming she's an American Indian but has no proof -- and then [is] using it for applications for college and for political reasons.\" SPOILER ALERT - ROSEANNE LAMENTS HER CHARACTER'S FATE: (Editor's note: Skip this paragraph if you are a fan of Roseanne Barr and have not had a chance to watch the premiere of \"The Connors.\") \u00a0.... Roseanne Barr blasted ABC for killing off her character in the Tuesday night premiere of \"The Connors,\" a spinoff of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d reboot that was axed earlier this year after Barr posted a racist tweet about Obama-era official Valerie Jarrett. The show revealed that the controversial character was killed off by an overdose of prescription pain pills. Killing off the Roseanne Conner character, was \u201can unnecessary grim and morbid dimension to an otherwise happy family show,\u201d Barr and her rabbi, Shmuley Boteach, said in a joint statement.

            "article_content": "On Thursday, Laura Ingraham speaks on Google executives exposed in a leaked video sharing their feelings of despair after the election.  Then, Laura speaks on the Democrats pathetic efforts to scuttle Brett Kavanagh nomination to the Supreme Court.  Plus the latest updates on Hurricane Florence already leaving thousands without power. Immediately following the election, Google executives gathered to share their feelings of dejection and despair. A video recently leaked to Breitbart reveals the mind-set of Google's leadership from within their corporate safe space. This is co-founder Sergey Brin, \u201cYou know, let's face it, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad because of the election. Anyway, on a more serious note, you know, myself, as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive and I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201d Values? What are those Google values? After all this is a company that has actively worked with the Chinese communist regime for years. And right now, Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens. Translation, Google is helping China silence its political opposition. The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily. They have more than a million Muslims in reeducation camps, but the legitimate election of President Trump, somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values? Give me a break. Thursday, we learned that a senior Google research scientist named Jack Paulson was so disgusted by the company's collaboration with Chinese sensors that he has quit in protest. And I was thinking about this, you want to know the real reason that the Google execs were so exercised, so hurt by the election of Trump? Because he promised to hold Google's partner, China, accountable. To punish Chinese cheating on trade deals that hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. For Google and many other big manufacturers, the pre-Trump status quo was much easier. Keep that production overseas, lower wages, no regulation, no health care that you have to worry about for those employees over in China. And if it hurts America, so be it. After all, those blue-collar Americans will probably be Trump voters anyway. And of course, Google, they hate you deplorables. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENT WALKER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GOOGLE GLOBAL AFFAIRS: That fear, I think, not just in the United States, but around the world, is what is fueling concerns of xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Actually, Trump's found -- the answers are pretty easy. Two words, America first. Sure, Trump will work with the rest of the world. He's shown that, but on a much more level playing field. So why is Google so threatened by that? I'll tell you why. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALKER: History teaches us that there are periods of populism, of nationalism that rise up and that is all the reason we need to be in the arena, that is why we have to work so hard to make sure it doesn't turn into a world war or something catastrophic, but instead, is a blip, is a hick up. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, you stop a world war with your search engine. That's ridiculous. Like a liberal elites across politics, academia, and the entertainment industry, big tech doesn't really like the American voters who turned out for Trump. That is pretty obvious. Google thinks it knows better than their customers, after all, Google execs are richer than they are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUTH PORAT, GOOGLE CFO: People are leaving, staff is crying, we are going to lose. That was the first moment I really felt like we were going to lose. Everybody, if you could turn around or go to the person next to you, and do a hug. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's worse than a sign of peace at mass. Sorry, I'm not a sign of peace person. Hug, group hug. Trump won. Oh, my gosh. I needed comic relief today. That made me laugh more than anything else. But then huggy bear Ruth got down to business. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PORAT: Our values our strong, we will fight to protect them, and we will use the great strength and resources in which we have to continue to advance really important values. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Again, the word values. What values is Google talking about? Well, the left-wing globalist values that have helped enrich the oppressive Chinese regime at the expense of free expression and religious liberty, and of course, made Google execs really rich. Part of Google's disappointment was that their efforts in 2016 failed really spectacularly. Of course they claim that they are nonpartisan. But an e-mail leaked to my colleague Tucker Carlson show that the tech giant tried to turn out the Latino vote in 2016 because they were confident Latino voters would support Hillary. But can you imagine their surprise when they wake up on the morning after election and they see 29 percent of Latinos voting for Trump? They were gobsmacked. Google is not some local business practicing civic engagement, we should all stand up and cheer, oh, Google, go. Google is one of the most powerful companies on the planet. They are responsible for about 90 percent of all searches online, there are more than 1.2 trillion searches on Google each year, globally. More than 2 billion people use its Android mobile platform. And they've made $110.8 billion in revenue last year alone. But when smaller companies, smaller companies like Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby or In-n-Out burger, when they move in the smallest of ways to support more traditional or even conservative causes, those companies are sued and vilified nonstop by the mainstream media. When a giant like Google pledges to actively undermine the political will of the American people, the media don't cover it. And you know why? Because the media agree with the Google agenda. This is one of my favorite moments from the Google anti-Trump corporate rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIN: Last question, yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything positive you see from this election result? BRIN: Boy, that's a really tough one right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's actually not so tough. I love those beanies, by the way. I want one. I will get one for my kids. That's a tough one. Anything good that comes out of Trump's election. Well, how is this to try on for size. The economy is booming. Fair trade deals are being negotiated, wages are rising and blue-collar America is more optimistic about the future that they have been for decades. These Google execs should have to do public acts of penance for their petty, idiotic statements. Here's the bottom line. The Google gang and the rest of big tech were happier when America was losing to China. They didn't care that blue-collar America got poorer and communist China got richer and stronger. So long as Google got richer in the process. But today, President Trump is turning the tables on that sick dynamic. His policies are working. Google is still rich, of course. But the globalists, even though though the economy is going well, the globalists are still grumpy. That tells you all you need to know. And that's the \"Angle.\" Adapted from Laura Ingraham\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d on September 13.",

            "article_content": "Jason Kander announced he is withdrawing from the Kansas City mayoral race to focus on getting treatment for his depression and PTSD. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Army veteran and Kansas City, Missouri, mayoral contender Jason Kander announced Tuesday that he is withdrawing his candidacy to focus on his mental health. Kander, a Democrat largely seen as the frontrunner for the 2019 election, said he\u2019s struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cInstead of dealing with these issues, I\u2019ve always tried to find a way around them. Most recently, I thought that if I could come home and work for the city I love so much as its mayor, I could finally solve my problems,\u201d Kander, 37, said in a lengthy Facebook post. \u201cI thought if I focused exclusively on service to my neighbors in my hometown, that I could fill the hole inside of me. But it\u2019s just getting worse.\u201d Kander will also be taking a step back from his political nonprofit, Let America Vote, as he seeks treatment from the Veterans Affairs facility in Kansas City, he said. \u201cAfter 11 years of trying to outrun depression and PTSD symptoms, I have finally concluded that it\u2019s faster than me. That I have to stop running, turn around, and confront it,\u201d Kander said. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS Kander deployed to Afghanistan in 2006, where he served as an intelligence officer. He was tasked with investigating those suspected of espionage, drug trafficking and facilitating Al Qaeda and the Taliban, according to an online biography. He later became a combat leadership instructor for the Missouri Army National Guard\u2019s Officer Candidate School. He has served as Missouri\u2019s secretary of state and as a state legislator for a number of years. Kander also challenged GOP Sen. Roy Blunt last year, losing by less than 3 percentage points. Quinton Lucas, a city councilman who has also launched a mayoral bid, praised Kander on social media following the announcement. \u201cJason and I have been friends for years. He\u2019s always been a leader and he\u2019s shown that even more clearly now,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cThank you for telling other veterans, and all of us really, that we don\u2019t need to suffer in silence. The impact he made today on so many is profound and I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d EMANUEL\u2019S EXIT HEATS UP CROWDED, CHAOTIC CHICAGO MAYORAL RACE Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., called Kander\u2019s decision to publicly address why he was dropping out of the race \u201cvery courageous\u201d and said it could \u201chelp a lot of people.\u201d \u201cObviously we are friends,\u201d McCaskill told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u201cHe is a tremendous person, and he\u2019s got a great family, and I know he will have a great support system. A lot of us out here are rooting for him.\u201d Kander concluded his post by letting his followers know that he \u201cfully intend[s] to be working shoulder to shoulder with all of you again.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m passing my oar to you for a bit. I hope you\u2019ll grab it and fight like hell to make this country the place we know it can be,\u201d Kander said. Potential candidates still have until Jan. 8, 2019 to file to run for mayor, KSHB-TV reported.",

            "article_content": "Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CFO Ruth Porat were both upset following Donald Trump's general election victory, newly released video shows. (Getty Images) Not long after Donald Trump won the general election in 2016, the executives of Google held a company meeting in which they expressed their disappointment at the result, newly released video has revealed. The recording, which was provided anonymously to and reported by Breitbart News, was made by the tech giant and showed several of the company\u2019s leaders. At the top of the video, co-founder Sergey Brin said that he\u2019s aware \"this is probably not the most joyous TGIF we have had.\" \u201cYou know, let\u2019s face it, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad for \u2026 because of the election,\" Brin said. \u201cMyself, as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive and I know many of you do, too. And I think it\u2019s a very stressful time and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201d The video also showed that a vice president, Kent Walker, described the outcome of the election as \u201ca shock to all of us.\" \u201cIt was a shock to all of us, the results of the election. It was a fair and democratic process and we honor that,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBut at the same time it showed an incredible level of division among Americans and that\u2019s something that gives us pause and focuses on how did we misunderstand that, what can we do to reach out to people whose perspective we have a hard time understanding.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s not just a challenge for America. It\u2019s a challenge that goes well beyond America,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe implications for the rest of the world are vast. And the echoes around the world are significant. This is not the first sign we\u2019ve seen of this rising tide of nationalism, populism and concern.\u201d CFO Ruth Porat later took the stage and told the group that though she was a \u201clongtime Hillary supporter,\u201d she respected \u201cthe outcome of the democratic process.\u201d \u201cWho any one of us voted for is really not the point, because the values that are held dear at this company transcend politics, because we\u2019re going to constantly fight to preserve them,\u201d she said. In a statement provided to Fox News, a Google spokesperson confirmed that at a previously planned meeting, some company employees shared \u201ctheir own personal views\u201d following the presidential election. However, the spokesperson said, none of the comments indicated \u201cthat any political bias ever influences\u201d how their products are constructed or designed to perform. \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint,\u201d the statement continued. LEAKED GOOGLE EMPLOYEE\u2019S EMAIL REVEALS EFFORT TO BOOST LATINO VOTE, SURPRISE THAT SOME VOTED FOR TRUMP Media Research Center President Brent Bozell, in a statement to Fox News, slammed the comments in the video. \u201cThis video is the smoking gun. Google\u2019s leadership is decidedly anti-Trump and there is no doubt that their company practices reflect that,\u201d Bozell said. \u201cWe need hearings now. Google cannot continue to run and hide.\u201d The video revelation comes on the heels of accusations of political bias leveled against Google after an employee\u2019s leaked email mentioned the company\u2019s efforts with a Latino nonprofit prior to the 2016 election. The email, written by Google\u2019s former head of multicultural marketing and obtained exclusively by Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d details various ways the company worked to increase voter turnout. However, a spokesperson for Google fired back at the claims Wednesday, saying that \u201cthe employee\u2019s email is an expression of her personal political views about the outcome of the 2016 election and those views do not reflect any official stance by the company.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Brian Flood and Christopher Carbone contributed to this report.",

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham. And this is \"The\u00a0\nIngraham Angle,\" live once again from Arizona tonight. We're just four days away from the critical midterm elections. And there\u00a0\nare only two things that currently hang in the balance. An economy as\u00a0\nevidenced by today's job reports. It's a roaring, my friends, and an\u00a0\nimmigration policy that makes sense. And my simple message is this. Let's not stop success, America. Since we're\u00a0\nhere in the Grand Canyon state we thought it was really important to talk\u00a0\nto some of the voters here. So I'm talking about people of different\u00a0\npolitical affiliations, different races different, walks of life to hear\u00a0\nfirsthand what really matters most to them ahead of Tuesday's elections. Now these are the voters who are going to decide in the neck and neck\u00a0\nArizona race now between Martha McSally, Republican, and Democrat Kyrsten\u00a0\nSinema. We're going to McSally just ahead. But first we want to hear from the voters themselves. We started this evening with the pressing issue of immigration and how\u00a0\nillegals have affected this border state. Raymond Arroyo joined me for the questioning of this group. Here's part\u00a0\none. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: I want to bring with an issue that is front and center right now\u00a0\nand that's the issue of immigration. Now there are multiple caravans\u00a0\nbarreling toward our southern border, and as border state here in Arizona a\u00a0\nlot of the migrants could end up in your own backyard. So, show of hands here. How many of you think we should welcome all members\u00a0\nof the caravan despite evidence that there are criminals within the group?\u00a0\nRaise your hand. All members of the caravan. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think there's criminals in the group. RAYMOND ARROYO, DIRECTOR AND LEAD ANCHOR, EWTN: You don't think there are\u00a0\nny criminals? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. I don't think there are criminal, there are women\u00a0\nand children who are trying to get away from fear and military dictators\u00a0\nand all kinds of other problems in their countries and they're looking for-\n- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Actually, Griff Jenkins was our correspondent down and he's been\u00a0\nwith the caravan for a number of days. He interviewed various members of\u00a0\nthe caravan and this is what he found out on Sunday. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Are you willing to break the law to\u00a0\nget back to the United States? (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She says he wants to apply to pardon for the felony\u00a0\nhe committed. JENKINS: Can you ask him exactly what happened? (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Number three. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A third-degree felony. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Attempted murder. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Dan, your reaction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My reaction is that most of these women and children\u00a0\nand families were coming here for asylum and they are doing it the right\u00a0\nway. That you have to go to a port of entry, you have to turn yourself in\u00a0\nat a port of entry and you have to apply for asylum. Now if they don't fit asylum then they have to go back. But if they meet\u00a0\nthe criteria for asylum, they're not breaking the law, they should be\u00a0\nentered, let them. INGRAHAM: Now listen to what President Trump has to say about the way\u00a0\nwomen feel about this caravan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want them in our\u00a0\ncountry and women don't want them in our country. Women want security. Men\u00a0\ndon't want them in our country, but the women do not want them. Women want\u00a0\nsecurity. ARROYO: Terry, I saw you nodding your head or shaking your head a minute\u00a0\nago. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't care if nobody is a criminal. Have some\u00a0\nrespect for this country and do it the legal way. I'm a lifelong Democrat.\u00a0\nI switch over for Trump just to vote for him. I've always felt this way. If\u00a0\nwe these people come in this way it's going to set precedents. There is suffering everywhere in the world. Where do we draw the line?\u00a0\nCharity starts at home. Let's take care of our own, first and foremost.\u00a0\nThen we do it the legal way, not illegally. INGRAHAM: Laura, I see Roy sitting next to Terry chomping it a bit. Go\u00a0\nahead, Roy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, to hear Trump say that women don't want the\u00a0\ncaravan to come in. I'm not sure number one the women don't want to be\u00a0\naround Donald Trump. But first and foremost, I will say that, you know,\u00a0\nlet's got to the process. Let's process each case by case. If was a proper\u00a0\nsystem of immigration in place then we can properly vet those that will try\u00a0\nto enter the country and decipher who's a criminal and who was seeking\u00a0\nasylum. ARROYO: Julie, you wanted to say what? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is a system how to come to this country. I am\u00a0\nan immigrant and I did it the right way. You file your paperwork, to get\u00a0\napproved. You come here. It's as simple as that. INGRAHAM: Well, here's problem is that right now our system is being\u00a0\ngamed. That's what a lot of people view that the asylum system, it's a good\u00a0\nthing that allow people to come in for asylum for certain credible fears. Fear of religious persecution, fear of ethnic cleansing, true fears of\u00a0\npersecution for, you know, political outlook. But what's happening for most\u00a0\nof these migrants. And we had the Mexican ambassador and the Guatemalan\u00a0\ninterior minister on the other night on the Angle and they both said that\u00a0\nmost of these migrants overwhelmingly their economic. They're coming because hundreds of millions of people around the world.\u00a0\nAmerica is a great place to live. It's better than most countries in the\u00a0\nworld, and so they want to come there. Let's go to Sergio. INGRAHAM: Laura, I want to, you know, what the media isn't showing is that\u00a0\ntheir passing live feeds of what's happening in Mexico with this caravan\u00a0\nand the caravan is assaulting police officers and they're throwing rocks\u00a0\nand they're leaving trash and they're tearing apart the country of Mexico. You have people there, their own Mexican residents that are living there,\u00a0\nthat are saying go back to your countries, stop tearing up ours. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But there was also a feeling in there, you have a good\u00a0\nand being welcome in different parts of the community. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But they're taking this mindset and they're coming and\u00a0\nthey're bringing it down to this border. ARROYO: Yvonne on the top there. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm an immigrant to this country and I came here\u00a0\nlegally. It took me 10 years to get my citizenship and I also worked in the\u00a0\nhealthcare industry. And you know they look at this caravan. This is an\u00a0\norganized group. I really felt an invasion of our country. I mean, this is an organized caravan. They have people that have trucks,\u00a0\nthey are hauling these people on the freeway, you know, and then they look\u00a0\nat the caravan, they are finding that 80 percent of it are men and less\u00a0\nthan 20 percent are women and children. INGRAHAM: Again, the officials that are monitoring this, the Mexican\u00a0\nofficials, the Guatemalan officials both that we've talk to and that we've\u00a0\ninterviewed have confirmed them. They are overwhelmingly able-bodied\u00a0\nworking age men, women and children being put in the front. And the\u00a0\ndescription of one of -- from one of the officials was almost like a human\u00a0\nshield. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. INGRAHAM: That's a fact. That's not a political opinion no matter what\u00a0\npeople think about immigration, that's fine, but it's not political\u00a0\nopinion. That's a fact. And I have a question, how many of you here and you're all of different\u00a0\nbackgrounds and political persuasions, object to the use of the word\u00a0\ninvasion? Raise your hand. So that's about half, about split. How many of the people who object to the use of the word invasion are\u00a0\nDemocrats? Raise your hand? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are coming here with their own flag, flying their\u00a0\nown flag. They drew a Swastika. I mean, American flag and burned it in\u00a0\nfront of the Honduran-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: First-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's an invasion. I'm sorry. It's an invasion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are people that fly the Confederate flag today. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm sorry. If that -- let's stay with the equal\u00a0\nimmigration. I'm sorry. (CROSSTALK)sorry. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no. But there are people that fly-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you want to come to this country, don't burn our\u00a0\nflag. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are people that fly the Confederate flag, so\u00a0\nyou're talking about they are burning our flag. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. INGRAHAM: OK. All right. ARROYO: Am I going to have to separate you two? INGRAHAM: All right. Back row. Hold on. We got to give everybody and\u00a0\neverybody a viewpoint here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, in terms of being organized, how is that different\u00a0\nthan caravans of boats that came over with what we call pilgrims which were\u00a0\nsimply European refugees, how is that any different when we're talking\u00a0\nabout caravans and invasions but we're not talking about what is the\u00a0\noriginal in the invasion of this or where we sit? We are in an invaded land that we invaded. Well, not I, not I, right. But\u00a0\n(Inaudible) like me invaded this land. INGRAHAM: Well, I think how many here believe that in part, these caravans\u00a0\nhave a political motivation in their organization? Raise your hand. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think so-- (CROSSTALK) ARROYO: Certainly-- INGRAHAM: We're going to get to that. Let's watch. Remember, everybody has\u00a0\nto get a point. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wanted to say something here. INGRAHAM: Clyde? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just wanted to mention harking back to what you said\u00a0\nregarding gaming the system and what that gentleman said is probably true.\u00a0\nWe've been gaming the system ever since we arrived by the Mayflower. That's\u00a0\nwhy I believe we have laws and that's why I think we have the system. I think we do need comprehensive immigration. I got here in 1969, I've been\u00a0\nhere in the same story over and over and over again. So, I think that we\u00a0\nneed to take the rule of law and we need to enforce it. And when you said\u00a0\nwelcome I'm not sure what that means. We're a welcoming country that can\u00a0\nvet each and every individual and use the power of the United States of\u00a0\nAmerica to keep us the United States of America. ARROYO: There was an important thing we learned at the very beginning.\u00a0\nThis is a half Republican half Democratic group, only one person said they\u00a0\nwanted to welcome that caravan. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. ARROYO: It's very interesting the way these Arizona voters are breaking\u00a0\nout. This is similar to what I found when we were in Texas last week. INGRAHAM: Right. ARROYO: Very similar. Now as you know, President Trump has moved or vowed\u00a0\nto move 15,000 troops to the border. INGRAHAM: Already moved the initial to Texas, the Texas border which is\u00a0\nwhere most of these migrants will arrive within the next month. ARROYO: And President Obama is now responding. We want to play this for\u00a0\nyou and get your reaction. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're even taking\u00a0\nour brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the\u00a0\nborder. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: And the men and women of our military deserve better than that. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Is this a political stunt in your mind. Raise your hand if you\u00a0\nbelieve it's a political stunt. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Hold on. Raise your hand if you believe there is no reason to\u00a0\nhave the U.S. military on the border and it's purely politics. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is politics. INGRAHAM: All right. Hold on. We got to give everybody here a voice. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. INGRAHAM: yes, sir? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. It is purely politics and I believe this rhetoric\u00a0\nis dangerous. I want to go back to the word invasion. We are the greatest\u00a0\ncountry in the entire world and we are scared of a caravan from her folks\u00a0\nwere coming to seek asylum. I thought that we can have better use of our\u00a0\ntroops' time and resources. Here in Arizona at any given time where I live in my community we have over\u00a0\n500 homeless youth. One in four children go hungry. I don't feel this is a\u00a0\ngreat way to utilize our nation's resources. And so, again, we have to be\u00a0\nvery careful when we use the word invasion. I don't see this as an\u00a0\ninvasion. INGRAHAM: How many people here are aware of the percentage of drugs coming\u00a0\ninto the country that come through Arizona. Let's have some gases. What\u00a0\npercentage of drugs come through Arizona? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sixty percent. INGRAHAM: Six? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sixty percent. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Forty percent. INGRAHAM: Bingo. Forty percent of the drugs coming into the country come\u00a0\nthrough our southern border. The poorest nature of our border. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But I also don't trust some current law enforcement we\u00a0\nhave. I don't feel that they need babysitters. We have thousands of border\u00a0\npatrol agents. INGRAHAM: I have another question for the crowd and then we got to move on\u00a0\nto another topic. Another question for the crowd, OK. Here's another\u00a0\nquestion. Do you prefer our military to enforce the borders of other\u00a0\ncountries which they're doing in Syria and Iraq, on Afghanistan, and mostly\u00a0\nin the Middle East or enforcing if necessary the borders of the United\u00a0\nStates? First question, do you want the military enforcing the borders of\u00a0\nother countries or the border of the United States? let's go to-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm with the -- totally OK with the military\u00a0\nprotecting our borders, provided that we were being attacked. I feel like\u00a0\nthat the nation is crippled in fear right now. I need to party in. Sorry. Everybody is like, just polarized because everybody really bad for\u00a0\neverybody is good and there is no in the middle, like Ricardo said the\u00a0\ncaravan there's a lot of people who are at the border already who walked\u00a0\nwhatever that are really seeking asylum. So we can't want everybody\u00a0\ntogether-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Does asylum mean-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- anyone or the other. INGRAHAM: -- seeking a job in the United States? Is that asylum? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. But it's where-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Because that's what most of the people at the caravan want. So,\u00a0\nthey want to have-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I agree. I believe the caravan is like probably a\u00a0\nlittle different. But the-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: No, that's actually not. The caravan is overwhelmingly -- the\u00a0\ncaravan according to DHS, according to the Mexican and Guatemalan officials\u00a0\nthere's a lot are great people, a lot of great people there. But\u00a0\noverwhelmingly when you -- when they're interviewed, overwhelmingly before\u00a0\ntheir, you know, their coach they're interviewed their said they want to\u00a0\nwork. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right, right. INGRAHAM: And they want their family members are here. I -- and I mean I\u00a0\nthink a lot of people understand that. It's very different from a\u00a0\nsystematic, ethnic cleansing, systematic persecution, the Christians in the\u00a0\nMiddle East are being beheaded, buried alive with their heads. That's a\u00a0\ndifferent type of situation. So, we got to be careful with their\u00a0\nterminology. Another issue which is as a nation gripped right now is the issue of race.\u00a0\nI want to play for this group all of your different backgrounds what is\u00a0\nbeing said lately about President Trump. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN HEILEMANN, NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, MSNBC: The president is\u00a0\nobviously a racist, he's obviously a demagogue. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, ANCHOR, MSNBC: The rhetoric of this racist, heartless,\u00a0\nsoulless man will lead to more violence. Yes, I said that, and a lot of\u00a0\nAmericans believe it too. DON LEMON, CNN HOST: To make it appeal to fear and hate is what it is and\u00a0\nit is racist. The president has always used fear to his advantage. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Show of hands, how many people think those media appraisals are\u00a0\naccurate. One, two, three, four. Who feels they're unfair? Why? Juttia. JULLIA LUNARIO, DEMOCRAT: I don't see the president as a person that is a\u00a0\nracist. He has shown that he has had many people of difference backgrounds,\u00a0\nethnic everything and I don't think race is the issue. It is, I don't like\u00a0\nyou. I don't care because-- (CROSSTALK) ARROYO: What did I do to you, Juttia? LUNARIO: -- because who you are. It doesn't matter of your background\u00a0\nwhether you were English, German, white, Asian, it doesn't matter. It's\u00a0\nconstantly used to make this man look bad. Use something different. Try\u00a0\nsomething new. INGRAHAM: How many people here believe that the charge of racism is used\u00a0\ntoo casually in the United States? Raise your hand. ARROYO: Why? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, racism is (Inaudible) ARROYO: Clyde? CLYDE BOWEN, REPUBLICAN: Well, I just think that what you're seeing is the\u00a0\nlast gasp of desperate group that needs -- that needs votes because that's\u00a0\nall the Democrats have. And you notice they are very quiet about Louis\u00a0\nFarrakhan. I went to the same school as he did in Boston and I know quite a\u00a0\nlot about that gentleman and nothing is said about the things that he has\u00a0\nsaid such as the Jews bring termites. And going back -- I'm sorry. Going back to the original time that he first\u00a0\ngot started. So, I would say that they're just using that and I'm not\u00a0\nsaying that. And yes, we've got a president that's kind of a newbie of\u00a0\nbeing a president and he is himself and he is a human being. But I would just say that they just using this is race baiting and race.\u00a0\nAnd if you crack a history book, you would see who very surely is the\u00a0\nperson who as the guy who in many of the situation concerning race with\u00a0\nAfrican-Americans. ROY TATEM, JR., DEMOCRAT: If you crack a history book you'll see today was\u00a0\n287 years of slavery based on race. It wasn't based on anything else. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And propagated by the Democrats and propagated by the\u00a0\nDemocrats from day one. TATEM: Here in America. That is not race. We're not talking political-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, in '13, '14, and '15-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: And the party -- and the party that-- TATEM: We're not talking about politics. We're talking about base on-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: No. TATEM: Hold on, hold on, we're talking about base on race. I let them.\u00a0\nThey're already talk. Can I make my point? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. TATEM: We're talking about base on race. African-Americans have been\u00a0\nenslaved. African-American after slavery in 1865 was subjugated to a 100\u00a0\nyears of Jim Crow lynching, disenfranchise men base on race. So, they only\u00a0\nsay that the only people that are playing race identity politics have no\u00a0\nmerit. There's a huge merit. INGRAHAM: Sorry, Roy. TATEM: No, no, there's a huge merit to-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Sorry. OK. Well, she hasn't spoken out. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Also, the Jewish community, too. You cannot-- (CROSSTALK) TATEM: I'm not talking about -- we're talking about race. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't -- she asks a specific question. (CROSSTALK) TATEM: We're talking about race. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Laura ask a specific question-- INGRAHAM: OK. One at a time. ARROYO: OK. Roy, let's give her chance to response. TATEM: I'm not negating it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She ask a specific question about whether Trump and\u00a0\neverybody, is he racist. He is not. It is an excuse. There is no proof.\u00a0\nThere is no background. TATEM: Do you know? INGRAHAM: Well, let's just -- let one person speak, guys UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's actually -- yes. My good friend Mary Anne\u00a0\nMendoza knows him. Yes, absolutely. Don't -- its not personal. TATEM: You're racist. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Roy, this is not personal. TATEM: You're racist-- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're make a convoluted argument when you start\u00a0\nbringing slavery. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They do. TATEM: I'm not making a convoluted, I'm giving you the background. I'm\u00a0\ngiving-- (CROSSTALK) ARROYO: OK, one at a time. INGRAHAM: OK. Guys, economic to opportunity in the United States we're to\u00a0\nget into this what happened economically and whether that has an effect in\u00a0\nmaking people see things may be a little bit differently, especially Latino\u00a0\ncommunities, African-American communities, Asian communities and how\u00a0\nprosperity is rising across the board. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Up next, Trace Gallagher is going to highlight some of the\u00a0\ntightest Senate races and then we're going to talk to Arizona Republican\u00a0\nsenatorial candidate Martha McSally. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: All right. We're just four days away from the midterms and some\u00a0\nof these races are in dead heat including right here in Arizona. In\u00a0\nmoments, we'll talk with Republican Senate candidate Martha McSally. But first, Fox's Trace Gallagher joins us now with an important update.\u00a0\nTrace? TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Laura. If you look at just\u00a0\nthe Fox News polls over the past two months, the Indiana Senate races is\u00a0\nseen a significant shift in the numbers. In September, GOP challenger Mike Braun was up by two points over\u00a0\nDemocratic incumbent Joe Donnelly. In early October, that flipped and\u00a0\nDonnelly was up by two. Now Donnelly has increased the lead to seven\u00a0\npoints, but don't write off Mike Braun just yet because according to the\u00a0\nReal Clear Politics average Donnelly is up by less than one point. Meaning\u00a0\nthis race still appears to be a dead heat. In the show me state Senate race no matter what poles you look at it is a\u00a0\ntossup. The RCP average has Republican challenger Josh Hawley leading by\u00a0\ntwo points over Missouri Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and that's\u00a0\nwithin the margin of error. The Fox News poll has them deadlocked at 43 percent each. And it's been\u00a0\nthat way for the past month. And we should know that polls also show\u00a0\nMissouri Democrats appear to be more interested in the election than\u00a0\nMissouri Republicans even though 54 percent of likely Missouri voters\u00a0\napprove of the president's job performance. The Florida Senate race seems to change with the seasons. For most of the\u00a0\nspring Democratic incumbent Senator Bill Nelson held a very steady leave\u00a0\nover Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott. Then came summer and Rick\u00a0\nScott took the lead, but now leaves have changed and so have the polls. According to the RCP average, Bill Nelson is back on top by two points. It\u00a0\nappears Rick Scott could use a heat wave. Finally, the Arizona where Fox News poll showed Democrat Krysten Sinema and\u00a0\nRepublican Martha McSally dead even at 46 percent each. That's a bad trend\u00a0\nfor Sinema who was up by two points in early October and up three in\u00a0\nSeptember, although the Real Clear Politics average still has Sinema by\u00a0\njust over half point. But all of these polls were taken before Green party candidate Angela\u00a0\nGreene dropped out and endorse Krysten Sinema. And we should note Sinema\u00a0\nwas a green party activist but has tried very hard to distance herself from\u00a0\nher past. Laura? INGRAHAM: All right. Thanks so much, Trace. And joining me now to discuss\u00a0\nthat latest toss up that Trace just mentioned is a woman vying to become\u00a0\nits next senator, Republican Martha McSally, of Arizona. Congresswoman, thanks for being here tonight. I want to start with\u00a0\nimmigration. We just completed a focus group so important for the voters of\u00a0\nthe state. How is your view on immigration different from your opponent's? REP. MARTHA MCSALLY, R\u2014ARIZ.: Well, it's like night and day. I\u00a0\nrepresent a border district. I chair the border security subcommittee and\u00a0\nI'm leading working with President Trump to make sure we build the wall,\u00a0\nsecure the border, close these crazy loopholes that are being taken\u00a0\nadvantage of every single day, end chain migration, to visa lottery, and\u00a0\nyou know, move forward in a way that is protecting Americans. My opponent was actually an activist helping people cross illegally in her\u00a0\npast and even though she had amazing political makeover trying to fool the\u00a0\nvoters here, she's voted to support sanctuary cities. And on really\u00a0\nimportant vote here that's meaningful in Arizona is she voted against\u00a0\nGrant's Law. This was named after Grant-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Grant Ronnebeck. MCSALLY: Yes. And the Angel families have endorsed me just ahead a press\u00a0\nconference the other day. She refused to meet with them. Grant was shot\u00a0\npoint-blank by somebody who shouldn't haven't here and should have been\u00a0\nheld until they were deported. And that law actually protects people in our\u00a0\ncommunity and she refused to vote yes on this. So, she's extreme and out of\u00a0\ntouch and out of the mainstream-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Well, she's trying to be a centrist on this. I want to play\u00a0\nsomething for you because she's basically saying I'm just as good as Martha\u00a0\nMcSally on issues like sending troops to the border. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRSTEN SINEMA, D, ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE: Here in Arizona it's not new for us to\u00a0\nhave military deployment to the border to provide a support role for our\u00a0\ncustoms and border patrol agents who were down there. So, we wish them well\u00a0\nand tell them to stay hydrated. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCSALLY: Give me a break. I mean, she has no idea what she's talking\u00a0\nabout, and she is in the liberal witness protection program right now\u00a0\nbecause border security is so important to all Arizonans. You know,\u00a0\nthoughtful Democrat and that's not an oxymoron because, you know, that\u00a0\nthere are still some who care about safety and security, independence in\u00a0\nRepublicans. Look, she's extreme on this issue. Look, I am totally support,\u00a0\nwholeheartedly support President Trump sending our troops in a support role\u00a0\nto secure our border. They support natural disasters. This is a disaster\u00a0\ngoing on in the border. INGRAHAM: She basically says the same thing. MCSALLY: Yes. Stay hydrated, right. You know, give me a break. So, look, I\u00a0\nwelcome to our community. They're coming to Davis-Monthan in Fort Huachuca.\u00a0\nI know they are going to do a great job. You know, I served in the\u00a0\nmilitary. They are serving and sacrificing. Border security is national\u00a0\nsecurity and this is-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Some of our focus group that we just did claim this is all big\u00a0\npolitical stunt. MCSALLY: Absolutely not, no, it's not. Look, we have cartels that are\u00a0\ntrafficking people and drugs through our communities right now. I represent\u00a0\nranchers on the border, they've endorsed me, so are the border patrol\u00a0\nagents representing 15,000 agents. They know the dangerous activity that's\u00a0\nhappening every single day on our border. INGRAHAM: Birthright citizenship important issue a lot of Arizona\u00a0\nhospitals affected by this migrant families, women come, have their\u00a0\nchildren automatic passport, automatic American citizenship. Your view. MCSALLY: Yes. And then we see a Chinese are coming over. There's a whole\u00a0\nfraudulent way for them to do that. Look, I appreciate the president is\u00a0\nbringing this up and the abuses of it. If we actually secure the border and\u00a0\nwe actually crackdown on illegal immigration and close these loopholes, we\u00a0\nwouldn't even be having these conversations. So, once again, you know, he's highlighting things that are being abused.\u00a0\nYou know-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Fourteen amendment covered or not in your view? MCSALLY: I'm not a constitutional expert. I just think if we secure our\u00a0\nborder and close these loopholes then we would stop his from happening\u00a0\nagain. INGRAHAM: The migrant lawsuit against President Trump and the\u00a0\nadministration. It's a, you know, six kids are in it. Six kids and a number\u00a0\nof Honduran nationals saying what the president said, in part, I'm\u00a0\nmentioning our show. \"The legal problem with Trump's plan to stop caravan\u00a0\npersons from entering this country that plaintiffs are seeking asylum.\" And goes on to say, \"and Trump simply cannot stop them from legally doing\u00a0\nso or using the military or anyone.\" MCSALLY: You can't make this up. I mean, this is just another example of\u00a0\npeople trying to take advantage of the weaknesses in our laws that we in\u00a0\nCongress need to fix. My bill which you also very strongly supported, often\u00a0\ncalled the Goodlatte bill, that it was the Goodlatte-McSally bill, McCaul\u00a0\nand Labrador. We work really hard on this and with President Trump to close\u00a0\nthese loopholes, to make sure that people can't just show up and demand to\u00a0\nbe in our country and be released into the interior of the United States. This is happening every single day here in Arizona. Hundreds of little mini\u00a0\ncaravans are taking advantage of this and now they're trying to sue the\u00a0\npresident? This has to stop. We must secure our border now. INGRAHAM: Are you worried about this Green party Cook now endorsing\u00a0\nSinema. It was pulling about 6 percent. But she's a centrist, but suddenly\u00a0\nthe Green party person likes the centrist as well? MCSALLY: Well, Sinema was actually the Green party activist and first ran\u00a0\nfor office as Green party ran of Ralph Nader's campaign. So, it actually I\u00a0\nthink is, you know, a completion of her being identified for who she truly\u00a0\nis. This, Angela Green, the Green party candidate was true to herself as a\u00a0\nliberal. And the fact that she is getting behind Sinema hopefully should\u00a0\nhave people wake up and realize Sinema is not a moderate. She's an extreme\u00a0\nliberal. She's out of the mainstream and this just brings it back to full\u00a0\ncircle of where her roots are. INGRAHAM: Why is this race so close? MCSALLY: Money. Chuck Schumer, George Soros and others have poured tens of\u00a0\nmillions of dollars into Krysten Sinema to present this image to the\u00a0\nArizona voters that she's actually right of center. It's not true. It's the\u00a0\nbiggest political cover-up in Arizona history. I just ask people across the country here are listening. If you want to\u00a0\nhelp us make sure we keep this seat. You know, we pick up North Dakota, we\u00a0\ndon't want to cancel it out in Arizona, right. This is for everybody, not\u00a0\njust in Arizona. Please go to McSallyforSenate.com. We need people to contribute. But we\u00a0\nneed people to get off the sidelines in Arizona. So, tell your friends and\u00a0\nfamily to get out to the polls to make sure that we hold this seat. This is\u00a0\nabout the direction of our country. INGRAHAM: One to 10 how important is the Trump factor here in Arizona.\u00a0\nHe's very popular. MCSALLY: It's very important. I look at John Junior was out yesterday. You\u00a0\nknow, President was here a couple of weeks ago. I flew at Marine One. I'm\u00a0\nworking very closely with him on so many things. We're building our\u00a0\nmilitary, securing our border. Look at the economy. I mean, it's amazing. We want to keep things going and\u00a0\nthat's what this election is about. INGRAHAM: Congressman, best of luck. (CROSSTALK) MCSALLY: Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it. INGRAHAM: Close it hard for a strong close. And if you like what you saw\u00a0\nfrom the first part of our focus group, stay right there. Up next, the\u00a0\nTrump effect. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Illegal immigrant should they get free healthcare in the United\u00a0\nStates? Raise your hand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. INGRAHAM: Free healthcare for illegal immigrant? (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, you'll have to pay through our-- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Free college? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Free college. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: As you'd expect, President Donald Trump looms large over these\u00a0\nmidterms no matter what party you are supporting. What did our focus group\u00a0\nthink about the so-called \"Trump effect?\" Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: It's 29 percent approval rating now among African-Americans in\u00a0\nthe latest poll for this president, 29 percent. It was 11 percent, and\u00a0\nthis is not a conservative poll. This is I believe the Harvard-Harris\u00a0\npoll. So that's a significant increase. Why do we think that's happening?\u00a0\nAnd do we think Democrats are freaking out about that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, they are. ROY TATEM JR., DEMOCRAT: I see more reports over a long period of time.\u00a0\nStatistics show that people no longer report, or are no longer on the books\u00a0\nwhen they are unemployed for a long period of time. And many African-\nAmericans have experienced long-term unemployment, so they aren't even\u00a0\nbeing counted. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the unemployment rate of the African-American\u00a0\ncommunity is the lowest it's ever been. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But he said it's not real, the number is not real. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's what he said. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's racist. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has done more for the Latino and black community\u00a0\nthan Obama ever did, and I voted for the man. He has done more -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Guys, guys, we have to move on from this topic. But, is -- to\u00a0\nclose this out, do charges of racism encourage more speech or limit speech?\u00a0\nI get the sense that people kind of pull back when the charge is made, that\u00a0\npeople pull back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We just witnessed neo-Nazis marching in\u00a0\nCharlottesville. INGRAHAM: Tristian? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You wanted to say something,\u00a0\nTristian. INGRAHAM: Tristian? TRISTIAN ROPA, DEMOCRAT: I don't feel like people are pulling back at all.\u00a0\nWe just recently with these last three events that happened just recently.\u00a0\nAnd I don't like to point out this political did this. That's useless and\u00a0\ndivisive. But we should acknowledge that the guy that sent all these\u00a0\nbombs, he did have that van and he was a devout supporter. And then with\u00a0\nthe shooting in the synagogue, he was a devout supporter. INGRAHAM: No, he wasn't a -- no, no. He was not. ROPA: Thank you for correcting me. INGRAHAM: And Steve Scalise was almost killed and he was a Bernie Sanders\u00a0\nsupporter. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: You guys can't dominate. ARROYO: We are listening to Tristian. INGRAHAM: We have Tristian is a young person. ROPA: And thank you for calling me out on that, for real. Thank you. But\u00a0\nstill, the climate that we are in right now, people are really willing to\u00a0\ndo and say these things. And it's not a right or left thing. It's all\u00a0\nover the place. I feel like conversation is -- there is a lot of\u00a0\nconversation and sometimes it gets really messy. And honestly, that's sad. ARROYO: How many people here, so of hands, will race affect your vote in\u00a0\nthis midterm election? Is race important to you and the way it's been\u00a0\ndepicted. INGRAHAM: And your vote. ARROYO: And your vote. INGRAHAM: OK, we have got to move on guys. I want to get into the idea\u00a0\nthat this election -- many people are saying it's a referendum on President\u00a0\nTrump. So regardless of which party you are voting for, is there anyone\u00a0\nhere only voting on Tuesday as a pro or anti-Trump sentiment? Raise your\u00a0\nhand. Is it about Trump for you on Tuesday? Raise your hand. OK. ARROYO: As a Democrat. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not. ARROYO: You're not a Democrat. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's an independent. ARROYO: You're an independent. RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You're paying back now, aren't you? (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: The current economy today is at the strongest it's been in my\u00a0\nlifetime. There's never been a better time to be a small business owner,\u00a0\nto be entering the workforce for the first time, never a better time.\u00a0\nToday the news came out, 3.5 percent, wage increase which is the largest\u00a0\nwe've had since 2009. Unemployment is down to a 1967 low which is\u00a0\nfantastic across all economic strata. How many of you here today give\u00a0\nTrump credit for this economic revival on the wage increase? Raise you\u00a0\nhand. You haven't spoken, another young person. I want to hear from the youth. TEANA LONG, DEMOCRAT: I go to school up north. I'm in a small town. And\u00a0\nthe wage increases have really affected our small town, because, like I\u00a0\nsaid, it's very small. So it's really hard not only to find jobs because\u00a0\nsmall businesses can't afford to pay its workers, but it's really hard -- a\u00a0\nlot of companies are going out of business and we are losing a lot of\u00a0\nreally valuable companies that are really important to our market. DEBE CAMPOS FLEENOR, REPUBLICAN: I am a small business owner, Latino\u00a0\nowned, woman owned, and actually the taxes from Trump have done very well\u00a0\nfor our small business. INGRAHAM: Tax cuts? FLEENOR: Yes. INGRAHAM: What have they resulted in? FLEENOR: Right here, $1,200. So that's pretty good. It gives me the\u00a0\nopportunity to pay my employees the wage increase that was forced upon me,\u00a0\ninstead of cutting hours. INGRAHAM: How many Democrats here, those of you who are Democrats, are you\u00a0\nconcerned that the House of Representatives being turned over to Democrats\u00a0\nwould upset the economic recovery? Raise your hand. Even if you voted\u00a0\nDemocrat, are you concerned about the economy being adversely affected? PILAR RUIZ, DEMOCRAT: I am. From southern Arizona, I'm a neighbor with\u00a0\nRaul Grijalva, district three. And that is one of the poorest districts in\u00a0\nthe country. And he is a Democrat and I am a Democrat, but you know what,\u00a0\nfor me it's not always about party line. It's about what are you doing for\u00a0\nthe people. And him and his daughter have hurt southern Arizona, Adelita\u00a0\nGrijalva, more than any other politicians in Arizona in my opinion. So\u00a0\nthat regards, I don't want that man in office. We need Republican in\u00a0\ndistrict three to win that race because -- I know it's not going to happen\u00a0\nbut it needs to happen because that district is extremely poor. There is\u00a0\nno economic growth. There is no nothing. INGRAHAM: How many of you here will miss Jeff Flake? Raise your hand.\u00a0\nHow many of you here will miss Jeff Flake in the U.S. Senate? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only his sanity. INGRAHAM: He has about an 18 percent approval rating, but that's OK.\u00a0\nWhile we are talking about Arizona, this is what Kyrsten Sinema, of course\u00a0\nthe Democrat who wants to be your next senator, said about the state she\u00a0\nhopes to represent. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRSTEN SIMENA, (D-AZ) SENATE CANDIDATE: So all around the world people\u00a0\nknow what's happening in Arizona, and not in a good way. We're not famous\u00a0\nin a good way. We're kind of like in a Lindsay Lohan kind of famous way. The states are the laboratories of democracies, and in my state of Arizona\u00a0\nit's clearly the meth lab of democracy. Republicans get a free ride when they call the Tea Party something other\u00a0\nthan what they are. And we have to say no, no, Tea Party Republicans, all\u00a0\nthe same thing. They're all crazy. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: To the Democrats in the room, put your hands up. If that offends\u00a0\nyou in any way. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It depends. I couldn't really hear it very well. I\u00a0\nhave a lot of disagreements with Kyrsten Sinema over the years, and I'm not\u00a0\na good friend of hers, but she is 10 times better than McSally on issues\u00a0\nright from the top to the bottom. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Now, the further removed we are from the Kavanaugh confirmation\u00a0\nfight, the more the baseless charges against him unravel. Ann Coulter is\u00a0\nhere, she will be with us later, to tell us about another criminal referral\u00a0\ninvolving a Kavanaugh accuser. And up next, when Hollywood comes out to\u00a0\nstump for Democrats, does anyone care? And wait until you hear what our\u00a0\nfocus group tells us. Don't go anywhere. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It probably will put a fire under me, especially with\u00a0\nall the misogyny going on. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The Democratic candidates are bringing out the big guns.\u00a0\nCelebrities are making ads, knocking on doors, as White House pushes back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OPRAH WINFREY, TALK SHOW HOST: You get a vote, and you get a vote, and you\u00a0\nget a vote. WILL FERRELL, ACTOR: Hi. It's Will Ferrell. I'm here in Kennesaw State.\u00a0\nOf course home of the owls. We're trying to get people to vote here for\u00a0\nStacey Abrams. MIKE PENCE, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I would like to remind Stacey and Oprah\u00a0\nand Will Ferrell, I'm kind of a big deal, too. This ain't Hollywood. This\u00a0\nis Georgia. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, so does trotting out Hollywood heavyweights actually move\u00a0\nvoters? We asked our focus group. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: How many people here in Arizona would you have your vote\u00a0\naffected one way or the another by a celebrity's endorsement? Raise your\u00a0\nhand. No one, either side. ARROYO: Alex, you are one of the people they are targeting, young people.\u00a0\nYour reaction to that? ALEX PHILLIPS, REPUBLICAN: As much fun as I had seen Kanye West and Donald\u00a0\nTrump in the White House -- (LAUGHTER) PHILLIPS: -- with the hats on, I'm not going to base my political views\u00a0\noff that. You can get your mileage off of it, but at the end of the day\u00a0\nyou should probably not make that the be-all, end-all. INGRAHAM: Take a look at this brand-new political ad directed by a\u00a0\nbrilliant film director and actress, Jodie Foster. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If somebody asked you what do you care about, what\u00a0\nwould you say? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Losing your health care? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Equal pay? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Equal rights? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What really, honestly matter to you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If basic human rights matter, then vote. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If women's rights really are human rights, then vote. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Lose. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hope. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: To the ladies here, would that ad in any way motivate you to go to\u00a0\nthe polls? Show of hands. Yes, if it would. In the back, why? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If I wasn't going to vote or had no motivation, it\u00a0\nwould probably put a fire under me, especially with all the misogyny going\u00a0\non. INGRAHAM: What is the most important issue for all of you, both parties,\u00a0\nno parties, on Tuesday, the most important issue? PATRICK BRAY, REPUBLICAN: I think for Arizona in general right now, I\u00a0\nthink the top issue is clearly immigration. And it's driven by the caravan\u00a0\nthat is on his way here. And I think we talked about it, but there's a\u00a0\ntwofold there with immigration. There is the regulatory system that's\u00a0\nbroken, but there's a border security issue that's also broken, and that's\u00a0\nwhy you have to see the military making sure we send a clear signal that we\u00a0\nare just not going to let people in our back door. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Health care for all. That's the biggest issue. People\u00a0\nneed -- how many -- 35 million people are without health care. INGRAHAM: Should illegal immigrants, should they get free health care in\u00a0\nthe United States? Raise your hand. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. Well, you'll have to pay for it through -- INGRAHAM: Free college? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Free college. INGRAHAM: All right, let's go. You better make a lot of money. ARROYO: How many people support that idea, free college, free health care\u00a0\nfor illegal immigrants. INGRAHAM: Do African-Americans or veterans all get free college? We have\u00a0\n300,000 veterans living on the street, homeless veterans on the street\u00a0\ntonight. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are 60 percent taxes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Medicare for all is not free. I'm on Medicare. INGRAHAM: There won't be any Medicare dollars for you, my friend. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not free. FLEENOR: -- of us are working to pay taxes. We are supporting those\u00a0\npeople whether they are illegal or whatever. I can't work anymore. I\u00a0\ncan't pay any more taxes. And 47 percent are on the dole. And how much\u00a0\ngreater does that number need to go before we become a socialist -- INGRAHAM: Hold on, guys. While we're talking about that, birthright\u00a0\ncitizenship, should children born -- neither parent is an American citizen,\u00a0\nneither parent is here illegally as a worker or anything like that, but\u00a0\njust illegal immigrant in the United States has a child. Should that child\u00a0\nimmediately become an American citizen? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, it's the 14th Amendment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's in the Constitution. INGRAHAM: So all -- so 300,000 of the illegal immigrants should\u00a0\nautomatically become -- (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: All right, it got really raucous there. We could have done a\u00a0\nwhole on this. I want to do more of these, so much fun. Another Kavanaugh accuser, by the way, facing potentially severe criminal\u00a0\npunishment over a false claim against the now associate justice of the\u00a0\nSupreme Court. Ann Coulter is here next to break it all down, and what it\u00a0\ncould mean for the midterms. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Brett Kavanaugh might be sitting on the Supreme Court, but the\u00a0\nfallout from his confirmation battle is far from over. Just hours ago,\u00a0\nSenator Chuck Grassley made another criminal referral to the Department of\u00a0\nJustice concerning an unnamed accuser who made rape allegations against\u00a0\nKavanaugh. The unidentified woman admits she, quote, \"just wanted to get\u00a0\nattention,\" and that it was, quote, \"a ploy.\" And joining me now with her reaction is bestselling author and commentator\u00a0\nAnn Coulter. Ann, the convention here is that Republican enthusiasm over\u00a0\nthe Kavanaugh confirmation was waning. What do you think with stories like\u00a0\nthis in the last few days before the vote? ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Liberals are crazy, and it's good\u00a0\nfor voters to be reminded of this. We've been going through a two-year\u00a0\ntantrum. But this one really takes the cake. That letter she wrote reads\u00a0\nlike, Penthouse letters, the detail of this gang rape. And first it's just\u00a0\nwritten anonymously. The handwriting could have been written by a man.\u00a0\nIt's sort of suspicious, a lot of capital letters. It's like a hostage\u00a0\nnote. And then this woman in Kentucky claims that she was the one who wrote it,\u00a0\ngives her name. The Senate Judiciary Committee does a little research and\u00a0\nfinds out she doesn't live either in Washington, D.C., or Oceanside,\u00a0\nCalifornia, which is where the original anonymous hostage letter claimed to\u00a0\ncome from. She's from Kentucky. She's and several decades older than\u00a0\njudge, not justice Kavanaugh, and has a history of being a liberal\u00a0\nactivist. Her quotes to the committee were hilarious. It was just, yes,\u00a0\nwell, it was in the news. I wanted to get attention. He had to be\u00a0\nstopped. INGRAHAM: Ann, isn't this good, though, to make these people pay? And it\u00a0\nreminds me of this leak that came out of the Feinstein office. I've been\u00a0\ntalking about this since it happened. This must be investigated and it\u00a0\nmust be pursued. Republicans are going to hold onto the House, unless\u00a0\nsomething really wacky happens. This can't be dropped by Lindsey Graham\u00a0\nwhen he takes over the committee. I think you've got to go in. I want\u00a0\neverybody's emails, I want everybody's texts, and I want to know who leaked\u00a0\nthat Blasey Ford letter. I want to know who did that. It was a travesty\u00a0\nwhat happened to him. COULTER: Yes. What often happens in these cases is our side, OK, he's on\u00a0\nthe Supreme Court, let's move on. Let's be good guys, because that will be\u00a0\nrepaid by good behavior from the left. No, we will never get good behavior\u00a0\nfrom the left. And whether it's a Duke lacrosse or that UVA gal or\u00a0\nmattress girl up in Columbia, there have just been all of these fake rate\u00a0\nallegations, which happen to be the fake allegations made against judge,\u00a0\nnow Justice Kavanaugh. And the false accuser doesn't get prosecuted. In\u00a0\nthe Duke lacrosse case, she went on to stop her boyfriend to death. No, there has to be some sort of repercussions of making false allegations\u00a0\nof rape. This was a very serious allegation, not particularly plausible.\u00a0\nBut of course these cases need to be pursued. One other thing, I think this is why contrary to what everybody else will\u00a0\nbe telling President Trump, the next nominee he gets to the Supreme Court,\u00a0\nI don't care whom he is replacing, it has to be a man because we now know\u00a0\nwhat the left's playbook is. They did at 29 years ago to Justice Thomas,\u00a0\nthey did it again to now to Justice Kavanaugh. People are going to say,\u00a0\npick a woman, pick a woman. What, because liberal love women so much?\u00a0\nThey love you and me, Laura, they love Sarah Palin. (LAUGHTER) COULTER: But if they have another false allegation, I don't think anybody\u00a0\nis going to buy it in the next few years. It absolutely should be a man. INGRAHAM: I think it should be the best, I don't care what your gender is,\u00a0\nthe best and most conservative, judicially conservative pick, whoever that\u00a0\nis. But doing the bean counting, Ann, never works for conservatives.\u00a0\nYou've been way ahead of the curve on that issue, and obviously immigration\u00a0\nand so many others. Thank you so much, Ann Coulter, here on the \"The Laura Ingraham Show and on\u00a0\nthe \"Ingraham Angle,\" of course. I still have radio on the brain. When we come back, a preview of my Monday night closing argument, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Martha McSally, good luck. You're going to be singing the\u00a0\nnational anthem tomorrow at the ASU football game. I'll be there. I'll be\u00a0\nwatching. And her opponent Kyrsten Sinema is going to be taking part in\u00a0\nthe coin toss. And on Monday, I'm going to deliver my closing arguments to all you voters\u00a0\nacross the country.

            "article_content": "This undated Pennsylvania Department of Transportation photo shows Robert Bowers, the suspect in the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (Pennsylvania Department of Transportation via AP) PITTSBURGH \u2013 The man accused in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre was released from a hospital and turned over to federal authorities for a court appearance Monday on charges he killed 11 people in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Robert Gregory Bowers, who was shot and wounded in a gun battle with police, arrived at the federal courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh less than two hours after his release from Allegheny General Hospital, according to U.S. marshals. A government car with a wheelchair inside was seen arriving earlier. Federal prosecutors set in motion plans to seek the death penalty against the 46-year-old truck driver, who authorities say expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and later told police, \"I just want to kill Jews\" and \"All these Jews need to die.\" The first funeral \u2014 for Cecil Rosenthal and his younger brother, David \u2014 was set for Tuesday. Survivors, meanwhile, began offering harrowing accounts of the mass shooting Saturday inside Tree of Life Synagogue. Barry Werber, 76, said he found himself hiding in a dark storage closet as the gunman tore through the building. \"I don't know why he thinks the Jews are responsible for all the ills in the world, but he's not the first and he won't be the last,\" Werber said. \"Unfortunately, that's our burden to bear. It breaks my heart.\" The weekend massacre \u2014 which took place 10 days before the midterm elections \u2014 heightened tensions around the country, coming just a day after the arrest of the Florida man accused of sending a wave of pipe bombs to critics of President Donald Trump. The mail bomb attacks and the bloodshed in Pittsburgh set off debate over whether the corrosive political climate in Washington and beyond contributed to the violence and whether Trump himself bears any blame because of his combative language. Werber noted that the president has embraced the politically fraught label of \"nationalist.\" He said the Nazis were nationalists. \"It's part of his program to instigate his base,\" Werber said, and \"bigots are coming out of the woodwork.\" Bowers killed eight men and three women before a police tactical team shot him, authorities said. Six other people were wounded, including four officers. Four of the wounded remained hospitalized Sunday night, two in critical condition. It wasn't clear whether Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. A message left with the federal public defender's office in Pittsburgh wasn't returned. He was charged in a 29-count federal criminal complaint that included counts of obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death \u2014 a hate crime \u2014 and using a gun to commit murder. Bowers was also charged under state law with criminal homicide, aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Just minutes before the synagogue attack, Bowers apparently took to social media to rage against HIAS, a Jewish organization that resettles refugees under contract with the U.S. government. \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,\" he is believed to have written on Gab.com, a social media site favored by right-wing extremists. \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\" HIAS had recently weighed in on the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S. from Central America, urging the Trump administration to \"provide all asylum seekers the opportunity to present their claims as required by law and treat all migrants fairly and humanely.\" The president has vilified the caravan and pledged to stop the migrants. One of the targets of the mail bomb attacks last week was liberal Jewish philanthropist George Soros, who has been accused by far-right conspiracy theorists of paying migrants to join the caravan. Three congregations were conducting Sabbath services in the synagogue when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, the historic hub of the city's Jewish community . Speaking at a vigil in Pittsburgh on Sunday night, Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said about a dozen people had gathered in the main sanctuary when Bowers walked in and began shooting. Seven of his congregants were killed, he said. \"My holy place has been defiled,\" he said. In the basement, four members of New Light congregation were just starting to pray \u2014 with two others in the kitchen \u2014 when they heard crashing coming from upstairs, looked out the door and saw a body on the staircase, Werber recalled in an interview. Rabbi Jonathan Perlman closed the door and pushed them into a large supply closet, he said. As gunshots echoed upstairs, Werber called 911 but was afraid to say anything for fear of making any noise. When the shots subsided, he said, another congregant, Melvin Wax, opened the door, only to be shot. \"There were three shots, and he falls back into the room where we were,\" Werber said. \"The gunman walks in.\" Apparently unable to see Werber and the other congregants in the darkness, Bowers walked back out. Werber called the gunman \"a maniac\" and \"a person who has no control of his baser instincts.\" The youngest of the 11 dead was 54, the oldest 97. The toll included a husband and wife, professors, dentists and physicians. Bowers shot his victims with an AR-15, used in many of the nation's mass shootings, and three handguns, all of which he owned legally and had a license to carry, according to a law enforcement official who wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Bowers was a long-haul trucker who worked for himself, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said. Little else was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record. ___ Lauer reported from Philadelphia. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Mark Scolforo in Pittsburgh, Michael Balsamo in Washington, Jennifer Peltz in New York and Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania. ___ For AP's complete coverage of the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings: https://www.apnews.com/Shootings",

            "article_content": "Google executives were so hurt by the election of Trump because he promised to hold Google's partner, China, accountable. This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" September 13, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Leland Vittert, stay safe in North Carolina. We'll have a continuing coverage of Hurricane Florence all throughout the evening. Let not your heart be troubled. We are always fair and balanced. We are not the destroy Trump media. And Laura Ingraham is standing by to take it away. A lot of news tonight, Laura. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX SHOW HOST: Hannity, I can't believe Leland is out there hanging on that light pole. It is more dangerous than being in the Golan Heights where he was. HANNITY: Yes. He used to be in the Jerusalem bureau. Look, we're going to call him hurricane Steve Harrigan. We had to come up with a name for Leland, but these guys really do a great job to put their lives on the line for us to give us a great coverage. INGRAHAM: Wow. Fantastic. And Hannity, great show tonight as always. HANNITY: Have a great show. INGRAHAM: All right, thanks so much. Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have an immediate news alert. At this hour, Hurricane Florence is lashing the Carolinas. Hurricane force winds already being felt and are expected to worsen through the night. We have Fox News coverage all along the coast. But we begin tonight in North Topsail Beach, North Carolina where Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan is really feeling the storm. Steve? STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, I've seen this bridge over the past few hours behind me just gradually disappear as the water comes up. If we do get an 11-foot storm surge as somehow predicted on parts of the coast, that water would go over this pew and go up the first floor most of these houses. It is dark all along this island. People really heeded the call to get out. They have boarded up their houses with plywood and most of them left, either going far inland or north or south, trying to get away from this giant storm. The power is out here. We just lost electricity a few hours ago. Those are the camera lights on me now running on batteries. As many as three million people could lose power before this is over. Right now, the winds have picked up considerably over the last hour or two. We are seeing tropical storm force winds, but really, strong enough to try and cause some damage. We are hearing things snap and crack and move. It's hard with pitch darkness to see exactly what is being moved but the house to my left has lost some bits off its roof and some small branches as well. Because the wind is so severe, they've shut down the bridge that leads from this island back to the mainland. So, if you are someone who has decided to stay here, you are going to be here to have to ride it out. As far as rescues go, there are a lot of assets in place, they are swift boat teams from 19 different states. That is something we see over and over again in these massive storms. The real contribution from all across the U.S. not only officially, but people with their own boats, who I'm sure we are going to see in the days ahead carrying out water rescues because that is the long-term danger. The wind is going to be dramatic. It's going to get worse here over the next couple of hours. We are probably going to see 100 mile an hour sustained winds here but it is that rain that is going to cause inland flooding, that is going to be the real slower slob and the real danger for a lot of people across the state. Laura, back to you. INGRAHAM: All right Steve, we are watching you and everyone in the studio here is watching this with me. We are actually afraid for you. I mean, that deck that you are on or the steps, that is not going to be there in an hour or two. That is gone. I'm sorry. I think you got to -- I know you want to report but you got to get off that -- you got to get off the wooden walkway. That ain't going to be there for much longer. I know that beach very well by the way, and that is brutal. HARRIGAN: Yes. Well we've been kind of moving back a little bit along the way each way so, we're trying to keep moving back where we feel the need to, but we are trying to show you the drama of what is going on here at the same time. INGRAHAM: The drama, but we like you more. So Steve, please stay safe. We'll check back with you later on in the hour. That is unbelievable. For any of you who have been down in the outer banks or near North Topsail, that is an incredible sight. We're going to have live reports of course from the ground, from the coast, throughout the hour. We also expect authorities to brief us on the latest so do not go anywhere. You want not miss the latest on this monster storm. And we do want to get to some other important stories tonight, like the ugly smearing of Brett Kavanaugh and she should be ashamed of herself. Senator Dianne Feinstein -- I actually have a lot of respect for her. We don't agree on everything. I have a lot of respect for her as a woman and being out there in the Senate. But what she did today, we are going to tell you about this. We have breaking news on what this might do or not do to the Kavanaugh confirmation. So stay right there. Plus, we break down the media treatment of Michelle Obama versus Melania Trump. And this as Michelle Obama gets ready for her big stadium-sized book to her. You're going to want to stop by for that and not turn the dial for that, but it's another unbelievable story of bias. But first, global titans versus the American people. That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Immediately following the election, Google executives gathered to share their feelings of dejection and despair. A video recently leaked to Breitbart reveals the mindset of Google's leadership from within their corporate safe space. This is co-founder Sergey Brin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEY BRIN, CO-FOUNDER, GOOGLE: You know, let's face it, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad because of the election. Anyway, on a more serious note, you know, myself, as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive and I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time and it conflicts with many of our values. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Values? What are those Google values? After all this is a company that has actively worked with the Chinese communist regime for years. And right now, Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens. Translation, Google is helping China silence its political opposition. The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily. They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps, but the legitimate election of President Trump, somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values? Give me a break. Today we learned that a senior Google research scientist named Jack Paulson was so disgusted by the company's collaboration with Chinese sensors that he has quit in protest. And I was thinking about this, you want to know the real reason that the Google execs were so exercised, so hurt by the election of Trump? Because he promised to hold Google's partner, China, accountable. To punish Chinese cheating on trade deals that hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. For Google and many other big manufacturers, the pre-Trump status quo was much easier. Keep that production overseas, lower wages, no regulation, no health care that you have to worry about for those employees over in China. And if it hurts America, so be it. After all, those blue-collar Americans will probably be Trump voters anyway. And of course, Google, they hate you deplorables. (BEGI VIDEO CLIP)  KENT WALKER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GOOGLE GLOBAL AFFAIRS: That fear, I think, not just in the United States, but around the world, is what is fueling concerns of xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Actually, Trump's found -- the answer are pretty easy. Two words, America first. Sure, Trump will work with the rest of the world. He's shown that, but on a much more level playing field. So why is Google so threatened by that? I'll tell you why. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALKER: History teaches us that there are periods of populism, of nationalism that rise up and that is all the reason we need to be in the arena, that is why we have to work so hard to make sure it doesn't turn into a world war or something catastrophic, but instead, is a blip, as a hick up. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, you stop a world war with your search engine. That's ridiculous. Like a liberal elites that crossed politics, academia, and the entertainment industry, big tech doesn't really like the American voters who turned out for Trump. That is pretty obvious. Google thinks it knows better than their customers, after all, Google execs are richer than they are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUTH PORAT, GOOGLE CFO: People are leaving, staff is crying, we are going to lose. That was the first moment I really felt like we were going to lose. Everybody, if you could turn around or go to the person next to you, and do a hug that works. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's worse than a sign of peace at mass. Sorry, I'm not a sign of peace person. Hug, group hug. Trump won. Oh, my gosh. I needed comic relief today. That made me laugh more than anything else. But then huggy bear Ruth got down to business. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PORAT: Our values our strong, we will fight to protect them, and we will use the great strength and resources in which we have to continue to advance really important values. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Again, the word values. What values is Google talking about? Well, the left-wing globalist values that have helped enrich the oppressive Chinese regime at the expense of free expression and religious liberty, and of course, made Google execs really rich. Part of Google's disappointment was that their efforts in 2016 failed really spectacularly. Of course they claim that they are nonpartisan. But an email leaked to my colleague Tucker Carlson show that the tech giant tried to turn out the Latino vote in 2016 because they were confident Latino voters would support Hillary. But can you imagine their surprise when they wake up on election morning after -- morning after election they see 29 percent of Latinos voting for Trump? They were gobsmacked. Google is not some local business practicing civic engagement, we should all stand up and cheer, oh, Google, go. Google is one of the most powerful companies on the planet. They are responsible for about 90 percent of all searches online, they are more than 1.2 trillion searches on Google each year, globally. More than 2 billion people use its android mobile platform. And they've made $110.8 billion in revenue last year alone. But when smaller companies, smaller companies like Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby or In-n-Out burger, when they move in the smallest of ways to support more traditional or even conservative causes, those companies are sued and vilified nonstop by the mainstream media. When I giant like Google pledges to actively undermine the political will of the American people, the media don't cover it. And you know why? Because the media agree with the Google agenda. This is one of my favorite moments from the Google anti-Trump corporate rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIN: Last question, yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything positive you see from this election result? BRIN: Boy, that's a really tough one right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's actually not so tough. I love those beanies, by the way. I want one. I will get one for my kids. That's a tough one. Anything good that comes out of Trump`s election. Well, how is this to try on for size. The economy is booming. Fair trade deals are being negotiated, wages are rising and blue-collar America is more optimistic about the future that t hey have been for decades. These Google execs should have to do public acts of penance for their petty, idiotic statements. Here's the bottom line. The Google gang and the rest of big tech were happier when America was losing to China. They didn't care that blue-collar America got poorer and communist China got richer and stronger. So long as Google got richer in the process. But today, President Trump is turning the tables on that sick dynamic. His policies are working. Google is still rich, of course. But the globalists, even though the economy is going well, the globalists are still grumpy. That tells you all you need to know. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining us now the reaction is CRTV host Michelle Malkin along with China Okasi, a tech and cyber security expert who is author of the forthcoming book, \"What the Tech Is Going on in Politics.\" It's great to see both of you. China, let's start with you. The Google tape that came out last couple of days, Breitbart has it exclusively, shows a corporate culture that is overwhelmingly in the tank in 2016 for Hillary. They are dejected and despondent and they look like they are set at that point to exert their influence in the tech world to change that dynamic of Trump as president. Does this look like a diverse company to you? CHINA OKASI, TECH AND CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: Well, I think that the entire thrust of technology in the tech world is actually diversity. When you consider that almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants, you would understand the spirit of support that these companies-- INGRAHAM: Legal immigrants, right? Yes, legal immigrants. OKASI: Yes. Legal immigrants. INGRAHAM: We are not against the legal immigrants. OKASI: But I will have to say this, OK, 80 percent of graduate students in the United States, in the fields of computer science and electrical engineering are international students, and in order for those students to stay, they need to operate on H-1B visas, OK. And so they are not necessarily going to take the track of permanent residency because that takes many years. These companies in many, many ways, have been supported and propped up by people who don't have that linear path to immigration. So it is really not a black and white issue. And I don't think they see it as -- INGRAHAM: Why are they so dejected by Trump winning? Trump was going to do one thing, and Michelle I want you to chime in. The number one thing I think they are really annoyed by is Trump taking on China. I think the immigration thing -- yes, they are worried about that, but Trump taking on China is something Obama in his own way promised to do, Bush promised to do, no one did it. Trump did it and is leveling the playing field. That means some of these Google execs might not make as much money in the end but they are still multibillionaires but more Americans might get slightly higher wages. Michelle? MICHELLE MALKIN, CRTV HOST: Yes. You've got the bottom line, Laura. And I'll get to China's comments about H-1B in a second. But let me just say this, I want to give a huge salute and shout out to the reporters, the tech reporters at Breitbart. I think this is a blockbuster report. It is both revelatory and confirmatory, for those of us who followed Google's capitulation to China, that goes back 12 years. Where they have thrown their own old corporate logo, \"don't be evil\" under the bus by agreeing to all sorts of censorship regulations, when they always stand so sanctimoniously as a holier than thou company that embraces progressive values. It is a gift that we now get to see that hypocrisy on display. And I think you are absolutely right, Laura, that these kinds of companies, in Silicon Valley, do not have America's interests at heart. So let's talk about diversity. You know, I did a report for CRTV in \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\" on the diverse American workforce. Tech workers, black, white, Asian-Americans, who were fired and forced to train their inferior H-1B replacement because Google and their like are more interested in suppressing the wages of American workers than they are in supporting the diversity as an American I.T. workforce. More hypocrisy from big tech and it is a cult. You look at them all seeing the praises of diversity when you have got conservative Googlers within the company that are too afraid to talk about their values and their support for our president. INGRAHAM: Yes. Someone leaked this out obviously, China. Someone's concerned inside the company. Paulson, resigns in the last week or two. You had Tristan Harris, the former global employee, February 7th, 2018, let's watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRISTAN HARRIS, I actually genuinely view this as an existential threat. When you shape people's attention, you're shaping their thoughts and thoughts proceed actions. So you are really shaping society, you are shaping culture, you are shaping whether people have the relationships they would have intended to have, whether they sleep or not. You're shaping elections. There is an entire set of consequences when you shape people's attention through design.  (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: China, your reaction? OKASI: You know, I think it is just such a monolithic view to think that all big tech companies have the same opinion. When you look at the spirit of what they are doing, it is not about being for or against the Trump administration. It is about policy. You look at the International Entrepreneurship Rule that were set about by the Obama administration, and yet has not seen implementation. It has been pushed back over and over again. Such things as the International Entrepreneurship Rule encourage those intellectual resources that we need to run these companies, all of these companies, Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, all have founders in them that are immigrant and that purport these views around diversity. INGRAHAM: But that's fine. No, no, no. I think that's great. China, I don't think there is any problem with that. I think Michelle -- you come here illegally, Sergey Brin and his parents fled the Soviet Union. I think it's ironic that they flee the Soviet Union, his father is a mathematician a University of Maryland. His mother works were Goddard. They are both brilliant. He's brilliant. They flee the oppressive Soviet Union only for him to turn around and help the Chinese communists develop an app to screen out offensive content. How does that make any sense? How are those the values that Google's stands up the day after the election and says, \"our values are offended by Donald Trump\" because they are helping the Chinese communists squelch free expression? That's disgusting. OKASI: -- inaccurate. I think -- INGRAHAM: It's not inaccurate. That's a fact. That is why one of the senior researcher's quit. OKASI: -- in order to (inaudible) in any country you have to follow their rules and regulations. And I think by supplying their products, really, to the people of China, they are allowing China to be part of the global conversation, part of the -- INGRAHAM: Do you think that's what is happening? Oh, come on. (CROSSTLK) OKASI: -- then Google should not participate in that context? They should not be a part of it? INGRAHAM: Why are they doing this? Michelle, in closing, go ahead. Michelle, go ahead. I got 30 seconds. Michelle, real quick, 15. MALKIN: No, no, no. Google is kowtowing to the communists and putting essentially internet duct tape around the mouths of dissenters who dare to criticize the communist government there. Also, by the way, read \"Sold Out\" the book that I wrote with John Miamo a former programmer, American computer programmer who defends American citizens who've been harmed by these H-1B policies. Guess what, the American I.T. workforce is sick and tired of these globalist elites telling them that there aren't best and brightest workers when they are the one being fired and replaced with these wage slaves. INGRAHAM: \"Fortune\" magazine research and China, I don't think you would think -- OK. \"Fortune\" magazine research on this shows that for every 100 foreign computer scientist working in United States, between 33 and 61 domestic workers were replaced. The influx of foreign workers also held down wages with compensation being 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent lower if foreign workers were not allowed. All right. Thanks for both of you for joining us, China and Michelle. And by the way, it's a disgusting Democratic smear, and the media are all too happy to run with it. Up next, we are going to explain how an 11th hour effort to derail Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court nomination tells you everything you need to know about today's left. Coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The air around Capitol Hill has been thick with desperation today. Why? Well, from a pathetic last ditch effort by Democrats to scuttle Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Intrigue swirling after reports says Senator Dianne Feinstein was sitting on potentially damning letter. It said to be written by an unknown woman alleging sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh when he was 17 years-old. I kid you not. And tonight the \"Guardian\" reporting that the letter claims that Kavanaugh and a male friend walked this woman in a room against her will during a party making her feel uncomfortable. The woman was later able to leave the room. We did that last week -- come on. Joining me now, Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director at the Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie, I'm laughing at this. It's so pathetic on so many levels. What's going on here. CARRIE SEVERINO, CHIEF COUNSEL, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK: I think -- you know, we know very little about what this letter even -- is supposed to mean but we know a lot about the politics. I mean, if Senator Feinstein had this letter since July, why didn't she ask it -- if she really thought this was credible, why didn't she ask about it when she met with him during the hearings, during these questions for the record? What's going on here is very clear. Senator Schumer said that we're going to do everything in our power to stop the nominee and that means character assassination, smears, is all fair game. I mean, look at what they are doing to Senator Collins. She has got people going after her staff saying, I hope you get raped and impregnated. They want people to follow her around and spit in her food at restaurants. There is this GoFundMe campaign that she says is a bribe that might even violate federal election law. INGRAHAM: Right. This is a smear across the board, but with Kavanaugh -- SEVERINO: This is so crazy. INGRAHAM: But with Brett, here he is 17 years old, is a Georgetown Prep kid at Washington Catholic School, is 17 with a friend, locks some woman when in a room and then she was able to leave. That is what is being reported this night as a story. But if someone you don't know who heard it from someone else, who's at Stanford. This is the most -- Diane Feinstein has actually had a pretty amazing career. She was elected in '92 year of the woamn, but this is -- is this really how she wants to end her senate career, this way? It's -- pathetic doesn't even describe it, though. It's an attempt at September surprise that goes down in utter flames. It's a complete and total embarrassment. SEVERINO: Yes. She's getting push from the left, so even someone as far left as she is, is feeling the pressure to be all the more outrageous and fanatical. INGRAHAM: All right, Carrie, thanks so much. And Democrats continue to deny that Republicans deserve any credit for the economy. Their argument goes something like this. It's really only good because of Obama. Oh, it's okay now, but the economy is okay but it's going to get worse, not going to last long, or who cares. The economic boom is overshadowed by how awful a person Trump is. Former White House staff, chief of staff Reince Priebus joins us now. Reince, you heard Obama on the trail saying the economic boom is his and he's glad people are getting around and recognizing it. How humorous was that for you to watch? REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, it's humorous because really what jump-started this economy is what the president did in the first week, which was the deregulation, executive order for everyone regulation put in place, two have to be eliminated. Turned out that 22 were eliminated for every one put in place. Bu it also tells you about the politics. It's also rather smart because Barack Obama and the Democrats are fighting in 34 split districts for the control of the House. Split districts meaning they either flip from Republican to Democrat in 2012 and 2016 or vice versa. In those 34 districts, 21 of them were won by Trump and the rest were won by Clinton. This is the fight that people are going to have. And what matters right now is who can take claim over the great economy. And as bizarre as it is for you and I and the listeners to believe that somehow the economy we are in is something Barack Obama did and not President Trump is insane. But what they are trying to do is play that game and those 34 states. INGRAHAM: Yes, but they are saying everything is chaos. They want to convince people that even though their lives are getting better, it's chaos. It's Trump chaos. What can the president do? If you talk to the president, what can he do to give people a sense that sunshine is coming out. Don't' let them rain on your parade, the sun is coming out? PRIEBUS: When you and I talked about this the last time we were on and the president started talking about it, which is I would do something completely different. I would boldly champion the idea that the president is willing to put rivals in a room -- he agreed with this -- he put rivals in a room. He put Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Bob Lighthizer, all these people and he allowed them to fight it out. I'm not talking about little -- INGRAHAM: But the voters don't care about Gary Cohn and -- PRIEBUS: That's my point. My point is -- INGRAHAM: How do you get these people to turn out to vote? PRIEBUS: You talk about the economy. You talk about -- INGRAHAM: Numbers don't get people to the polls. PRIEBUS: You talk about -- well, what does get people to the polls when they are getting more money in their pockets. INGRAHAM: They want to feel that things are calming down. Don't they want things to be calm her? They want to feel that it's going to be safe streets, borders are going to be enforced, doing the president's agenda, I can take a vacation every now and then. PRIEBUS: Which is the accomplishments and the results of the Trump agenda. And I think the accomplishments and the result is what the white house needs to focus on, and I would quit fighting over whether or not people are fighting over trade in the White House. Admit that people fight over trade in the White House. De-minimize it. INGRAHAM: But nobody cares about that. PRIEBUS: Right, but that's what I'm saying. Minimize it for what it is. INGRAHAM: So the president should focus on the results that he's brought. He does -- PRIEBUS: And he admit I, but yes. I put rivals in front of me. I learned from the Socratic Method. Who cares? Look at the results of what I have done which is why I've said in the past, the things that I have said, which is that he puts a shark and a seal on a falcon and a rabbit -- INGRAHAM: That's a Woodward book phrase. PRIEBUS: And I've said on -- I think I've said it on your show. INGRAHAM: Why is that a bad thing? PRIEBUS: It's not a bad thing. INGRAHAM: Let me seethe quote. When you put a snake and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo with that wall, I like that. That's like a song. Things start getting nasty and bloody. I mean, if he said that, I'm like, OK, good. Why is that a problem? PRIEBUS: And the president had agreed that he encourages the fight over policy in front of him. INGRAHAM: He's 14 points down in this midterm election cycle. I know Republican, the party in power, always loses seats, but in this economy, blue-collar optimism, Obama was out there waving off the possibility that manufacturing was ever coming back. PRIEBUS: Keep in mind we were also seven to eight points down in 2014. We took control of the Senate. INGRAHAM: You have to make some headway here, right? PRIEBUS: You do have to make headway, absolutely. You do have to make some headway. But the Republicans have a natural advantage in the midterms. I am still optimistic, and the presidential approval numbers are no different today than they were in November. INGRAHAM: They're not a little down, a little bit? PRIEBUS: No, no, no. They're at 37 percent -- INGRAHAM: CNN had it down. PRIEBUS: OK, well, CNN has 36. But they were at 37 percent on Election Day of 2016. And remember, in those 34 split districts, at 34 -- excuse me, at 37 percent, 21 of those districts went from Obama to Trump in a split district at 37 percent approval in 2016. So it's not always how it appears. INGRAHAM: We're going to do this in another segment. I want to get your sense on this. I think it should be all for one, one for all right here with the Republicans. Ted Cruz is facing a tough opponent in Texas, Beto O'Rourke. He's a pinup boy in Texas. The Bushs might not like Trump, they don't like Trump, they didn't vote for Trump. But they are very popular in Texas. George W. Bush isn't campaigning for Ted Cruz. What the heck is going on? PRIEBUS: Honestly, I don't know that if he is or not. INGRAHAM: He's not as far as I know. But shouldn't he? Come on, support Republicans. PRIEBUS: I think control of the Senate is what's at stake. I think you let bygones be bygones. INGRAHAM: Yes, turn it out. PRIEBUS: Win control for the Senate, not just for the president. But if you are not willing to work for the president, work for the good of the country and the things you believe in as a Republican, period. INGRAHAM: Reince, it's always good to see you. I like the snake in the dove. PRIEBUS: I think it's great. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: That is like most of our houses. Everybody is fighting all the time. Up next, we head back to North Carolina for a live update on hurricane Florence as the conditions are intensifying by the minute. Stay right there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: A lot of fast-moving developments tonight as hurricane Florence roars into the Carolinas. For more, let's go to Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert who is in Morehead City, North Carolina. Leland? LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, in the past 30 minutes or so this light pole and I have gotten to be better and better friends as the wind has picked up. Now it's the point where you really have to hold onto it lest you get blown away here in these winds that keep picking up. We can't stress it enough. What makes Florence so different is not necessarily the intensity. This isn't the worst hurricane you can be through in terms of wind speed, but how long it's going to last. You are talking about 20 or 24 hours, which having been out here now for about 10 hours in it, it's pretty miserable. But just imagine being at home, as many people are now, watching and knowing that the conditions that we are in is what is happening to their house. It is not an additive situation, every hour isn't just another hour. It's an exponentially bad situation that's getting worse. And the tide is coming in now. We watched these docks continue to rise. There is only another foot or two left on those pilings before the docks break away and then go into the city, and sort of destructive barges through this city. And that is even before we get to the point where you have got the storm surge and these 40 inches of rain now that are not only going to come through here in Morehead but also upriver, and all the way back, dozens if not hundreds of miles into coastal Carolina. Right now about 100,000 power outages, Laura, that will go into the multi-hundred-thousands before the night is over. INGRAHAM: Leland, when do you make the decision to pull off that dock there, because you got about -- looks like a lot less than one foot before that water starts rolling over you, my friend. What happens when that the lamppost gives way? That is not a good situation. VITTERT: The lamppost is stuck a couple of feet into concrete. But once this water comes up here over this, the idea of slipping and being in that water is not one that I think -- a risk we're going to take. So that is about the time that we pull out. INGRAHAM: Leland, please, please be careful. I don't like the looks of you out there with that lamppost, although you do make a nice couple, Leland. So you have a good rest of the night. We'll send some provisions down your way. We'll have more reports from the ground later in the hour. As we explained in our \"Angle\" last night, the Democratic Party is being slowly -- not slowly -- it's being hijacked by a strain of leftism manifesting itself in vitriol and outright now violence. With that in question, my question tonight -- why aren't all Republican, given what we're seeing from the Democrats, including, by the way, the Republicans who don't even like President Trump that much, like Ben Sasse, Jeff Flake, George W. Bush, and others, why aren't they all coalescing around candidates, especially those who are vulnerable, to make sure the GOP wins in this November, including in the Senate, not just the House, but Senate races? Joining us now to discuss, Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, and Dave Bossie, former deputy campaign manager for the Trump campaign. Ari, let's start with you. George W. Bush hitting the campaign trail. He is still very popular in certain parts of the country, and former two term president. But I don't think he is campaigning for someone like a Ted Cruz who's in a very close race and Bush's home state right now. What gives there? ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There's two months to go, and I think the president will make some decisions about what he's going to do, how extensive it will be. He's traditionally stayed off the campaign trail since he left the presidency, and that is just his personal decision. But his popularity is rising. And frankly, Laura, I want to see more establishment Republicans out there helping our candidates everywhere. This is about the future of our nation, and every election is important. And the worst thing Republicans can do, either their establishment or Trump Republicans, is let the Democrats take back the Congress and do the damage they'll do to our country. INGRAHAM: But Dave, instead of people, all for one, one for all, the Democrats are just going to, they are out there standing shoulder to shoulder. They don't agree on anything. DAVID BOSSIE, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS UNITED: No matter how insane they are. They stand -- it doesn't matter what they say or do, the policy positions, the left is always very good at standing together, no matter how awkward it might be. Look, the Republicans really need to -- they have 54 days to decide whether or not they want to continue to have control of the House and of the Senate. I think the House is really where it comes down to. And Trump derangement syndrome amongst some of these Republicans is really unfortunate. Flake and Corker should be out there campaigning for candidates across their states and across the country, and instead they are not. They are attacking this president, undermining these great policy positions, these great economic numbers that we have. And they are detracting from that. INGRAHAM: And instead, we have Ben Sasse giving interviews, Ari, about how -- the burning issue on peoples' mind going into the midterms is politicians releasing their tax returns. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BEN SASSE, R\u2014NEB.: It's never been a lot but everybody has always done it. This is the first time it hasn't had it. The president said he would release them once he got the nomination, and then once he got elected. Then he said the people have lost interest. I think there's a lot of distrust. He should release them. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Ari, your reaction? FLEISCHER: Why do they have to keep stirring this pot? I understand how the press can put a microphone in front of a politician and you say something anti-Trump and they run to do it. It's not constructive. And frankly, when it comes to Sasse or Corker or Flake going into some of these districts to campaign, most people in the United States have not heard of these guys outside of their states. So I don't know that it's all that helpful to Governor Scott in Florida to have a senator from Tennessee campaign for him. The dynamics of this race are really going to be whether or not Donald Trump can get his base out to support Republicans. We all know the anti-Trump base is coming out. So like it or not, this is a nationalized election. There is no dodging it. And the Trump base needs to show up in presidential year numbers, not off year numbers. INGRAHAM: I think Ari is right. However, it is not about going out and really campaigning. Who cares, Ben Sasse -- he couldn't get arrested. Nobody knows who he is. I agree with that. But how about buttoning it up? Button the mouth. We don't really need to hear you doing your best MSNBC pundit impersonation, OK. Don't kneecap the president during a midterm election cycle, Ben. BOSSIE: But some of these folks are on their way out. Look at Jeff Flake and Bob Corker. INGRAHAM: They've no constituency. BOSSIE: But not only do they have no constituency, they are not running for reelection because the same people who elected President Trump wouldn't reelect them in November, and that is -- INGRAHAM: That stings -- BOSSIE: -- fundamentally their problem for them. They need to -- this is part of their going away party. INGRAHAM: And Ari -- FLEISCHER: But what America has got to focus on, the alternative here, if the Democrats take control, are their policies, and their policies are a government takeover of health care, that Donald Trump committed treason, and we should raise our taxes. That is what is driving the entire Democratic agenda. Do we really want that to be running the House or the Senate again? I sure hope not. BOSSIE: Ari is exactly right. Look, President Trump is not on the ballot in November, but his policies are. The America first agenda that he ran on and won on and has made America great again over the last 18 months is on the ballot this November and we have to show up in force. INGRAHAM: Abolish ICE, that is what the Democrats want to do. FLEISCHER: One other policy point. Medicare for all, the rally cry from the Democrats. The worst thing for seniors who rely on Medicare is to make Medicare Medicare for all. It's already going broke, and if you want longer lines and worse health care for Medicare for seniors, make it Medicare for all. INGRAHAM: Blue-collar America, they are doing well. They better turn out big time in the midterms. This thing is all going to go south. Gentlemen, thanks so much. And how the media treat Michelle Obama versus Melania Trump. It tells us a lot about our current moment that we are in, our political atmosphere. We're going to explain it all, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: When it comes to politics, first lady Melania Trump seems pretty hands-off, unlike former first lady Michelle Obama, who's been all over the political landscape, trying to of course get ready to sell her book and whip up Democratic votes for the midterms. And while Michelle is given the cover girl treatment, an actual cover girl, Melania, is disparaged and often ridiculed. Joining us with their reaction, Rachel Campos-Duffy is a Fox News contributor and Gretchen Von Helms, a Democratic strategist. All right, ladies, Michelle Obama is an impressive person. She seems like a great mom, loves her husband, very politically engaged, that is fine. Shot 12 magazine covers during her time in the White House, \"Vogue\" three times, \"Time\" magazine twice, \"Glamour,\" \"In Style.\" I don't know, I can't remember one magazine cover Melania has been on, maybe one when they won the election, \"People\" or something. What do you make of this, Gretchen? GRETCHEN VON HELMS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, this is really about not a political issue but a gender issue I think, because the press has treated and picked on women as either too fat or too skinny or too tall or too short, or too frumpy in the case of Hillary Clinton. So it isn't just about the first -- INGRAHAM: We are not talking about Hillary. Focus on what we are talking about. We're talking about Michelle Obama, who was literally on every magazine cover that we can remember. VON HELMS: She did a great job. She was wonderful. INGRAHAM: And Melania, who was a cover girl is on nothing. She's gorgeous. They are both beautiful women. One happens to be Donald Trump's wife, and one happens to be Barack Obama's wife. And all we're saying is, take politics out of it. They are both first ladies, and yet on \"The View\" as we saw just a couple of days, Rachel, this is what the ladies on \"The View\" said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was struck by Melania's a statement. She said - UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do not do -- don't do it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't do that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We know. That's why we are telling you, don't do it. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's right. I can't do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Obviously, ha-ha-ha, she has a goofy accent. We're going to say that without saying it. Rachel? RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The irony of it, right. This is the party of diversity and tolerance and supposedly immigrants, as well, and here they are making fun of our first immigrant first lady in modern times. So that is very interesting. But really, this is about politics. Your guest sounds very nice but very naive. If Melania were a progressive, if she was for socialism and all these other leftist policies, if she was married to a leftist -- VON HELMS: That's ridiculous. If she just got out there and did stuff, she would get on the cover of stuff. She's not been very active. CAMPOS-DUFFY: She would get the covers of the magazines. She is a former international model. She is clearly the most fashionable first lady we have had since Jackie O, maybe even surpassing Jackie O. And yet not only does Michelle Obama, but so does Chelsea Clinton. I mean, who has ever thought of high fashion and Chelsea Clinton, and she got \"Vogue\" but Melania doesn't get \"Vogue\"? This -- VON HELMS: They shouldn't be about how these women look. It should be about how they think. And Melania has not been forthcoming about what she thinks and what she wants to engage in and what her platform is. This is not about these women dress or the little things. It's about the beliefs that they put forth. CAMPOS-DUFFY: In the case of Melania, it's one other thing. It's about the leftist strategy to not normalize Donald Trump. So they can't legitimize him, and the strategy includes not legitimizing his wife, his kids, his blue-collar recovery, economy, his booming economy, trade -- INGRAHAM: I have a question, Gretchen. Gretchen, I have a question, though. Gretchen, liberal women are all like, we are pro-choice, whatever you want to be, be. If you want to be politically active, if you just want to be a traditional first lady, and maybe you don't plant the vegetable garden, and you don't do Let's Move and dance with Ellen, but maybe you support -- VON HELMS: You want to stay home, take care of your children, that's great. INGRAHAM: Yes, maybe you do that. So, but is her choice. Why not -- VON HELMS: Michelle Obama -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Why is Melania -- you know she's being treated differently. I don't know why you are denying that. She's obviously being treated differently. Hold on, let Gretchen finish. VON HELMS: She's choosing to stay home, she's choosing to be with her family. That is a great choice. She is choosing to put faith and family first. That is her decision. It doesn't necessarily make it a sexy cover magazine. But she's not putting herself out there for that. So what. Let her stay home. INGRAHAM: Wait a second, \"Vogue\" magazine puts -- all the women on the cover of \"Vogue\" are there because they are brilliant endeavors? Most of them are there because they are fashion and their looks and a lot of them are business people, too. But come on, guys. They are there in part because they are beautiful. VON HELMS: First of all, Michelle -- INGRAHAM: We are out of time. Love you, Gretchen, for coming on, and love you, of course, Ms. Duffy. All right, Rachel. We head live to the Carolinas next. Latest on the hurricane. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Hurricane Florence currently smashing into the Carolina coastline. For more on what is happening, let's go back to Fox News correspondent Leland Vittert, who is still in Morehead City, North Carolina, and still holding onto that lamppost. Leland, glad you're still friends there with that lamppost. LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Still very good friends, but about to part, much to, I should say, the happiness to both you and my mother on this one. The storm surge keeps coming and you are really getting a sense of the power of the water here. And that is what is the destructive nature that Florence will bring not only here, but farther inland. What makes this storm so unusual is how it is curving in there. And the barrier islands are just about two or three miles that way. But rather than acting as a barrier, they are acting as a funnel for this water as it continues to slam in here. And the longer that Florence turns, it could be in total about 24 hours of hurricane conditions. The worst it's going to get, not for the people out on the islands, it's bad there, but the water levels will continue to rise here. And up the streams, farther inland, sometimes up to 100 miles inland, you could get really catastrophic flooding, which means water rescues are going to be going for a long time. As we are out here now, probably about eight hours into hurricane conditions, you begin to understand why authorities were so dire in their predictions here. It is so clear that if people decided to say, they were essentially on their own. Too dangerous now for the police or fire department to come out, Laura. INGRAHAM: Leland, please, please be careful out there. And let's now go to Rick Leventhal, who is in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, where the storm is about to hit next. Rick? RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Laura, for most of the day Wrightsville Beach was pretty calm. And in the last couple of hours things have picked up pretty dramatically. We were down right by the beach in a house about five doors from the ocean. And because of the threats from the storm surge, we moved to higher ground. And we are definitely well protected here, but we are also feeling the winds picking up and the rain coming down. Wrightsville Beach is one of these coastal communities that heeded the mandatory evacuation order, just a handful of residents stayed behind. What we saw throughout the day were police officers, beat patrol and fire department, doing their rounds, doing their patrols to make sure that nobody was getting into trouble. And everything was good as of a couple of hours ago. The fire department retreated to the other side of the bridge, and everybody's getting ready to ride this thing out. Again, the big fear is that the storm surge will live up to expectations, seven to eleven feet. And where we are we'll be fine, but all these homes and businesses down on sea level, they could be in for some pretty significant flooding, as of course the roads could become too. So we are keeping an eye on it and we'll keep you posted. INGRAHAM: Rick, how long is the water supposed to be coming in there? How long is the rain supposed to last? LEVENTHAL: We were told to expect heavy rain for the next three days. So we are. The surge could come sometime after midnight with high tide, but they are saying this storm is moving so slowly that it could be tomorrow morning, even midday tomorrow by the time the hurricane force winds get here. INGRAHAM: Got it. Rick, please stay safe out there. Please, please stay safe. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: And 60 houses set ablaze in north Boston tonight, a big gas leak, gas explosion. Our prayers are with those families. And for everybody in Florence's path, please, please stay safe. Follow instructions of officials. And our reporters on the scene, they'll be there all night. We thank them for their coverage. Please be sure to keep it tuned right here to Fox News Channel for the latest updates and information all throughout the night. It starts with Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team.

            "article_content": "Supreme Court reaches decision on the Trump administration's travel ban. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the latest version of President Trump's controversial travel ban that\u00a0affects residents of some majority-Muslim countries. The ban applies to people from Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also placed limits on people from North Korea and Venezuela. Since the president signed an executive order in January 2017 establishing a ban on travel of people from Muslim-majority nations, it has been a point of contention and challenged in court. Here\u2019s a look at the ban\u2019s journey through the legal system. In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court issued its first substantive ruling on a Trump administration policy on June 26, upholding the travel ban. The court said the president has substantial power to regulate immigration. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by his four conservative colleagues. \u201cThe sole prerequisite set forth in [federal law] is that the President find that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here,\u201d Roberts wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who dissented, said \"a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.\" People wait in line outside the Supreme Court in Washington, to be in the gallery when the court hears arguments over President Trump's ban on travelers from several mostly Muslim countries. (AP Photo/Jessica Gresko) In the last case the justices will hear until October, oral arguments on the travel ban will be delivered before the Supreme Court on April 25. This is the first time the justices are considering whether it violates immigration law or the Constitution. People waited for a seat inside the courtroom for days ahead of the hearing. A decision is expected by June. The Trump administration removed Chad from the travel ban because the African country had \u201cimproved its identity-management and information sharing practices\u201d enough, press secretary Sarah Sanders said. It had been included on the list because of an office supply glitch that prevented it from supplying homeland security officials with recent samples of its passports. It was also unable to adequately share public safety and terror-related information with U.S. officials who screen foreigners seeking to enter the country, officials said. Washington, D.C. and 16 states backed Hawaii\u2019s lawsuit against the travel ban with an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s discriminatory ban both hurts the families caught up in the chaos of his draconian policies, and undermines our states\u2019 residents, institutions, businesses and economies,\u201d New York Attorney Gen. Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The Supreme Court announced on Jan. 19 that it will rule on Trump's controversial travel ban.\u00a0The justices plan to hear arguments in April and issue a final ruling by late June. Handing the White House a huge judicial victory, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Trump\u2019s travel ban affecting residents of six majority-Muslim countries. Lower courts had said people from those countries with a \"bona fide\" relationship with someone in the United States could not be prevented from entry. Grandparents and cousins were among the relatives courts said could not be excluded. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request from Hawaii to temporarily block a version of Trump's travel ban, which was supposed to take effect at midnight ET on Oct. 18. Hawaii argued that the revised ban\u00a0\u2013 which included citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and some Venezuelan government officials and their families\u00a0\u2013 was a continuation of Trump's \"promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.\" \"Today\u2019s dangerously flawed district court order undercuts the President\u2019s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States,\" the White House said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President\u2019s lawful action.\" The Supreme Court didn\u2019t take action on a case that originated in Hawaii pertaining to Trump\u2019s travel ban and a ban on refugees. However, it did dismiss another case that originated in Maryland. That case involved a ban that has since expired and been replaced with a new one by the administration. The Department of Justice asked the nation\u2019s highest court to dismiss the case challenging the administration\u2019s travel ban. The administration argued the case should be dismissed because it was regarding a previous travel ban that is now moot. As Trump\u2019s original ban was set to expire, the president unveiled new restrictions on travel to the U.S. from certain countries\u2019 citizens. The revised ban included citizens from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also included some government officials from Venezuela. The Supreme Court blocked a lower court\u2019s decision that would have allowed refugees to enter the country under certain conditions, blocking a ruling that said a resettlement agency counts as a \u201cbona fide relationship.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that would allow for more refugees to enter the country despite the ban. The federal court ruled that refugees working with a resettlement agency would be considered to have established an approved \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d with a contact in the U.S. WHO DOES TRUMP\u2019S TRAVEL BAN BLOCK FROM ENTERING THE US? It also expanded the scope of a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to include other family members, such as grandparents and other relatives. People protest President Donald Trump's travel ban outside the U.S. Court of Appeals in Seattle. (Reuters/David Ryder) The Supreme Court, temporarily, allowed for the administration\u2019s travel ban to keep a strict enforcement on its ban of refugees. It did, however, leave in place the court order that made it easier for travelers from the six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S. and allowed a previous expansion of \u201cbona fide relationships\u201d to stay. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii, ruled that a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d certain travelers need before entering the U.S. could be expanded to include grandparents and other relatives. The Justice Department filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court for clarification. After the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the Trump administration issued guidance on who would be allowed into the country and who would be barred. The Supreme Court announced it would allow Trump to forge ahead with a limited version of his travel ban. Trump hailed the decision as a \u201cvictory for national security.\u201d HAWAII GETS CHANCE TO MAKE CASE FOR FIGHTING 3RD TRAVEL BAN The court said it would hear arguments in October, but until then, the ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could be enforced if the visitors lacked a \u201ccredible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia blocked the travel ban from being implemented. It had begun to hear the case earlier in May. \u201cWe remain unconvinced [the ban] has more to do with national security than it does with effectuating the President\u2019s promised Muslim ban,\" the court said at the time. The Department of Justice filed an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the ruling against the travel ban. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson granted a request to continue to halt the travel ban. Sitting in Maryland, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang temporarily halted the executive order. The injunction was not as comprehensive as the one issued earlier in Hawaii, but it did contend that the ban was discriminatory toward Muslims. The order did not change the previous injunction in Hawaii, but rather just reinforced it. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson prevented the travel ban from being implemented just before it was set to take effect. Watson granted the state of Hawaii\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order. Trump called the decision an \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach.\u201d The state of Hawaii sued in an attempt to halt the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban from going into effect. Lawyers said the \u201cnew executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the State of Hawaii contrary to its state Constitution.\u201d Lawyers also argued that the ban would damage Hawaii\u2019s \u201ceconomy, educational institutions and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state\u2019s citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society.\u201d Trump signed a new executive order which barred travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days \u2013 removing Iraq from the new ban. The new order also exempted permanent residents and current visa holders from the travel ban. Syrian refugees were still included in the new order but only for 120 instead of indefinitely. Texas Attorney Ken Paxton split with other states and defended the travel ban as he filed documents with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking to reconsider a decision blocking the ban. Paxton argued that the order is a legal exercise of presidential authority. A federal judge in Virginia granted an injunction to prevent the administration from implementing the ban. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said the ban was unconstitutional as it had a religious bias. The travel ban\u2019s suspension was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in a unanimous decision. MUSLIM ADVOCATES, LEGAL ORG FILES SUITS OVER TRAVEL BAN Those judges\u00a0were Michelle Friedland, appointed by former President Barack Obama; Richard Clifton, appointed by former President George W. Bush; and William Canby, appointed by former President Jimmy Carter. The court began to hear arguments from the Justice Department and lawyers from the states of Washington and Maryland \u2013 in opposition to the ban \u2013 on Feb. 7. The Justice Department filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking it to intervene and reverse a previous judge\u2019s decision to halt the travel ban. Sixteen attorneys general filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0in support of the lawsuit against the travel ban. Those included: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton did not extend a temporary injunction against the administration\u2019s travel ban. But U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle did issue a temporary block of the ban on the same day. \u201cThe state has met its burden in demonstrating immediate and irreparable injury,\u201d Robart said as he ruled in favor of lawyers from the states of Washington and Minnesota. The Trump administration tweaked its travel ban to exempt legal permanent residents of the U.S. AFGHAN GIRLS ROBOTICS TEAM ARRIVES IN US JUST IN TIME \u201cThey no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of green card holders. Senate Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats to overturn the executive order. When Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. sought a vote on legislation to reverse the ban, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., objected. Trump also fired acting Attorney Gen. Sally Yates on this day when she refused to defend the travel ban. A Boston federal court temporarily put Trump\u2019s travel ban on hold for one week. The ruling stipulated that previously approved refugees, valid visa holders and lawful permanent residents or travelers from the seven countries included in Trump\u2019s order could not be detained or removed from the U.S. because of the executive order. A federal judge in New York issued an emergency order blocking, in part, the executive order. U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly\u2019s ruling temporarily barred the U.S. from deporting people who arrived with a valid visa or who had already completed a refugee application. As dozens of people were detained after their planes landed in the U.S.,\u00a0massive protests\u00a0erupted at airports nationwide. Trump signed an executive order which immediately barred entry into the U.S. for the citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The order, dubbed \u201cProtection the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,\u201d also halted the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, but indefinitely barred all Syrian refugees from entering the country.

            "article_content": "On Monday, Laura Ingraham redefines the caravan of a reported 14,000 migrants as a \u2018mobile mob.\u2019 Then later, Laura inspects a sexual assault allegation made against Senator Corey Booker. Plus: Raymond Arroyo interviews attendees at President Trump\u2019s Texas rally in support of Senator Ted Cruz. Just as in 2016, there is no politician in America today who has a better read on what the voters want than Donald Trump.\u00a0\nLast night in Houston at a rally for Ted Cruz, President Trump\u00a0drew a reported18,000 people with thousands more stuck outside. But the excitement\u00a0isn't confined to Houston. New data from NBC News indicates that the Democrats' hope of a 'blue wave' may be receding. Republican voters are outpacing Democrats in early voting in seven key states: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas. Democrats are leading only in Nevada. And the president's approval rating is as high as it's ever been. The hosts of MSNBC's early show, which ought to be renamed\u00a0\"In Mourning\u00a0Joe,\"\u00a0are apoplectic.\n\"Nearly half of the people in this country approve of the job this man is doing, even after Charlottesville, porn stars, his humiliation in Helsinki, bowing to Kim Jong Un, ripping babies from their mothers calling Hispanics breeders, destroying America's most critical alliances, and bankrupting our country, and we could go on,\" said a disbelieving Mika Brzezinski\u00a0.\nLions and tigers and bears, oh my! Mika hasn't been this upset since, I don't know, election night?\u00a0\nIt turns out that people across the country vote their pocketbooks and choose results over resistance. Republicans are trouncing Democrats by 15 points in the category of who best handles the economy. Another big issue where the far-left liberals just don't seem to understand normal Americans is illegal immigration, and specifically the so-called \"caravan.\" Yes, that's what everyone calls the horde of migrants storming through Mexico and making their way to our border. Merriam-Webster's definition of caravan is: \"a company of travelers on a journey yesterday through a desert or hostile region. Also, a train of pack animals. Secondary, a group of vehicles traveling together as in a file. A covered wagon or motor vehicle equipped as traveling living quarters.\" The word \"caravan\" colloquially connotes something fun, festive, desirable. Well, yet other descriptions come to mind among Americans and legal immigrants watching this all play out. They wonder why their country would welcome with open arms people who barged across the border even as disabled veterans sleep on the street. They wonder if liberal politicians simply see the migrant mob as future Democratic votes. And they wonder why illegal immigrants should be able to find work when many Americans still cannot.\nTrue refugees fleeing oppression will encamp wherever they can away from their place of origin, which they have fled to escape danger. In this case, we would see folks from Central America staying in Mexico. Legitimate seekers of asylum must live in credible fear of government repression based on religious, racial or ethnic identity. Home country violence and government corruption, as terrible as they are, and whether it's in Central America or anywhere else, are not sufficient bases for asylum, nor is the desire just to get a better job or live a better life. If simply wanting a better life warranted asylum in the U.S., our population would be roughly 6 billion by now. So who are these migrants who, according a Mexican newspaper have swelled to 14,000 from the initial 1600 just last week? They're mostly working-age males. A far smaller number of women and children are usually seen out in front. Many have friends or family already in the United States, many of\u00a0whom are here illegally. Of course, they're impoverished with little to no English speaking skills at all. They're from Honduras, Guatemala, and many from Mexico. Others we don't know where they're from and it's undetermined how many have documents at all. How many have health problems or even criminal records? The president yesterday told reporters to do some digging instead of just the glossy, easy sob-story reporting.\n\"You're going to find MS-13, you're going to find Middle Easterners,\" President Trump told reporters. \"You're going to find everything. And guess what? We're not allowing them in our country.\" It doesn't matter where people come from, whether it be Central America, Europe or any other part of the world. If they come illegally,\u00a0most Americans think it's not fair and\u00a0President\u00a0Trump agrees. Not only would allowing this crush of people into our country be an insult to the millions of Americans who went through the legal process, it would be unfair to Americans who need help and are not getting it, like the 40,000 homeless veterans on the street on any given night. When it comes down to deciding between\u00a0those folks or an angry mob of foreign migrants, President Trump knows the answer: America first.

            "article_content": "U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warns against use of chemical weapons in Syria. Iran is \"feeling the pain\" from the sweeping sanctions revived by President Trump in August, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News exclusively in a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday. \"They feel weak and we are suffocating them to the point that they have to address ballistic missiles; they have to address their support on terrorism,\" Haley told \"Special Report\" anchor Bret Baier. The Trump administration this summer restored major sanctions against Iran in the areas of automobiles, gold and other key metals. The sanctions had been suspended under former President Barack Obama's 2015 nuclear deal, pummelling the value of currency there and threatening to further unravel the Islamic country's already-struggling economy. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal in May, saying its enforcement and monitoring mechanisms were too lenient and calling for Iran to return to the negotiating table. IRAN LOOKS TO CHINA FOR HELP AS SANCTIONS DECIMATE ECONOMY Even more severe U.S. sanctions against Iran's banking and energy sectors are slated to go into effect in November, including restrictions on Iran's oil industry that could cut off a crucial source of hard currency. \"Our focus right now is on the Iranian people,\" Haley said, acknowledging the unrest in the country. \"I mean, they have protested, they have spoken out, they have said they want a better life. ... But at the end of the day, we can\u2019t allow them to have any nuclear programs.\" Responding to a report that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has approved a gas attack in the Idlib Province, the last remaining rebel stronghold in the country, Haley also issued a pointed warning to Iran and other key players in the Middle East. TRUMP CALLS POTENTIAL MEDDLING IN ELECTIONS A 'NATIONAL EMERGENCY' \"What we told, you know, the Syrians, the Russians and the Iranians was, well, twice -- we have warned you not to use chemical weapons; twice you have used it, and twice President Trump has acted,\" Haley said. \"Don\u2019t test us again. Because I think the odds are very much against them.\" For Russia and Iran, both allies of the Syrian government, retaking Idlib is crucial to complete what they see as a military victory in Syria\u2019s civil war after Syrian troops recaptured nearly all other major towns and cities, largely defeating the rebellion against Assad. U.N. officials believe an offensive on Idlib would trigger a wave of displacement that could uproot an estimated 800,000 people and discourage refugees from returning home. The U.S. and France have warned that an Idlib offensive would give rise to a humanitarian crisis, and that a chemical attack in Idlib would prompt Western retaliation. President Trump, who ordered Syrian targets bombed last year and again in April this year after purported chemical attacks, said earlier this month that any further uses of chemical arms would be a \"grave mistake.' On Sunday, government forces bombed the village of Hobeit in Idlib Province, killing an infant girl and wounding several other civilians, the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group reported. Responding to reports that former Secretary of State John Kerry may be telling foreign countries to wait out Trump's administration, Haley again slammed the Obama administration's previous deal with Iran. \"They can wait this president out, but this president is what saved us with this policy. Because otherwise, within just a few years, they would have gotten all this money and it would have been lifted anyway,\" she said, referring to the eventual sunset of key provisions of the Iran deal. For example, some restrictions on the number of centrifuges Iran could produce, as well as research and development into centrifuges, were set to expire in 2025, although larger restrictions on the country's ability to produce weaponized nuclear weapons were to be indefinite. Asked separately about President Trump's Wednesday authorization of sanctions against any country that interferes with U.S. elections, Haley said the message was clear: \"Straight shot across the bow. To anyone that wants to mess with our midterm elections, get involved in our midterm elections; use any kind of fraud -- the president is saying, if you do it, you will pay.\" Haley also addressed the worsening economic and humanitarian crises in Venezuela, saying the situation is clearly linked to the country's socialist policies. \"What I will tell you is Maduro needs to go,\" Haley told Baier. \" I was on the Venezuelan border about a month ago, and saw literally a million people cross that border every day for their only meal. You had people bringing their last possessions to sell in Colombia, just to buy food. And this is all because of failed socialism that led to corruption, a dictatorship and poverty. Inflation is about to hit the 1 million percent mark there.\" She compared the problems in Venuzuela to those in Nicaragua, where anti-government protesters are demanding President Daniel Ortega leave office. Haley charged that both leaders have \"gotten high on power.\" \"Ortega and Maduro are cut from the same cloth,\" Haley said. \"They are making money off of their people. They don\u2019t care if they are starving. They don\u2019t care what they do.\" Fox News' Bret Baier and Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Bob Hugin is going nuclear against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez in the final days of the closer-than-expected New Jersey Senate race. An angry Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez on Wednesday fired back at his Republican opponent for airing a new ad reviving salacious allegations that the senator had sex with underage prostitutes during past trips to the Dominican Republic -- calling the claims \"lies.\" \u201cI\u2019m going to keep my remarks brief because I\u2019m worried about what language I might use,\u201d a fired-up Menendez said at a Hackensack news conference, surrounded by female supporters. The New Jersey senator called\u00a0the ad from Republican opponent Bob Hugin \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cdesperate.\u201d \u201cThese are lies,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cI know it. You know it. And Bob Hugin damn sure knows it as well.\u201d Menendez has long denied the allegations as a smear since they first surfaced on a news site in 2012. \u201cIt stoops so low with its bogus lies that it might as well been directed by Donald Trump himself,\u201d the Democratic senator said. Menendez\u2019s press conference came after Hugin, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive, began airing the explosive television ad this week that cites papers filed in federal court by prosecutors in 2015 acknowledging the FBI probed the prostitution allegations as part of its corruption case against Menendez. \u201cIt\u2019s right here in this shocking FBI affidavit,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Justice Department had evidence that for several years, Senator Menendez had been traveling to the Dominican Republic to engage in sexual activity with prostitutes \u2013 some of whom were minors.\u201d HUGIN REVIVES PROSTITUTION ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MENENDEZ Prosecutors declined to bring charges related to the prostitution claims, though they did pursue a bribery case against him. A mistrial was declared last year after the jury failed to reach a verdict in that case. In 2015 court papers, prosecutors said the FBI investigated Menendez and donor Salomon Melgen after being presented \u201cwith specific, corroborated allegations\u201d they had sex with underage prostitutes, though they decided against bringing any charges on those claims. (Melgen was later convicted in a separate Medicare fraud case, and sentenced to 17 years in prison.) \u201cPresented with specific, corroborated allegations that defendants Menendez and Melgen had sex with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, the Government responsibly and dutifully investigated those serious allegations,\u201d the papers stated, in response to claims from the defendants that the allegations were \"false\" and tainted the case. MENENDEZ FACES UNEXPECTED DANGER IN DEEP-BLUE NEW JERSEY The prosecutors also wrote: \u201cConfronted with corroborating evidence of such serious crimes, it would have been an inexcusable abdication of responsibility not to investigate these allegations.\u201d The Hugin ad\u2019s narrator also takes a swing\u00a0at Menendez over claims made at the time by Menendez\u2019s lawyers, as\u00a0documented in the 2015 court filing, who argued \u201csuch easily disprovable\u201d allegations of cavorting with underage prostitutes\u00a0\u201cwould hardly be a federal crime even had it been true.\u201d \u201cAs an initial matter, it is most certainly a federal crime to leave the country for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sex act with a minor, and the defendants\u2019 suggestion to the contrary is unsettling,\u201d prosecutors wrote\u00a0in response. New Jersey hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate in 46 years. But Hugin has been spending millions on negative ads reminding voters of Menendez\u2019s past ethics troubles. A sign that Democrats are taking Hugin\u2019s challenge seriously: the Senate Majority PAC,\u00a0which is aligned with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, announced plans to spend $3 million this week on anti-Hugin ads.",

            "article_content": "Thousands of families are leaving Guatemala and other countries in Central America; Genevieve Wood of the Heritage Foundation shares insight. Two senators on different sides of the political divide agreed on Sunday that the issue along the border is a \u201crefugee crisis\u201d and not an \u201cimmigration crisis,\u201d but were split on why thousands of families are fleeing Central America for the United States. Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Angus King, I-Maine, agreed that the people attempting to cross the U.S. southern border illegally were coming here for a better life, but the former believes it is for economic reasons while the latter says it\u2019s because of violence in Central America. \u201cThey\u2019re fleeing violence,\u201d King said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cThis is different from the waves of illegal immigrants coming 15 to 20 years ago mostly from Mexico, simply looking for jobs.\u201d Lankford countered that assertion by arguing migrants are coming to the U.S. and not going to other, less violent countries in Latin America. \u201cThe vast majority of these individuals are coming for economic reasons,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from Central America, that's why they're not going to Belize or Ecuador -- who also have great asylum laws. They're coming to the U.S. because they want to have economic opportunities, not just asylum.\u201d The number of families entering the U.S. illegally at the southwest border jumped six-fold in May to 9,485, compared with the same month in 2017. Since October, more than 58,000 have arrived, the bulk from Guatemala, followed by Honduras and El Salvador. Feelings of desperation are being felt throughout Central America, where the lawlessness, endemic poverty and levels of gang violence akin to war zones that have driven so many families from their homes show little signs of abating. In March 15, 2017 file photo, police investigators carry a body to a forensic vehicle, after a shootout between private security guards and gang members, at the central market in San Salvador, El Salvador, Wednesday, March 15, 2017. The rate of violent death in El Salvador is still higher than all countries suffering armed conflict except for Syria. ((AP Photo/Salvador Melendez)) The rate of violent death in El Salvador is still higher than all countries suffering armed conflict except for Syria, with a murder rate of 99.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, according to the most recent global study by the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey. The number of people displaced in the nation of 6.5 million by turf battles between the country's two biggest gangs, MS-13 and Barrio 18, skyrocketed last year to 296,000, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. In neighboring Honduras, one of Latin America's poorest and most violent nations, adding to the sense of insecurity is the country's role as a major transit point for South American cocaine as well as the political turmoil and civil unrest that have followed hard-line President Juan Orlando Hernandez's re-election last November amid allegations he stole the vote. In Guatemala \u2014 the third of the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Central America \u2014 criminal activity is also spreading, adding to the discrimination and abuse long faced by the indigenous communities that are among the largest groups fleeing poverty. \"This isn't about immigrants chasing the American dream anymore,\" said Sofia Martinez, a Guatemala-based analyst for the International Crisis Group and author of a recent report on gang violence in Central America, \"Mafia of the Poor.\" \"It's about escaping a death sentence,\" she said.

            "article_content": "'Medicare for All' plan pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to a new study. The \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and endorsed by a host of Democratic congressional and presidential hopefuls would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, according to a new study. The Vermont senator has avoided conducting his own cost analysis, and those supporting the plan have at times struggled to explain how they could pay for it. The study, released Monday by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, showed the plan\u00a0would require historic tax increases. The hikes would allow the government to replace what employers and consumers currently pay for health care -- delivering significant savings on administration and drug costs, but increased demand for care that would drive up spending, according to the report. According to the report, the legislation\u2019s federal health care commitments would reach approximately 10.7 of GDP by 2022, and rise to nearly 12.7 percent of GDP by 2031. But the study, conducted by senior research strategist Charles Blahous, said that those estimates were on the \u201cconservative\u201d side. Sanders\u2019 plan builds on Medicare, the insurance program for seniors. The proposal would require all U.S. residents be covered with no copays and deductibles for medical services. The insurance industry would be regulated to play a minor role in the system. Sanders is far from the only liberal lawmaker pushing the program. 2020 hopefuls like Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., endorsed a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program last year. Political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in a recent upset primary and instantly became a prominent face of the democratic socialist movement, also is promoting a \"Medicare for all\" platform. \u201cEnacting something like \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 would be a transformative change in the size of the federal government,\u201d Blahous, who was a senior economic adviser to former President George W. Bush and a public trustee of Social Security and Medicare during the Obama administration, said. Blahous\u2019 study also found that \u201ca doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.\u201d But Sanders blasted the analysis as \u201cgrossly misleading and biased,\u201d noting that the Mercatus Center receives funding from the conservative Koch brothers. Koch Industries CEO Charles Koch is on the center\u2019s board. \u201cIf every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all, and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States cannot do the same,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThis grossly misleading and biased report is the Koch brothers\u2019 response to the growing support in our country for a \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 program.\u201d A spokesman for Sanders said that the senator\u2019s office has not done a cost analysis on the new plan, however the estimates in the latest report are within the range for other cost projections for Sanders\u2019 2016 plan. Sanders' staff found an error in an original version of the Mercatus report, which counted a long-term care program that was in the 2016 proposal but not the current one. Blahous corrected it, reducing his estimate by about $3 trillion over 10 years. Blahous says the report is his own work, not the Koch brothers'. Also called \"single-payer\" over the years, \"Medicare for all\" reflects a long-time wish among liberals for a government-run system that covers all Americans. The idea won broad rank-and-file support after Sanders ran on it in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Looking ahead to the 2020 election, Democrats are debating whether single-payer should be a \"litmus test\" for national candidates. The Mercatus analysis estimated the 10-year cost of \"Medicare for all\" from 2022 to 2031, after an initial phase-in. Its findings are similar to those of several independent studies of Sanders' 2016 plan. Those studies found increases in federal spending over 10 years that ranged from $24.7 trillion to $34.7 trillion. The Mercatus study takes issue with a key cost-saving feature of the plan -- that hospitals and doctors will accept payment based on lower Medicare rates for all their patients. The study found that the plan would reap substantial savings from lower prescription costs -- $846 billion over 10 years -- since the government would deal directly with drugmakers. Savings from streamlined administration would be even greater, nearly $1.6 trillion. But other provisions of the plan are also expected to drive up spending, with coverage for nearly 30 million uninsured Americans, no copays and no deductibles and improved benefits on dental, vision and hearing. The study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "People hold candles as they gather for a vigil in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Congregation, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PITTSBURGH \u2013 A gunman who's believed to have spewed anti-Semitic slurs and rhetoric on social media barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in U.S. history. The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said. The suspect, Robert Bowers, traded gunfire with police and was shot several times. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offenses. It wasn't immediately known if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. \"Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe,\" Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, characterizing the slaughter as a \"terrible and unspeakable act of hate.\" The mass shooting came amid a rash of high-profile attacks in an increasingly divided country, one day after a Florida man was arrested and charged with mailing a series of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and little more than a week before the midterm elections. The killings also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue \"had some kind of protection\" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf noted that once again \"dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way.\" Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in \"solemn respect\" for the shooting victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. Authorities say that just before 10 a.m., Bower entered the large synagogue with an assault-style rifle and three handguns. Three separate congregations were conducting Sabbath services in different areas of the large building, according to Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office said it was told by victims that a brit milah \u2014 a ritual circumcision ceremony at which a baby boy also receives his Hebrew name \u2014 was also taking place, though law enforcement officials later said no children were among the dead or wounded. \"It is a very horrific crime scene,\" said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director. \"It's one of the worst that I've seen.\" The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning, he said. The mass shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Chicago and elsewhere increased security at Jewish centers. Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers \"were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,\" though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known. Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record, expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on a social media site called Gab, according to an Associated Press review of an archived version of the posts made under his name. The cover photo for his account featured a neo-Nazi symbol, and his recent posts included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews during World War II. Other posts referenced false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust \u2014 in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished \u2014 was a hoax. He wrote of a Jewish \"infestation,\" using a slur for Jews. Gab confirmed Bowers had a profile on its website, which is popular with far-right extremists. Before the shooting, the poster believed to be Bowers also wrote that \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.\" HIAS is a nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group believes Saturday's attack was the deadliest on the Jewish community in U.S. history. \"Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh,\" Greenblatt said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was \"heartbroken and appalled\" by the attack. \"The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead,\" Netanyahu said. \"We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.\" Thousands of people, some holding candles, gathered for a vigil in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Saturday night in honor of the victims, whose names were not immediately released. A chant of \"vote, vote, vote\" broke out during the emotional gathering. Some attendees blamed the shooting on the nation's political climate, and said they took little solace in the planned visit by Trump. At a political rally in Murphysboro, Illinois, Trump said \"the evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us.\" The president \u2014 who, at times, has been accused by critics of failing to adequately condemn hate, such as when he blamed \"both sides\" for the violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally in 2017 \u2014 said that anti-Semitism must be \"confronted and condemned everywhere it rears it very ugly head.\" He called for the imposition of the death penalty for \"crimes like this.\" The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. The facade of the fortress-like concrete building is punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God's law, the \"life cycle\" and \"how human-beings should care for the earth and one another,\" according to its website. Among its treasures is a \"Holocaust Torah,\" rescued from Czechoslovakia. Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250 people. Eisenberg, the former synagogue president, said officials at Tree of Life had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at the synagogue who retired more than a year ago, said the building is locked during the week, and is outfitted with security cameras. \"But on Sabbath it's an open door,\" he said. \"You know, you're always worried that something would happen,\" said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light Congregation, which meets at Tree of Life. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday's service. \"But you never dream that it would happen like this,\" Snider added. \"Just never ever dream that it would happen like this.\" ___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo in Washington, Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia, Gene Puskar in Pittsburgh, Marc Levy in Harrisburg and Allen G.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK \u2013 Over 100 migrants and refugees held captive by human traffickers were shot at while escaping from a clandestine prison in northwestern Libya and there were numerous deaths and injuries, Doctors Without Borders said Friday. The international medical organization, also known as Medicins Sans Frontiers, said many people in the town of Bani Walid including members of security forces, hospital and municipal workers, and elders tried to protect the escapees as they were chased by their captors and armed men attempting to recapture them. MSF said survivors of Wednesday night's escape reported that at least 15 people were killed and up to 40 people, mostly women, were left behind. It said MSF staff helped treat 25 injured people at Bani Walid General Hospital including seven with severe gunshot wounds and multiple fractures. The organization said the survivors are mostly teenagers from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia seeking asylum in Europe. Some of the traumatized survivors told MSF staff that they had been held captive for up to three years, the group said. Many had visible scars, electric burn marks, and old, infected wounds, illustrating the ordeal they had suffered, it said. Libya plunged into chaos following a 2011 uprising that toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Since 2014, the country has been split between rival governments and parliaments based in the western and eastern regions, each backed by different militias and tribes. A U.N.-brokered deal in December 2015 to create a unity government failed, but efforts are under way to try to hold elections this year. MSF said the escape and shootings are the latest example of \"the ongoing horrors\" suffered by many migrants and refugees fleeing poverty and conflicts in Africa and the Middle East and transiting through Libya seeking a better life in Europe. \"Kidnapping for ransom remains a thriving business, boosted by European Union-sponsored policies aimed at criminalizing migrants and refugees and preventing them from reaching European shores at all cost,\" MSF said. The organization said it has been working for about a year in the Bani Walid region, where migrants reportedly face widespread kidnapping, torture and extortion. But MSF said it has no access to the clandestine prisons in the area. It said the survivors of Wednesday night's escape, under the supervision of local Bani Walid security forces, were transferred to a security facility in Bani Walid, and on Thursday they were moved again to detention centers in the capital Tripoli. MSF said its medical teams in Tripoli are carrying out medical consultations and 14 severely wounded patients have been referred for hospital care. \"All necessary measures must be taken to ensure patients can access the required treatment and to protect these extremely vulnerable people from further harm after surviving such atrocities,\" said Christophe Biteau, the head of MSF's Libya mission. \"Arbitrary detention cannot be a solution.

JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Lawrence Jones, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, 4 o'clock in Dallas, Texas, and this is The Five.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nWelcome to \"The Five\" live from Dallas. We're here on the campus of Southern Methodist University for the whole hour. The SMU Mustang band is playing for us. We have a great show. There's a ton of tight races to talk about in the midterms, the migrant caravan is getting even bigger as President Trump threatens to stop it. Plus, we're answering questions from some of the students in the crowd, and Lawrence has some big surprises for us that he brought back from the Texas state fair. So, Greg, how is Texas treating you so far?\u00a0\nGREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: I love it. Although, I will say a marching band is not good for the hangover.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Not at all.\u00a0\nWATTERS: You had sweet tea last night.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: As the worst thing that you could possibly hear when your head is just reeling from pain. But this is -- we've got all guys, one girl. This is like out-lumbered.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nDANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Boy, you're hilarious.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That joke takes a while to figure out.\u00a0\nPERINO: I, for one, love a marching band.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You do.\u00a0\nPERINO: I love the marching band. Thank you for being here.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Juan, do you feel welcome here in the great state of Texas or what?\u00a0\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, you know what? Someone else said they're the lone star. I think that was Gregory.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But I feel like -- and also, what fun it is to be right next to the stadium. Man, I tell you what, SMU football.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: People know about the Mustangs.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nWATTERS: There's definitely no kneeling going on in that stadium.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, that was huge, by the way. Their bathrooms are massive.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Thank you, Gregory.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Their bathrooms are dark and large.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nLAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: I know that we have a lot of Fox News supporters here in the great state of Texas because we defend liberty here, they believe in the president. They believe in what we're doing in Fox News.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nJONES: So, yes, it's good to be back home.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: They also buy a lot of our books.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yes. You know they say everything is bigger in Texas, including Greg's ego.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. There's a lot to cover, so let's just go right to it. With just 15 days to go, President Trump's approval rating hits an all-time high. Surging fast in the national poll. This comes as the president heads to Houston, Texas, tonight, for what's expected to be a massive rally for Senator Ted Cruz. Supporters began lining up over the weekend to get a good spot, and the president's 2020 campaign says 100,000 people have RSVP. Amid these positive signs for Republicans, President Trump very confident going into the midterms.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the Republicans are going to do very nicely. We're doing very well with the senate, and he was just asking about the race. Other than two years ago, the presidential race, I have never seen spirit like I see right now. I think the Republicans are going to do very well.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Meanwhile, Democrats tamping down expectations of a so-called blue wave.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTOM PEREZ, DNC CHAIRMAN: You always knew that this election was going to be close. I don't use the term blue wave. I still have a lot of confidence in the house. I know the senate is a tougher map but we've got great candidates. And then I look at these governors' races and I see the work that's being done.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWATTERS: So, Dana, the generic congressional matchup ballot is shrinking now down to single digits, primarily if you look at the average. And then the competitive races, very tight. What do you think about this so-called blue wave at this point?\u00a0\nPERINO: I think that it's not possible in the Senate. I think the Republicans will keep the Senate and they will add to their numbers there. So that is -- it's just a tough year for Democrats. That math is hard. But guess what, it doesn't get any better for them in 2020, really, because of where the states are that you have contests. So turnout will be important and you might be able to tell a lot about 2020 once we finalize this midterm election.\u00a0\nBut in the house, I can't tell if the Democrats are doing a little bit of tamping down expectations because they want their people to get worried so that they will try to boost turnout or if it's kind of just demoralizing. They have all this build up, and now here you have Tom Perez, the DNC head saying, yeah, I never thought it's really going to be that good anyway. I don't think they'll be a blue wave. Does that just demoralize them even further and they not turnout, I don't know.\u00a0\nWATTERS: How can the Democrats be demoralized even further, Greg?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, the blue wave is now -- officially a blue trickle. I think the Democratic Party need a giant box of depends because they are leaking everywhere. Here's why. You know what the Democratic Party is like, they're like the guy who shows up at the bar who wears too much aftershave, he's got his shirt open, he's trying really hard but he's guilty of overreach. Everything the Dems have done is overreach. Kavanaugh, overreach. Stormy Daniels, overreach. The caravan, overreach. They try so hard and it blows up in their faces because nobody takes them seriously. They have absolutely no results. They just have anger and emotion.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right, Juan, tone down the aftershave, all right. You're scaring everybody off. What do you think about this now coming from the head of the DNC trying to lower expectations?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think it's smart. I think what you want to say to your Democratic base that has a tremendously high level of enthusiasm is, don't take anything for granted. Don't get complacent. You better get out there and vote. But, you know, let's go back to the top of the show. You were talking about Trump's numbers going up, now exceeding President Obama back in 2010.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yeah.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But remember, Obama lost 63 seats.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Wasn't a good year.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that.\u00a0\nWATTERS: It was not a good year.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Because there's a lot of people out there who were cheering you, Jesse, and I just want them to know the truth. And the second thing is, high-level.\u00a0\nWATTERS: But they all have great taste behind us.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, they do. They have great barbeque. But, you know, I think, remember, there's high levels of enthusiasm where, in fact, right now, a record level of enthusiasm for this midterm race. And a lot of it, I think, is generated by the fact that people think there's a lot at stake and there certainly is. I agree with Tom Perez, the map for the senate, very difficult. But I think right now for the house if you look at the numbers, things look pretty good for the Democrats, but they need their voters to turn out. And in a state like Texas, who thought that a Democrat could challenge Ted Cruz? That's the story.\u00a0\n(BOOING)\u00a0\nJONES: I think the Democrats overplayed their hand. This is why they're struggling so much. And they never quite got a message. Everything was what they were against. You could never determine what their why was. And right now they're getting Republicans to the polls. The biggest advantage they had was Republicans were complacent. They got the tax cut that they wanted. They may be angry at congress for not getting health care, but they were going to stay at home. With the Kavanaugh stuff and the mob mentality that they have with socialism, now Republicans, especially in the state of Texas, are fired up and they will be going to the polls.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Now, Juan mentioned Beto O'Rourke, and I believe the president had some words for the Democratic senate candidate here. Let's listen.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: I think Beto O'Rourke is highly overrated. When I heard about him, I figured he must be something a little special. He's not. I thought he got beaten badly in the debates. I think he's a highly overrated guy.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. He also said something about Ted Cruz and it looks like there may be a nickname change. Let's listen.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: He's not Lying Ted anymore. I call him Texas Ted. Ted Cruz and I had a very, very nasty, tough campaign. It was very competitive. It was a very tough campaign.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. So, overrated O'Rourke and beautiful Ted.\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, see -- he was trying something out there and then he said Texas Ted, like he wants the alliteration. I don't think I would have gone with overrated or work. I would have used Beto, right? Because it's actually is an interesting topic.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What? Beto male? Or you just call him the master.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What are you talking about?\u00a0\nWATTERS: I have no idea.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Really good at his job.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Jesse, it's too late. It's too late.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nPERINO: I've got it.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Lying Ted is going nowhere and he's now having regrets. So he wants to live in the moment and say, oh, beautiful, beautiful Ted. Get out of here.\u00a0\nJONES: The problem with Beto is he's running a national campaign. Texans hates that.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's true.\u00a0\nJONES: And so the fact that he wants to make this a social media campaign and opus to national politics, he just doesn't understand Texas.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, imagine Donald Trump running a social media campaign. Never heard of such.\u00a0\nJONES: Well, he's the president of the United States. You're making my point.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Lawrence said that Texas is its own state. I hear Texas is its own country. Up next, a massive migrant caravan headed for the U.S. nearly doubles in size as President Trump promises to get tough to stop it. That and more as The Five continues from Southern Methodist University.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Welcome back to \"The Five\" live in Dallas, Texas. A caravan of Central American migrants is reportedly swelling in size to about 7,000 people as it pushes north toward the U.S. border. In response, President Trump is threatening to cut off foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if they don't stop this massive group. Trump is also clashing with the media over who is in the caravan and who is to blame.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: You know what you should do, just go into the middle of the caravan, take your cameras and search. OK. Search. No, no, take your -- take your camera, go into the middle and search. You're going to fight MS-13. You're going to find Middle Eastern. You're going to find everything. And guess what, we're not allowing them in our country. What's happening at the border was caused by the Democrats because they won't let anybody change immigration laws that are horrible.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Lawrence, criminal, MS-13, caused by the Democrats? What's going on?\u00a0\nJONES: Because the Democrats believe in open borders.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, is that right.\u00a0\nJONES: I don't understand how you all can be competitive in border states such as Texas, advocating for illegals to come across the border.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't think anybody.\u00a0\nJONES: But quite frankly, we don't know who's in that crowd that's coming across the border, but that's just the fact. The American people don't want people coming across the border without vetting, right? That's the problem.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: OK, Jesse, do you agree? Do you think that the president is demonizing these people who are seeking asylum?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yeah, the president is telling the press to do its job and report the facts. Listen, we are a melting pot but we're also a nation of laws. And we don't like people kicking down the border and demanding citizenship. We want it done the right way and the proper way. And there's a lot of fake news about the caravan too. They're making it out to be a bunch of mothers with young children. But if you look at the video, you know, your eyes aren't going to lie to you. There's teenage kids. There's 20-year- old men. And they brutally broke through the border into Mexico, roughed up some of the border police on the Mexican side. They're wearing t-shirts that are calling our president the devil. And a lot of people in America are looking at these visual and saying this looks like a hostile crew. And we're not necessarily going to welcome you with open arms if you're going to behave that way. And then once they get a little north, they pay the drug cartels $5,000 for a family unit, so now the drug cartels are basically acting like tollbooth operators for America. So if the Democrats want open borders, they're on the same side as the drug cartels. Mexico has to step up and stop this. America would never let other citizens flow through our country in a caravan size the way Mexico is doing.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So, President Lopez overdoing it in Mexico, Dana. They say people in the caravan aren't leaving for pleasure. They're leaving out in necessity, about desire for the American dream, economic opportunity. And then the Democrats are saying, oh, President Trump is demonizing those people seeking asylum. What do you say?\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, I think this entire episode -- if Democrats think that the caravan is helping their cause, they're wrong. If you are somebody who wants more legal immigration in the country, if you think that immigration is our strength, this is not helping. You take someone like me, very sympathetic to refugees. This, to me, does not look like refugees. And also, you have able-bodied young men. I understand that the economic conditions in their country are not good, but then stay there and fight for it, OK.\u00a0\nJONES: Yeah.\u00a0\nPERINO: Like we don't have to be responsible for that. And I am one -- I would take a lot more refugees, actual refugees. I think that that is an important thing than America does for the world. I think it's a leader on that. But this is -- this is not -- now, take somebody like me who is pretty moderate on immigration from that standpoint and you have me feeling this way about this caravan, then you've got a real problem. It's not helping you.\u00a0\nJONES: They'll fight the Border Patrol but they won't fight for their own country, which is sad. Meanwhile, they'll send their kids across the border with the cartel many times. If anybody has done research on human trafficking, a lot of these kids that their parents send them across the border end up as sex slaves. But they want us to be compassionate when they end up behind bars. I mean, it's absurd.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: So, Greg, a lot of threat now from the president saying he's going to cut foreign aid.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Right.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But if you cut foreign aid to these countries, don't you worsen the conditions and make it more likely that people are seeking asylum?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I don't think so. In fact, I think that this is the worst possible visual the Democrats have right now, unless, like, Bernie Sanders came out wearing a thong. Other than that, this is like -- you can't -- this is -- this crystallizes the lack of process.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Bernie bros might like that.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah, yeah. The process is a system, due process. That's what we want. What this is saying we don't care. We just have a goal. We want these people to come. If they so believe in the system of our government, why are they violating it so brazenly while holding onto their flag and talking about how great their country is as they're storming our border? Our border is what defined a country. It's crazy. And to the point about how -- Trump demonizing other people, who's been demonized the most? Every time you try to come out for some kind of process, they call you heartless or racist. Maxine Waters told people to go after Republicans and conservatives, and that is essentially demonization. So the demonization thing it goes both ways.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: But isn't it process that people come to the border and apply?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Not in that way. That's not a process.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think they have a right to apply.\u00a0\nPERINO: At the port of entry.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: All right. A new study reveals who is the most politically biased on college campuses. The answer ahead on \"The Five\" live from Dallas.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Ah, my head. All right, a new study found that among campus administrators, liberals outnumber conservatives by 12 to 1.\u00a0\n(BOOING)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah. Knock it off. To put that in perspective, North Korea has more diversity. The result is a student body going deeper into debt and only exposed the one kind of thinking, the kind that makes kids dumber, so they don't notice it's also making them broke. So let's try some college-level math. The number of college administrators has doubled in the last 25 years. The only thing growing faster is Jesse's hair.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: And it's his real hair, by the way. Meanwhile, student debt now tops $1.5 trillion. That's 37 grand per kid. Now what do you get for that? A stupidity farm kept afloat on the backs of students and their parents. And because they're not learning anything of practical value, it's true, students won't realize this, of course. $1.5 trillion, it's basically our own Venezuela, a third world socialist sinkhole existing within the United States, immune to market forces and common sense, and you and your kids are paying for this crap. If you're 23, you won't be able to afford a home and you can't get married until you're done paying for the promos new butt lift. It's not a bad thing. What a bargain. You're getting poorer and dumber all for the same price. How stupid can you get? Go to college and for a mere 37 grand, you'll find out.\u00a0\nPERINO: Hmmm.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah. So I think the.\u00a0\nPERINO: Maybe SMU is the exception?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, the message I'm trying to get to the college kids, Dana, is that it's a waste of time. Dropout right now. And everything will be great, right?\u00a0\nPERINO: How about don't listen to Greg yet, but be aware, and you should know -- the cost, right? Like what is the benefit, what is the value that you're getting? What are you paying for? And hold those administrators to.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: And to be fair, SMU is a great school. But a lot of these.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: So, Jesse, these kids are going to be paying for four years of nothing for the rest of their lives.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Yeah. If I'm a father and I'm paying 60 grand for my kid to get brainwashed, I'd just rather have them watch CNN for free.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nWATTERS: I'll yank them right out of there. And listen, remember when Ward Churchill, the crazy left-wing professor in Colorado, he said people on 9/11 deserved to die, and it took that university like ten years to boot him out because he had tenure. I was just at Cornell asking why is Cornell so liberally biased? And they kicked me out. So it's totally backwards. It's snowflake city. They need safe spaces to do anything anymore. If we ever fight a real war, who's going to fight it? Not these guys. Maybe these guys.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Juan, you've got to admit, 12 to 1 is groupthink, right?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: And I think what we need is affirmative action for academic underachievers on the right.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: There you go.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I tell you what, I so disagree with you because I think parents and students are paying for high-level education. They believe in education. They believe in the benefits of it. And if you go to the books, let's go to the numbers, guess what? College graduates make more.\u00a0\nPERINO: Over their lives.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah, yeah. But it's not worth it.\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, they're also going to have -- they're going to be late buying a home, late buying a second car, but they also will have all the debt that the baby boomers and Generation X are putting on them for.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Hey, Greg. Seriously, Gregory.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yeah.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Would you rather your kid go to college or not?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Not.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh my gosh.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Peter Thiel has a great idea, these $100,000 grants where you -- start a business in two years instead of going to college. I think that -- it's better to learn how to open a business. Lawrence?\u00a0\nJONES: So I have some numbers of myself. I cover this every day at campus reform. All right. So, SMU, love you guys. We pulled the FEC reports from SMU over 2017 to 2018, $85,000 went out, all right. $65,000 of that went to Democrat organizations.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You mean these are financial contributions?\u00a0\nJONES: Financial contributions. These are faculty, administrators, professors that are on the college campuses. So if they're giving towards the Democrats, all right, 100 percent of the donations, 65 percent of them are faculties, 13,000 of them was the administrator as well. If they're giving to Democrats, what do you think they're teaching the students?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think they better be teaching academics.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Well, Juan, when I was at Harvard University doing a little Watters' World package the other day, I asked these two girls what do you think about the fast and furious scandals? And you know what they said? The movie? They don't even know.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Not being exposed to right-wing conspiracies.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Someone died.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: . San Diego state.\u00a0\nJONES: That is about impeaching Donald Trump? Do we really want to be teaching our students?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You don't think it's important to teach people about our Democratic process?\u00a0\nJONES: To impeach Donald Trump?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I mean.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nJONES: It's not a headline. That's an actual course.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I'm saying that's a headline. That's the title of the course, Lawrence.\u00a0\nJONES: But why should our students be.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, are you a snowflake? Are you so worried?\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Yeah, and they do.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: They shouldn't be taking sides. It's an anti-Trump course.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: If you're saying it's an anti-Trump course, that's wrong.\u00a0\nJONES: It is. That's exactly.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I don't think so,\u00a0\nJONES: Impeach Donald Trump?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, impeach.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right, when we come back, we're going to be answering questions about the midterms from students here at SMU. Stay with us.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nPERINO: I sure love a marching band. I know my friend Maria is out there watching them, too, and she loves them, as well. Welcome back to \"The Five,\" live in Dallas.\u00a0\nCollege students could have a major impact on the midterm, so we're good to hear from some SMU students who have questions about the November election. I'm going to turn this way because they're here. Grace Reon, go ahead. Ask your question.\u00a0\nGRACE REON, SMU STUDENT: Hi. I'm a political science major and senior here at SMU; and my question is has O'Rourke appropriately adjusted his strategy and rhetoric for Texas audience? And does he need to?\u00a0\nPERINO: Does he need to? Greg, you want to take that one?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I heard that he actually got a rifle rack for his Prius. But you know they have that saying that he's all hat, no cattle? He's like no cattle, all manure.\u00a0\nPERINO: Does anyone want to answer her question?\u00a0\nWATTERS: I would say this. Didn't he come out for kneeling during the national anthem? So that's not going to play in Texas. So he needs to recalculate.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You know what I think is interesting on this? Is that he's run, really, a high-class campaign in terms of lack of name-calling, until the debate, which is when I would say he's picked up on your question.\u00a0\nPERINO: He may have gone negative too -- too late.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: He picked up on the line. But you know what? I just think it's good. It's good, because it's hope and high-class, as opposed to fear and anger.\u00a0\nPERINO: We've to keep going going, Lawrence, because we've got another one. We're going to have you go first next, Lawrence. Miles Beattie. Miles Beattie, go ahead.\u00a0\nMILES BEATTIE, SMU STUDENT: Hi, I'm Miles Beattie, who -- I'm a sophomore, a Democrat who is voluntarily giving content to this network. And --\u00a0\nPERINO: Well, we appreciate it. What's your question?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I know how you feel, Miles.\u00a0\nBEATTIE: I'm a little nervous, but --\u00a0\nWATTERS: Miles isn't getting paid, Juan.\u00a0\nBEATTIE: Yes, but my question -- my question is, do you believe the polls accurately represent the race, since many young people who are considered, quote, \"unlikely voters\" are fired up about O'Rourke?\u00a0\nPERINO: Good question. Lawrence, you know a lot about college campuses and the campaign.\u00a0\nJONES: Yes, and when I came back to Texas, there's a lot of Beto signs all over the place.\u00a0\nI think Ted Cruz kind of got comfortable at first. He was running for president ever since he got elected to the Senate. And so he was a little far removed. Once he came back and started telling the people what he was for, why they elected them, I think the energy went back to Ted Cruz.\u00a0\nI really don't think Beto ran a campaign for Texas. He ran a national campaign, as I said before. And so he really does focus on the issues. Cruz is going to focus on Texas. So, you know, I think the polls are wrong on this.\u00a0\nPERINO: And Miles we'll have to see turnout, because do signs and momentum turn into actual votes? We'll see. Everyone is going to be studying this race, because it will have impact in 2020, for sure.\u00a0\nAll right. Grayson, we're going to go to you next. This is Grayson Sumpter. Go ahead.\u00a0\nGRAYSON SUMPTER, SMU STUDENT: Thank you. I'm a political science and prelaw student and the vice president of College Democrats. This is in reference, also, to the previous question. So considering that, as we've seen in particular in the last few years, polls don't always perfectly represent how people are going to vote. What factors do you think that pollsters are looking out for in determining these things?\u00a0\nPERINO: Juan, you want to go first?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: One of the difficulties, is obviously, you've got to look at registered voters, and then you've got to look at likely people among registered voters. And that's the difficulty in a contest like the one here in Texas, where here we are on the campus of SMU. In most midterms, young people do not turn out. Minorities do not turn out to vote in high numbers.\u00a0\nThe question is, are they wrong this time because of the high level of engagement with these midterms. And one final factor, cell phones. I bet you don't have a landline. So if the pollsters are checking, do they miss you?\u00a0\nPERINO: And OK, we're going to go next to --\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Hey, try to make this a fun question, OK?\u00a0\nPERINO: -- John Bookas.\u00a0\nJOHN BOOKAS, SMU STUDENT: I can. All right. I'm from Fairfield, Connecticut. I'm a music and math major here, and I'm the president of College Republicans.\u00a0\nI was wondering, what types of stories seem to have the greatest and least effect on the -- on the public?\u00a0\nPERINO: A question for you, Greg.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Well, I think that, obviously, anything that has visual appeal will win. I mean, that is why I think the caravan thing has been so damaging. And any time that you actually -- when you see the overreach, like you did, Kavanaugh could have just came and went, but when they decided to go full -- when they went full Avenatti, or as I like to call him spaghetti Avenatti, because you serve him with a side of crow. The guy's life is over.\u00a0\nHe was supposed to have a rally today. Did you know that? He canceled it, because he couldn't afford the cab fare. Anyway, I don't have an answer.\u00a0\nPERINO: Jesse, about stories? Like, how do you make a story choice for what you want to do on \"The Five\" or \"Watters' World\"?\u00a0\nWATTERS: You've got to go visual. It's got to really blow you away emotionally and impact you like that. That's why the Russia story is a joke. No one can see it. You can't taste it. You can't hear it. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. It's just in the sky. So that's why that's not getting any play. I agree with Greg. The caravan is hot right now, because it burns your eyes.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Imagine that. The Russia story has just gone away.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's fake news.\u00a0\nPERINO: These are very important, but also, you've got to remember to pay attention to when people tell the pollsters what their No. 1 issue is: health care. It's been all the way across the board. Republicans have been late to figure out a way to defend themselves on that.\u00a0\nLet's go to the next one. We have Evie Mathis. Evie, get the microphone there. Go ahead.\u00a0\nEVIE MATHIS, SMU STUDENT: Hi, I'm from Boulder, Colorado, and I'm the vice president of College Republicans.\u00a0\nI was wondering why do news stories, even big ones, tend to die out after a couple of days?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Because Trump tweets something.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's actually kind of true. I think partly it's the 24/7 news culture. Lawrence.\u00a0\nJONES: The attention span of the viewers. I mean, there's always another news story. And sometimes that next news story outweighs the other one, and so the attention span of the viewer, they forget about it and move on to the next thing.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You know what it is? Do you ever play shuffleboard? That's what the news is now. So you go -- we put a little story out there and then somebody gets another story and bumps it out. So that's all news is now, is we keep bumping stories. Even we -- even stories that we have out there are bumped by another story.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I think it's just like a gusher these days. And so much is driven literally as Jesse says by the Trump Twitter feed. It just keeps coming.\u00a0\nPERINO: All right. We're got to keep going.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You have to realize that you, as a smart young woman, SMU student, need to pay attention to stories that are important that will make a difference.\u00a0\nPERINO: Indeed. All right. Emmakate Few. Not many, a few. Kate Few, go ahead, last question.\u00a0\nEMMAKATE FEW, SMU STUDENT: Thanks. I'm Emma Kate from Augusta, Georgia. I'm a journalism and political science student here at SMU. But I want to hear your take on if you think it's a good thing that athletes have a larger platform to speak about politics or if they should stick to sports.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Well, I'm not going to tell anybody bigger than I am what to do, because then they could just knock my head off. So they do what they want.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think you have to be straight with our FOX audience and tell them that you are an athlete. And you're a great runner.\u00a0\nBut you know what? I think it's just the celebrity world. And so if we have a celebrity president, why shouldn't celebrity athletes also have their say?\u00a0\nPERINO: Lawrence.\u00a0\nJONES: I'm just a free-speech purist. If you want to talk about politics, I don't care. It doesn't mean that I'm going to take their opinion, you know, into account, because they're professional athletes but I like athletes talking about sports.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I think everyone should shut up except for me.\u00a0\nPERINO: Emmakate, I bet you didn't expect that answer. Thanks, students. We appreciate it. We love that you are here.\u00a0\nAnd next, Lawrence hits the Texas State Fair to talk to voters about the midterms. He's got a big surprise for us next. Not sure what that is.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nJONES: I'm so excited to be back here in Dallas. It's my hometown. I lived here my entire life here up until this past year. And one of my favorite things to do growing up was to go to the State Fair of Texas, which is just a few minutes away.\u00a0\nEarlier today, I made my way down there, where I snatched up some surprises for you guys. And I also have the chance to speak with some Texans about the Texas big state Senate race. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Howdy, everybody. And welcome to Texas.\u00a0\nJONES: All right. I'm going to conquer my fear today. I'm going to do this. It's going to swing me all around the place, but I think I'm ready to do it.\u00a0\n(RIDING KIDDIE TRAIN): Whee!\u00a0\nYou've got Ted Cruz versus Beto O'Rourke. Who's your favorite candidate and why?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ted Cruz. Just for philosophical reasons.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely Beto, because he just brings new life into the system.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think everybody needs to get out and vote.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to go with Beto, largely because I think the ways in which he's been able to, like, create a grassroots campaign.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I'm a constitutional conservative, so I'm a Cruz fan.\u00a0\nJONES: What issue is most important to you?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The issue for me as an immigrant, of course, immigration is one.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: To me it's the deficit.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Party line. In all honesty, people say, they'll be, like, \"Well, I'm going to vote for this candidate because I'm Republican, or I identify as a Democrat.\" But it doesn't matter. Issues are issues.\u00a0\nMy favorite thing at the fare is funnel cake and lemonade.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: and turkey legs.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turkey legs.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The food, absolutely the food.\u00a0\nJONES (EATING SOME FOOD): Woo! So good. I love Texas.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nPERINO: Very nice.\u00a0\nJONES: God, I love my state. Right?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Great job, Lawrence. Great job.\u00a0\nJONES: I brought you guys some goodies. This is fried pizza, so try it.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Fried pizza? How can you fry a pizza?\u00a0\nJONES: Just eat it, Juan.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I don't know about this one.\u00a0\nJONES: Just eat it.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I'm going to pass this down to Greg.\u00a0\nPERINO: Can you eat that?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Oh, yes.\u00a0\nJONES: And this is fried PB&J, all right?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Peanut butter and jelly.\u00a0\nPERINO: Jesse, you want that.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That looks good.\u00a0\nPERINO: I want the chocolate one, please.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, no. She wants the cookie dough.\u00a0\nJONES: Oh, yes. The fried cookie dough.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I swear, I ran over something like this last night.\u00a0\nJONES: I don't know what it is, but --\u00a0\nPERINO: This is fried cookie dough?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: These are fried Oreo cookies.\u00a0\nJONES: Let me tell you what I love about Texas.\u00a0\nPERINO: I only smell it.\u00a0\nJONES: We season our food. We treat it with love. We love people. We're friendly, unlike D.C., where I was.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Ohh!\u00a0\nJONES: You know, this -- this trip was really good for me, because it reminded me of what I'm fighting for, which is the liberty that Texas has preserved. And I want -- I want the rest of the United States to experience this. Low taxes, no state tax. OK? So we want to keep more of our money.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's no state tax there?\u00a0\nJONES: There's no state tax.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I'm moving to Texas.\u00a0\nJONES: I told you. Right? And the people are just amazing here. Haven't you guys had a great time?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: We had a great time. But I'm seeing you out there with big hammer. What happened?\u00a0\nJONES: Well, things happened.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, I thought you won. I thought you won that big prize.\u00a0\nJONES: Yes, I did win a prize, but I didn't get quite what I wanted. So I ate a lot of food. So blame it on the food, OK?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I'm rooting for you, Lawrence.\u00a0\nWATTERS: On the kiddie ride, you looked a little scared.\u00a0\nJONES: I'm afraid of heights --\u00a0\nWATTERS: OK.\u00a0\nJONES: -- but I conquered my fear. Right?\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Just so you know, while you were doing that, Jesse was getting a facial.\u00a0\nWATTERS: It was a barbecue facial.\u00a0\nPERINO: Was it really a barbecue facial?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Infused.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Is that what you're calling it?\u00a0\nJONES: OK, the audience is waiting for us to eat this food.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I can't eat it!\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I have another question.\u00a0\nJONES: Yes, what's up?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Where did you get that hat? Is that a Texas hat?\u00a0\nJONES: It's a Texas hat. I had to dust it off before I got on the plane. And I brought my cowboy boots. And yes, it's amazing.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: And you look.\u00a0\nJONES: Thank you. Thank you.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You look great, Lawrence.\u00a0\nPERINO: What did you study? Did you want to go into journalism, or what was it?\u00a0\nJONES: I was a criminal justice major, and I wanted to go to law school. My sophomore year, I started doing TV, and I've been doing it ever since.\u00a0\nPERINO: And then how did you -- tell us about Campus Reform, then. How did you get connected?\u00a0\nJONES: So campus reform, I left my job here in Texas with the campus, and I really wanted to save the college campuses. We keep talking about all these issues that we're facing right now as a country. They start on the college campuses. Like the mob that you see right now, going over --\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: You went too far.\u00a0\nJONES: It started -- it started on the college campuses, where people just got away with everything.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Jobs not mobs, Juan. Jobs not mobs.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: How about critical thinking, smart people asking questions?\u00a0\nJONES: Yes, I'm sure you love it, because it --\u00a0\nWATTERS: You can't put that on a bumper sticker.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No, holding politicians to account. We can't hold that on a bumper sticker.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's too many words.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: To you, yes.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: No, but you're right.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nWATTERS: -- the war.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You know what it is? Campus is like a seeping sore, and everything out of it goes out into pop culture, and all of a sudden, it ends up at the worst place, in human resources. It's all toxic ideas, and it has to be stopped. That's why don't go to college.\u00a0\nJONES: But -- there's hope, though, because at Campus Reform, most of the reporters, all of them, actually, over 90 reporters, they're all college students. And they report on liberal bias and beefs every single day. So there's hope for us.\u00a0\nPERINO: That's pretty good. Well, thank you for bringing us this delicious food. I am not going to eat it. I'm just going to smell the calories. It smells really good.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: You just put on two pounds.\u00a0\nPERINO: I know. You can just, like, gain weight just smelling it.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes.\u00a0\nPERINO: But anyway, thank you, Lawrence.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: We've got to go.\u00a0\nJONES: \"One More Thing\" is up next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nWATTERS: Time now for a \"One More Thing.\" Dana Perino.\u00a0\nPERINO: All right. I just want to take a moment and thank our fantastic crew. Fox News always has the best people, and it's not the people here that you see on your screens; the people behind us. We have some pictures from before. All those guys there. Audio, lighting, stage manager. Look at these guys, all across the board.\u00a0\nLast night we went to the Heartache Pit barbecue. We had our team there: our producers, audio, everybody. We appreciate it.\u00a0\nIf you want to see a little bit more about what's going on in Texas politics, go to the Facebook page for \"The Daily Briefing.\" I did a Facebook live that you can watch, taped, with Gomer Jeffers Jr. He's a \"Dallas Morning News\" reporter. He knows everything about politics in Texas. Check it out.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. As Dana said, last night we were at the Heartache Barbecue. Greg had way too many ribs, too much sweet tea. We shot a whole package for you guys. That package is going to air tomorrow night on \"The Five,\" 5 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Texas time. So make sure to check that out. You actually probably want to see what's edited out of this package.\u00a0\nPERINO: Yes.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's where it got really crazy. But anyway, we had a lot of good food and a lot of fun.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'm still full.\u00a0\nWATTERS: So tune in. Yes, that's the whiskey pie right there. That's a must-get.\u00a0\nAll right. Greg.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: All right, now for some real photography. Let's roll.\u00a0\nPERINO: Gosh.\u00a0\nGRAPHIC: Greg's Airplane Pics!\u00a0\nGUTFELD: \"Greg's Airplane Pics!\" All right. When I fly, I tend to have a little drink on, a bottle or two of wine. And I know that when I'm on the plane, everything is really interesting to me. Like clouds. So let's just run some pictures of some clouds that I took. There's some clouds. You see that, that was during the takeoff.\u00a0\nPERINO: You've never seen clouds before.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: this was when we are coming a little bit up. I don't know where we were.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Cumulus.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: And then this is some more. Put -- the lower third is blocking the clouds. You crazy people. I have -- we have 30 of these.\u00a0\nPERINO: Beautiful clouds.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Wow.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: We have more clouds after that, and then we have yet more clouds, because I was drunk and I thought it was interesting. And now that I look at it, I'm deeply embarrassed.\u00a0\nWATTERS: So are we, Greg.\u00a0\nAll right. Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Much love, Gregory. We understand these things happen. Hey, a different look for \"The Five\" today. We got off the set and went into a classroom, a journalism classroom here at SMU.\u00a0\nThe students wanted to know about working at Fox, bias in the news business. They had a lot of questions about low levels of trust in American journalism and what they can do in the next generation to restore public confidence.\u00a0\nThe good news: the classroom was packed, folks. Tony Peterson, the chair of Journalism Department, and Pam Harris Hackett, who is in charge of broadcast journalism, told us enrollment for journalism right now: an all- time high at SMU. It was great to meet the students, and I told them, what they will do in delivering the truth, holding the powerful to account, is essential to the future of American democracy.\u00a0\nPERINO: They're coming for your job, Juan.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Good.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's right. No fake news here at SMU.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: No.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Terrence [SIC].\u00a0\nPERINO: Terrence? Lawrence!\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Lawrence.\u00a0\nJONES: Lawrence! OK.\u00a0\nWATTERS: I had too much wine with Gutfeld.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Yes, blame me.\u00a0\nJONES: One of my favorite things to do is eat sweets. My godmother has a bakery here in Dallas. Absolutely Edible Cake. And her favorite dish that everyone goes crazy about is the Sweet Potato Thang.\u00a0\nPERINO: Oh, she's cute!\u00a0\nJONES: Yes. She's been on the Food Network channel.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: What's the name of the bakery?\u00a0\nJONES: It's Absolutely Edible.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: Do you think having the word \"edible\" in it is necessary?\u00a0\nJONES: Yes.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: I mean, is there bakeries where it's inedible?\u00a0\nJONES: We don't judge. We don't judge.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'm smelling it.\u00a0\nJONES: Yes, but it's the Sweet Potato Thang. People fight each other over this over Thanksgiving.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: Oh, my goodness.\u00a0\nJONES: Even the last -- I want to see your reaction when you have one bite.\u00a0\nGUTFELD: It's pretty awesome.\u00a0\nJONES: I promise you won't regret it.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: This is awesome.\u00a0\nWATTERS: This is good.\u00a0\nPERINO: OK.\u00a0\nWATTERS: This is really good.\u00a0\nPERINO: I'm so full.\u00a0\nWATTERS: Just eat it, Dana. Come on.\u00a0\nJONES: Even if you don't live in Dallas, you can go to Absolutely Edible, and she will ship you one.\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: It is delish.\u00a0\nJONES: Right? Isn't it amazing?\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: I'm telling you.\u00a0\nWATTERS: All right. I like the mom plug in there. Got to respect that.\u00a0\nJONES: Mom plug?\u00a0\nWATTERS: Lawrence, right?\u00a0\nJONES: Yes.\u00a0\nWATTERS: That's it for us from Dallas. Special thank you, a very special thanks to everyone here at SMU. We'll see you tomorrow back home in New York City. \"Special Report\" is up next. Play it away, boys.\u00a0\n(MARCHING BAND MUSIC)\u00a0\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: From Texas here to sunny Florida.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "FARIBAULT, Minn. \u2013 One afternoon in 1993, as Carolyn Treadway looked out through her house window, she caught the sight of a woman in a traditional Islamic garment practicing parallel parking between mobile cones beside Faribault's Central Park. It was the first time Treadway, a retired teacher and Faribault School Board candidate, had come across a Muslim in Faribault, which was then about 90 percent white. \"I remember distinctly thinking, 'That person looks different than what I'd normally seen,\" she said. --- The nonprofit news outlet MinnPost provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News. --- Days later, Treadway learned about an expedition of Somali-American leaders from the Twin Cities who had come to Faribault to explore job opportunities for newly arrived refugees, people with limited English language skills and employment experience. Soon after, the leaders found out about the town's meat processing plant, operated by Jennie-O, and news about job opportunities in the area spread. Hundreds of Somali refugees eventually flocked to Faribault for jobs the company had been struggling to fill after it had eliminated union positions and lowered employee wages. The change opened up doors for new refugees, many of whom have made Faribault their home over the last three decades: working, raising their families and establishing small businesses in the city. The influx of Somali immigrants has allowed the city of 24,000 \u2014 located 50 miles south of the Twin Cities, in Rice County \u2014 to avoid the fate of so many other towns in Minnesota and throughout the Midwest, places that have seen their populations stagnate or decline. Yet the demographic change initiated by that shift didn't come without consequence, and it is only now, some residents say \u2014 after years of grappling with cultural and racial issues, and overwhelmed schools and social service programs \u2014 that those tensions are starting to fade away, as more and more native-born residents come to terms with the fact that Somali refugees are putting down permanent roots in Faribault. When Treadway first moved from Kansas to Faribault more than four decades ago, Faribault was an almost entirely homogeneous white community, not much different from many towns across Minnesota. That started to change in the 1980s, when a small wave of Cambodian refugees first made their way to Faribault to work at the Jennie-O processing plant. In the following two decades, a steady stream of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees arrived in Faribault seeking jobs at the plant. The arrival of Somalis, in particular, significantly altered the city's demographics. In 2000, whites made up 90 percent of Faribault's population. Today, people of color make up more than 26 percent of the population, with African Americans alone accounting for 9 percent of the city's residents. The change was even more dramatic in area schools. Today, students of color account for 53 percent of the student population at Faribault Public Schools, as detailed in a 2018 report by the Minnesota Department of Education. The pace of the Somali refugee arrivals in Faribault was gradual in the 1990s and early 2000s. But it grew exponentially during the Great Recession, when jobs became hard to come by in the Twin Cities metro area. The growth was also fueled by people from other parts of the country moving to Faribault to join family or friends. It wasn't always a smooth process. The public school system and local governments, in particular, were not prepared to support and help newcomers integrate into the community. \"For at least 12 to 15 years,\" Treadway said, \"all those entities were playing catch-up rather than being proactive on how the community can absorb and support these people who are coming from a very different environment.\" It didn't help that cultural conflicts often surfaced. Groups of Somali men would often socialize standing on the sidewalks of downtown Faribault, for example, and would often casually sit or lean on parked cars. Or they'd be inconsiderate to passing pedestrians. Likewise, new refugees wouldn't wait in line on busy days at grocery stores, gas stations or banks. Instead, they'd often cut in line to get what they needed. None of those habits are particularly frowned upon in Somalia. But in Faribault, the practices frustrated residents, who saw Somali refugees as aggressive, rude and disrespectful toward others. \"They didn't have anyone to help them understand that in America,\" Treadway said, \"judgment is made if you cut in line or throw plastic bottles down on the ground when you drink out of them.\" That sentiment was echoed in the \"Beyond the Gateway: Immigrants in a Changing America,\" a book that in part chronicled the experiences and tensions of immigrants and native-born Americans in cities and town in the U.S., including Faribault. White residents vented to the book's researchers, a team from Georgetown University, about their frustration toward black and Latino immigrants who work in downtown Faribault, which had become a social hub for foreign-born residents in the area. Many white people no longer felt comfortable going to downtown anymore, one person told the researchers. \"I think they're afraid of them,\" the person said. \"They don't really know them.\" Over time, an estimated 4,000 Somali residents have put down roots in Faribault. Some of those families have now lived in the town for more than two decades, and have U.S.-born children who are now in their teenage years. Between 2004 and 2018, in fact, the community established more than a dozen small businesses \u2014 grocery stores, restaurants, cafes and money transfer shops \u2014 along with two main nonprofit organizations. One of those is Somali American Faribault Education, which provides refugees with ESL programs and connects them to jobs; another is the Somali Community Resettlement Services, which connects refugees to employment, housing and county services. \"Faribault has become our city,\" said Hassan Mursal, a businessman who's lived in the town since 2002. \"Our children are succeeding. The community is thriving. We play a role in the security and safety in our neighborhoods.\" The growing acceptance of the Somali community is partly the result of longevity. Mursal said the Somali community's business success and cultural staying power has earned the respect of some white residents who used to look at them with scornful eyes when they first resettled in Faribault. \"They realized we're normal people with a different culture,\" he said. Frank Marzario, for one. The owner of Pawn Minnesota in downtown Faribault, Marzario said his grandparents came to the United States from Italy, and that the story of the town's East African immigrants reminds him of his own family's experience. \"I support their ambition and their determination to make a better life for themselves,\" he added. \"I have a good relationship with my neighbors and the Somali community.\" But the improved relations are also the result of some concrete efforts undertaken by the city. As part of an effort to bring diverse communities closer, the Faribault Diversity Coalition has been working in recent years to promote tolerance in the area through cultural events and social programming. \"Our role is to create better understanding and appreciation for cultures,\" said FDC Director Gordon Liu. \"We view diversity as an asset. So we showcase how different cultures bring vibrancy to the community. \"There are times when each community feels their voices have not been heard,\" Liu added. \"So what we're trying to do is make sure we take the time to listen and try to figure out what different communities are struggling with and how we can help bridge that gap.\"",

            "article_content": "Political participation among Vietnamese Americans in Orange County, California is on the rise. (hayward-ca.gov) A wave of Vietnamese Americans \u2013 more than half of whom share the same last name \u2013 are running for public office in Orange County, California, The Los Angeles Times reported. Among the 24 candidates who are running for different offices, 13 share the same last name: Nguyen. Little Saigon, an enclave in Orange County that comprises Garden Grove, Westminster, and Fountain Valley, is home to one of the largest concentrations of Vietnamese outside\u00a0of Vietnam. Karthick Ramakrishnan, a UC Riverside professor quoted by The Times, credited the rise in the Vietnamese\u2019 political participation to their increasing \u201cinfluence in central O.C. policies.\u201d She said the wave of Vietnamese Americans has its origins in the years immediately following the Vietnam War, during which thousands of Vietnamese refugees resettled in California. The name \u201cNguyen\u201d is the most common Vietnamese surname. Its origins lie in a dynasty that ruled Vietnam until Communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh took control of the North in 1945. Today, as many as 40 percent of Vietnamese people answer to \u201cNguyen,\u201d according to some estimates. Vietnamese Americans, as a voting bloc, have been historically Republican, largely due to their former country\u2019s embrace of communism. But younger generations of Vietnamese Americans, said Ramakrishnan, are becoming more liberal.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley says the Democrat should 'quit hiding' and stand up to her party on the Supreme Court nominee. Judge Brett Kavanaugh goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday for confirmation hearings with what supporters call the longest paper trail \u2013 practically a superhighway \u2013 of any federal judicial nominee, a testament to his enviable insider status in public and private corridors of Washington power. That impressive resume has created both political opportunity and peril, as Senate Democrats have demanded a go-slow approach so that Kavanaugh's records as a federal judge, White House staffer and lawyer for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr can be thoroughly scoured. \"We don't know if there's some sort of revelatory bombshell,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said. But Republicans are confident the 53-year-old judge will be on the bench when the Supreme Court begins its new term Oct. 1. \"Watching this confirmation unfold is like watching the tortured last moments of a blowout basketball game,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. \"Democrats are down thirty with ten seconds left, but they keep fouling to stop the shot clock in an attempt to avoid their inevitable defeat.\" \"Democrats are down thirty with ten seconds left, but they keep fouling to stop the shot clock in an attempt to avoid their inevitable defeat.\" An extensive Fox News analysis of Kavanaugh's record on and off the bench \u2014 more than a million pages of speeches, memos, and rulings \u2014 reveals a solid, predictable conservative record. The National Archives, working with the George W. Bush Presidential Library, began releasing tens of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh's past record every few days this month. But officials admit they will not be able to produce all the documentation until late October, weeks after the nominee's Senate hearings, floor vote and potential swearing-in as the 114th justice. Some Senate progressives had initially declared a boycott -- refusing to meet personally with the nominee before the hearings -- as a protest over access to his papers. But that solidarity collapsed, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer has shifted strategy, warning, \"We stand ready to sue the National Archives for Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s full records if necessary.\" Republicans say the judge's views are being distorted and his record has earned bipartisan praise. But it is a long, dense record, including: \"There has been quite an extensive record,\" said Jennifer Mascott, Kavanaugh's first law clerk hire and now a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. \"But if someone is really looking for what will give us the best sense of how Judge Kavanaugh will rule were he to be confirmed, it would be looking at his opinions.\u201d The Gatekeeper Despite clerking for his mentor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh sees his five years as a White House aide to President George W. Bush from 2001-2006, as the ideal training ground for his judicial job. Much of that time he was staff secretary, the person who manages the daily paper and policy flow to the president, including documents circulated among senior staff for comment. It is a crucial, if largely thankless, job. \"It was important that I maintain strict neutrality and impartiality in that role, so that the president and his policy staff would have confidence that their concern would be presented to the president fairly,\" he has said, adding that the experience \"helped make me a better student of the administrative process, a better interpreter of statutes.\" He was in that role for a range of major events and debates, from Hurricane Katrina to moves to expand Medicare. Most controversial, at least for Kavanaugh's future endeavors, was the internal debate over the administration\u2019s initial endorsement of \"enhanced interrogation\" of suspected terrorists held overseas. \"I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants,\" he testified at his 2006 confirmation hearing for his current seat on the D.C.-based U.S. Court of Appeals. But newly released emails from his White House service include a Nov. 19, 2001 memo, cryptically suggesting he would be \"happy to help\" prepare then-Attorney General John Ashcroft explain post-9/11 policy allowing secret surveillance of contacts between some terrorist suspects and their defense lawyers, without any court order. Democrats will want to know the extent of Kavanaugh's involvement in, or understanding of, the administration's evolving anti-terror policies. But his backers note this particular email came before the detention policies at Guantanamo were imposed. The Investigator Before his job as staff secretary, Kavanaugh was associate counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel during the Clinton probe, and Starr told Fox News his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 served as a trusted adviser. At the time, the investigation had advanced far beyond its initial look at Arkansas real estate deals. But Kavanaugh recognized that the president, in his view, had broken the law by committing perjury. An August 1998 email titled \"Slack for the President?\" was written just two days before Clinton would give grand jury testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. \"The president has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles,\" he wrote, accusing the White House of \"a sustained propaganda campaign that would make [former president] Nixon blush.\" The then 33-year-old lawyer said while he respected the office of the president and tried to be fair, he could offer no defense for Clinton\u2019s public and private behavior, and now \"the Congress can decide whether the interests of the Presidency would be best served by having a new President.\" Less than a\u00a0month after that memo, the \"Starr report\" would form the investigative basis of the GOP-controlled House of Representatives' impeachment of the president, a national drama that ended with the Senate's acquittal. The episode is likely to be revisited at the confirmation hearings, but the nominee has long defended his then-boss, and the investigation itself. But a 2008 lecture, which he wrote while a judge, suggested -- as a policy, not legal matter -- sitting presidents should be immune from congressional investigations and prosecution while in office and \"should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office.\"\u00a0He added, \"A President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\" Some Hillary Clinton supporters have privately lamented the irony: a lawyer who helped aggressively investigate her husband two decades ago is now poised to sit on the Supreme Court, a nomination she would have made if the 2016 election had turned out differently. Getting Ready In an isolated area of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House complex, Kavanaugh has spent the past few days being put through the rhetorical ringer. For hours on end, he sits alone at a table, peppered with questions about his personal and professional record, all in an effort to see if he will crack under the pressure. The informal, but intrusive prep sessions are known as \"murder boards,\"\u00a0for their intensity, designed to simulate what the 53-year-old nominee to the Supreme Court will face this week in his Senate confirmation hearings. Democrats hope any public mistakes can pay political dividends in coming weeks. \"If you\u2019re in the Democrats' position, you have no ammunition except obstruction,\" said Edward Whelan, president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Maybe they hope they win control of the Senate in November, and are able to keep things from happening until January. From their perspective, obstruction is all upside.\" \"If you\u2019re in the Democrats' position, you have no ammunition except obstruction. Maybe they hope they win control of the Senate in November, and are able to keep things from happening until January. From their perspective, obstruction is all upside.\" Sources say the mock questions have focused equally on his work in the judicial and executive branches. The stakes are enormous, not only for the nominee but also for the man who selected him from an evolving list of 25 possibles first announced during the presidential campaign. Aides say President Trump hopes a successful confirmation will build momentum for his separate midterm political agenda, and bring a measure of stability and public confidence to what has been a challenging 20 months in office. In the broader realm, filling the seat left by the retirement of Kennedy would solidify the high court's current, shaky right-leaning majority. Having that fifth reliable conservative vote would help guide the administration as it makes strategic decisions about which high-profile issues to pursue in court -- like immigration, the environment, transgender rights and expanded executive authority. \"It's important Democrats and Republicans not roll over on this pick,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center. \"The American people want their justices to be an independent check even to the president nominating you, to follow the Constitution, not their own political values.\" But liberal advocacy groups have all but abandoned efforts to defeat Kavanaugh through public opinion, with scant paid issue advertising. Many progressives lament Democratic senators have been distracted by other ideological fights as the midterm election approaches, with most of the rhetorical fire aimed at Trump himself. But the hearings could still be dramatic. Senate sources say Democrats will focus much of their attention on seeking Kavanaugh's views on presidential power, with the possibility he could decide any challenges to the ongoing special counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"Look, it is not a done deal,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., vowing to continue opposing Kavanaugh. \"Donald Trump has made his nomination. And he picks somebody off a list that has been prescreened, prescreened by not one but two right-wing extremist groups.\" Along with his courtesy visits to 65 senators of the Senate who will decide his fate, Kavanaugh has prepared for the spotlight by reviewing his own record, and enduring those closely guarded mock hearings. The private rehearsals are coordinated by the White House Counsel's Office and include more than a dozen participants -- government lawyers, conservative academics, some of his former law clerks, even four senators. The goal is to anticipate every possible line of questioning and danger zone -- to give measured answers but not reveal too much. Sources say Kavanaugh has settled in being himself, avoiding unscripted responses that might provide the televised \"soundbite\" to derail what has so far been a flawless confirmation journey. Administration officials are privately confident he will shine in the hearings. Supporters point to his smooth handling in the face of withering Democratic opposition when he was nominated for his current seat on the Washington-based federal appeals court.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Andy Kim, running for New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, is facing criticism for his comments about working under a Republican administration. (Facebook) A Democrat running in a tight New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District race has reportedly exaggerated his resume, claiming he worked under a Republican president as a national security officer while he worked at an entry-level position. Andy Kim, a counterterrorism expert and former Obama national security adviser, is running in a district that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and for former Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. He is facing off against incumbent Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur, with many polls indicating the race is a toss-up. The Democrat portrayed himself as middle-of-the-road candidate that can come across the aisle for the greater good of the country. As a proof of bipartisanship, he boasted about his record of working for both Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cWhat is service? \u2026 It\u2019s a kid from Marlton who became a national security officer for Republican and Democratic presidents and worked in Afghanistan under Generals Petraeus and Allen,\u201d said his campaign ad. On his campaign website, Kim also claims that he \u201cworked under both Democratic and Republican Administrations and I have and always will put the nation and the American people above partisan politics.\u201d But according to the Washington Post\u2019s fact checkers, only one part of the ad is accurate \u2013 he did work for then-President Obama and had a senior role within the administration. Kim, however, has never technically worked for a Republican president. The Democrat\u2019s LinkedIn page claims he worked at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for \u201cless than a year\u201d back in 2005 as a conflict management specialist. The position is an entry-level job where Kim lasted for five months before leaving the job to pursue doctoral research at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. It was also his first full-time job after graduating the University of Chicago in 2004 and spending four months as an intern at the USAID, the Post revealed. According to the campaign, Kim was paid at a GS-9 level at the agency \u2013$37,390 per year \u2013 which would be the equivalent of a second lieutenant in the Army, the entry-level position for commissioned officers. Some former colleagues of Kim went his defense amid the Post\u2019s revelations, insisting that the candidate\u2019s work at USAID was tied to U.S. national security. Zack Carroll, Kim\u2019s campaign manager, insisted that the ad claiming Kim worked for a Republican president is still accurate, despite that his job was entry-level and just for five months. \u201cWhile working at USAID under the Bush administration, Andy served in the Africa bureau working on U.S. response to conflict-related crises across Africa, including national security concerns related to terrorism in Somalia and genocide and child soldiers concerns in Sudan/Uganda. Andy worked closely with officials from the Pentagon, State Department, and other national security departments to develop comprehensive foreign policy responses to these and other crises,\u201d he added. Fox News reached out to his campaign early Tuesday but did not immediately hear back. Chris Russell, a strategist for the MacArthur campaign, slammed Kim for exaggerating the his biography and urged take down the ad. \u201cAndy Kim grossly embellished his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at USAID in a deliberate attempt to mislead voters about his background,\u201d Russell said.",

            "article_content": "In a wide-ranging interview with Laura Ingraham, President Donald Trump addresses his response to the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, the contrast between globalists and nationalists and his relationship with the news media. This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" October 29, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a very big night from Washington. Earlier today, I went one on one with President Trump. We talk about the deadly shooting in Pittsburgh, the spate of pipe bombs sent around the country last week, and the push by some to connect his words with those heinous acts. We also discussed his new plans for the border, the midterm and reports his legal team will provide written answers for Bob Mueller's investigation, but first, using tragedy to silence the president. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. With midterm polls tightening in key races in favor of Republican candidates across the country and that blue wave beginning to slip away, liberals are attempting to neutralize the GOP's most effective campaigner. Of course I'm talking about President Trump. In the last few months, he's delivered results for the American people on the economy and trade, just to name a few. And of course he stood strong on law and order, Justice Kavanaugh and border enforcement. But in the wake of the tragic slayings at a Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend, some on the left have labored to blunt the Trump momentum by trying to link the president to this lunatic anti-Semite shooter. MSNBC'S in \"Morning Joe\" even thought to connect the president's views on the migrant mob to the mass shooting. Now, see if you can follow this line of reasoning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: The last caravan that they whipped up frenzy about actually only brought 14 arrests by the end of the caravan. They know it's a lie. And they are spreading hatred across America and at the end of the day, Mika, again inspiring people like this Pittsburgh mass murderer. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK. Now, if you can't follow that thinking, the idea at least is transparent, tag conservatives with a gruesome tragedy and then push for the conscription the restriction of speech that liberals find abhorrent. Now, we saw the shameless politicization in the wake of the Mandalay Bay and the Parkland shootings as well. Each time conservatives were singled out and condemned as somehow being guilty or complicit when nothing could be further from the truth. Now, remember when that negligent Broward County Sheriff Israel tried to blame the NRA for the Stoneham Douglas shooting? (BGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESWOMAN: This monster, carrying bullets to school, carrying knives to school, assaulting students, assaulting his parents, 39 visits in the past year. That should never have been allowed to get that far. SCOTT ISRAEL, SHERIFF, BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA: And I understand you are standing up for the NRA. You just told this group of people that you are standing up for them. You are not standing up for them until you say I want less weapons. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, the idea then and now is to declare conservative toxic and tie them to a property in hopes of just shutting them up or scaring them so they won't speak out. Effective conservative political speech has to be stifled at all costs, particularly Trump's. This is former President Barack Obama trying to accomplish just that over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: There's nothing compassionate about ripping immigrant children from the arms of their mothers at the border and putting them in pens. I think it's wrong to spend all of your time from a position of power vilifying people, questioning their patriotism, calling them enemies of the people and then suddenly pretending that you're concerned about civility. Come on! (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: No, you come on. You were the president who expanded the family detention and separations out of concern that children were being trafficked in human trafficking. Now, Trump does the same thing, he's depicted as some kind of monster? Give me a break. And MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell tried to go even further attempting to blame not only the president, but his supporters for the horrific shooting in Pittsburgh. That was until a congregant at the Tree of Life synagogue shut her down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC HOST: It is not just our political leaders because we see thousands of people at rallies starting in 2016 and straight through to this weekend who are cheering hateful speech. LOU WEISS, CONGREGANT, TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE: I really can't think of anything less helpful than to be politicizing this. I mean, this man hated Jews. He actually hated Trump as it happens. Some people are trying to discourage Donald Trump from coming to Pittsburgh. He should come. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now the president is going to Pittsburgh tomorrow with the first lady to pay his respects to the families at the Tree of Life synagogue and to comfort the grieving, which is only the right thing to do. The very idea that the president would condone or countenance a rabid anti- Semite killing innocent people in prayer is absurd and its offensive. He has a Jewish daughter, a Jewish son-in-law and Jewish grandchildren. He has been one of the most vociferous and strong supporters of Israel that we've ever had. He relocated the American embassy to Jerusalem in the face of incredible resistance despite the fact that all these other presidents promised to do so. And the president told me today at the White House he is undaunted by the liberal attacks and their outrageous implications. Now, the left can go right ahead, go right on with their pathetic attempts to demonize this president in the last days of this midterm campaign, but it will not work. But it does reveal their desperation. His warning of an approaching horde of noncitizens, one organized by outside political forces, is not messaging hate. It is standing up for America's sovereignty. It's what presidents should do to protect the nation and to preserve the integrity of our own laws. And the Democrats know that is also a winning political message, which is why they're stooping to use tragedy to smear the best campaign closer the GOP has ever seen. Good luck, my friends. It will not work. And that's The Angle. And now my interview with President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Mr. President, thank you so much for being here today. We really appreciate it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you Laura. INGRAHAM: I know you're heading to Pittsburgh tomorrow and Rabbi Jeffrey Meyers from the Tree of Life synagogue said last night the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY MEYERS, RABBI, TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE: I want to address for a moment some of our political leaders who are here. Ladies and gentlemen, it has to start with you as our leaders. My words are not intended as political fodder. Stop the words of hate. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: So given his words, what do you think your role tomorrow will be and should be? TRUMP: Well, I'm just going to pay my respects. I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt and I really look forward to going. I would have done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already have disruption but I look forward to going to Pittsburgh tomorrow. INGRAHAM: You said over the weekend you might even tone up the rhetoric. The media today seized on it at Sarah Huckabee Sanders' press briefing. If they are pointing fingers at you saying, look, you could do more, you're the leader of the free world. What do you say to that? TRUMP: Well you know, I did a rally and I said, in fact, I was thinking about canceling it. I also did the Young Farmers and it was great doing that and then I had a rally afterwards and I said you know, you make them too important if you start canceling. I remember Dick Ross (ph) wanted to get the Stock Exchange open as soon as possible, did a great job and other things. Once you start doing that, once you cancel -- so you are doing a rally and rallies are meant to be fun. Rallies are meant to be everything and I said tone it down and then you saw the group saying, no, don't tone it down, don't tone it down. So, we had a great rally in Illinois for some great people and frankly, I think that's probably the way it should be. You should go about your life. You can't let these people disrupt any more than they already have, which is disgraceful. What he did is disgraceful. You can't let it happen. As far as with the rabbi said, I agree with him. INGRAHAM: The word nationalism has taken on, for the left, this connotation, of fueling anti-Semitism, hate, even violence. Do you think that is fair and do you want to further clarify what nationalism means to you? TRUMP: No. To me I don't have to clarify. It means I love the country. It means I'm fighting for the country. I look at two things, globalists and nationalists. I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many, many years, you know this better than anybody, our leaders have been more worried about the world than they have about the United States. And then leave us in a mess, whether it's the wars, whether it's the economy, whether it's debt, whether it's all of the things that they've done, including putting in the wrong Supreme Court justices, and we've already put two great ones in. Now, I'm proud of this country and I call that nationalism. I call it being a nationalist and I don't see any other connotation than that. Now, as soon as you make any statement nowadays with the political correctness world, they make a big deal. I'm not a globalists but I want to take care of the globe, but first I have to take care of our country. I want to help people around the world but we have to take care of our country or we won't have a country, including we have to take care of our country at the border. INGRAHAM: When you hear people use the phrase anti-Semitism to describe anything connected to you, you have a Jewish daughter, you have grandchildren who are Jewish, what's your reaction to that? TRUMP: And it just received an award from the state of Israel from Bibi Netanyahu thanking me because I moved the, as you know, the embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel and I just did that. Now, how many presidents said they were going to do it and they never did it? Many, many presidents. I won't go over the names but I can tell you every one of them. I can tell you what every one of them said. I just opened up and we opened it up. We didn't just name (ph) it, you know, it is going to take years and years to build and it was going to cost over a billion dollars. I opened up a beautiful building for $400,000, already open, well over a billion dollars and it's opened after four months. INGRAHAM: And you were criticized for that too. You were criticized at the time I believe for being too pro-Palestinian, and now you're criticized on the other side. TRUMP: And in fact, this horrible human being, this terrible person tht did the shooting, he was not a Donald Trump fan because he said I was too close to Israel. So, that seemed to be his reasoning. So, I will tell you, I'm going to show you right after, I'm going to show the most beautiful plaque. It just came. They must have known you were going to be doing this interview, but it was sent by Bibi Netanyahu thanking me for opening the embassy in Jerusalem, which as you know is like the biggest deal. INGRAHAM: The phrase enemy of the people, another phrase that's been seized upon by many in the media, many in CNN, but not just CNN. There was a woman who was just on CNN a short while ago saying that you have radicalized more people than ISIS. That was CNN today. TRUMP: Well, that must be some kind of a sick woman. When I say the enemy of the people, I'm talking about the fake news, and you know it better than anybody. You have news out there they are so fake and I can do the greatest thing ever, North Korea as an example. We would have been going to war. Normally, we would have been going to war with North Korea. I think President Obama would have gone to war. If he had had an extra year he would be in right now a war with North Korea. He told me it was by far -- and I'm not knocking him for this -- he said it is by far his biggest problem. Look at what we've done and yet when they talk about North Korea they say what's taken so long? INGRAHAM: But you know they're going to be biased. TRUMP: This has been -- wait a minute -- this has been going in 70 somewhat years and they say -- I left Singapore where we had our meeting, where we really had a very good meeting and a good relationship, like what four months ago. They say the new line is what's taking so long? I say -- INGRAHAM: Well, how does it help expand your base to call them the enemy of the people? How does it help America heal in times like this? TRUMP: Because, I'll tell you why, it's a very good question. Before we finished, so we've done a great job with North Korea. Then they said we can't get them on anything because the sanctions are wrong, we got everything, there's no missiles, we got our hostages back. We have the remains coming back -- everything. So now they said he met -- the new line is, I met. INGRAHAM: Of course. TRUMP: \u00a0But listen to this. INGRAHAM: But why are you expecting they are going to be fair to you? They're never going to be fair to you. TRUMP: But they were thinking I met, OK. That's the new line. I shouldn't have met, so, you know. And if you go back to before I got here and look like we were going to war, above war with North Korea. So -- INGRAHAM: I was here with Reagan. I refer Reagan, they called him stupid, dumb, slept on the afternoon, incompetent, a warmonger and he always kind o -- he was like -- he had Stealey (ph), but he was -- TRUMP: But he didn't have social media. He would have fought back. He didn't have social media. When they -- it's my form of telling the truth. Here's the problem, we have a lot of supporters. You know that better than anybody. All you have to do is look at your ratings, OK. But you know it better than anybody, their supporters know that they're lying. I watched \"Meet The Press\" this weekend. Everything was so falsely put, putting words in people's mouths -- INGRAHAM: Are they trying to hobble you in the midterms because you're the best closer for this party. That's what the Republicans are saying. TRUMP: Well, 100 percent. They are going at it and I'm getting 25 and 30,000 people to these rallies. Nobody's ever seen it. There has never been anything -- this isn't bragging. There has never been anything like what's happening. I went to Illinois. You're going to see, a Boeing 747, this massive hanger packed and they had to use a second hanger for the overflow. Nobody has seen anything -- INGRAHAM: Yes. TRUMP: And always, look what happened for Ted Cruz. He's doing great now. We left Houston, he's now doing great. They don't even talk about that race and his opponent is not very good. INGRAHAM: The bomber who sent the letters to CNN and Democrats was a fan of yours. He obviously also seems insane, completely insane. So, what do you say about that? You put bomb in quote, they went crazy over that too over the weekend because you used the word bomb in quotes. Would you like to kind of -- TRUMP: No, look. He was insane a long time before -- you look at his medical records, he was insane for a long time. Bernie Sanders had a fan who shot a very good friend of ours, Steve Scalise, and other people. He was a total maniac. Nobody puts his name in the headline, Bernie Sanders, in the headline wit the maniac -- INGRAHAM: In fact, Nancy Pelosi said do not politicize this back at the time. TRUMP: I was in the headline of \"The Washington Post,\" my name associated with this crazy bomber. Trump bomber or something, but I was in the headline when they got him. They didn't say bomber found, they talked about Trump in the headline. Now, they didn't do that with Bernie Sanders when he had -- they didn't do that with the Democrats when other people came out. They didn't do that with President Obama with the church, the horrible situation with the church. They didn't do that. They put my name in the headlines. When I say enemy of the people, I'm talking about the fake news, and it is fake. And the thing is, my people understand. One quick (inaudible), so, a reporter for \"The Washington Post\" does a story that -- a place that I was doing, an arena was empty and he shows a picture, not a very good crowd Mr. Trump, something to that effect. And then it turned out that he took the picture five hours before the people started coming into the arena. The arena was packed and there were thousands of people outside. They had to retract it. But this is the kind of dishonesty that we have. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Part two of my interview with the president is next. His reaction to former President Obama hitting him on the midterm trail and so much more. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now for more of my interview with President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: Going into some individual races, Florida obviously so important to 2020, but important period. Andrew Gillum against Ron DeSantis. Ron DeSantis congressman, strong supporter of yours. Over the weekend you called Andrew Gillum, you referenced him being a thief, what did you mean by that? TRUMP: Well 100 percent. Well, the FBI offered him tickets, said $1,800 a piece and he took them. He took a trip with the same FBI agent I guess he was posing as a developer or something. The man stone cold took the stuff. I don't even think he should be allowed to continue on wit this. INGRAHAM: He responded today by calling you weak. You are howling because you're weak. That's what he said in a tweet. TRUMP: I haven't heard that one lately. That's OK. Good, that's a change of pace. Look, here's a guy that in my opinion is a stone cold thief and his city, Tallahassee, is known as the most corrupt in Florida and one of the most corrupt in the nation. He's a disaster and how he's even close to being tied is hard to believe. But Florida can't have -- if Florida has a governor like that, and I know Florida better than I know practically anywhere. Florida will become Venezuela. It will be a disaster and you have Ron DeSantis, who is a Harvard Yale guy. He's had a really terrific, you know, he's very good person. He's going to be a very good to a great governor. This other guy is a stone cold, in my opinion, he's a thief. How can you have a guy like this? And you just look at his record. Also, look at the job he's done as the mayor of Tallahassee. He's a total disaster. INGRAHAM: John James of course, running for senate. TRUMP: Star. INGRAHAM: Beto O'Rourke is down in the polls since you came in Texas but John James is only eight or nine points off his senate bid. He's like Army combat veteran. Why do you think he's not getting the play? TRUMP: He is doing so well that I'm trying to get to Michigan. That's how well John James. John James is a star. African-American, great guy, and you know John James -- he was one of four or five people running and I'm watching television and I see John James and I said who is that guy? He is running in Michigan. Let me see him again and I said that guy is great, he's a star. Now, she -- I don't know, she is just a clone for -- all she is an automatic vote -- Debbie Stabenow. She has been a disaster for Michigan. She is an automatic vote for Schumer. John James is a young star and I said I'm going to back him and I backed him. (Inaudible) I backed him and he's taken off. He ends up winning with, you know, not a lot of money, ends up winning the primary and he's doing really well. He's down seven which sounds like a lot but it's nothing because normally they are down 25 or 30. INGRAHAM: Obama is kind of following you on the campaign trail. He was in Wisconsin -- TRUMP: How is his grass(ph)? INGRAHAM: Yes, at Wisconsin. He's going to Florida this week and he brought up the issue of the caravan and he said the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: They're trying to convince everybody to be afraid of a bunch of impoverished, malnourished refugees a thousand miles away. That's the thing, the most important thing in this election. Not health care, not whether or not folks are able to retire. Suddenly it's this group of folks we don't even know where they are. They're way down there. Don't fall for that kind of fearmongering. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: We are scaremongering people on the border. TRUMP: Yes. Well, he's trying to do the opposite. It's the problem with our country and you look at that caravan and you look largely, very, you know, big percentage of men, young, strong. A lot of bad people, a lot of bad people in there. People that are in gangs. We don't want them in this country. If they want to come into the country you have to apply like other people. We have millions of people coming in. They apply. They're coming in legally. We have a very strong border. I called up the military. This caravan is not -- they're wasting their time. They are not coming over the country. INGRAHAM: What is the military going to be able to do? Obama and Bush both sent the National Guard and it had no effect. TRUMP: But they're not me. They're not me. I'm sending up the military. This is the military and their standing there and one thing that will happen -- INGRAHAM: No lethal force. TRUMP: -- when they are captured, we don't let them out. What has been happening and we are not as of pretty recently, we are not letting them out. What happens is they would catch and release. We are catching, we are not releasing, so if they want to come over -- we're not even doing that. We're not letting them into this country. We're not going to let gang members -- INGRAHAM: But what if they're applying for asylum? Isn't the law because Congress is changing (ph) the law? TRUMP: If they are apply for asylum, we are going to hold them until such time is their trial to -- INGRAHAM: Where? Do we have the facilities? TRUMP: We're going build tent cities. We're going to put tents up all over the place. We are not going to build structures and spend all of these, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. We are going to have tents, they are going to be very nice and they are going to wait and if they don't get asylum they get out. And very few people -- they don't actually -- if you want to wait, they don't usually get asylum. You know that. INGRAHAM: Eighty percent, the projected. TRUMP: The problem is they release them in and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows up. But we are going to -- unlike Obama and unlike others, we are going to take the people, were going to put them in and they're going to wait. And you know what, two things happen. When they find out that that happens you're going to have far fewer people come up. And also, President Obama separated children from parents. Nobody talks about this. INGRAHAM: Until a judge came along and said you can't do it. TRUMP: No. He separated -- no, President Obama separated -- INGRAHAM: No, in the beginning. TRUMP: OK, just so we all understand -- INGRAHAM: \"The New York Times\" is saying the military, Mr. President, being called up by you is an election year play. Is this politics or is this real? TRUMP: We are being invaded. When you look at that, thousands of people. Somebody said, you know, now on that one when they built it down. I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people. Thousands and thousands of people on the bridge when you look at that bridge loaded up with people. That's called an invasion of our country. This has nothing to do with elections and I've been saying this long before election, I've been saying this before I ever thought of running for office. We have to have strong borders. If we don't have strong borders we don't have a country. INGRAHAM: Democrats are worried about the Latino vote suddenly. They are worried they're not going to get the numbers. TRUMP: They should be. They should be. You know why? Because the Latinos, the Hispanic-Americans have the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers in the history of our country. The African-Americans have the best employment and unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Asians, best employment numbers in the history of our country. Women, 65 years, you know, all of these things, women have the best numbers they've had in 65 years. They should be worried. INGRAHAM: How are you going to expand into these traditional Democratic areas? TRUMP: With results. INGRAHAM: Kanye West spend some time here. TRUMP: He was great. He was great Jim Brown. They were great. INGRAHAM: It's fascinating. How big of an effect is West on this push for African-American support? TRUMP: Well, a person came into my office who does poll numbers, said I do not believe how good these poll numbers are with African-Americans, and you see what's happened with my poll numbers. But here's what also happened. When we have the best employment numbers, the best median income numbers for all of these groups. I mean, we have the best numbers we've ever had and I sometimes jokingly say it's going to be awfully tough to beat me in a debate when I have the best numbers ever produced. So I think they should be worried. They should be worried about the African-Americans because they are going to lose them. INGRAHAM: Will you do some events in the inner cities? TRUMP: I'm doing them. I already have them scheduled. INGRAHAM: One thing that I think a lot of us are very concerned about is what's happening with the market this year. It's flat for the year, down a little bit, off its record high, both the S&P and the Dow. I know you've complained about the Fed before. How much is cheap credit globally is a part of this problem? TRUMP: Well, remember this, President Obama had the worst recap that we've ever had since the Great Depression, OK, in terms of coming back. But he was dealing with zero money, zero interest money. We actually created value for money so the people that have money in the bank and did it the way you were supposed to do, they are actually getting interest on the money now. The Fed is being very tight. Now, in one way you have to say that's very conservative. That's a good thing from the standpoint of conservative. I don't like it because it closes it down a little bit, but we're up. We are up almost 50 percent from the time I got elected, almost 50. In fact, more in some instances and now we are down just a little tiny bit. We have such a strong -- when you go job numbers, when you go companies moving into our countries. We have so many companies, big ones like Foxconn and like the car companies. They are moving back to Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, North Carolina, they are coming back and nobody's ever seen this. You've never seen it before. They left and they had no intention. We just signed a deal with Mexico and with Canada. We did a new deal with Korea. INGRAHAM: How about Bolsonaro? You talked to him last night. What can we expect for -- he's called the Trump of South America. TRUMP: I know. I'm honored. We had a great conversation, and he's now the head of Brazil. INGRAHAM: A deal, trade deal? TRUMP: Yes, I could see that happening. You know, Brazil has traded as very tough because they charge very big tariffs. Brazil has been very tough. So, we'll be able to straighten that out, but we have of course what's happening with China. China has been really hurting our country economically. And you see, we are going to win that one. It's going to happen. We're going to win that one. INGRAHAM: How confident are you about the deal? TRUMP: I could make a deal right now, I just say they are just not ready. INGRAHAM: $250 billion additional tariffs if that deal doesn't go through. TRUMP: $250 billion and have $267 billion waiting to go if we can't make a deal. INGRAHAM: Are you optimistic? Scale of 1 to 10. TRUMP: I think that we will make a great deal with China, and it has to be great, because they've drained our country. We have really helped rebuild China. They've been taking out an average of $500 billion, billion, a year for many years. Not going to happen anymore. INGRAHAM: Who is your dream person to run against in 2020? You've already raised $100 million. Dream, dream candidate to run against? TRUMP: So far I like them all. I don't see anybody -- INGRAHAM: Hillary, apparently she's not down and out. TRUMP: I like her, too. I like her, too. I would be very happy with Hillary. I like them all. I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against. And that could happen, but I don't see it right now. INGRAHAM: A couple other questions FOX viewers really want to know. \u00a0Declassifying those documents, they were kind of kicked over to the inspector general. Why not declassify them, get them all out? TRUMP: We are getting very close to doing what we have to do. I want to wait until after the election. INGRAHAM: Why are you and Rod Rosenstein such good friends now? It seems like everything has been settled. TRUMP: I do get along. But this should have never -- there should have never been a special council, in my opinion. It's an illegal investigation totally. A lot of people agree with me. A lot of people on your show and on other shows agree there was no collusion, there was never any collusion. \u00a0It shouldn't have ever happened. But with all of that being said, I do get along. And I have made everything available. You know why? Because I have nothing to do with Russia. Hillary was a lousy candidate, and I did a very good job. INGRAHAM: Are you going to do written questions, written answers? TRUMP: She didn't go to Wisconsin, she didn't go to Michigan enough. She didn't do what she had to do to win, and it's just one of those things. \u00a0But we have nothing to do with Russia, and I think you probably know that almost better than anybody. INGRAHAM: The written questions to Mueller's, written answers to his question? TRUMP: It's ridiculous that I have to do anything because we didn't do anything. But we will probably do something, yes, where we will respond to some questions. INGRAHAM: How's Melania doing? TRUMP: She's doing fantastically, really good. She's doing a great job. \u00a0Just got back from Africa, and she saw some things that were really eye- opening. And tremendous poverty, tremendous poverty. So we're trying to help. INGRAHAM: Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Laura. INGRAHAM: Really appreciate it. (END VIDEOTAPE) INGRAHAM: A bit more of our interview in the last part of a show. But next, in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at that Tree of Life Synagogue, critics took aim at President Trump's rhetoric. Ahead, the Israeli minister of education responds. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I'm just going to pay my respects. I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers, and some of the people that were so badly hurt. And I really look forward to going. I would have done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption. But I look forward to going to Pittsburgh tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was President Trump on what he hopes to accomplish with his visit to Pittsburgh in the aftermath of the horrific attack that left 11 dead. Now, some have suggested that the president's own language contributed to this tragedy, and even though the perpetrator hated his support for Israel and apparently hated him. Here to react, Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of education and minister of the diaspora Jews, along with Joel Rubin, president of the Washington Strategy Group and former Obama deputy assistant secretary of state. Mr. Minister, I would like to start with you. What would you like to say tonight to the president's critics? We'll get to some of the specifics in a moment, but a message to them about their concern about his language? NAFTALI BENNETT, ISRAELI MINISTER, DIASPORA AFFAIRS: First of all, I came over from Israel to tell the folks in Pittsburgh that we stand united. \u00a0Israel has always been under attacks, and now we've seen the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in America's history. And we do stand united with our brothers and sisters. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism has always existed. Where there are Jews, there's always been anti-Semitism, and we need to speak up. And I believe that's what the president is about to do. What he's done, he spoke up very loudly, very clearly, saying he would fight anyone who is anti-Semitic, and that's what we would expect, and we were very pleased to hear that. INGRAHAM: What about the resistance, though, Mr. Bennett? The resistance to the president's visit by, not all, but some more progressive of Jewish leaders in the country and in Pittsburgh proper. They were even criticizing your decision to come to Pittsburgh, and I believe we have one of those -- this is a tweet by David Simon, who is a Jewish-American writer. He said \"Go home. Netanyahu's interventions in U.S. politics aided in the election of Donald Trump and his raw and relentless validation of white nationalism and fascism. The American Jewish community is now bleeding at the hands of Israeli prime minister and many of us know it.\" \u00a0Those are tough words, not just directed at Donald Trump, but Bibi Netanyahu. BENNETT: Those are terrible words, but they are on Twitter. They are not in reality. I spent a couple of days in Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh with the Jewish community, and all I received was warmth, desire for unity. I think the president is absolutely right as the leader of the United States to go there and visit. I'm sure he would have been criticized had he not decided to go. And I think it's time for unity and for all of us to stand together. That's what we're doing. INGRAHAM: Joel, let's go to you. Some of the language being tossed around about President Trump I find to be not that helpful. This is a woman named Julia Ioffe on CNN just moments before I interviewed the president. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JULIA IOFFE: This president, one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization. And this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: She came out with kind of a half-hearted apology afterwards, Julia Ioffe, her name is. Your thoughts? JOEL RUBIN, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: Laura, first and foremost, I thank the minister for coming to Pittsburgh. I'm a fourth- generation Pittsburgher, grew up in Squirrel Hill. That's my parents' synagogue that got shot, so it's very personal. So for him to be there, it's positive. Political debate is part of Jewish life, and it's also part clearly of the community's feelings. This tweet, this statement, it reflects a real raw emotion right now. And I think American Jews in particular are very concerned about the rhetoric about how Jews are being described right now in the political environment. And we feel that that is contributed to a culture of hate that may have inspired this killer. INGRAHAM: The reference to Donald Trump, though. Donald Trump just -- I had the chance to see this big stone plaque he received today from Benjamin Netanyahu for his work for the Jewish people. It was in the Oval Office. \u00a0He had just received it. His daughter is Jewish, grandkids are Jewish, son-in-law is Jewish. A year ago, I think, there were saying he was too pro-Jewish. He was anti-Palestinian because of the move ultimately of the embassy to Jerusalem. Saying that he's causing a horrific attack by a man who said he despised Donald Trump. RUBIN: These are two separate issues. Support for Israel is not the same as what the American Jewish experience is. And right now in this country there is deep concern. After Charlottesville, for example, where the president was not clear in his condemnation of the white supremacy. And that kind of fed into this idea that maybe the president is not calling anti-Semitism or ethnic baiting enough. And it continues. There are many examples that make people very concerned about how we're being treated right now here at home. INGRAHAM: Mr. Minister, your response to that? The Jewish community has been fairly -- more Democratically aligned politically. But this is a tragedy that hits home for so many, including Joel, so many out there. \u00a0Your final thoughts tonight? BENNETT: I think we all have to speak out whenever anyone talks anti- Semitism, be at Louis Farrakhan, who just a few days ago compared Jews to termites, or David Duke. RUBIN: Agreed. BENNETT: And I think President Trump has been extremely supportive of the state of Israel. Moved to the embassy to Jerusalem, has recognized Jerusalem as our capital, has been a big friend of the Jewish people. This is not a partisan issue. It's got to be bipartisan. The president and on the other side of the aisle, everyone has to step up, speak up against anti-Semitism, and that's exactly what's going on here. INGRAHAM: We all can probably do a little bit better tonight, and I appreciate both of your being here. Thank you so much. And Lindsey Graham has been hitting the trail for the GOP senators across the country and came face-to-face with some nasty protesters in Tennessee. \u00a0He's going to be her next to tell us why this exemplifies what's at stake just eight days away. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Senator Lindsey Graham was campaigning with Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in Nashville yesterday when a mob of angry leftists disrupted them, yelling for Trump's impeachment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's take a moment and remember those that lost their lives in Pittsburgh. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Marsha Blackburn is a white supremacist! (SHOUTING) CROWD: USA! USA! USA! (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And did you catch that? During a moment of silence for the Pittsburgh victims, these disgusting protesters heckled Senator Graham and Marsha Blackburn. Senator Lindsey Graham joins us now. And senator, you say this paints a clear picture as to what's at stake in these midterms and why they're so important. I know you have been running yourself ragged going all over the country. And thanks for staying up with us tonight, but this is a very important time for this country. Explain why you think this is so critical at this juncture. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Who do you want to run your government? The bottom line, what they did was rude and crude. It's the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans politically. This is not good for the country. If you want to reward this behavior, then you get a chance a week from tomorrow to do so. If you think this is inappropriate and wrong for the country, you can vote Republican. I've tried to work across the aisle. I will keep trying to work across the aisle, but I've had it with this intimidation, in-your-face radical left. \u00a0I want to shut them down, and the best way to shut them down is to beat them at the ballot box. INGRAHAM: Senator Graham, there has been a drumbeat over the past few days since this horrific, dastardly, evil, satanic act took place at that synagogue. And we have a montage, I just want to share with you, of individuals on television trying to tag President Trump with it. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a problem, and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play in dealing with it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would put specific responsibility on the president. \u00a0I think what he's done over the course of the last few years is help foment this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the center, an unapologetically incendiary president untrammeled by traditional norms of civility. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Your reaction? GRAHAM: Again, they don't get it. I think when we win a week from tomorrow, and I think we will, I hope they understand that one of the reasons that we are doing so well as Republicans is people are disgusted with what you've just seen and heard. Nobody blamed Bernie Sanders when his supporter shot Steve Scalise, tried to kill a bunch of Republicans. \u00a0Nothing Trump can do is right in the eyes of these people. Trump is not responsible for this anti-Semitic hatemonger who will meet justice. That's not Donald Trump's fault. He didn't send anything through the mail. That's not his fault. It's not the left's fault when people do bad things in the name of the left. So the American people have had it with this. I've had it with it. Kavanaugh, the caravan, blaming Trump for everything under the sun. If you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they've got it wrong, then vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party. The only way they're going to change is for them to lose. If you want Kavanaugh to mean anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh character assassinations, then you need to reject what they did and hand them the defeat they deserve. They want power so badly, the media is in the tank for them, and the only way they'll get it is for the American people to send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you, tired of your tactics and blaming every Republican for everything. INGRAHAM: Senator, very quickly, the 5,200 troops being called up to go to the border, I understand they're going to be putting reinforced razor wire on the border fence. Donald Trump reacted to this, but Bush tried National Guard and Obama tried National Guard. We spent like $1.4 billion, we didn't get much for it. Do you think this will be different this time? GRAHAM: Name one person who has tried to solve immigration harder than I have. I've reached across the aisle, and I am offended by this caravan trying to overrun our country. We are a hospitable nation. They're taking advantage of our generosity. We need to send a clear signal to this caravan and every other caravan that America is not going to tolerate this. \u00a0So President Trump is doing the right thing. To our friends in Mexico, if you don't help Trump stop this caravan you're going to pay a price in Congress when it comes to this trade deal. INGRAHAM: Lindsey Graham, thank you so much. I know you stayed up for us. \u00a0We really appreciate it. And we break down some ugly comments from Al Sharpton this weekend about President Trump's appearance at a Turning Point USA's Young Black Leadership Summit. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REV. AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: It was a make America great rally, the use of young blacks as props, which really is an insult to them. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Those wide remarks by Al Sharpton were directed at the attendings of Turning Point USA's Young Black Leadership Summit where President Trump gave a speech last week. Here to react is Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21. Horace, it seems that the reverend Al believes that only Democrats should have the monopoly on outreach to African- Americans. I found that, I've got to say -- I shouldn't be surprised, but it was still despicable. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Not just the monopoly on outreach, also the monopoly on the use of bigoted and racist remarks with every single group. He didn't just attack Kanye West and other moderate blacks. \u00a0He's attacked gays. He's attacked Asians, both Chinese and Koreans. It's his vile language that refers to people who are Jewish as diamond merchant. \u00a0These are the kinds of comments that a man like this makes, and then he wants to stand up and say he should be the arbiter of what constitutes racism and what doesn't. My group, Project 21, was created precisely because we want to make sure people understand that black Americans aren't identified by our skin color. We all have individual views, opinions. We can be Democrats, we can be Republicans. He's none of those things. He's just a bigot. INGRAHAM: To your point, MSNBC trotted out Al Sharpton this weekend to react to the Pittsburgh tragedy. Was that a wise decision given his ugly history of comments about people of the Jewish faith? Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REV. AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: We must equally be outraged with the Tree of Life 11 and say that there is no room for bigotry anywhere. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: No room for bigotry anywhere. I would agree with him on that, but why does that not apply to some of his past statements? COOPER: Here is the guy who is the posterchild not for a dog whistle, for coming right out and using the most vile and bigoted remarks. And he targets people all the time. When it was Don Imus who came on his program and wanted to apologize for the bigoted remarks that he had made, his response was, you can't be a purveyor on the national airways if you're making comments like this. And yet there he sits on MSNBC. INGRAHAM: A lot of corporate types like to -- they want to play nice with Al Sharpton because if they do play nice with Al Sharpton they won't get hauled in or sued or they won't be harassed by him. I think that's part of it as well. But to say that the black youth that were at that Turning Point summit were used, that's an insult to their intelligence. They were there because they wanted to be. Horace, thanks so much. And what was behind this moment at the White House Halloween event yesterday? The president explains. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Tonight's last bite, one more snippet from my conversation with President Trump today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: You had a lot of kids. There was one moment where I was watching on video, there was this little girl. She had kind of a wand or something, and she was -- and you said, you pointed over the press and you said -- what did you tell her? TRUMP: It was a snake. It was a cobra. It was a cobra. And a little beautiful girl, she -- I said let me have that and I looked at the press. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, that's all the time we have tonight.

            "article_content": "President Trump dialed back his political attacks and denounced the suspicious mailings, urging people to solve&nbsp;their differences peacefully. John Roberts reports for 'Special Report.' President Trump is\u00a0facing two big tests of his presidency as November's midterm elections draw closer: the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants and this week's mysterious bomb threats. The threats pose a challenge to the Trump administration on how to respond without alienating the Republican base or crucial swing voters that may determine the outcome of House,\u00a0Senate and gubernatorial races across the country. On the caravan issue, where thousands of migrants are marching through Mexico\u00a0toward the U.S. border,\u00a0Trump is reportedly considering a sweeping executive order that would block asylum-seekers\u00a0from entering the country. It would be a decisive measure \u2013 resembling the Trump administration\u2019s previous executive orders to curb migration from some Muslim-majority countries \u2013 and would likely energize the Republican base, which\u00a0sees immigration as one of the main issues of the midterm elections. But the move could cause a backlash as it would draw attention to the White House -- a source of division among voters -- and away from local Republican candidates, some of whom hold sharply different views than the president. TRUMP MULLS PLAN TO BAR ENTRY OF ALL MIGRANTS AT US-MEXICO BORDER If the executive order goes ahead, the images of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers stranded at the U.S. border may prompt outrage similar to that of\u00a0last summer, when children were separated from their parents as families tried to cross into the U.S. illegally. The outcry forced Trump to concede and sign an executive order effectively reversing U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy at the border and allowing children to stay with parents caught crossing the border illegally. On the issue of explosive devices being sent to multiple Democratic politicians and CNN, Trump immediately called for unity, saying the incidents were \u201cabhorrent.\u201d \u201cThe safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. We will spare no resources or expense in this effort.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn these times, we have to unify. We have to come together, and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\u201d \"In these times, we have to unify. We have to come together, and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\" EXPLOSIVE DEVICES MAILED TO OBAMA, HILLARY CLINTON, OTHERS PROMPT SECURITY SCARE Top Democrats jumped on Trump\u2019s remarks, saying his remarks \u201cring hollow.\u201d They accused him of condoning \u201cpolitical violence.\u201d \"President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTime and time again, the President has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and his actions: expressing support for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter, the neo-Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville, his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters, dictators around the world who murder their own citizens, and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people.\u201d The president returned Thursday to criticize the media and blamed it for incivility. \u201cA very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!\u201d A former top adviser to Hillary Clinton said earlier this week that the suspect or suspects linked to a rash of explosive devices sent to Democrats, such as former President Barack Obama and the Clintons, could have been inspired by Trump\u2019s messages. EX-CLINTON ADVISER SAYS TRUMP'S TWITTER MESSAGES MAY HAVE INSPIRED BOMB SUSPECT Philippe Reines said on MSNBC that the rhetoric coming from the White House can\u2019t be dismissed in the wake of the bomb scare. \u201cIf you look at who they\u2019ve targeted so far, it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re following Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed,\" Reines said Wednesday on \"Andrea Mitchell Reports,\" adding that not everyone in public office has access to Secret Service protection. But the Trump administration forcefully pushed back against suggestions that it shares the responsibility. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Thursday that Trump is \u201ccertainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone, no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up a Republican baseball field practice last year.\u201d",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" November 1, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are moving them out. This endemic abuse of the asylum system makes a mockery of our immigration system, displacing legitimate asylum-seekers -- and there are legitimate asylum-seekers -- while rewarding those who abuse or defraud our system. Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Trump at the White House today saying America is a welcoming country, but he will not allow the generosity of America to be abused by those who would break the laws, saying he's changing the process essentially for asylum and that the U.S. military is going to build tent cities along the border and that people will be held there while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. This as he tweeted a video that raised a lot of eyebrows today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He says he wants to apply for a felony he committed, attempted murder. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And it goes on to show someone who is convicted of murder in the country, let in again. That person in that video, actually, shown at the end, came back in in the Bush administration. But let's bring our panel: Jonathan Swan, national politics reporter for Axios; Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president. Jonathan, what is clear is that the president is making this the closing argument and sees benefit to making this the closing argument. JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS: Yes, when you talk to people who are close to him, they are almost joyful about this caravan situation. I'm talking about pure politics here. They think this is a political gift, and they want to put as much attention on it as possible. They want as much media attention on it as possible. And the president in this last week making this the centerpiece of his argument. BAIER: Katie, I heard the Defense Department talking about what they are hearing intelligence-wise from their partners in Guatemala and Mexico, saying that there are real dangerous figures. It's not just mothers and children in this caravan. But it is going to get some time to get to the border. The national emergency part is -- some critics question. KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM: Senator Chuck Grassley, who is on the oversight committee and handles a lot of these immigration issues also sent a letter to Secretary Nielsen and Secretary of State Pompeo today asking for more details about who these people are because they received intelligence there are violent actors, MS-13 and other national security threats, and they want to know how to separate those people from those who are actually trying to seek asylum in the United States. When it comes to the timing here, you can criticize the president going after this issue when the caravans now are thousands of miles away. However, you could also argue he's trying to be proactive in stopping thousands of people getting here before they are out on the front door on the border and causing yet another crisis for border patrol and our customs enforcement agents. BAIER: Tom, when you ask people what's most important, immigration comes in, like, third, depending on where they live. Border states, it's more important. But it does cross party lines, this issue of national security and the border and dealing with it effectively. TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: It does, and certainly it puts Democrats in a very tough spot. What are you going to say? Sure, let everybody in, that's not a winning message for them. So definitely the Democrats do not want to talk about the caravan at all. They want to talk about health care. It's interesting, though, Trump just cited in his press conference today, this is the best economy ever but he's not running on it. And the reason he's not running on it is because voters don't vote out of gratitude. They vote out of fear, anger, and frustration. This is of issue that riled up his base, and that's what the Republicans need in five days. They need the Republican base to turn out. Trump is tripling down. He thinks this is the answer. We'll find out whether he's right or not. BAIER: But it is affecting some of these red state Democrats. I just talked to Claire McCaskill in Missouri. She said in the interview she is 100 percent behind President Trump in his efforts to secure the border. SWAN: And she looked noticeably uncomfortable when you asked her that question. I watched that interview. She is someone who the polls suggest is very vulnerable if not likely to lose. And she does not want to be talking about this issue, because, again so many red states are with Trump on this issue. BAIER: Here is an NPR/PBS Marist poll in the past few days about the issues. Economy, jobs, health care, immigration third, and you see the breakdown, all voters, GOP voters. Was it a policy speech or a political speech, Katie, at the White House today? PAVLICH: I think you can argue that it's both. Obviously it's political because we're up against a midterm election where President Trump had repeatedly said my name isn't on the ballot but my policies are, and the issue of bringing up illegal immigration, showing the caravan, the White House releasing that ad, hammered that point home. But when it comes to policy, this is a crisis. You have 2,000 people a week coming over the border. You go down and you talk to these folks. The agents there are demoralized because they are now babysitting and taking care of people in these, call them tent cities, in these facilities. They feel like they are not capable of doing the job which they were sent there to do, which is to secure the border and keep bad actors from coming into the country. So when it comes to policies, he laid out a lot of things today. We'll see if they can actually get them done when it comes the asylum claims being only made at the ports of entries. When it comes to holding families longer than the 20 days as they are required with Flores. But I would say that it was both. Yes, it's political because of the time that we are in. This is a huge issue for GOP base voters which are essential in a midterm election. But also there is a very serious crisis with Central American illegal immigrants coming here and having no way under U.S. policy and law to immediately deport them back to their home countries. BAIER: I want to go to everybody's individual race that they pick that they are interested in. But quickly, Jonathan, you had this interview with the president in which the birthright citizenship issue, a scoop that you had came up and was confirmed. Also this about enemy of the people, this exchange with Jim VandeHei. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM VANDEHEI: Do you worry at all? You are the most powerful man in the world. If you say that word \"enemy,\" \"enemy,\" literally tens of thousands of people go into a stadium to listen to you. And then people go on social media and they get themselves so jazzed up. There's got to be a part of you that's damn it, I'm scared that someone is -- TRUMP: It is my only form of fighting back. I couldn't be here if I did that. VANDEHEI: You won. You have the presidency. TRUMP: No, no, no. But I did this before I won. (END VIDEO CLIP) SWAN: It was an interesting moment because we'd been interviewing the president at that point for about 15 or 20 minutes. The interview wasn't actually going that well. We were asking policy questions, pressing things, and he didn't look that comfortable. And the weirdest thing was Jim starts really converting him on this issue of his rhetoric. Trump almost relaxed as the conflict went up. It was like he finally looked like he was sort of -- and he made very clear that he's completely unfazed by any thought of potential consequences of this language. And he says -- he actually said in the interview, basically my people want it. They love me more because of it. And Jim said, yes, but you're the president. BAIER: The question, Tom, on that front, is whether the past two weeks with the shooting and the pipe bombs changed the dynamic towards the Democrats in some of these suburban House races, that maybe some of them who were going to their parties said, well, wait a second, I don't like that rhetoric. BEVAN: It's obviously very, very hard to quantify the impact of either these events. And I suspect this point how divided the country is, how locked-in people are to their choices, the impact is probably nil in terms of it's not going to change minds. BAIER: It's a wash. BEVAN: It's a wash. Will it motivate folks to turn up who wouldn't otherwise have? Probably not. I think at this point the cake is pretty much baked. BAIER: Lightning round on the races that you picked that you are interested in. Katie first. PAVLICH: I'm interested in Arizona. I'm from Arizona. Kyrsten Sinema versus Martha McSally. The polls have them all over the map. Real Clear Politics has Sinema up by 0.7 but a local ABC 15 poll came up today with McSally up by seven, interestingly enough among young independents breaking for McSally, which I thought was an interesting point. So we'll see if she can pull it out next week. BAIER: We're getting word that the Green Party candidate there may be getting out of the race and throwing her support to Sinema, like the libertarian in Montana. How much that makes a difference, we don't know, how many points that is. What's your race? BEVAN: I want to pick something people hadn't talked about before, but I have to go with the Florida governor's race for this reason. We had poll come out, CNN poll. Two weeks ago they had Gillum 12, now they have got him up by two. This race has tightened considerably. In our Real Clear Politics average eight days ago Gillum was up 5.8 percent. Now his lead is half of that. So keep an eye on this race. There's a lot of movement here in the final days. BAIER: The president there last night. Jonathan, your race? SWAN: I chose one that we haven't talked about, Maryland's first district. I think it's a fascinating race to watch. It should be an easy Republican victory. Andy Harris, the incumbent, won I think by 40 points or something in 2016. But the Democratic candidate, Jesse Colvin, he's an army veteran. He's in that Conon Lamb mold. He's got this ad at a shooting range where he's firing, he's a really good shot, straight through the heart. And you have anti-Pelosi. So he's testing that message of distancing himself from the leftwing of the Democratic Party. We'll see if it works. If it does and Republicans lose, we'll know pretty early in the night because it's east coast, and that's a harbinger of a pretty terrible night for Republicans. BAIER: There are a few of those House races on the East Coast that we'll be looking at closely. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "On 'Fox & Friends,' Homeland Security secretary says the need for action on border security is clear. The head of the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security bashed the media Sunday for their reporting on the increasingly volatile immigration controversy, writing in a string of tweets: \u201cWe do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\u201d Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen added: \u201cThis misreporting by Members, press & advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive. As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry.\u201d She noted that no one is \u201cbreaking the law by seeking asylum at a port of entry.\u201d The Trump administration, which has called it \u201chorrible\u201d that\u00a0illegal-immigrant children are sometimes separated\u00a0from their parents when their parents enter criminal proceedings, has been criticized in recent weeks for increasing the prosecutions of illegal immigrants under a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that critics say leads to those separations. A child illegally entering the U.S. is generally separated from adults at the border if the child is in danger, has no clear relationship to the adult, or if the adult enters criminal proceedings. Through Twitter, Nielsen reiterated that current policies are derived from laws already in the books: \u201cFor those seeking asylum at ports of entry, we have continued the policy from previous Administrations and will only separate if the child is in danger, there is no custodial relationship between 'family' members, or if the adult has broken a law.\u201d She added: \u201cDHS takes very seriously its duty to protect minors in our temporary custody from gangs, traffickers, criminals and abuse.\u201d Earlier this month, Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon\u00a0was denied entry at a detention center\u00a0he attempted to visit in Texas after the police were called and an official told him to \"please go away.\" He and other Democratic politicians have visited other immigrant detention facilities successfully.",

            "article_content": "Jimmy Carter criticized President Trump in a recent interview, saying he thought the commander in chief was a \u201cdisaster in human rights and taking care of people and treating people equal.\u201d (AP) Former President Jimmy Carter has some advice for fellow Democrats looking to end Republican control of American government: Don\u2019t go too far to the left. \u201cIndependents need to know they can invest their vote in the Democratic Party,\u201d Carter said Tuesday, during his annual report at his post-presidential center and library in Atlanta. Carter stressed that Democrats nationally must \u201cappeal to independents,\u201d who are souring on the current administration. President Trump\u2019s job approval rating, according to Gallup, has dipped to 40 percent, mostly because of declining support among independents. Carter alluded to arguments from self-identified progressives that Democrats will sacrifice votes on the left if they don\u2019t embrace the liberal base: \u201cI don\u2019t think any Democrat is going to vote against a Democratic nominee,\u201d Carter said. He also insisted that he\u2019s not asking the left to sacrifice its goals, only to see that winning elections is necessary to accomplish any of them. There is some historical irony to Carter\u2019s analysis. He came to the White House in 1976 from the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, and he clashed with party liberals, drawing a spirited primary challenge in 1980 from Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. Carter prevailed, but he was wounded, abandoned by Kennedy\u2019s most liberal supporters and unable to win over independents who helped deliver a landslide for Republican Ronald Reagan and end Carter's hopes for a second term. Carter and his wife live a modest life in Plains, Georgia, where the former president was born and raised. Following his presidency, he wrote books about his faith and career before starting the Carter Center. Carter also \u201ccosts U.S. taxpayers less than any other ex-president\u201d in terms of allowances and office staff, the\u00a0General Services Administration\u00a0reported. As an elder statesman, he does like to dip back into the political scene, now and again. These days, he said, he sees little hope for the U.S. to change its human rights and environmental policies as long as Trump is in the White House. However, he offered a caution about the political consequences of a Democratic shift \u201cto a very liberal program, like universal health care.\u201d That\u2019s delicate \u2014 and, Carter admitted, even contradictory \u2014 advice coming from the 93-year-old former president, and it underscores the complicated political calculations for Democrats as they prepare for the midterms and look ahead to 2020. \u201cRosie and I voted for Bernie Sanders in the past,\u201d Carter noted. He was referring to his wife, Rosalynn, and their support for the Vermont senator, an independent who identifies as a democratic socialist, over establishment favorite Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Carter\u2019s latest handicapping comes near the conclusion of a midterm primary season that has seen Democratic voters nudge the party to the left. In some states and districts, that means nominating full-throated advocates of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and the abolition or overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In other races, it means nominees who back more cautious moves to the left, such as background checks before certain gun purchases, a \u201cpublic option\u201d health insurance plan to compete alongside private insurance policies, step raises for the minimum wage and an immigration overhaul that offers legal status to some immigrants in the country illegally. Carter did not delve into those distinctions, instead offering a sweeping condemnation of his latest successor to remind Democrats of the stakes. He denounced the administration\u2019s latest environmental policy proposal to make it easier for energy companies to release methane gas that contributes to climate change. At another point, he pointed to California\u2019s environmental policies \u2014 limits on carbon emissions, stiffer fuel-efficiency standards \u2014 as the model for combating climate change. He singled out Trump\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families at the border, including those seeking asylum. \u201cAmerica is inherently committed to human rights, and I think in the future we will let that prevail,\u201d Carter said, \u201cbut for the next two years, I can\u2019t predict the imprisoned children are going to be any better off \u2014 unfortunately.\u201d Carter has previously criticized Trump for his repeated falsehoods, and he has chided the incumbent for his hard-line support for Israel over Palestinians. Yet Carter has found common ground with Trump on other foreign policy fronts, and did so again Tuesday. While avoiding any mention of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 elections, Carter said he has engaged for years with Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the ongoing Syrian civil war. \u201cI have his email address,\u201d said Carter, adding that he and Putin share the same Russian river as their favorite spot for salmon fishing. That friendship, Carter said, means when Russia and other nations hold multilateral talks about the Syrian conflict, \u201cquite often they invite the Carter Center. ... They do not invite the U.S. government.\u201d Carter also praised Trump for meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Carter repeated his frustrations with the last Democratic president, Barack Obama, for not engaging more directly with the insular Asian nation. Carter said he\u2019s not sure Trump has made real progress yet with North Korea, but he endorsed calls for the U.S. to declare formally an end to the Korean War and normalize relations with Pyongyang. \u201cLet them be part of the community of nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be enough in itself to bring an end to the nuclear program in North Korea.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" July 26, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, thanks so much. Fascinating hour with Roseanne. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you INGRAHAM: I've got to watch the last half, I only saw the first half because I had to work for the second half HANNITY: Well, why didn't you watch the second half? INGRAHAM: I'm going to watch it tonight when I get back, but it was wild from beginning to end. So good job. That's like dealing with like a feral -- you know some kind of feral, wild deal, that was cool. HANNITY: All right. INGRAHAM: So congrats on that, Sean. HANNITY: All right, have a great show, we'll see you tomorrow. INGRAHAM: All right, and good evening. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle.' We have a phenomenal show lined up for tonight. We have breaking news on that 2016 Trump Tower meeting with supposedly Russian agents, you know Natalia Veselnitskaya, lawyer-gal. So we'll talk to you about that. Plus a stunning turn of events in the impeachment campaign against Rod Rosenstein by the House GOP. Wait until you hear who Auntie Maxine claims is driving her anti-Trump crusade. And a major warning to Democrats. Why they may be dead-wrong again about the polls ahead of the midterms. But first, when the inmates run the immigration asylum. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Today was the court-imposed deadline for the Trump administration to reunite families who were separated due to that DOJ zero- tolerance approach to illegal immigration. Of course, all the usual suspects in the media painted a grim picture. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTFIED MALE: They're indicative of these emotional pains and struggles these families have been dealing with over the last several weeks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I met two children from two different families. One a 7-year-old boy who loves the superhero Flash and the other an 11-year-old girl who has to help her father operate his smartphone and likes to play basketball. They are normal kids in almost every way, normal kids dealing with a very difficult situation. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Tonight the administration announced 1412 children have been delivered to parents in immigration custody, which took hundreds of staffers apparently to carry out. Lord knows how much money it took. But the fact that this ever happened drove the left to cry Trump's a heartless guy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA BASH, CNN: A practice that's been called heartless and cruel by Republicans who almost never speak out. MIKE BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC: They are being held, and they're being held against their will. This is a Trump policy that is blatantly cruel. REVEREND AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST: Most of Donald Trump's base wouldn't tolerate seeing white children treated like that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Reverend Al -- histrionics aside, the White House's hands were tied, remember -- by the 2015 ruling by Obama judge Dolly Gee, ordering that even children who cross the border with parents have to be released from custody in 20 days. That meant either Trump continued that old policy of catch and release, family units caught entering the country illegally, or parents were detained separately from their minor children, because the children had to be released. The administration chose the latter path which led to well -- mostly Democrat-led protests across America which ultimately drove the White House back to back down. It was a total mess. Congress had the chance to change the law, close the loopholes. And let's face it, they could've tightened the asylum process and expedited the deportation hearings. But they chose to do nada. How brave. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN, R\u2014WISC., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have a broken immigration system. It doesn't work for anybody. Least of which to control our border. And so when we get to the moment where we're actually solving this problem, which I would prefer sooner rather than later, I really think it's going to gravitate around these four pillars. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But then came a typical sneak move that we expect from Democrats, but not from the president's own party. Before running to the airport today for their working August recess, the House held a sneaky vote on a Homeland Security appropriations bill that will only end up adding to our problems at the border. The amendment basically codifies DACA and was the brainchild of Congressman David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina. But it wasn't just David Price. GOP Congressman Kevin Yoder, the all-important Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, was also in full support of the idea. Especially this part that made it easier for illegal immigrants to claim asylum. If they credibly fear gang-related or domestic violence. Yoder claims he was moved to change his position on asylum due to the influence of his mother. He said today, \"As a son of a social worker, I have great compassion for the victims of domestic violence anywhere, especially as it concerns those nations that turn a blind eye of crimes of domestic violence.\" Well, forgive me, congressman, and I appreciate your personal story, but your family history shouldn't be allowed to thwart the president's immigration agenda. And frankly, imperil the party's prospects in the midterms. Until 2016, asylum was traditionally reserved for those in fear of persecution for things like their religious, their political or their ethnic background. Not due to one's fear of crime or the threat of domestic abuse in his or her home, as horrible as that is. But as a new barometer for asylum status is whether a foreigner feels safe in his or her home country, we should -- might as well through the borders wide open. It doesn't matter if you have a wall or no wall. Hundreds of millions of asylum requests are going to come pouring in. Now, it's worth remembering the Center for Immigration Studies estimates if this House language, like that in the Gang of Eight Bill, were to prevail in the Senate, we could be looking at 32 million new voting-age adults living in the United States by the year 2036. Democrats want desperately to replace America's more conservative electorate with foreign, younger, usually more socially liberal voters. What does that mean? I'll tell you one thing it means -- no more Donald Trumps. And big business will revel of course, in the glut of low-skilled workers in the midst of what they claim is a labor crunch. They also won't have to raise wages much, right? Which is what they are starting to do now, they're having to do it to fill these jobs. And that means more profit for themselves. But beyond the all the tears, the meltdowns and a lot of sad stories -- some sob stories -- it's critical for Republicans not to cave to the Democrats on immigration. This is just a desperate play by the resistance because Trump is beating them on the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH MACDONALD, FBN HOST: The future is pointing north. Up 232 points. The market's loving this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we're on our way -- we back up, maybe to the January highs. MACDONALD: Wow, we may have 5 percent GDP growth coming Friday. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Because their phony Russia collusion pipedream is crumbling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is just not a lot in the Trump collusion bucket to look at. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And because they are incapable of separating the president from his base. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: According to the new NBC news \"Wall Street Journal\" poll, 88 percent of Republicans approve of the job President Trump is doing. The only president with a higher approval rating was in their own party at this point in their presidency, it was President George W. Bush less than a year after 9/11. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now is not the time for Republicans to give in on immigration enforcement or melt because of the cheap, emotional media games. By the way, games that are only reserved for non-citizens. It was President Trump's get tough approach on immigration, his relentless focus on the American worker, the American family, that helped him win the election against all odds. Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania. Giving into the melodrama of the moment is not the way to go. In fact, that will end up further burdening the American taxpayer, who was already fed up with a political system that sometimes makes them feel like second-class citizens. I know, Mr. President, you will not let them down. And that is the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is immigration attorney Michael Wildes who is the author of the new book \"Safe Haven in America: Battles to Open the Golden Door.\" Our friend Alan Dershowitz wrote the forward. And Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new movie, \"Death of a Nation\" is in theaters August 3, we're all looking forward to that. His accompanying book comes out on the same day. All right guys, a lot to unpack. Dinesh let's start with you. This is the kind of story I think Republicans always have a hard time with because nobody likes to see a child crying, because he or she misses his mother or his father. It tugs at everybody's heartstrings. Mine. I am a mom. You're a dad. It has hard stuff to see, but this problem was brought on by politicians who refused to do the work they were supposed to do. And now the American people, as usual, are supposed to pick up the tab. Your reaction to all of this? DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": Well, I think on the one hand, there is grief, but there is also the manipulation of grief. The politics, if you could call it -- moist eyes. This isn't just the Democratic Party. It's also the media which frames these images. And so it's not that the Republicans are insensitive. The Republicans are scared of being portrayed as insensitive. And the Democrats are using that charge, even though at heart, they know it's fake. And what I mean by that is look, we live in a Hobbesian world in which a lot of these problems, gang violence, domestic violence, these are epidemic -- particularly you know the favelas in Brazil, the slums of Bombay, all over China. These are global problems. America has never taken the position that our doors are open worldwide to anybody who is suffering from these problems. We create very carefully carved out exceptions, for example, political persecution or as you said earlier, religious persecution. And that is it. But the Democrats are using the fact that they are able to dramatize these problems on our border to create a kind of emotional stampede. And then Republicans feel politically defensive, run for the exits, in the kind of familiar invertebrate fashion. INGRAHAM: Well yeah, this Kevin Yoder, congressman, I don't know him from Adam. But you know he brings this story -- his mother was a social worker. Well that's interesting and I'm glad she was a social worker, but that has nothing to do with our U.S. Immigration policy. And for some reason, like Donald Trump had him on Air Force One last week. Like he's a great guy, he's giving me $5 billion for the wall. Five billion dollars for the wall is not going to matter if we have tens of millions of people all across the country, we have 45 countries, Michael Wilde, where domestic abuse generally not recognized as crime. Forty-five countries. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Haiti, it goes on and on and on where women do not get the same rights as women here in the United States and other developed countries against men who abuse them. So does that mean all of them can apply under Kevin Yoder's, David Price's new idea about asylum? That is madness. MICHAEL WILDE, AUTHOR, \"SAFE HAVEN IN AMERICA: BATTLES TO OPEN THE GOLDEN DOOR: Thank you Laura for having me on. Forgive my personal attire. I am running for mayor in New Jersey and there was an event in my community and I came over here to join you. Look, I'm a law professor and adjunct at a law school. Political asylum is actually sacred law. And historically domestic violence has not yielded itself for a long time as the basis for political asylum. There's an old battle cry between persecution and prosecution. If you are being persecuted, you apply for asylum at our door. If you are in fear of prosecution or you have issues with your home country, it's not America's business, and we have economic challenges for our own citizenry. So domestic violence is less of a case. But gang violence is a different predicate for asylum. Because there you have countries that enable narcos and all the drug traffickers and they take no action. And Muslim countries throughout the world where women are being abused in relationships where the government codifies it under Sharia law and so forth. So the real question is should America's golden doors be slammed shut when there are people that are trying to protect themselves? INGRAHAM: Well I do know this. Dinesh -- I do I know we have Iraqi Christians, Syrian Christians, people throughout the Middle East who have been waiting for years. The classic case of ethnic cleansing, religious cleansing taking place in central African republics, Sudan and throughout the Middle East. And we've taken in -- I mean Dinesh you might know better -- I mean very few. And yet, just because you show up at our southern border and you know, NBC is there to cover your -- you know, the sad story, that suddenly America -- Americans are going to say okay, we're going to change our whole system, and we are going to throw open the door to every criminal victim in the world. And let me just read this, then I want you to react. Credible fear applications since 2007 -- 5,171 applications for credible fear asylum request. 2016 -- 91,786. An increase of 1675%. Do you think there is any fraud there, Dinesh? D'SOUZA: Well you know, I would like to step back for a moment and look at this a slightly different way. I mean the founders looked at America as a kind of moral community. A group of people who have a common set of values and a common destiny. Almost in some senses like an extended family. If someone came banging on your door and said listen, I am in fear because I'm being chased by a gang, I would submit that the ordinary person would be a little skeptical before giving them \"asylum,\" before saying come in. You can move in because you have a credible fear. It's now become our responsibility. Most people would say wait a minute. I have a direct obligation to my own. As for others, coming in from the outside, I am sympathetic. But on the other hand, it's not necessarily my problem. At the very least, our democratic system has to go through the legislative process to decide what we do with such people. So ultimately the decision is with Congress, but this idea that somehow because the media dramatizes a hard-left story, that the idea that somehow the Republicans have to run for cover, this is just in a sense political theater. WILDES: Laura, if I may -- INGRAHAM: Michael, we have a 311,000 applicant backlog as of January of this year. We have an overall backlog of 700,000 in general immigration applications in our immigration courts. Jeff Sessions said last month or the month before, we're trying to make progress, but just we can't keep up with it. At some point, it swamps the whole system, costing a huge amount of money, that most people watching the show tonight are like, I don't want to pay for this. Out of money here -- go ahead, you can close it out. WILDES: Thank you. Two points. First, we all agree, with the gentleman speaking, Congress should set the policy. We don't want the attorney general or the cops, the ICE agents to be executing on asylum law. That should be in the courts. And certainly they should have set up enough judges to adjudicate these cases, so you don't have children without representation and you don't have families being separated. The real issue here is a few weeks ago you said if the Republicans aren't going to work with the Democrats, then do nothing. Here they are beginning to work with each other, but you are not liking what they are doing. But guess what. Congress, it's their job. We all agree, all three of us, that they have to fix this. INGRAHAM: Why did they have no vote on this then, Mike? Why no vote? Why are they running out of town for their August recess? They did this sneak vote and they run out of town, no one comes. New called all these Democrats today, none of them would come on the show, nor would Congressman Yoder. WILDES: I have always been disappointed in members of Congress. INGRAHAM: They are all afraid. They don't want to defend this -- WILDES: Yeah because they feel they're never going to get re-elected if they're strong on immigration. INGRAHAM: It's indefensible. WILDES: They feel they'll never get re-elected. INGRAHAM: It's indefensible. Yeah. They are running home to vacation or campaigns. They do not want to defend. We are out of time, guys. We are out of time. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: We'll do a longer segment, Michael Cohen by the way, is reportedly claiming tonight that Donald Trump knew of the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians ahead of time. But there may be one big problem with Cohen's allegations. Details next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Breaking tonight, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former attorney, claiming the president knew in advance about that Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 in which Russians were supposedly going to offer campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, that according to CNN. Of course, in their breathless coverage, they seem to be ignoring the important nugget. Quote, to be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence such as audio recordings to corroborate his claims. But he is willing to attest to his account. Here now to react, former U.S. Attorney and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy and \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist Kim Strassel. Welcome to both of you. Andy let's start with you here. Boy, it seems like Michael Cohen has gotten very talkative, a lot of stuff coming out over the last few days. What do you make of this latest claim? ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think he's had a change in posture over the last number of weeks. The retention of Lanny Davis certainly was an indicator of that. I think the big problem he will have, if this is his version of events is apparently he has talked about this before in prior testimony and prior interviews and evidently did not cough this up. I have always thought that if Mueller believes that Cohen was somehow the key to proving a collusion case against Trump, there is no way he lets fact case walk to the southern district of New York. I would be surprised if this links up to anything that is serious in the way of collusion, like an espionage conspiracy. But look, the Trump Tower meeting is bad. It's not collusion in the sense that they were, that they opened the investigation over it. But nobody -- no one's going to look good in this. INGRAHAM: But Andy -- Andy hold on. Andy. Andy. As we talk about this, I think we forget Hillary Clinton paid for dirt that was assembled by the Russians in the form of the Steele dossier. She actually went further than meeting with someone. Her people paid for it. They got dirt and it ended up making it all the way through the U.S. government. So it's like big deal. MCCARTHY: Look Laura. No, I don't think it's bad if campaigns are turning to foreign governments for dirt. It's not collusion. It's not something that's impeachable. It's icky. But that's what this is. INGRAHAM: Kimberly, let's go to you on this. Rudy Giuliani was on CNN as this came out and he had a comment about the, well, the veracity of Mr. Cohen. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: There's nobody I know that knows him that hasn't warned me that if his back us up against the wall, he will lie like crazy, because he's lied all his life. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Wow, a war of words. That seems like probably only still (ph) Cohen to release more information. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, COLUMNIST, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, just the kind of guy you want as a lawyer, right? INGRAHAM: Yeah. STRASSEL: But -- look I think the issue here is you've got to decide whether or not you believe CNN reporting. There has been a lot of breathless reporting out there that has turned out not to be correct. Then, even if it is correct, you have to decide if you believe Mr. Cohen now versus what as Andy said he might've said in the past. And whether or not there is any evidence, which apparently there is not in which case this may come down to a case of he said versus three other he says, saying the opposite. But I mean, what Andy said is true, it kind of looks icky, but the bigger point here is, is there a crime? MCCARTHY: Right.  STRASSEL: Because obviously it was not a crime for Trump, Jr. to meet with this Russian national and find out what she had to talk about. It's also not a crime for Mr. Trump to have had prior knowledge of it either. Mr. Trump Sr., the president. The question, has he ever under oath that he didn't know? Was he in any situation where he might be viewed as having lied to federal law enforcement? I'm not sure that's the case. It's another potentially bad headline if it's true, but I'm not necessarily sure it's any legal jeopardy. INGRAHAM: Andy, the Veselnitskaya woman was there to push the Magnitsky Act. She was trying to get him to push Congress on that Magnitsky Act because of Russian adoptions. I mean the whole thing, it has nothing to do with Hillary. So it was a big scam, a big play and -- sounds like they were played in that meeting. Jared was bored, I think he got up and walked out or Manafort walked out. And so it was a big nothing. If this is where they are now, Andy, on this level -- and we're going to get to the Twitter issue in a moment -- what does this tell you about the state of the Mueller investigation? MCCARTHY: It seems to me the Mueller investigation is winding down to a conclusion. That investigation or that indictment that they brought recently against the 12 Russians who are actually intelligence officers, I don't think that's the kind of thing you should indict. Putting that aside, if you read the indictment and the logic of it, it kind of excludes the possibility that there could have been the kind of espionage conspiracy that everybody was so whipped up about that caused the investigation to start in the first place and lead to Mueller's appointment. So if it is winding down, I sure hope it's winding down, because it seems like it ought to. INGRAHAM: Yeah, a report out today that Mueller is looking through the president's tweets. MCCARTHY: I mean who thought he wasn't? Who thought he wasn't? I have been looking at them too. Kim, have you been looking at them? I've been looking at them -- STRASSEL: I've been looking at them too. INGRAHAM: I gotta play this for you guys. Preet Bharara, of course, former U.S. attorney southern district, Preet Bharara was on CNN today with Wolf Blitzer and they were all excited about the tweet story. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: The tweets he sends late at night and early in the morning, and often out of anger, I think go some way to showing what is state of mind was and to prove obstruction -- WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: And I'm quoting Giuliani now -- \"If you're going to obstruct justice, you do it quietly and secretly, not out in public.\" What do you make of it? BHARARA: Well -- you know -- yes. What Rudy Giuliani says is the norm. This president likes to break norms and maybe he likes to violate the law in ways that break norms as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Kimberly? STRASSEL: The cheerleading here is extraordinary. But we have been witnessing this now for going on two years, and as I just said, headline after headline saying oh, definitely collusion. And then oh, obstruction of justice. And really it will only be a few weeks now. And look what Mueller is looking at this point. And nothing has come of it so far. Other than those indictments we've had related to charges that have nothing to do with either of those two central topics or anything that the press is actively pressing for. So I mean I agree with Andy. I would wish that if Mueller has decided that -- Trump is not a target, that he's not going down the road, that even if he is still wrapping up his probe, that he'd feel he had a duty to tell the country the president is no longer a target so people can start to move on. INGRAHAM: Andy, Turley said this is where they are looking over tweets, then this is like the dregs. Like this is -- I mean it's just ridiculous. I'm sorry. Now we are in tweets? And what -- you know, interviews? This is all public stuff. How are you obstructing an investigation with public comments? I don't -- I'm not following that. I guess it's possible, but I don't follow it. MCCARTHY: Well -- the whole thing is preposterous because with due respect to Preet, past state of mind or a criminal state of mind is irrelevant unless you've done something that can actually amount to obstruction. The president cannot obstruct justice by taking lawful actions that are within his constitutional prerogative, like pardoning people or firing Comey, or weighing in on whether somebody should be prosecuted which prosecutors across the country do that every day. INGRAHAM: Or complaining that Jeff Sessions didn't recuse himself. That's not obstructing justice. It's an opinion. It's craziness. MCCARTHY: Yeah, I understand the style problem. Like they don't like the way Trump goes about things. But you still have to kind of prove the thing that's a crime, before you start worrying about what somebody's state of mind was. INGRAHAM: Yeah, but a former U.S. Attorney in New York like Preet Bharara should know better. I mean, I know he is on CNN, but you've got to know you can't say that on television. All right, fantastic conversation, guys. Thank you so much. I want everyone to stay there because we have some big breaking news out of North Korea we're going to bring you in just a matter of moments. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Some breaking news out of North Korea. The White House saying a U.S. Air Force plane has now left North Korea containing the remains of fallen U.S. service members from the Korean War. Approximately 5,300 American soldiers' remains have not yet returned home from that war. It's an important, very positive first step as the U.S. and North Korea continue negotiations on denuclearization. And in other news, mad Maxine is at it again. She has moved on from calling for her acolytes to attack Trump officials wherever they are to now saying her opposition to all things Trump comes from a higher power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS\u2014CALIF.: We never dreamed we'd have someone in the White House who was so divisive, who could not tell the truth, and who was intent on not making America great again, but taking America down. And I know that I am here to do the work that I've been sent to do, and as the pastor said to me when I came in this morning, when God sends you to do something, you just do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Her own version of the crusades. This latest language comes after Judicial Watch filed an ethics complaint against her inciting violence against the Trump cabinet. Let's bring in that man behind the effort, Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. Tom, I know you have been all over this call to declassify these FISA documents as well, but now you're on onto the Maxine story. Is this kind of a publicity stunt for Judicial Watch or is this a real thing? TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: I saw her call on people to get a crowd together if you see a cabinet member of the Trump team, if they are at department stores or restaurants or a gas station, get a crowd together, push back and tell them they are not welcome. That is kind of inciting a riot. We filed this complaint. It's really easy to figure out whether or not comments like that reflect credibly on the House, which is the rule. And of course they won't do anything about it. There was another member said that maybe we should censure her. That has gone nowhere. INGRAHAM: How has that gone nowhere? Is it because she is kind of an icon to the left. She is protected in her own way and she is elderly, so you don't want to make her a bigger story, is that the reason no one wants to move on censuring her? She was, without saying it explicitly, she was saying get them. FITTON: I think it is fear-based decision-making by the Republican leadership. INGRAHAM: We want to hear the audio and then we want to hear what you have to say. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WATERS: People do want to see us be stronger and more forceful and to confront them on these policies. If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get up and you create a crowd, and you push back on them. (APPLAUSE) WATERS: They have got to absolutely harass them until they decide that they are going to tell the president no, I can't hang with you. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I like how the NBC anchors just sit there, they are like mannequins. They don't say anything. They're like, wait a second, congresswoman, are you -- there is no pushback by these people on these other networks. Imagine if a conservative said that about other people? FITTON: And harass public officials. But the House is going to let her use her position in the House to really attack people in inappropriate ways and incite violence. I think it is inciting violence and I would like the House to grapple with it. And as I said, it is fear-based decision-making by the house. INGRAHAM: You are being nice. They are wimps. They are wimpy. FITTON: They don't want to confront Maxine Waters. They don't want to confront Rod Rosenstein. INGRAHAM: They're afraid of this asylum ting. Now on this asylum issue, you have Congressman Yoder who threw Trump $5 billion for the wall and he wants to institutionalize DACA, codify DACA, and open up asylum to anyone who claims a criminal element in this country or her country, gang or domestic violence. How are we supposed to verify that? That was never asylum. It was racial or ethnic or religious or political persecution. And now it is if my country is too violent. FITTON: If you have a bad home life, you get asylum. INGRAHAM: But these are Republicans doing this because they are afraid of the emotional arguments. FITTON: The reason immigration is controversial here in Washington D.C. is because politicians want to do something none of the people want them to do. It's always going to be controversial. The voters have to be alerted and then they'll push back. INGRAHAM: Tom Fitton, thanks so much. And joining us now with more on this growing threat is former House oversight chairman Jason Chaffetz who has had many threats directed against him personally while he was in Congress. We are also joined by Democratic strategist and radio talk show host Garland Nixon. Great to see both of you. Jason, let's start with you. Things have gotten way out of hand. When we can't have a person walk into a restaurant wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat without being verbally assaulted, in some cases physically assaulted. If you support the president in a high school, you are called a racist, hater, xenophobe. So there is free speech but there is not free speech. And I think there are a lot of people who are just afraid. JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: And they should be. After the Gabby Giffords incident, after Steve Scalise was shot and almost killed, also other members that were targeted because they were Republicans, then you have House members on the Democratic side of the aisle basically, like Maxine Waters, inciting people to violence. This is the face of what the Democrats are putting up. It is the resistance movement. It's Antifa. It's targeted, it's aggressive, it's a scorched earth. And I have got to tell you, I was on the receiving end of lots of it. My family was subjected to things they should never be subjected to. Diane Black just in the last few days had somebody who was arrested for being aggressive against her. It's a very real threat and people are going to get hurt. INGRAHAM: Garland, this is one of the types of calls, and I know Democrats can hate stuff too. I'm not saying it's just Republicans. But since Trump, it has asked gotten worse. This is what Jason was subjected to. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I suggest you prepare for the battle mother -- and the apocalypse, because we're going to hunt your -- down, wrap a rope around your neck, and hang you from a lamppost, you worthless piece of dog -- (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's just -- Garland, your reaction to the climate we are living in right now. GARLAND NIXON: I think it's terrible. But it really isn't new. In fact, I had some friends for years that worked for John Conyers, and I was aware of some very nasty calls that he got on a regular basis. So this isn't new. But I disagree with it. But let's not have a short memory. Let's not forget that President Trump during the election was inciting people -- at his rallies -- INGRAHAM: That one comment? One comment. That's all you have is that one punch him in the face comment. NIXON: I am not here to defend anyone who is inciting violence because I disagree with it, but let's not try to pretend there is one party who has ever pushed this. INGRAHAM: Have you seen a concerted effort on the part of conservative activists to attack people in public places? Someone is eating with his or her child or family, just having a quiet dinner, and shouting at them, screaming, demanding and prattling on about all these points. That's just not right. NIXON: Right, and I absolutely agree. INGRAHAM: That is all left-wing resistance dingbat stuff. NIXON: I absolutely disagree with that because I'm a person, I am a King-esque person so I believe in nonviolence. But let's not forget with Michele Bachmann and the lock and load, this is not new. There has been dangerous rhetoric for many, many years, and hopefully both parties and both sides will learn to calm this down. It doesn't seem like that is happening. But I oppose it, and I think the people both sides of the aisle should step up to the plate and oppose this. INGRAHAM: Jason? CHAFFETZ: Those are nice words, but I don't see Democrats who actually will call out Maxine Waters. If I do it as a Republican, then I will get accused of just being a partisan. But when she does that, I don't see a Democrat who ever stands up and says, you know what, that's wrong. And through all the campaign, with all the Trump and the rhetoric, it's a different scenario and someone is heckling the president, the candidate then, in front of tens of thousands of people. It may not be excusable in your mind, but I went to Trump rallies out there. I've been with the NRA rallies, and you don't see this kind of stuff. And I don't see the Democrats stepping up and taking some ownership and saying, you know what folks, you have got to tone it down. NIXON: President Trump said to beat people up and he would pay the bills, and he would come there -- INGRAHAM: That was one time. It wasn't smart to say. It wasn't smart, but it was someone causing a huge ruckus just to get on camera, and it got the better of him in the moment. This was not a concerted effort by a candidate. CHAFFETZ: I had Debra Messing of all people called me out on Twitter saying that we should take him down. What does that mean? You want to take some people down. It's unbelievable the number of celebrities that will also engage in taking them down, using language. Look at the cover of the latest magazines. Cutting off Donald Trump's head and then mocking it with comedy. This is really aggressive stuff. INGRAHAM: Again, we can say this morning, noon, and night, but if conservatives spoke like they do on a regular basis, physically approached people like they do on a regular basis, they will be holding candlelight vigils. The left melt on stuff like this, but they can do it. Maxine Waters can say these things with complete and utter impunity. And we are supposed to say oh, it's just Maxine. It's ridiculous. If you are a Democrat, it's like Maxine, you are out of line. You are out of line. The passion may be out there but you are out of line. You sound like a complete buffoon. NIXON: I don't think it's with impunity because right now you're exercising your right to go after her. And I am saying -- INGRAHAM: Her colleagues. She is the toast of the town. She is all over Democrat politics, Garland. She is everywhere. Wasn't she at the Oscars? She was at the Grammys. The woman is like the cause celebrity in the Democratic Party. But we'll see if anything happens. But we hope nothing violent happens because that would be the real tragedy of all of this. Thank you so much to both of this. And coming up, the media on the left obsess over the so-called blue wave in the upcoming midterm, but they could be making a miscalculation of epic proportions. We will tell you why, up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The left is very giddy about the prospect of a blue wave in November, and they are devouring any little tidbit of information that helps confirm that narrative. Case in point, a new NBC/Marist poll indicating sagging approval for President Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. His critics couldn't get enough of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KING, CNN: Look at his approval rating in those states right now in these new NBC/Marist polls, 36 percent, 36 percent, 38 percent. That is bad news for Republicans. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC: Donald Trump is now getting crushed in polling in Michigan and Wisconsin, which is part of why he offered a partial surrender today in his chair for with Europe. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president has no coattails. You used the right word, devastating. They are in trouble right in the president's base. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But the Democrats could be in for a rude awakening come November. Joining us now, someone with a warning to those folks, Democratic pollster Mark Penn, along with Tom Bevan, the publisher of Real Clear Politics. Gentlemen, great to see you tonight. Mark, let's start with you. It's commonly thought that most pollsters were wrong before the last election. However, on the popular vote, they were pretty close, where they not, with Hillary Clinton, two percent, three percent. But they missed it in key states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, which is kind of the whole shooting match. But nevertheless, when I saw them going total frothy on the Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan deal, what do we think now? MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: In 2016, the only person to action call the Electoral College right was Kellyanne Conway who was left off the set as she correctly predicted it. So my point about these pools is, what happened in the election was the analysis was bad. And what I see now is the questions are bad. They are usually slanted, anti-Trump questions, so they don't see the narrative here, which this is a divided country. It's close. I think there is a blue edge, but it is way too early to say there's a blue wave. And you have to be very careful because these polls very rarely put the Trump messaging and for testing. They don't ask about sanctuary cities. They don't ask about using tariff as a wedge. They ask easy, layup questions designed to prove points they are making. INGRAHAM: Tom, the questions are things like, do you support ripping babies out of the arms of mothers after they have crossed the border? No one is going to say yes, I favor that. But if you asked the question this way, should people be able to cross our border illegally and then get various benefits for having done so, and they will say what? No, we don't want that. What of this and where are we right now? TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: I think Mark makes a great point in that it's the numbers, but it's also the framing. Let me just give you an example. The NBC News/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll that came out after the Helsinki summit and voters disapproved of that, and that was a headline. But the actual story, the real headline was that Trump's approval rating had reached an all-time high for his presidency, 45 percent. It had actually ticked up. And so the framing around that was all negative despite the fact there was good news for Trump in there. In the last week or two, the Democratic lead advantage in the generic ballot has ticked actually in favor of Republicans by about a point. But I also agree with Mark. The problem in 2016 was not the polls. It was the pundits. And you would've thought that if we, the journalists -- INGRAHAM: Don't look at me. BEVAN: Exactly -- had learned anything from 2016, it would be not to overinterpret, not to jump to conclusions. Again, there is still three months left before the election. And the other thing is that the economy is doing pretty well, and Trump gets good marks on the economy. Over 50 percent in most polls, job approval rating on the economy, and it's the number one issue for voters. INGRAHAM: That is still key. And by the way, everyone focuses, Mark, on the approval ratings if it's not over 50. It should be over 50. OK, fine. But he won the presidency with an approval rating of 36 percent. So could it be they are not wild about some of the stuff he does personally but they like the results he gets for the American worker? Could that be may be where we end up if he ends up having a positive effect in some of these races? PENN: His personal rating in the Harvard CAPS Harris poll we are just coming out with is 41. His approval on the economy and terrorism is around 55. And so, are voters going to focus on what's going on with the economy or on what he does personally? That has always been the big question on Trump. Clearly on Election Day they focused a lot more on the issues. We don't know what's going to happen this time. That's what makes it so fascinating. That's why pundits have to be careful. When you look at these high approval ratings on the core issues, that means the president has got to be doing something right. There is a storyline here that you've got to see, because if you miss it and you are a Democrat, boy, you will miss the whole election again. INGRAHAM: Tom, I was talking to Hannity about this right before the election when we were both predicting Trump was going to win, and then right after the election. And we both said thank goodness we host radio shows, because we hear this stuff day after day after day. People say they are all conservatives listening. No, they are not. It's a really interesting cross-section of the country. I know liberals will laugh if they are watching this. Listen and then you will learn every now and then. Just listen. But people were saying we don't care about this Billy Bush tape. We don't care about Stormy Daniels. We don't care about -- they thought he might be kind of a bully but he is our bully. And we are tired of being bullied by the experts and the consultants and the corrupt class. He's going to fight for us. That's what they were telling us on the radio. And still to this day they are saying that. Now, maybe it won't add up to much in November. I don't know. But I can tell you, I do a daily focus group. And my listening audience, they are not listening to this. They don't care about this Mueller stuff. They don't care about any of this Cohen tape. They are like let's move on to the next topic. Let's talk about immigration. Tom, close it out. BEVAN: That's exactly right. Another interesting statistic. In 2016, Donald Trump got 90 percent of Republican votes on Election Day. His approval rating in that \"Wall Street Journal\" poll is 88 percent. On Election Day, he only got nine percent of Democrats, and nine percent of Democrats give him a favorable job approval rating. So we have been in a state of suspended political animation since the campaign. Despite all the controversy that surrounds the president, partisans on the other side have not budged. There's been some wiggle room by independents in the middle, and that might actually be what it comes down to on Election Day in November. INGRAHAM: Guys, thanks so much. And coming up, Demi Lovato's overdose exposing another tragic cold truth of celebrity life. We'll explain after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The overdose of music superstar Demi Lovato is casting another harsh spotlight on the false allure and the dangers of celebrity. TMZ reporting tonight that Lovato recently surrounded herself with a new group of so-called friends. And on Tuesday night, they decided to go on a binger. The group apparently knew things could get bad with Lovato. TMZ saying they had an emergency medication called Narcan on hand. It is used to revive someone after overdosing. But this story follows an all-too-familiar pattern. Let's face it, incredibly talented people surrounding themselves with hangers on and enablers. And often this ends in tragedy. Joining is not analyze is counselor, drug counselor Sonya Veytsman. Sonya, we have had so many instances of people with immense talent who weren't found alive. From Belushi to of course Prince and the list goes on and on and on going back decades and decades. And now this. What is your take? SONYA VEYTSMAN, CELEBRITY DRUG COUNSELOR: There's a misconception that fame or wealth can serve as a buffer against vulnerability for a mental illness or addiction, and it doesn't. So psychologists have come up with a hypothesis called diathesis stress model which sort of explains why certain vulnerabilities emerge. And it talks about genetic predisposition combined with any sort of environmental stress, and when it reaches a combination, it reaches a certain threshold, then mental illness or addiction can emerge. And in this specific case of Demi, she from what I know has been pretty vocal about her father having history of substance abuse. INGRAHAM: But Sonya, I've got to ask about this. You counsel people who have drug problems. When you have a drug problem, and she has been very vocal about her own problems. She said -- talked about her problems going back to 19 years of age. I was going to an airport. I had a spray bottle filled with vodka. It was just 9:00 in the morning. She said she was throwing up in her car. She said she was about to get on a plane to L.A. to the sober living house she was staying at. And then she said I had all the help in the world but I didn't want it. Then the story of course about her friends out there partying with her with the Narcan. They know that she is vulnerable. And presumably they are not totally dumb people, though they sound pretty dumb. They know she could end up dead. And this is who she is hanging out with. I don't know, her family has tried to intervene unsuccessfully. But who are these friends? Who are they? VEYTSMAN: Part of managing drug addiction is certainly avoiding triggers. So that people that abuse and people that would be a bad influence are people that are also under the influence of some sort of substance and don't have good judgment. A big part of addiction is ambivalence. So the new models of treatment really try to address that, things like harm reduction and motivational interviewing, which looks to basically help people reconcile or address or resolve some of that ambivalence. So whenever someone is abusing drugs, typically there is a lot of conflict within them about continuing the drug use or whatever substance, and -- INGRAHAM: I've got to say I don't really understand. I am trying to follow what you are saying on that, but drug ambivalence? She has an addiction problem. Here's ambivalence. There shouldn't be any, OK. VEYTSMAN: It's not that simple. INGRAHAM: I know, nothing is that simple. But if you are an addict, the number one thing you have to do is what? This is your line of work. You have to not be with people who enable you, correct? VEYTSMAN: Right, but then there is something called secondary gain which talks about the benefit of using or doing something. So anyone that is abusing is actually gaining a benefit from it, and the benefit might be escape, it might be numbing the pain. That's probably the reason that striving them to do it. So sometimes that driver dependence outweighs their desire to change. And so that's why relapse is so common. INGRAHAM: So what are the chances of relapse? We are almost out of time. If you go sober, relapse, chances, what percentage? VEYTSMAN: They're very high. It's a very high likelihood. Counselors prepare are usually their patients for the likelihood of relapse. INGRAHAM: Sonya, thank you so much. Sad situation. We certainly wish her and her family the best. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: I want to say thank you to this president, Donald Trump, getting some of our war dead at least back from the Korean War tonight. People thought it wasn't going to be possible. Well, it's happening, and it wouldn't have happened without his leadership. My surrogate dad Chuck Carlson served in the Korean War, and I know he's watching tonight. We want to always honor your troops. We think of you every day. Thank you for your service to this country.

            "article_content": "TIJUANA, Mexico \u2013 The caravan of largely Central American migrants waiting to request asylum at the U.S. border is bigger and far more visible than in previous years. Here's a look at why this year's caravan had more attention and more participants. ___ WHAT IS THE CARAVAN? Caravans have been a fairly common tactic for advocacy groups to bring attention to asylum-seekers. The latest group pales in size compared to previous border surges, but it gained huge visibility when President Donald Trump unleashed strong criticism after it began on March 25 in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border. The caravan drew as many as 1,000 people as Trump and top aides portrayed it as a significant threat and evidence of a dysfunctional border. Over 100 Central Americans are now attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. The largest single group of migrants in the caravan is from Honduras, although there are also many Guatemalans and Salvadorans. In Honduras, political protests broke out after a disputed November election in which President Juan Orlando Hernandez won a new term and his opponent alleged fraud. At least 17 people died as police cracked down on protesters, and some caravan members are opponents of the president. ___ WHY ARE ASYLUM-SEEKERS COMING? Violence in Central America continues to cause people to flee, despite falling homicide rates. Murders in Honduras and El Salvador fell by about 25 percent in 2017, but both are still among the most violent countries in the world. Street gangs known as \"maras\" are also ubiquitous and prey on small business owners and families through extortion. Many migrants this year said they joined the caravan because they felt there was safety in numbers while they traveled along the route from Mexico to the U.S. border. There is significant violence perpetrated by gangs who prey on migrants on the final leg north. ___ STAYING BEHIND Some Central Americans are requesting asylum or humanitarian visas in Mexico, but more than half of those who filed asylum requests in Mexico in 2017 have not received an answer. Mexico says its application procedure was slowed down by damage to its offices caused by the Sept. 19 earthquake. It has temporarily suspended the 45-working-day deadline for ruling on applications, which may have led some migrants to look for refuge in the United States. ___ IN THE HEADLINES President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have been tracking the caravan, calling it a threat to the U.S. since it started. Trump has cited the caravan as justification for the border wall he wants to build and said he ordered the Homeland Security Department to \"stop the caravan.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it \"a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system,\" pledging to send more immigration judges to the border to resolve cases if needed. But comments urging Mexico not to allow the caravan to reach the U.S. border may have given the group more publicity than it has had in the past and inspired the migrants to continue on. ___ WHAT'S NEXT? The Caravan members are slowly beginning to enter a U.S. facility at San Diego's San Ysidro border crossing, with eight entering Monday and six more Tuesday. About 120 others are still waiting for initial screenings by U.S. asylum officers, after which they may be deported if their claims are rejected. They could also be detained or released with ankle monitors while their cases wind through immigration court, which can take years.",

            "article_content": "President Trump doubled down on his assertion that there are Middle Easterners and possible terrorists among the migrants in the caravan. John Roberts reports for 'Special Report.' President Trump is considering a sweeping executive order that would block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the U.S.\u00a0at the southern border\u00a0in a bid to stop the caravan traveling north through Mexico. The White House, if it goes ahead with the measure, would issue new regulations restricting certain migrants\u00a0from seeking asylum. The rules would\u00a0effectively block most if not all the migrants who are taking part in the caravan, Politico\u00a0first reported. Fox News has learned the proposal originated out of the White House and is one of several being considered. No final decision has been made. \u201cThe Administration is considering a wide range\u00a0of\u00a0administrative, legal and legislative options to address the Democrat-created crisis of mass illegal immigration.\u00a0No decisions have been made at this time.\u00a0Nor will we forecast to smugglers or caravans what precise strategies will or will not be deployed,\u201d a White House official said. The order would be akin to Trump's previous aggressive immigration-blocking executive orders, such as the travel ban aimed at halting people from some Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. Any attempt to block the entry of Central American migrants is likely to prompt legal challenges, though Trump is likely emboldened following a Supreme Court ruling earlier this summer that affirmed the president\u2019s right to bar the entry of migrants who \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d The plan for the executive order comes just in the final stretch before the upcoming midterm elections, with Trump trying to make the issue of caravan the defining topic as voters head to the polls. \"Every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws!\" Trump wrote in a tweet Monday. \"Remember the midterms!\" Hundreds of U.S. troops are also set to make their way to the southern border to help Homeland Security and the National Guard\u00a0as the caravan pushes north. An official told Fox News on Thursday roughly 800 soldiers will be sent to the area to offer \u201clogistical support,\" including providing tents and vehicles. It\u2019s not immediately clear which units are being tasked with the mission as details are still being finalized. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops on the southern border assisting Homeland Security. Democrats, while previously outspoken regarding Trump\u2019s immigration policies, are staying largely silent on the issue, instead preferring to remain focused on tackling the GOP on issues like health care, saying it\u2019s the winning issue this election cycle. DEMOCRATS AVOID SPARRING WITH TRUMP ON CARAVAN AS MIDTERM NEARS Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the country, slammed Trump in a statement earlier this week regarding the caravan of migrants, saying the president is \u201cdesperate\u201d to change the conversation because \u201chealth care is the number one issue Americans care about.\u201d According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last week, which surveyed people since the beginning of the caravan earlier this month, the issue of immigration isn\u2019t the top concern for voters. It ranks below health care, which has consistently been viewed as the most important issue. Other key issues have been the economy, jobs and policies concerning gun rights.

HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: On \"Media Buzz\" this Sunday, with two days until the election to decide who controls Congress, it has come to this. The president and the mainstream media accusing each other of fomenting violence. This as the press pounds Donald Trump over his vowed to end birthright citizenship with an executive order and his dire warnings about the migrant caravan in Mexico.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: You see it in Donald Trump saying he's going to circumvent the constitution with an executive order. He can't do that. It's not about anything other than scaring Americans and actually appealing to their most racist, base instincts.\u00a0\nTUCKER CARLSON, CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS: Trump's proposal will get us closer to the purpose of the 14th Amendment. And for that, he is being denounced naturally as racist.\u00a0\nRACHEL MADDOW, HOST, MSNBC: A disease-ridden foreign invasion secretly organized by a Jew, to the extent that is the get out the vote program for the elections this year, for Republican candidates this year, courtesy of the White House and conservative media.\u00a0\nLAURA INGRAHAM, TALK SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: His warning of an approaching horde of non-citizens, one organized by outside political forces is not messaging hate. It is standing up for America's sovereignty.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Are the media demonizing President Trump over race and immigration or is it the other way around? Plus, in the wake of those terrible terror attacks, that acrimony between the White House and the press turning even more caustic in the run-up to Tuesday's elections.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He says he's trying to unite the country. Why is he out there --\u00a0\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The very first thing that the president did was condemn the attacks both in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs. The very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: In this hyperpolarized environment, who's really stoking fear in America? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"\u00a0\nAfter a week of violence and white-hot rhetoric especially around immigration, a new Washington Post/ABC poll finds that roughly half of registered voters surveyed, 49 percent say President Trump and the way he speaks is encouraging politically-motivated violence. Nineteen percent disagree.\u00a0\nBut wait, in that same survey, about half of those questioned, 47 percent say the media are encouraging political violence with the way they report the news. About 15 percent disagree. ABC correspondent Karen Travers asked the president about the poll Friday, but only cited half the result.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKAREN TRAVERS, CORRESPONDENT, ABC (voice over): A new poll found that half of Americans say you're encouraging politically motivated violence with the way you speak.\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: No, no. You know what? You're creating violence by your question.\u00a0\nTRAVERS: Me?\u00a0\nTRUMP: You are creating -- you. And also, a lot of the reporters are creating violence by not writing the truth. The fake news is creating violence.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent for The Washington Examiner; and Capri Cafaro, former Democratic state senator of Ohio who teaches at American University.\u00a0\nMollie, I understand the difficulty of shouting a question with Marine One in the background, but didn't that sort of symbolize the media's tendency to blame Trump and avert their collective eyes from their own role in this?\u00a0\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Yes, although I just want to point out that President Trump was wrong to blame the media for violence. We have witnessed weeks if not years of the media blaming Trump for violence that he has nothing to do with. It's also --\u00a0\nKURTZ: He pointed a finger at you. You are responsible.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: Yeah, and it would be nice if we could separate out two conversations. One, what type of rhetoric are we using? How are we having - - what type of conversations we are having? And secondly, who is responsible for the violence they commit? We need to make sure people are held responsible for their own violence.\u00a0\nAt the same time, there's room for improvement across multiple areas. There is room for improvement how Donald Trump talks about things. There is a lot of room for improvement how the media covers all sorts of topics.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah, and I don't see much focus on the second half of that and most of the headlines from The Washington Post poll were Trump blames the media which is true, but half the story. He says, no, you and the press, you're spreading hate, you're spreading anger, you're dividing the country. We now know based on the survey that half the country agrees.\u00a0\nCAPRI CAFARO, FORMER OHIO SENATE MINORITY LEADER, CONTRIBUTOR, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: To Mollie's point, I think that one thing is clear, that there's enough blame to go around between the president and his rhetoric and how he conducts himself.\u00a0\nBut at the same time, certainly the American people see the media playing an equal amount of role to at least dividing the country. Whether or not I agree that there are two separate issues here, one is about violence and one is about division --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. The people who pull triggers are the ones ultimately responsible.\u00a0\nCAFARO: Right, of course, but here's the other thing though. The American -- and I think this what shows -- the American public has lost trust in its institutions, whether it's government or whether it's media, equally our distrust. And the media is -- I always look at headlines because headlines bring in the readers.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah.\u00a0\nCAFARO: And for example, the hill and The Washington Post say that Americans share the blame between the two. Now, ABC, for example, said half of America blames Trump. So, words do matter and in an editorial process.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And so do omissions. Susan, why do so few journalists examine whether their business which of course thrives on conflict, thrives on partisanship are contributing to anger and divisiveness in this country? Is this poll kind of a wake-up call?\u00a0\nSUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: I think the press never likes to admit it's -- whether it's complicit in all this, they don't like to look inward. They say, we correct our mistakes, we are never really to blame. That's a problem.\u00a0\nThe media does need to take a closer look at its own fairness, at its own bias. And that hasn't happened at all with President Trump and it didn't happen with President Obama. That's an absolutely legitimate complaint.\u00a0\nKURTZ: On this question of birthright citizenship, the president told Axios that the policy is ridiculous and he could change it with an executive order and doesn't necessarily need Congress or a necessarily need a constitutional amendment.\u00a0\nDid he get the media freak out he wanted knowing fully well saying I can just sign a piece of paper would cause the press to make this a big issue and he wanted it to be made a big issue?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: He wanted to highlight birthright citizenship as an issue and the media complied and made it a big issue. I was really disappointed with how they covered this. They treated it as a foregone conclusion that the law is clear, the birthright citizenship is granted, not to people who are in the country legally for their children --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: -- but for people who are in the country illegally. The idea that that's a settled constitutional question is highly debatable. There are good arguments for first looking at various court opinions that say that that is settled. There are a ton of arguments that say that that is not settled. It really hasn't been taken up by the court very much.\u00a0\nSo to treat this as if he's saying I'm going to overturn the constitution, we haven't seen an executive order. It depends on what the executive orders says.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. Now, a few Republicans, Susan, including Paul Ryan who is leaving anyway said, no, Trump can't do that, it's unconstitutional. But the uproar, of course Democrats opposing it, fueled in part by the media since this is hardly imminent. We don't even have the order yet. Did the press take the midterm bait?\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: This could end up before the Supreme Court too.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. But talking about the coverage now because --\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: That's right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: -- we have this thing coming up on Tuesday as you --\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: And it's another way to argue that the president is racist, that the president is afraid of immigrants coming in to our country which was based on immigration. Of course, it's all part of the sort of narrative that this is a president who is outside the mainstream and that has been part of the argument he's made against the media.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Sorry, Capri, I didn't see the media going nuts when Barack Obama signed an executive order that changed --\u00a0\nCAFARO: The DACA.\u00a0\nKURTZ: -- essentially saying the process for millions of dreamers --\u00a0\nCAFARO: Right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: -- as they're called. People on the right said it's an abuse of presidential authority and now it's kind of flipped.\u00a0\nCAFARO: Right, except for the fact that, you know, I think that this is more a delineated issue directly related to the 14th Amendment. I agree there are all kinds of issues that we can go around as far as the intent of the 14th Amendment and all the rest of this.\u00a0\nI think that there are two sort of parallel things happening here. One is the media coverage which I think has been focused on the issue of whether or not the president can do this with an executive order with the subtext of President Trump doesn't understand how government works.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Ah-ha.\u00a0\nCAFARO: And then you have Democrats and progressives within the campaign context saying, this is a dog whistle. So I think there are two separate things happening, both kind of playing into an anti-Trump message.\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: What's missing too is if you really look at what's happening in this country with birth tourism, there are whole aspects of this that the media could really get into and educate the public about. What is behind the president's motivation here? This very little understanding and very little reporting about that.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: And if you look at 2016, if there was one lesson to take, it was that people really care about the lack of border enforcement, lack of concern about national sovereignty. And instead, the media treated anyone who cared about those things as illegitimate and racist. It is a really good way to decline your credibility among people when you keep calling people that when they have completely legitimate reasons to be concerned about border security enforcement and national sovereignty.\u00a0\nKURTZ: My judgement is the press took the bait on this. It is a trap sort of laid by the president. Now on the caravan, Washington Post headline, \"For Trump and GOP, subtle racial rhetoric is out, over rallying of white support is in.\" So, look, the president has clearly driven daily coverage of caravan. He sent 5,000 troops to the border. He then says there will be 10,000-15,000.\u00a0\nGiven the title wave of media criticism over the president's handling of this issue, are journalists again helping the president to highlight what is his closing argument in this election?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: They do. I actually think that's one of the big lessons, that the media and the president are in a codependent relationship and they both get out of this. What they want -- the media gets clicks and President Trump gets to highlight an issue that was very key to him winning in 2016 and that is key again to remind people why it might be important to vote for Republicans.\u00a0\nKURTZ: So they need therapy. They need therapy. Co-dependent.\u00a0\nCAFARO: I think Democrats would argue potentially the opposite that, you know, highlighting this more divisive, you know, conversation surrounding, you know, the migrant caravan and dividing the nation. Again, all of those subtexts might actually help drive Democratic turnout. But --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Let me ask you this. On Friday, there was this absolute blowout jobs report. The economy is --\u00a0\nCAFARO: Right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: -- doing really well and wages are even up. The president says it's not that exciting to talk about the economy. But even if you think that the whole issue of this, it is now about 4,000 potential asylum-seekers, is overblown, how do these organizations not cover it?\u00a0\nCAFARO: They have to. I think one of the things that is really interesting about how this issue has been covered by the press is not necessarily what's been said but what hasn't been said. Images speak louder than words.\u00a0\nYou have a lot of media outlets from PBS, you know, all the way to, you know, some of the more mainstream outlets like NBC and ABC showing these images and highlighting the humanitarian crisis of children and hunger and heat and, you know, the problems that these folks are having between here and there, why they're fleeing supposedly.\u00a0\nSo, I think that the fact that those issues are being highlighted trying to create humanity around this issue, again, is creating a silent and juxtaposition of President Trump being mean about this issue.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Last night, Susan, \"Saturday Night Live\" mocked Fox News where it is supposedly scary coverage of the caravan. So, is there a partisan split here where critics say Fox News overplays the story of the caravan and MSNBC and CNN play up the dangers of Trump and the way he's treating the caravan and immigration generally?\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: No, absolutely. It's OK. I think \"Saturday Night Live\" is a place here to bring levity to the situation. But, you know, it's also missing in the coverage too, just the impact. We talk about the humanitarian issue which is very important. When they get here, really what happens and what's the impact on communities?\u00a0\nAnd then there's little local coverage about the impact on school systems, on neighborhoods, on how they have to absorb the cost and the difficulty of new immigration that's not regulated.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. Of course, all of that will happen after next Tuesday. And speaking of next Tuesday, let's put this up on the screen. HBO is complaining that the president is using the style and the typeface of Game of Thrones.\u00a0\nHe tweeted this picture of himself. Sanctions are coming, it says, November 5th, like it's a coming attraction of a television show. November 5th, I guess that would be the day before the election.\u00a0\nAll right. When we come back, the war between the president the press is really getting uglier in the run-up to Tuesday's election. And later, Frank Luntz. He says his focus groups show that voters -- he says he has never seen this before -- are really, really angry.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: President Trump is back to calling the fake news media the true enemy of the people, prompting a major push back from the press as we see here in an interview with Axios.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nJIM VANDEHEI, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, AXIOS: You are, like, the most powerful man in the world. And if you say that word - enemy, enemy - literally, tens of thousands of people go into a stadium to listen to you, and then people go on social media, and they get themselves so jazzed up. There's got to be part of you that's like, I'm scared that someone is going to take it too far.\u00a0\nTRUMP: It's my only form of fighting back. I couldn't be here if I do that.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You won. You have the presidency.\u00a0\nTRUMP: No, no, no. But I did this before I won.\u00a0\nAINSLEY EARHARDT, HOST, FOX NEWS: If you don't want to be called the enemy, then get the story right, be accurate and report the story the way that I want it reported.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: That was Axios's Jim VandeHei asking those questions. So, we're back to now arguing about enemy of the American people and even after the horrifying Pittsburgh synagogue slaughter, we are back to the press pounding away the idea that Donald Trump is somehow to blame because he inspires lunatics.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: That was actually a great example of how the media lacks any self- introspection after spending years of calling Trump Stalin and Hitler and bigot and racist, the threat to the entire planet. They say, how can you call us the enemy of the people? Well, this is rhetoric that people have been witnessing for many years. I think the media need to look --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Do you justify the rhetoric? Do you agree with it?\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: No. In fact, I previously said I think it's wrong for both people to do it, but there needs to be some introspection about the role that the media play. And also, they seem to think that people don't like the media because Donald Trump is calling them these things. No, Donald Trump is calling them these things because people spent so many decades frustrated with the media's performance.\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: I agree with that. I agree with that, but I also think, you know, enemy of the people is -- I don't like the term. I'm a member of the media but --\u00a0\nKURTZ: No, it suggests a kind of traitorous situation. I know some people hate the media and believe that. And yes, it's all in the fake media, but he says 80 percent of the media is fake. Look, Susan, he went to Pittsburgh this week to pay his respects after the awful synagogue slaughter.\u00a0\nYes, the Democratic mayor did ask him to wait because of police resources, but the coverage was that the president brings out more division in the grieving city.\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: The coverage was about all the people who didn't want him there and very little coverage about the people who did want him there and do appreciate him there. The entire story was framed, Trump visits Pittsburgh even though nobody wants him there.\u00a0\nI mean, that's just how twisted and backwards the coverage is of the president. That interviewed you just played was really interesting where he said, look, I wouldn't be here if I didn't do this. I have to say I agree with him on that.\u00a0\nPeople have long blamed Republican candidates from just not going -- pushing back hard against the the media that many believe have long been biased and favor Democratic candidates. President Trump hit back really hard. People think that that is really what got him in the White House.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. And then Trump -- and then Trump says, well, this coverage yesterday, there were riots in Pittsburgh. Well, there weren't any riots and there wasn't any coverage suggesting it. Let me play for you, we talked last week about a Washington Post headline in the wake of the arrest of the serial pipe bomber. Here's the president pushing back on that.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: Bernie Sanders had a fan who shot a very good friend of ours, Steve Scalise, and other people. He was a total maniac. Nobody puts his name in the headline. I was in the headline of The Washington Post. My name associated with this crazy bomber. Trump bomber or something. But I was in the headline when they got him.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Even if you believe President Trump's rhetoric is divisive, how can the press blame him for the bomber and the Pittsburgh massacre by a guy allegedly who despise Jews his whole life?\u00a0\nCAFARO: Right. Well, again, this is an issue of separating with individuals that obviously have mental derangement that need to be held accountable for their own actions and incendiary language. I think that the difference between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump -- one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders hadn't been mentioned necessarily in connection is because he wasn't having some of those incendiary words at his rallies in the same way that I think have been perceived --\u00a0\nHEMINGRWAY: But that's entirely a question of how the media treat these things. In fact, Bernie Sanders is someone who inspires a lot of people. He is not responsible for the violence committed --\u00a0\nCAFARO: I agree, but --\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: -- but the idea that --\u00a0\nCAFARO: -- I'm not necessarily saying that Trump, like, is responsible for the violence either, but I think that there -- you could probably give a laundry list of more --\u00a0\nKURTZ: But if the press, oh, this crazy person with a bomb or a gun was a fan of Bernie Sanders, a fan of Donald Trump, then it's the press, you're right, it's the press that then makes that link.\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: Right, but you have to report that. Look, you're a reporter out there. You see the picture of the van and you cannot say, look, there's Hillary --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Oh, it's part of the story.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: It's part of the story. You see those same pictures on the Facebook page of the guy who shot Scalise and tried to kill dozen other people --\u00a0\nFERRECHIO: Oh, people do report --\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: -- and that's not covered.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I got to go.\u00a0\nHEMINGWAY: It's click-bait. It's all click-bait.\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. I think we kind of came to an agreement there. Capri Cafaro, Susan Ferrechio, and Mollie Hemingway, thanks very much for joining us. Ahead, CNN's Don Lemon says the biggest threat in the country comes from white men. Up next, the reporter who says Donald Trump is more dangerous than ISIS. We blow the whistle on misleading video that includes some familiar faces.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Sometimes pundits just go too far, way too far in making wild accusations. Julia Ioffe, a GQ correspondent who had worked for The Atlantic and Politico, took to Twitter after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and blamed it on President Trump. Then, she went on Jake Tapper's CNN show and said this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nJULIA IOFFE, CORRESPONDENT, GQ: And this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did. I mean, the way he talks, the way he -- the way he --\u00a0\nDAVID URBAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That is -- that's just -- it's unconscionable for you to say that.\u00a0\nIOFFE: The way he talks -- ISIS has like 10,000 members. I think the president has far more supporters who espouse an equally hateful ideology.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Julia --\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Worse than ISIS, a brutal terrorist movement, are you blanking kidding me? Well, later in the program, after the RNC attacked Ioffe, Tapper gave her a chance to clarify her remarks.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nIOFFE: This has been a very emotional and personally painful time for me. I think I exaggerated and I apologize for that.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: I give her some credit for apologizing but she never should have made such a reckless charge. Fox Business Network took flack this week for comments by a conservative guest.\u00a0\nChris Farrell, the director of Investigations for Judicial Watch, was on Lou Dobbs Tonight when he spoke of criminal involvement in that caravan of Central American migrants which he called a leftist mob, and said this about big-time Democratic donor, George Soros.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nCHRIS FARRELL, DIRECTOR, INVESTIGATIONS FOR JUDICIAL WATCH: A lot of these folks also have affiliates who are getting money from the Soros-occupied State Department, and that is of very great concern. If we're going to start cutting money, start cutting money there.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Soros, who is Jewish, was one of the recipients of a pipe bomb mailed to his home, as you recall, and criticism on the left heated up when that episode of the Dobb show re-aired a week ago Saturday night, hours after 11 Jews were killed in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.\u00a0\nGary Schreier, senior vice president at FBN, said in a statement, \"we condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight. This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings.\" And he said the guest will not be invited back. Judicial Watch has since put out a release a Soros group helping to fund a State Department open government partnership in Romania.\u00a0\nThis is really ticking me off. There's a video out there that is generating a lot of buzz online. Donald Trump Jr. is one of those who has re-tweeted it, showing a bunch of big male pundits just flatly writing off his father's presidency.\u00a0\nAnd the underlying theme is true. I have repeatedly criticized commentators for doing that going back to the early months of Donald Trump's tenure. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nBRIAN WILLIAMS, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Donald Trump is done. He is done. There is no question about that. He is done.\u00a0\nLAWRENCE O'DONNELL, HOST, MSNBC: The beginning of the end for the Trump presidency. I believe this is beginning of the end.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): I do, too.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's really the beginning of the end.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): The beginning of the end.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u00a0\nKURTZ (on camera): The beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Hold on, wait a minute, what on earth am I doing in there? Well, I got suspicious and I did a little digging. Here's what I actually said last year while interviewing a top editor at Breitbart after Steve Bannon parted company with the president.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ (on camera): Now, one of your editors wrote this week that Bannon leaving the White House could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency but the impact of one person leaving isn't really that great.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: I was quoting someone else in an interview. My view was 180 degrees opposite. That was a complete and total distortion. By the way, that lead off soundbite from Brian Williams, well, here's what the MSNBC anchor actually said while interviewing former Congressman David Jolly.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nWILLIAMS: We looked up a quote from you the day Mueller was appointed. You were on the air with us, and you said, Donald Trump is done. He is done. There is no question about that. He is done.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: So Brian Williams was also quoting someone else who's behind this twisted video and entertainment of it called super deluxe which was part of Turner entertainment, part of CNN's parent company until the takeover by AT&T, and which coincidentally was shut down one day after posting that video, a video that was utterly intellectually dishonest.\u00a0\nNext on Media Buzz, Don Lemon under fire for saying white men on the right are the greatest threat to public safety. And later, Jon Stewart on how Donald Trump is outmaneuvering the press. He kind of nails it.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ, ANCHOR: CNN's Don Lemon is drawing all kinds of flak for saying that the primary danger to America is not from migrants moving toward the border. Here's what he said.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN HOST: We have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men. Most of them radicalized up to the right. And we have to start doing something about them. There is travel ban on them.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Joining us now, two veteran political warriors, David Bossie, the former Trump deputy campaign manager, president of Citizens United, a Fox News contributor. And he's also the co-author with Corey Lewandowski of the forthcoming book, Trump's Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining his Presidency. And Philippe Reines -- excuse me, a former State Department official and Hillary Clinton confidant.\u00a0\nBossie, we'll start with you. Don Lemon, he has doubled down with those remarks. CNN had no commented. What you make of him saying the main problem is not just white men, but white conservative men?\u00a0\nDAVID BOSSIE, FORMER TRUMP DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, first of all, I think he's desperate for attention. I take this as somebody's whose ratings, this is just a ratings ploy, to me, as a failing anchor, failing network. Somebody who just wants to say the most outlandish thing he can to try to gain attention to himself. This is nothing more than about himself.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I don't think, Philippe, that Don Lemon was trying to point the finger at all white men are all white male conservatives, but I found it jarring just like when people say the problem in this country is black people.\u00a0\nPHILIPPE REINES, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: You know, I'm a CNN watcher. So, over the last couple weeks, they've been very shaken about the pipe bombs they received, Don in particular. I think they look at that, first of all, that was a white male who was a Trump supporter. They're looking at a white male who shot up a synagogue.\u00a0\nAnd overall, it tends to be white males. Now, whether I will put that up there, I have a hard time agreeing with Don Lemon on that kind of thing.\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Let me play you another comment. This is from Karen Attiah. She is the Global Opinions Editor at the Washington Post. And she had this to say about the whole debate, about is the president and Republican Party responsible for some of this recent violence.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKAREN ATTIAH, WASHINGTON POST: This is a matter of people dying over the climate that's been created by not only the White House, being condoned by people like Steve King and even Lindsey Graham. But that people are dying, people are literally dying over this.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: People are dying because of Donald Trump and the Republican Party without any sort of qualification there.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: First of all, once again, these are folks who aren't acting responsibly and trying to ratchet down this heated rhetoric. All of us have a responsibility to try and take all of these things seriously. I blame everyone equally. Look, the media -- the mainstream media in this country, it never -- along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and the left-wing smear machine, never accepted Donald Trump's victory. Not for one second.\u00a0\nAnd they had spent the last two years demonizing this president at every turn. Not allowing anything that he says or does to be spoken truthfully. And that's why this president has changed the dynamic and said, the media - - and he has broken the media. I believe he has broken them for the better, because they're going to have to be more honest. And they're going to have to learn to be more honest with the American people instead of showing their bias, every single day.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Philippe.\u00a0\nREINES: Well, I think to the extent that critics are demonizing him, they're demonizing a demon. Yes, everyone bears responsibility. The president of the United States bears a higher responsibility and he has a higher opportunity to ratchet this down, but what he has actually done is that instead of unleashed betrayal or hate (ph), he has approved it by tolerating it. And I think, we've had...\u00a0\nKURTZ: You use the word unleashed.\u00a0\nREINES: Yeah.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And by the way, I hate this blood on the hand's argument. I think the perpetrator is responsible.\u00a0\nREINES: Of course, they are.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I'm sure you remember when some on the right blamed President Obama when police officers would get killed and he said it was his rhetoric about law enforcement. So you really want to say unleashed?\u00a0\nREINES: I do want to say unleashed because he has made it OK. I would say two things. We've had two violent episodes in the last couple weeks. I would never in a million years say and I haven't said that what happened in Pittsburgh has anything to do with Donald Trump. I just wouldn't say it.\u00a0\nBut it is folly to say that someone sending 13 pipe bombs to 13 people that Donald Trump recites every chance he gets isn't tied to Donald Trump beyond that. Even if you want to cut him a break and give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's not responsible, he is responsible for saying everybody tone it down, starting with myself. He doesn't take responsibility, but he has a unique voice.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I got to move on.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: Well, I think you are exactly right. Barack -- the right, throughout eight years...\u00a0\nREINES: Probably wasn't exactly right.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: But we, as conservatives, did not stand up every day and point the finger at Barack Obama when police officers were being attacked and shot across this country in numbers like we've never seen.\u00a0\nREINES: I don't think that's true. The beer summit (ph) were full of people saying...\u00a0\nBOSSIE: Come on, that's not serious.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Let me move on because something else that's really made news in the last couple of days is Michael Cohen, a long time personal attorney of President Trump is being sentenced for the crimes that he pleaded guilty to next month. He told Vanity Fair in an on-the-record interview that Donald Trump when he knew him in private made racist comments.\u00a0\nAnd one of them was that after a rally in which Michael Cohen says he told then businessman Donald Trump in a kind of a meeting of mostly white people. He said he responded because black people are too stupid to vote for me. Is that damaging coming from Michael Cohen?\u00a0\nBOSSIE: Not at all. Michael Cohen is -- no one takes him seriously on either side of the aisle. So it's a tremendous burden for Michael Cohen to have to walk around and not be the center of attention. And that's what he is talking about here.\u00a0\nLook, Michael Cohen, during the campaign made the exact opposite statements. And Pastor Darrell Scott talked about them. They traveled together throughout the campaign. And Pastor Scott said the exact opposite of what Michael Cohen is saying.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: With Michael -- he traveled every day with Michael Cohen. And he never heard those things. It's outrageous.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And the media reaction, Philippe, yeah, you know, that's bad, the accusation that Trump said these things, but what do you expect, and it won't hurt him?\u00a0\nREINES: Well, I mean, he makes Ronald Reagan's Teflon look like Saran Wrap. Nothing hurts Donald Trump, I can't name something hypothetical. But in terms of Michael Cohen, someone being upset with the former boss or even having a grudge doesn't make them less credible, anymore than Sammy the Bull Gravano or you know Brutus in terms of Caesar.\u00a0\nAnd what I did note about Michael Cohen is that he's the son of a holocaust survivor. And it is possible these days he is being shaken by these things. He can't be right...\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Michael Cohen told Vanity Fair, I should have been a bigger person, I should have left, maybe I should have quit. By the way, just briefly, Kanye West, remember all the media freaked out over his embrace Trump at the White House. He now tweets I've been use to spread messages I don't believe in. And I'm stepping away from politics. Media reaction, never mind.\u00a0\nAfter the break, White House reporters chastising Sarah Huckabee-Sanders over her boss' enemy that people attacks.\u00a0\nAnd Jon Stewart on how Trump is thumping the press.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: The escalating rhetoric between the president and the press produced some tense moments in the White House briefing room.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shouldn't you reserve the term enemy for people who are actually the enemy of the United States rather than journalists?\u00a0\nSARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is not referencing all media. He's talking about the growing amount of fake news that exists in the country.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Jim Acosta pressed Sarah Sanders about CNN, which the serial pipe bomber targeted last week. But she wouldn't brand the entire network an enemy. And David Bossie, White House reporters and others are now revolting against the president bringing back discharge, fake news, enemy of the American people. I always thought that goes too far rhetorically. And then, as you saw, she wouldn't name -- Sarah Sanders wouldn't name outlets. Your take on this sort of rhetorical escalation?\u00a0\nBOSSIE: The frustration on the right, on the conservative side, is that CNN acts like a Democrat Super PAC all day, every day. That is all they do is act like they are trying to elect Democrats, all they ever do.\u00a0\nAnd they are trying to attack this president all day, every day. So this president says, the fake news is the enemy of the people. He's not saying the media. He's saying the fake news.\u00a0\nKURTZ: He said fake news is ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, so that's a lot of media.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: He's saying the fake news because they all have made mistakes. You look -- just look at yesterday, CNN puts a woman on during a rally. We found this woman in the audience and the interviewer, and it's Andrew Gillum's mother.\u00a0\nKURTZ: It was disclosed.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: Of course, it is not disclosed until they are caught at it though.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I think it was disclosed at the time. All right. Philippe, we played earlier President Trump told Axios this is my only way to fight back, by attacking the press and using that language. And that's how he uses it, counterpunching against the foe that's constantly pummeling them.\u00a0\nREINES: But these are codes. Counterpunching is lying. You know...\u00a0\nKURTZ: With what?\u00a0\nREINES: Well, these things he does, basically, let's narrow it down, including Sarah Sanders. It's lying. So when he says enemy of the people, the media is not the enemy, this is the one person's enemy list that he keeps reciting. It's as simple as that.\u00a0\nKURTZ: How was it lying if that's his opinion? It's not an opinion I happen to agree with, but he's certainly...\u00a0\nREINES: I just think, in general, the lying is off the chart. I mean, now, you're seeing he's lied more than 5000 times. He has lied at the rate of 80 a day.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: This president is demonized by the mainstream media, by the left- wing mainstream media on a daily basis, since he won the election in November of 2016. Not for one minute have they allowed him the breathing room like they have other presidents, to have that honeymoon period.\u00a0\nREINES: That's 93 of the coverage is negative is negative, 93 percent of what he does is negative.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: No. Hey, how about we look at the economy, how about we look at our national security. The facts are -- the facts are that the economy is better off, the American people are better off, we are more secure at home and abroad since this president has come into office. And those are the facts.\u00a0\nIt's the media that doesn't want the American people to hear how good things are going, because they're afraid of having Republicans in control on Tuesday.\u00a0\nREINES: The good thing about this talking about Tuesday is we will go from fake news and fake polls and fake everything to real voting. And I think we're going to see after the blue tornado, I don't think it's a wave, because I think it's going to hit here, in this district...\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right.\u00a0\nREINES: We're going to see whether or not this stuff works.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Fascinating to me that you would say the 93 percent negative coverage is just fine, if that's the figure. But let me get you both.\u00a0\nREINES: Well, it's also the economy, even among Republicans...\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Let me go to Jon Stewart, no fan of President Trump, here's what he had to say about the relation. Play it.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJON STEWART, TELEVISION HOST: I think the journalists have taken it personally. They are personally wounded and offended by this man. He baits them and they dive in. And what he's done well I thought is appeal to their own narcissism, to their own ego. Because what he says is these are -- and the journalists say we are noble, we are honorable, how dare you Sir. And they take it personally.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Is Jon Stewart right? Is the media covering President Trump the narcissists and not the other way around as they often say?\u00a0\nBOSSIE: Of course, he is right about that. And it's amazing he would make that point. Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, you name the so-called comedian, they are 100 percent, whether it's in the entertainment industry or the media, these folks are all leftists. And they are opposed to everything this president has done.\u00a0\nKURTZ: That may be true, but here is Jon Stewart saying the president is beating the press at their own game. Is he right?\u00a0\nREINES: I don't think so.\u00a0\nKURTZ: They take it too personally, then they fight back, and then it's all about...\u00a0\nREINES: I don't think so. First of all, it's hard to sit here after 15 years. And I think both you and David know that I've had my own problems with the press. But there's a constructive way to do it and there's a non- constructive way. No, it is not fair to say that he's playing them. And by the way, he has made any press is good press, Maxim, wrong. I mean, most of his press is bad.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I think it helps him.\u00a0\nREINES: Well, because it just confuses people.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I have like 20 seconds. When you push back against the press as a campaign person, how is that different except perhaps in tone than the president doing it?\u00a0\nREINES: Because we're all not the equal. He's not just some guy sitting next to me like David. He has a high responsibility to not do this. And it's crazy. It's like the Republican Party didn't get the memo.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: The media is offended because this president doesn't bow to them. He does it his way every single day. And they are offended by it. And they lash out -- they lash out at him.\u00a0\nREINES: All right.\u00a0\nBOSSIE: They are offended by his form of truth.\u00a0\nREINES: There is no form of truth.\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Guys, guys, got to go. Still to come...\u00a0\nREINES: We're going to sit here and keep arguing.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Are the media capturing the anger in America on the brink of the election? Frank Luntz is on deck.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Final stretch of the midterms. There is no shortage of public anger out there as we see in this Nevada focus group convened by Frank Luntz.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want my president to be civil. I wanted him to have more than a third grade...\u00a0\nFRANK LUNTZ, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: You are talking servility and then it goes to hell the moment Donald Trump is mentioned, why is that?\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we are learning it from him. He interrupts people. He bullies people.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem he's attacked nonstop by the media every single day.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: And Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster joins us now. And, Frank, I sometimes wonder whether the whole angry America theory is overplayed within the media echo chamber. Are you finding something different?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: I find it very different. I mean, that was done by HBO and Vice News. And these two guys came together to give the American people a chance to put a mirror up so they could see exactly what they're saying and doing. And we did half a dozen of these. The last one airs Monday night on HBO.\u00a0\nI have never done a session without people yelling at each other. I've never done a session this year without it degenerating into this abusiveness that your own children, I say this to the - they think they have the right to yell and scream if there are offended with. If your own children behave that way, you send them to their rooms. And yet, this is how adults behave when they talk about politics in every state in the country.\u00a0\nKURTZ: In terms of the battle for the House since we all believe that anger is a motivating factor for people turning out to vote, does this mean whether Democrats or Republicans are angrier could affect the outcome of the election?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: It absolutely could, but there's always been anger with some sort of control. I can't say a four letter word on this show or I'll never be on Fox News again. You have to carry yourself with certain decorum. There is no decorum anymore. There are no limits anymore.\u00a0\nSo we feel like we have the right and even the responsibility to shout. And I wonder what that means the day after the election. We're spending more money in this election than any other off-year in the history of American politics. And it's almost all the negative ads and abusiveness and these debates have degenerated. I'm afraid.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I bet that many in the audience are saying, well -- half the audience will say well, it's Trump's fault. And half of the audience will say it's the media's fault. And so my question to you...\u00a0\nLUNTZ: It's our fault. It's our fault.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Who is our?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: The public. I am responsible for everything I say on your show. I am responsible for how I carry myself...\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right.\u00a0\nLUNTZ: And so are you, and so are the 320 million Americans. But they want to ignore that responsibility and they want to blame someone else. We are now in a blame-game society and it's wrong. It's wrong if we do it on the right, it's wrong if we do it on the left.\u00a0\nKURTZ: OK. But President Trump has the biggest megaphone and some people blame him. We who sit in front of television cameras have a big megaphone. Is that -- how much is divisive media coverage contributing to this climate of anger that you're seeing in your focus groups?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: I still read the New York Times and the Washington Post. I know a lot of people have stopped doing it. But I would say to them, if every editorial, 100 percent of editorials are hostile to the president, why should anyone read it? They know exactly what you're going to say. If I turn on a cable news program and I only get one side, I'm only half- informed. And that's the not the way we should be.\u00a0\nThe fact is today, we're getting our information to affirm us and not inform us. And that is the core problem that's contributing. And the other part is there is no civics. Our kids are not being taught about history, about politics, about elections.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Is this -- is this a climate that's created in part by President Trump and his approach to the office, and then, exacerbated or amplified by media?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: Every interview tries to get me to blame either Trump or Democrats and Congress. I always say the same thing. It's both of them. They both should not be doing this. They both should be held to a higher standard. And the public is responsible for playing along and actually agitating it. They want to hear the lines. They want to hear the slogans that give them the right to yell and scream. And we've got to stop.\u00a0\nKURTZ: So you're pointing the finger at most Americans, how does this affect your polling this year, all this emotion and this anger and the divisive issues?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: I have less confidence in polling numbers today than I ever had. Because I'm looking at turnouts in places like Texas, it's a presidential level turnout. And then, I see some states that are turning out in a typical off year. I would not use polling to predict or project. I would simply use it to explain what is happening and why.\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Frank Luntz, I'm very glad you could be here in person.

            "article_content": "The Pentagon says the military will provide barricades and fencing as well as support in the air through helicopters and airplanes to help move Border Patrol agents. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced Sunday that the military has already begun delivering countermeasures to the southern border, following reports over the weekend that Mexican police toting plastic shields abandoned their blockades\u00a0in the face of a swelling Central American migrant caravan making its way to the U.S. The Pentagon has sent jersey barriers in conjunction with plans to deploy active duty troops there, and full details of the number of troops to be deployed as well as their roles should be announced Sunday night, Mattis told reporters. His comments come as Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen vowed on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the caravan \"is not getting in.\" \"My general message to this caravan is: Do not come,\" Nielsen said.\u00a0\"You will not be allowed in. ... There is a right way to immigrate to the United States,\" she continued, \"and this is not it.\" U.S. officials announced Monday that 5,000 soldiers will be sent to the area.\u00a0The troops will bolster the efforts of the approximately 2,100 National Guard forces already there. The caravan, which has contained as many as 7,200 people\u00a0and is currently approximately 1,000 miles from the closest border crossing with the U.S.,\u00a0has become a major issue with less than two weeks before the pivotal Nov. 6 midterm elections. SECTION OF BORDER WALL UNVEILED AS CARAVAN MOVES TOWARDS US-MEXICO BORDER The group has traversed about 30 miles per day since forming in Honduras, with many members saying they are fleeing the violence and widespread poverty there. The tensions of a long trek through searing heat with tenuous supplies of food and other goods spilled over Saturday night when a dispute over a food line evolved into the beating of a man falsely accused of child stealing. Raul Medina Melendez, security chief for the tiny municipality of Tapanatepec in Oaxaca state, said the town was distributing sandwiches and water to migrants camped in the central square Saturday night. When a man with a megaphone asked people to wait their turn, some men hurled insults at him. \"Finally people got really angry and those below began to attack the guy,\" Medina said. As the man ran, a false rumor spread that he had grabbed a child for protection and he was caught and beaten. Police rescued him and took him to a hospital for treatment, though his condition wasn't immediately clear. On Sunday, several in the caravan took to microphones to denounce the attack. \"Is that the way we're going to always behave?\" a woman from Honduras asked. \"Anytime there's a rumor everyone is going to run to beat up someone?\" \"This is not a spontaneous caravan of vulnerable people.\" Vice President Pence this week warned that the migrant caravan is being funded by outside, leftist groups, citing intel said to be provided by foreign partners and a phone call with a Central American leader. \u201cWhat the president of Honduras told me is that the caravan was organized by leftist organizations, political activists within Honduras, and he said it was being funded by outside groups, and even from Venezuela,\u201d Pence told Fox News in an interview late Friday in Yuma, Arizona.\u00a0\u201cSo the American people, I think, see through this \u2013 they understand this is not a spontaneous caravan of vulnerable people.\u201d President Trump has sharply criticized\u00a0Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for not doing more to stop the caravan, and he has even threatened to cut off aid to those countries in retaliation. He has also claimed there are \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners\u201d mixed in with the caravan, and Homeland Security officials confirmed\u00a0last week\u00a0that among the thousands of migrants heading for the United States border are some \u201cgang members\u201d and people with \u201csignificant criminal histories.\u201d On Saturday, more than a hundred Mexican federal officers allowed the thousand of migrants to cross a bridge they had barricaded, after\u00a0representatives from Mexico's National Human Rights Commission told police that a rural stretch of highway without shade, toilets or water was no place for migrants to entertain offers of asylum in Mexico. Police boarded buses and headed further down the highway, while migrants cheered and vowed to trek all the way to the U.S. border. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto launched a program on Friday dubbed \"You are home,\" which promises shelter, medical attention, schooling and jobs to Central Americans who agree to stay in the southern Mexico states of Chiapas or Oaxaca. Police commissioner Benjamin Grajeda said that authorities only blocked the highway Saturday to tell people about the government's offer. \"Here in this truck right now you can get help,\" he said. Thousands of migrants in the city of Arriaga rejected the plan Friday night, but said they could be willing to discuss it again once they reach Mexico City. Some fear they will be deported if they take advantage of the program. Fox News' Peter Doocy, Lucas Tomlinson, Chris Wallace and The\u00a0Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" October 23, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. TUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For days, we have watched as a growing Caravan on - of Honduran nationals has snaked northward toward our border to claim asylum here. The spectacle has been televised from the very start and it has spoke - sparked an explosive political debate. Now, more migrants are on the way. There are reports tonight that another Caravan of asylum seekers, this one organized exclusively on social media, is planning to leave from El Salvador next week heading here. You can be certain then when and if that group actually arrives here, the usual red-faced cable news anchors will demand that we let them in immediately, no questions asked. Never mind that one-third of all Salvadorans on Earth already live here in the United States. It is our duty, they will tell us. Once those anchors get off the air they will return home to entirely immigrant-free neighborhoods feeling good about themselves. The only Salvadorans they will ever meet personally are those doing their laundry for minimum wage. But ignore the hypocrisy, if you can. Stifle your personal concerns about mass immigration. People are suffering, they're telling us. And only America can save them. If you've been watching television you've seen pictures like this all day of desperate poverty and hopelessness. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now reached California. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Oh sorry about that. That was the wrong tape. That was not a slum outside Tegucigalpa. That video was shot right here in Orange County, California, not far from Disneyland. The desperate and impoverished people on the screen you saw were American citizens. Hundreds of thousands of them sleep on the ground every night in this country. They don't make it on CNN very often. They're just Americans. Their tragedy is not interesting. If they did laundry at five bucks an hour for rich people though, our moral superiors might notice and care. But as of now, no. The cable news geniuses could not be less concerned about what is happening to American citizens, which, if you think about it, kind of explains the Trump phenomenon. One of the great mysteries here in Washington is how a president with no prior political experience, who's emotionally volatile and not very articulate, remains nevertheless so very popular outside of Washington. It doesn't make any sense. But of course, it makes sense. Trump's secret, he says things like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. And I say \"Really? We're not supposed to use that word.\" You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: A nationalist, in other words, a leader who puts his own country first, who cares about his own people most. You'd think everyone in charge of a nation would be a nationalist. Putting interests of your own citizens above those of citizens of other countries was once considered a prerequisite for running a democracy, not anymore. Now it's considered immoral, evil, in fact. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) DON LEMON, CNN: Nationalist. Use that word. We're going to talk about that word tonight. It is a favorite of the Alt-Right and is loaded with nativists and racial undertones. CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN: He's weaponized race and sort of nationalism and dog whistles. JOHN BERMAN, CNN: You're suggesting there's some kind of dog whistle there. SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD.: It is. It is. It applies - it - it - it does provoke hate activities. BILL BURTON, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: What are you trying to say as President of the United States that you're a nationalist? Americans know what that means. It's not even a dog whistle anymore. It's a bull horn. (END VIDEO CLIPS) CARLSON: Not a whistle. It's a bull horn. Hitler was a nationalist. Of course, so were Mahatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln, and every other leader of every other nation state throughout history until about 20 minutes ago, but whatever. Nationalism provokes \"Hate activity,\" says a sitting U.S. Senator. All the cable news geniuses say, \"Amen.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a time in my lifetime, I'm not that old, when a - when a picture like that would have just elicited nothing but sympathy and empathy-- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --among the American people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see that you think, Oh, my God. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What must be happening where those people are coming from? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How can we open our arms to people like that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These people are coming and asking for asylum. Guess what Ben? It's in our laws that people are allowed to come to our borders and ask for asylum. STEPHEN EDWARD SCHMIDT, AMERICAN COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS STRATEGIST: This is a moral outrage that harkens to the worst accesses in the history of the country, to the separation of families at the slave auction blocks-- ROSIE O'DONNELL, ACTRESS: Yes. SCHMIDT: --to the separation of Native American families. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Hope you're following that at home. Immigration, it turns out, is not a civic question that American voters might be allowed to have opinions about. It's bigger than that. It's a moral outrage. It's a humanitarian crisis. The law is irrelevant here, so are any of your stupid selfish concerns about the effect of impoverished foreigners moving into your neighborhood or your school district. The rule here is simple. Listen carefully. If people from a place poorer than America want to move to America, they get to do that. Period. If you disagree or complain or do anything other than recite the poem at the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, you are, well you already know what you are, because you've heard it a thousand times, but we're going to tell you again anyway, maybe this time it will penetrate, you are a racist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY REID, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC: They see those pictures and are being told fear those Brown people. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, HAITIAN-AMERICAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ORGANIZER, ACTIVIST, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, LECTURER, SENIOR ADVISOR AND NATIONAL SPOKESWOMAN FOR MOVEON.ORG: Right. JOHN HARWOOD, CNBC'S CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES CONTRIBUTOR: The Democrats are a diverse party. The Republicans appeal disproportionately to older Whites. And the mob thing is an attempt to alarm those voters about the prospect of non-Whites and immigrants. BRIAN PATRICK STELTER, CNN'S SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, RELIABLE SOURCES HOST: The Right-wing coverage of this is it - is it demagoguery? How would you describe this? MAX BOOT, AMERICAN AUTHOR, CONSULTANT, EDITORIALIST, LECTURER, MILITARY HISTORIAN: It is demagoguery, Brian. It is also, I believe, racism and nativism, really pandering to the fears of Trump supporters and Fox News viewers. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Yes. You're racist just like you were racist for opposing Obamacare or not watching Sunday Night Football or believing that Brett Kavanaugh did not sexually assault someone. You are a bigot until the moment you obey the Democratic Party, at which point you are a good person like Al Sharpton or Louis Farrakhan. You know the drill. There's one interesting new twist in this latest propaganda barrage though, fear. If you're against admitting an entire Caravan full of poor people into this country it's because you've been coached by that dastardly Fox News to fear the people in the Caravan. But let's be honest. That's not really true. There are a lot of reasons to oppose admitting this Caravan full of people. We don't need any more low- wage labor in this country, for one thing. We also have a right to decide who occupies our property, that's always true. Show up uninvited at Joy Reid's house and you'll discover that she agrees with that principle too. So there are good reasons to oppose this. Fear of Hondurans isn't really one of them. By and large, these are not scary people. Mostly, they're just poor people from crappy countries who want a better life. That's understandable. Nobody blames them for that. Nobody's really afraid of these people. What normal people are afraid of is this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. TED CRUZ, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, TEXAS: God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We believe survivors. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: And this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get off. Get off. Stop fighting. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: So, look closely at those videos. What didn't you see in them? Migrant fruit pickers from Honduras. There weren't any. There wasn't a single impoverished Central American immigrant. The only work boots you saw in those videos were from Brooklyn. They're part of the historic - hipster costume. They're not real. Those were thoroughly American kids, kids with clean fingernails, children of privilege. Those are people with four-year college degrees. Some of those people teach in colleges. What you just saw was the Activist-Left. That's a group about as diverse as the checkout line at Whole Foods. These are not immigrants. They're far too pampered and decadent to be immigrants. These are homegrown religious extremists who believe in nothing but their own power. Suddenly, people exactly like this hold Congressional seats, and they host their own TV shows, and they teach at your kids' school. These are the people worth worrying about. So cool it with the lectures about fear. Listen carefully cable news geniuses, it's not impoverished peasants from Central America we're afraid of. It's you. Univision Anchor, Jorge Ramos, joins us tonight from Southern Mexico at the site of the Caravan encampment. Jorge, I am really glad you're here because I've - I've wanted to ask you this question all day. So, in the many times we've spoken, you've explained that immigrants to the United States from Central America are a net addition to our economy. They're America's strength. They make this a much better country. Given that, why isn't Mexico jumping at the chance to absorb these migrants into its economy? Why is it wasting this human capital? JORGE RAMOS, CHIEF NEWS ANCHOR, UNIVISION: Well there are - the reality, Tucker, is that most of the immigrants that you see behind me, and as a matter of fact they're not criminals or terrorists or not even immigrants. They're refugees. They don't want to stay here in Mexico. They want to go to the United States. Their plan is just to have a better life in the United States. And - and they are refugees. So, I think we have to treat them with respect. We have to listen to the stories, hear their cases, check their backgrounds. And if they apply for political asylum, go through the process. The reality, Tucker, I understand what you're asking. But the reality is that they don't want to stay in Mexico where, by the way, in the last 12 years, more than 200,000 people were killed. They don't want to stay here. They're fleeing violence and extreme poverty in Honduras, most of them-- CARLSON: So-- RAMOS: --they want to go to the United States. They don't want to stay here in Mexico. CARLSON: We need -- RAMOS: And in Mexico, by the way, they crossed the border between Guatemala and Mexico. I was there this morning. But that's probably just for the - for Donald Trump to see, just by the bridge, you will see little boats crossing thousands of immigrants in the last few days for-- CARLSON: Wait but - but - but I'm confused-- RAMOS: --Donald Trump to see -- CARLSON: --but - but hold on-- RAMOS: --so long it's not for show -- CARLSON: --wait but hold on you, OK-- RAMOS: --the reality is completely different. CARLSON: OK. So, you say that the United States must show respect to these, what you call, refugees. Why doesn't Mexico show them respect? Mexico is a rich country, the richest in the region. There are more billionaires in Monterrey and Mexico City than there are in Washington D.C. Why are they sleeping on the ground? And why haven't they been taken care of by rich Mexicans of goodwill, the blue-eyed ruling class of which you were a part, why - where are they in this? RAMOS: Well, you know, it's a - it's a great question. And I'm so glad that you asked it because Mexicans, despite what you might hear in social media, Mexicans have been treating, all these refugees with incredible generosity, and with incredible solidarity. I know that there are fake stories in - in the United States saying that these people were funded by George Soros and by Democrats or by Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela, Vice President Pence is completely wrong about that because if they really finance these people, it was a scam. I've been talking to people here in - in Chiapas who don't have a single dollar, Tucker, to buy a bottle of water. So there - there's no financing here. And Mexicans-- CARLSON: No, no but that's - wait but hold on-- RAMOS: --civilians-- CARLSON: --that's my point. RAMOS: --not the politicians. CARLSON: Right. RAMOS: The politicians, they'll be playing the game with - with Donald Trump. But civilians - Mexicans civilians have been giving all these refugees a little money, water, food, clothes, and sometimes-- CARLSON: But why not - but - but hold on, what about your - I understand and I-- RAMOS: --transportation to go to - to the next town. Yesterday I saw-- CARLSON: --OK. RAMOS: --something incredible-- CARLSON: All right wait, but let me - let me just interrupt you and say I - I-- RAMOS: --and let me tell you, they-- CARLSON: --OK, go ahead. RAMOS: --yesterday they went 26 miles, a marathon, many kids, hundreds of kids, Tucker, and that's the people of the Caravan, no terrorists or criminals. CARLSON: I - I think most Mexicans are very nice people. I grew up next to Mexico. I always like them. It's your ruling class I'm asking you about, the people who are some of the richest people in the world, who spend the summer in France every year. And again, you're from this group, so you can speak to this. Where are they in this? Why aren't they taking care of these people who are sleeping on the ground? We can see them right behind you. RAMOS: I - I was never part of that group. CARLSON: But where are those people - where are the Mexican billionaires? They're very good at lecturing us about our moral inferiority, but they don't seem to be helping at all. Why? RAMOS: No. I think you - you want to concentrate on what Mexicans are doing. I just told you that civilians have done it in a - in a beautiful, generous way. And I think we have to concentrate now on what the role of the United States should be in - in all these crises. First of all, I spent two days with these refugees. And I have not seen a single person from the Middle East. That's a lie. And I think, Tucker, you have - you have to tell the truth to your audience, and you don't have - you have to make sure that people are not lying about this Caravan because- - CARLSON: What-- RAMOS: --the people from the Middle East are not part of this Caravan-- CARLSON: OK. But wait - what are you - let me just - let me just ask, what are you doing? RAMOS: --and they're not terrorists. And they simply want a chance to remake -- CARLSON: Wait hold on. What are you - I understand and -- RAMOS: --their lives. CARLSON: --look, I'm not there. So I'm not - I can't describe the people there. You said the United States, its taxpayers, me, you know, the other 330 million American citizens-- RAMOS: Right, of course -- CARLSON: --right - have an obligation. How many of these migrants are you taking in personally into your home and are supporting once they get to the United States? RAMOS: I - I think that's a great question. And - and that's precisely the kind of question that people like you ask when you don't want to understand that this has nothing to do with individuals. It has to do with nations. And what we have to understand-- CARLSON: But what's the answer? RAMOS: --is that these refugees-- CARLSON: Right. RAMOS: --are not a threat to the United States. I know that in - in Fox News they'll be reporting that they-- CARLSON: No, no, no, but how many are you taking in? It's a very - before you attack the Fox-- RAMOS: --are a threat to the-- CARLSON: --it's a simple question-- RAMOS: --sanctuary of the Unites States-- CARLSON: --how many are you - how many are you-- RAMOS: --that is not true. They are - they are not a-- CARLSON: --taking in? RAMOS: --threat to the United States. I think it's really a love letter to the United States. And you know what they're saying at the - in the United States, please help us. You are the only ones who can help us. CARLSON: I think that's right. RAMOS: And that's exactly what-- CARLSON: I agree with you. RAMOS: --they are asking from President Trump-- CARLSON: I agree with you. I agree. RAMOS: --and from people like you-- CARLSON: But - but-- RAMOS: --and from all your audience. So, I think it is very important that you send-- CARLSON: --but - but - but what about you, hold on-- RAMOS: --that you send correspondents Fox correspondents -- CARLSON: --wait, I understand. I'm not attacking-- RAMOS: --to this place and talk to them. And don't-- CARLSON: --OK. RAMOS: --don't lie to your audience, Tucker. CARLSON: But I'm not lying to the audience. RAMOS: Don't tell them that they're terrorists-- CARLSON: I'm trying to get, hold on - I'm going to - I'm going to stop with this-- RAMOS: --and - and tell them the truth about this Caravan because what you and-- CARLSON: --I'm going to stop with this, hold on-- RAMOS: --Fox News and President Trump-- CARLSON: --wait listen, I'm asking you a very simple question. RAMOS: --are saying about this group is a complete lie. CARLSON: OK. Let me just ask you a - and let's - let's - let's answer this question. We can end on this. How many of these migrants are you personally taking responsibility for? RAMOS: Right. CARLSON: How many are going home to Jorge's place in Miami at the end of the day? And be - please be specific. RAMOS: Yes. Well, I think that, again, this has nothing to do with individuals. CARLSON: Oh, you don't have to do a thing. RAMOS: It has nothing to do with me. I wish I could help all of them but right now - right now-- CARLSON: How about three? RAMOS: --we're talking about 7,000 here. We're talking about 2,500 kids. It is impossible for an individual to deal with a crisis like this. I think President Trump's immigration policy has been a complete failure-- CARLSON: Have you donated money personally? RAMOS: --and unfortunately, Tucker, I - I hope that that you could-- CARLSON: Wait hold on, let me just you -- RAMOS: --help them too and I wish I could-- CARLSON: --have you donated money? RAMOS: --help them too. CARLSON: Well, you can. RAMOS: I wish we could that. CARLSON: Well sure you can. RAMOS: I - I wish - I wish we could do something like that but I - but I-- CARLSON: Well I think you can. RAMOS: --bet if your kids were in danger of being raped or being raised in extreme poverty or being threatened with join in-- CARLSON: Right. RAMOS: --Armada or a gang, what will you do? I mean-- CARLSON: I can count on you to do a standup next to them but probably not to help them-- RAMOS: --will you take the risk? I'm merely telling for the same reason that they're doing-- CARLSON: --I noticed. RAMOS: --for their kids. CARLSON: OK. Jorge, thank you so much. Appreciate it. People are very upset about the migrant crisis, not upset enough to help personally but upset enough to demand that you help. Brit Hume joins us just after the break. Is the mid-term a Blue Wave in the making or is it not? He's been thinking about it. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Mid-term election exactly two weeks from right now. Everything that happens is, in effect, political at the moment. What's going to happen in two weeks? Brit Hume has been thinking about it, and joins us tonight. He's, of course, chief political analyst at Fox. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Senior. CARLSON: Senior, whatever, the biggest guy at Fox, for sure. HUME: Or -- or senior moment political analyst. CARLSON: It's - so, the Caravan. I - I hate to make it a political question because I - I think it's a civic question. But it is political. What's the political effect of it? HUME: Well, if you think about it from Trump's point of view, here's an issue, immigration, that hadn't been all that prominent this fall, but one that he emphasized, I think, and am sure, he believes to great effect in 2016. So, here comes this Caravan. Now, mind you, Tucker, in terms of, you know, this country and what kind of threat these people pose, these people are - are probably - most of them will probably never get here. CARLSON: Right. HUME: I mean they've got to walk ahead of them. They're all - they already have sore feet, all of them, or most of them. You can see the - the pictures are - are heartbreaking. These people, you know, they're - they're - they're in pain. And so, they - they're marching up through Mexico. They got at least a month to come before they could reach any part of our border. And it all - how long it will take depend on where they go. Most of them probably won't make it, so it's probably not that big a threat in terms of - of a lot of people crossing the border. But it's very visual, as the pictures on the screen right now illustrate. And Americans are looking at this and they see the picture of that bridge, which is just chock-a-block with people, they think what's going on here. So, Trump's out raising hell about it. This helps him, unquestionably, in my view. It's a good issue for him and a good issue by and large for Republicans. CARLSON: I wonder if Democrats understand that because their cheerleaders, their handmaidens all day long have been acting as if this, you know, is something that everyone would agree with that America has a moral obligation to accept anybody from a poorer country. HUME: That's a problem that Democrats often have is that they think everybody agrees with them, and they take their cues from elites in New York and Washington and, perhaps, some other places, and they get on board with this stuff. And, you know, there are pockets of the country where that's strong and in other cities and so on. But, you know, one of the things that's happening in this election is that if you look at the - the - the - the classic, what they call the generic ballot, would you rather have a Republican or a Democrat-- CARLSON: Right. HUME: --you need to go. Which party you think should control Congress that number's been very good for Democrats most of this fall. And it's still good on a national basis. But in the - in the places and the crucial races, that number is close to where it's barely a margin for the Democrats at all. And those are the places around the country that they'll need to win to get control of the House. The - I'd still favor that. But they don't favor that as much as they once did, not very many weeks ago. CARLSON: So, we - sum up the political apocalypse that occurs if Democrats don't take the House back. HUME: Oh, my lord. Oh, my lord. CARLSON: Ha-ha, ha-ha. HUME: I mean, you know, that you - you would have thought that there would have been a really major reassessment than the appointment of-- CARLSON: Yes. HUME: --new leaders and so on after what happened in 2016 that the - the - the unlosable race was lost to Donald Trump; it really hasn't happened. Is there a generation of new leaders emerging? Maybe, but they're pretty hard to see now because what you see is Pelosi and - and Chuck Schumer-- CARLSON: Yes. HUME: --and - and - and - and Perez and that group and - and the rest of these people are and - and Joe Biden's out on the campaign trail, Obama's out on the campaign trail. This doesn't look like the, you know, the group of tomorrow's leaders. CARLSON: It really doesn't but if they lose they're going to get a new set, I would say. HUME: Well their hopes of the Senate look diminished too. CARLSON: Yes. HUME: That looks like that's not - probably not going to-- CARLSON: Briefly. HUME: --happen. CARLSON: Brit Hume, thank you very much for that. HUME: You bet, Tucker. CARLSON: Senior political analyst. A former aide to Hillary Clinton, high-ranking, is defending the Left's new tactic of screaming at people they disagree with in restaurants. He joins us next, fresh from a restaurant. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Ted Cruz has cast votes that some Democrats don't like. Rather than wait until the election two weeks from now to vote against him, some decided to scream at him and his wife in a restaurant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CRUZ: God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Solve this -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think that putting a sexual assaulter on the court is a victory for women? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave him alone. CRUZ: Thank you, Sir. God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, you believe in man assaulting women. That's what your vote cost today, Senator? CRUZ: I believe in due process. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, why do you support a man that abuses women? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave him alone. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why doesn't he support women? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you, Ted Cruz. CRUZ: God bless you, Ma'am. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you, Ted Cruz. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you, Ted Cruz. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you, Ted Cruz. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: Shame on you, Ted Cruz. Changing minds and annoying travelers at the same time. That wasn't a restaurant, of course. That was Washington National Airport. Cruz is not the only lawmaker getting yelled at these days. Mitch McConnell recently screamed at in a restaurant also. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have to know. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave him alone. Leave him alone. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ditch Mitch. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON: You want to live in this country? Of course, you don't. Most people are horrified by it. Some people though defend it. Former Hillary Clinton aide, Philippe Reines recently said that the public harassment of lawmakers was a made-up problem. He joins us tonight. Philippe, thanks a lot for coming on. PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER: Yes, thank you for having me back. CARLSON: You didn't mean to defend that, I assume. REINES: I wasn't defending Ted Cruz. I - that - those could've been Republicans chanting against Ted Cruz, the way he's so unpopular. CARLSON: Screaming at - look, screaming at people in public places is not, you know, you could argue it's protected by the First Amendment. That's fine. But it's not the way that people should behave. It's not anything we should defend, and it's not the country we want to live in, is it? REINES: Well let's be clear - clear what happened. First, the first instance of this was Sarah Sanders who-- CARLSON: Right. REINES: --was in a restaurant in Virginia. CARLSON: At Lexington Virginia and was ejected. REINES: She was asked very nicely to leave. She was asked nicely more than sometimes you're nice to me in terms of questions. So, I don't think that that is a heavy price to pay for someone who lies with impunity every day to the American people. CARLSON: OK. So - so you worked for Hillary Clinton whose-- REINES: I did. CARLSON: --husband was credibly accused of rape. If your mom-- REINES: He was not credibly accused -- CARLSON: --he was accused of rape by someone with all kinds of contemporaneous conversation -- REINES: --dismissed by Ken Starr. But that's not what we're here. CARLSON: I'm just saying, look, I'm not accusing -- REINES: OK. CARLSON: --him of rape. I'm just saying that he was accused of rape. So, you could see someone saying \"Well, Philippe defended this. His mother gave birth to him. Why should she be allowed to eat in a restaurant?\" It's within bound to say, \"Philippe's mom, please leave.\" How would you feel about that? REINES: Nobody was protesting Sarah Sanders' mother. It was Sarah Sanders. CARLSON: Because she works for a guy they don't like. Look, I mean I'm just saying maybe -- REINES: I mean first of all, she has free will. She doesn't have to work there. It's an honor and a privilege to work there. CARLSON: Well you don't have to defend the Clintons -- REINES: She chooses every day to - she-- CARLSON: --but how would you like it if-- REINES: --she chooses every day to lie to the American people. People are seeing public officials and they don't see any accountability. And they're thinking to themselves. CARLSON: What about elections? REINES: Elections are two weeks. I mean what - what point is this OK? I mean-- CARLSON: I don't know you -- REINES: --100 - 100 days ago, I mean-- CARLSON: You - no, no, but you just agree - REINES: --I'm - I'm not the - I'm not the angry mob. CARLSON: --the questions -- REINES: A 100 days ago, I started a protest outside the White House. CARLSON: Right. REINES: You have loyal viewers like Kate Roonie who know that I couldn't hurt a fly. Donald Trump is trying to shut that down because he doesn't want protestors outside. CARLSON: OK. I guess the point I'm making is should - is this - is it OK or do things start to fall apart, when you -- REINES: I'll tell you it's not OK. CARLSON: --snatching this kind of nonsense -- REINES: I'll tell you it's not OK. It's been-- CARLSON: Lots of things aren't OK. REINES: --it's been-- CARLSON: Is this OK? REINES: --642 days since Donald Trump was sworn in. Not one of those days has he said, \"We've got to dial down the rhetoric.\" I'll tell you what he did say. CARLSON: OK. REINES: In the last few days - in the last few days, he has specifically-- CARLSON: Have you seen a lot of Democrats been-- REINES: --I'll tell you what I saw. CARLSON: --pushed out of restaurants. REINES: He specifically - we're not in power. We're not - there's nothing to hold us accountable to. CARLSON: No. No, because your youth wing-- REINES: In the last week-- CARLSON: --all the little - all the little robots who follow you-- REINES: --he specifically-- CARLSON: --are doing this. I mean I know - I must know 10 people who've been yelled at until they had to leave restaurants, all conservatives. Is that OK with you? REINES: There's nothing -- CARLSON: Is that an OK thing? REINES: --I am OK with Sarah Sanders, Secretary Nielsen, and Mitch McConnell. Yes, Mitch McConnell was more in danger of-- CARLSON: You're OK, so-- REINES: --salmonella in that restaurant than he was-- CARLSON: So, if Hillary Clinton is-- REINES: --no one's been arrested. CARLSON: --in a restaurant and I walk up to her-- REINES: I've been with her when she's-- CARLSON: --and I start screaming at her-- REINES: --accosted. CARLSON: No but, I - I get it. But are you-- REINES: It's not - there's a difference to that. CARLSON: --OK with that? REINES: There's differences between unpleasant-- CARLSON: If I scream at Hillary until she leaves-- REINES: There's serious difference being unpleasant and something being OK. I will say if you're protesting something, you're disagreeing with that. CARLSON: But how about you - what are we saying -- REINES: If I - if I separated children from their parents, and I went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant, I would realize-- CARLSON: Well how about - how about if I endorse-- REINES: --that there's a possibility-- CARLSON: --third-term abortions? I mean there are lots of things I disagree with, and find repugnant that you support. But I'm not going to-- REINES: Hey, you're not a public-- CARLSON: --yell at you. REINES: --official, Tucker. CARLSON: No. So, is it OK to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves a restaurant? And the answer is \"No, it's not OK.\" It's never OK. REINES: I - I think what happened with Nancy Pelosi was fine, the other day. She was walking out of a fundraiser and a group was protesting-- CARLSON: If she was going with her daughters -- REINES: --you don't see any - you don't see any of us yelling about it. CARLSON: --if I walked up and said, \"Nancy Pelosi, I'm going to yell at you until you leave The Palm because you have a - you support a policy I disagree with.\" I think a normal person would say, you know what-- REINES: You're crying how pathetical -- CARLSON: --if you don't like make -- REINES: --that's not what happened at any of those instances. CARLSON: --I've noticed because Conservatives don't do it because they're not monsters. REINES: In the last 10 days, Donald Trump used the name George Soros for the first time in his presidency, and the guy had a pipe bomb in his mailbox last night. And we're talking about whether or not-- CARLSON: Wait -- REINES: --whether or not Sarah Sanders gets her corn at Hen -- CARLSON: --who and all put a pipe bomb in George Soros'-- REINES: --why do you think-- CARLSON: --mailbox? REINES: --why do you think they did? You think it's just -- CARLSON: Because Trump criticized George Soros, one of the richest people-- REINES: --coincidence? Because Donald Trump-- CARLSON: --in the world? REINES: --Donald Trump runs around-- CARLSON: No, because George Soros maybe you count -- REINES: Don't laugh. CARLSON: --I'm laughing because-- REINES: Laughing why? CARLSON: --to draw a connection between Trump, Soros, I've criticized Soros a thousand times. I hope he'll live long enough I can continue to criticize him. REINES: But you're not Donald Trump. I'm not Donald Trump. He has - he has- - CARLSON: Our elected leaders are not allowed to criticize George Soros? REINES: --come on. In 642 days, if there's an angry mob-- CARLSON: No, no, I'm serious, look-- REINES: --if - if - if we'd gone from coconut juice and soy to angry mob, and everyone is so worried about violence, why has Donald Trump not said everyone needs to dial it down? The rhetoric in our society-- CARLSON: I think - I think-- REINES: --he has never said that, Tucker. CARLSON: --he said it. Mobs shouldn't assault people. REINES: He's-- CARLSON: --everybody's like oh mob, you're racist-- REINES: --he-- CARLSON: --racist. REINES: He calls Democrats-- CARLSON: --OK. REINES: --an angry mob. CARLSON: Well they are an angry mob-- REINES: Jobs not angry mobs. CARLSON: --and I hate that stuff. REINES: It's catchy but he needs-- CARLSON: It's all but true. REINES: --fear and hatred to succeed. CARLSON: Yes. REINES: He has no interest in taming it down. CARLSON: He's never screamed at people in restaurants. REINES: He's -- CARLSON: It was great to see you -- REINES: --it's his responsibility. CARLSON: I'm going to let you dine-- REINES: I just came from BLT-- CARLSON: --without being harassed. REINES: --at Trump Hotel. CARLSON: No one yelled at you, exactly. Democratic Party Keith Ellison has been accused of abusing an ex- girlfriend. She's gone public, and she'll tell us the story next, and what happened to her after she did. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Two weeks from now, DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison may become the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota. This despite allegations of abuse that have been leveled at him by his ex-girlfriend, Karen - Karen Monahan. Karen Monahan is a Liberal. She's a Democrat. But she's also complained about the poor treatment she's received from fellow Democrats since she was bold enough to go public with her allegations. Has anything changed in the weeks since she said that? Well Karen Monahan and her attorney, Andrew Parker, join us tonight. Thank you both for coming on. ANDREW PARKER, KAREN MONAHAN'S LAWYER: Thank you, Tucker. KAREN MONAHAN, KEITH ELLISON ACCUSER: Thank you. CARLSON: So Karen, you had said publicly that since coming forward with your claims against Keith Ellison that you were, in effect, blacklisted by fellow Democrats. Can you describe what you meant when you said that? MONAHAN: Well, I think if you look on social media, if you see some of the letters that have been written that basically say they don't believe me, the folks who have signed on you it's pretty apparent. There's been a lot of bullying. There's been a lot of harassment, isolation by many folks that I stood side by side with supporting them in their campaigns, walking with them in various protest, worked together on different issues around social justice. CARLSON: Were you so - I mean that's not the reception that people who say they're survivors of abuse expect they're going to get from the Left, from Democrats. Were you surprised by it? MONAHAN: No. I watched the MeToo movement. It was, you know, both - I've watched both sides basically take women's pain and use it as a tool for politics. And once it came to one side or the other, you would see these same people start pushing away from it and saying stuff like, \"Well let's talk about the real issues.\" And this is a real issue. CARLSON: Andrew Parker, do you think that the Democratic organization in Minnesota investigated this in a legitimate way, these claims? PARKER: No, it wasn't legitimate at all. Any objective review of it would reach the same conclusion. The Democratic National Committee kicked it to the DFL party in the State of Minnesota who hired their lawyer to investigate their candidate for Attorney General. And not just their Candidate, Tucker, for Attorney General but cause celeb for the Democratic Party, a leader of the progressive movement, not just in Minnesota, but nationally, the Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee is who they were investigating and they hired their own lawyer, not an outside independent lawyer, their own lawyer-- CARLSON: Right. PARKER: --and - and a law firm that raised over half a million dollars for Democratic candidates and over $50,000 for Keith Ellison himself. CARLSON: Yes. That's not legitimate. Karen you have said or allegedly there is a video that shows you being dragged off the bed by Keith Ellison, him swearing at you. Does that video exist? MONAHAN: Yes. CARLSON: Will the public have a chance to see it? MONAHAN: Well the public will not have a chance to see it. That's my pain. And for something like that for everybody to look at and ogle over, something that was-- CARLSON: Yes. MONAHAN: --very traumatizing for me, absolutely not. I would not allow the public to see it. If and when I decide to show it to somebody, it will be in my time. I mean this is a process and just to find the courage to come out and break my silence, as I said, knowing the backlash that I would get, and knowing that this is a journey that I would walk pretty much on my own it took tremendous amount of courage. And I had to face the same fears that so many others who have been victimized face when they decide to either share their story or not tell - share their story. CARLSON: So-- MONAHAN: It's also the same - it's also the same kind of fear that many people who actually know about this situation, have known about it long before I ever shared went - went public with it, why they sit silent or they're afraid to show public support. Many have been bullied and intimidated if they did come out and show any kind of public support, and I grappled with that same fear, the fear of isolation, the fear of being re-victimized-- CARLSON: Well but that's - that's what you're not supposed to feel-- MONAHAN: --being smeared. CARLSON: --according to the people who are making you feel that way. Thank you both for joining us tonight. I appreciate your taking the time to talk to us and tell us what happened. Thanks. MONAHAN: Thank you so much. PARKER: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well the administration has infuriated the Left once again, this time, by defending science. But wait, we thought the Left was for science. But it turns out they're not. And if you are, you're a bad person. That's a topic that's addressed at some length in a new book called Ship of Fools. You can purchase it at TuckerCarlson.com. TEXT: ORDER TUCKER'S BOOK AT TuckerCarlson.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Federal law prohibits gender discrimination. Various federal programs offer special loans to female business owners. Congress sets rules for how women need to be treated in the workforce and universities. There are literally dozens of government agencies that exist in part due to the long-standing presumption that men and women are biologically distinct. They're different. Now, the Trump Administration in the spirit of all of that wants to define gender on a clear scientific basis, but is running into headwinds politically in trying to do that. Tammy Bruce joins us tonight to respond. TAMMY K. BRUCE, ON-AIR CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT: Hey, Tucker. CARLSON: So Tammy, let me just ask you, what happens to women if the definition of sex, of gender becomes up to the discretion of the individual? BRUCE: Yes. Well your opening comments, I think, made that pretty clear. We have a scientific framework that recognizes women and men. As a woman who's worked most of my adult life for the welfare of women, that's important. You know, we are important. We lead different kinds of lives. Our - our life experiences are different. We're subject to certain kinds of, different kinds of violence, sexual violence etcetera. So, I mean it's important but the - the important thing also is when it comes to the government and law is that something is actually administratable that something is clear, that something is defined. And, of course, science, as the Left always tells us, is important, and as - and as an - a - a distinctive framework of how we make decisions. The problem here is, is that Barack Obama created a framework where for Title IX, people could - would be judged and placed in a framework based on simply what they claimed. Now, I think the transgendered issue is a serious one, people going through-- CARLSON: Right. BRUCE: --serious life changes. Chelsea Manning just posted Twitter photos with her having the surgery. We know, of course, Caitlyn Jenner has. Hundreds of Americans have gone through this. CARLSON: Right. BRUCE: And it's a serious issue. And I think that what we're looking at here for the government, especially as a gay woman, if you're looking for the government to, and the reaction to this change has been remarkable to confirm your value or your existence as a person, we're all in trouble because the government is not the place to get that. Right now, any kind of rule, I think, for the government's got to be something that helps us administrate a framework like Title IX and recognize the differences between men and women while transgendered individuals, of course, this doesn't erase them. It means that their relationship with themselves and with the medical community and how they identify-- CARLSON: Right. BRUCE: --remain - is personal and that they can work through the system within that framework. CARLSON: Yes. I mean it's not an attack on anyone to-- BRUCE: No. CARLSON: --to start to worry that maybe women are - are about to be hurt in this. That - that's my opinion because -- BRUCE: Well, yes-- CARLSON: --we should at least talk it through, I think-- BRUCE: Well - well yes-- CARLSON: --rationally. And I'm glad that you helped us do that. BRUCE: Exactly. CARLSON: Tammy, thank you. BRUCE: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well getting into Harvard is tough for anybody, but it's a lot harder for some, and it depends on your skin color to a large extent, it turns out. We know that because of documents related to a discrimination lawsuit brought by Asian applicants to Harvard. And those documents show the University has spent decades rigging its admissions policies at the behest of University leaders, who want a significantly less Asian student body. It's hard to believe but that is happening even today. Jason Hill is a Philosophy Professor at DePaul University and author of the book We Have Overcome. He opposes the admissions practices of Harvard. Jason, thanks a lot for joining us. So, a lot of us grew up hearing about the discriminatory practices of the Harvard Admissions Department believing that they were no longer in existence, only to discover that they are, and that Harvard is defending them, even having been caught using them. JASON HILL, PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR, DEPAUL UNIVERSITY: That's right. CARLSON: What is this? HILL: Well I think this is - there's no other word to describe it than just nefarious. I mean any institution that uses race explicitly as a way and ex - explicitly uses race with such zeal as a way of excluding persons from their institutions is just plain evil. And what makes it even more nefarious is that we're talking about a group that has achieved the highest academic record, the highest SAT scores, but has the lowest admission rate among any racial group. This makes it even more nefarious and - and - and - and I just - I think the word that comes to my mind is evil here. This is plain -- CARLSON: So but-- HILL: --and - and -- CARLSON: --if you're telling kids, and we do tell kids all through young adulthood through their teen years and high school, we say, \"Get the highest grades you can and the highest test scores,\" those are the criteria that are going to be used to judge you. And it turns out that's a lie. It makes all of us kind of cynical, doesn't it? This - this fake meritocracy? HILL: It's - it's profoundly anti-American. And it's - it's - it goes in the face of - of - of - of what is - as - is - is - is the American dream, which is meritocracy, which is going by fairness, which is going by working hard, not judging people by race, by ethnicity, by, you know, morally neutral factors, but judging people based on merit, on talent, on sheer grit, and ten - tenacity and resilience. And what Harvard is saying is that there are other criteria that we're going to judge you by, a superfluous and extraneous criteria, and anything that you exhibit such as talent and merit, we're actually going to discount those and use them against you. And when we have a model group that aspire to the best virtues that America can offer, such as grit, tenacity, and hard work-- CARLSON: Yes. HILL: --and display those to the American people, we say we're going to discount those, and we're going to actually use them against you. And I think that's just very, very unfair. CARLSON: They believed in our values and we punish them for it. It's really sad. Thank you. HILL: We punish them for it. CARLSON: You put that so nicely. Professor, thanks a lot. HILL: Thank you. CARLSON: Well he hosts the most popular television show in the A.M. He has written a bunch of best-selling books. He can probably bake 30-minute brownies in five minutes. Brian Kilmeade joins us after the break, we are honored to say. Stay tuned. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON: Time now for the Friend Zone. We bring on one of our favorite people here at Fox. Tonight, we're honored to be joined by one of the co- hosts of Fox & Friends, the great Brian Kilmeade. His new book, Andrew Jackson and The Miracle of New Orleans, a best-seller sold so well, it's now out in paperback, and we are proud to be the forum in which he announces that. So Brian, all this drama going on, you spent a lot of time thinking about Andrew Jackson and studying his presidency, what are the lessons from Jackson that we could apply to this moment? How would he handle the drama we're living through? BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX & FRIENDS CO-HOST, FOX NEWS: Straight ahead, very similar to Trump. And that's one of the most amazing thing, Tucker. I could say lucked out but also when you write a history book, you worry about being relevant. People like you and I like politics, like history, lot of our audience does. But I had no idea that President Trump was even going to run for president, let alone win and be so compared, and accurately, to Andrew Jackson, and put his portrait up in the Oval Office. I had no idea his - his tomb would be defiled for the first time since his death, prior to the Civil War because all of a sudden, Andrew Jackson's being re-evaluated. Suddenly, the previous president wanted him off the 20. We can never justify slavery but he had slaves. We can never justify some of the battles he had with American Indians at the time, but others was in order to win a war called the War of 1812. So, having done that, he was still an unbelievable success story that in the afterward I have Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, all looked up to him and said, \"I can learn from this guy.\" I'm amazed today we're having trouble finding relevance, good things about Andrew Jackson, a 13-year-old orphan who ended up a two-term president. That's the American story. CARLSON: One of the toughest people ever to hold the Office, I - I think by popular claim. KILMEADE: He shot people in duels. He had a bullet in him his entire life. He suffered from dysentery, 6' 1'', a 140 pounds. He was brought up in the backwoods. There were no social programs to prop him up. He found a way. He didn't blame. He took action. Became a self-taught lawyer, Judge, Congressman, Senator, a Militia General. Won some of the most consequential battles, including the Battle of New Orleans, that any American General has ever won. And get this, he didn't go to West Point. He didn't learn his leadership from his - from his father. He learned it from being raised by his town, his County, his country, and he bled red, white, and blue. And he lived to pay back that country for what they did for him and that give him a shot at life. In no other country could he have done anything. He was one of the original American success stories even if you didn't like some of his policies. CARLSON: Amazing. This is why the book has sold the number of copies it has. KILMEADE: Yes. CARLSON: It's a great story and a great account of an amazing life. Brian, thank you very much. The great Brian Kilmeade. KILMEADE: All right, go get them, Tucker. Thanks. CARLSON: Always sits in on this show when I'm gone. That's it for us tonight. Amazing how fast that went. We'll be back tomorrow night at 8 o'clock to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We'll be back tomorrow.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" May 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Back from West Virginia. Good to see you, Bret. Thank you. So, we have lots of late-breaking news tonight at this hour. Plus, several big story exclusives for you. The lawyers for the 9/11 mastermind held at Gitmo are now arguing that he suffered brain damage at the hands of the CIA, and so therefore, he cannot be sentenced to death when he ever gets his trial. In moments, one of the few people who really knows the man who interrogated him, KSM, himself with his opinion on all of this is here live tonight. And there's also breaking news this evening at the border where some say the president is not getting what he wants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And if we don't get border security, we have no choice, we'll close down the country. Because we need border security. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: And late tonight, continuing word that a slow but steady stream of asylum-seekers are quietly being let into the country, which has some of the president's supporters lashing out. But first, the brash CEO and ex- convict from coal country is now the center of attention in the hot races to watch as he hopes to unseat Joe Manchin in West Virginia. Don Blankenship has drawn fire from both sides of the aisle tonight over what he said at last night's Fox News debate, doubling down on comments that some have called racist about the family of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You're talking about the father of the current Secretary of Transportation, President Trump's Secretary Transportation, Elaine Chao. The father who you called a China person. DON BLANKENSHIP, WEST VIRGINIA U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: Some people are Korean persons, and some of them are African persons. It's not any slander there. He has conflicts of interest with China. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, that was just a beginning. Mr. Blankenship joins me live in moments to explain his strategy that some are calling Trumpian. But first, Peter Doocy live on the ground of how this is all playing out with the folks in West Virginia. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Martha. We've long known that Don Blankenship would be getting good news next Wednesday because that's when his probation ends. But now, he may be in a better position to get good news the day before the West Virginia primary day because our politics editor, Chris Stirewalt, believes Blankenship, the former coal baron, may get as much as an eight-point boost from the nationally televised debate last night, which basically featured Blankenship standing stage right and watching while the two office holders sharing the debate stage with him, chipped away at each other by trading brutal attack lines and accusations with one another and largely leaving Blankenship out of it. But, when the former coal baron did speak, he won applause and laughter from the constituents in the room with one-liners about his conviction and his residency in Nevada. He apparently did well enough to have the conservative Weekly Standard now looking ahead to a possible match up with Joe Manchin. David Bieler over there, skeptically writes this: \"Blankenship seems like he might be much worse than your run-of-the-mill bad candidate. There's a difference between the performance of somebody like Sharon Angle and somebody like Roy Moore or Joe Arpaio. If Blankenship wins the nomination, he could easily end up in the latter group. But if Republicans nominate Jenkins or Morrisey, West Virginia could be one of the most interesting competitive races in the country.\" And Blankenship is succeeding even though conservative-linked Super PACs are spending money against him and liberal outlets such as The Huffington Post are continuing to publish stories that call him out for his defensive words like China person. Over at The Huffington Post, they write this: \"West Virginia Republican Senate Candidate Don Blankenship on Tuesday said he saw nothing wrong with his use of a racial slur to describe the father-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\" So, this state now has a candidate who is unapologetic about controversial comments and unpredictable on a national debate stage. Sound familiar, Martha? MACCALLUM: It does. Peter, thank you very much. So, here now exclusively, Don Blankenship, West Virginia Republican Senate, candidate for the U.S. Senate, and former Massey Energy Company CEO. Mr. Blankenship, thank you. It's good to see you here tonight again. Good news, if it's true that you might have picked up as much as eight points in the polls last night in West Virginia, but you hear what is coming at you from The Weekly Standard. They say that you are another Sharon Angle, another Roy Moore and that you present a disaster for your party in the general election in West Virginia. BLANKENSHIP: I think they're just wrong. They've been wrong a lot. They've been wrong so far in this campaign. I'm a little bit miffed that a China person is discriminatory. I thought that if you refer to someone as an Asian or whatever you might try to throw it in that category but somebody from China is from China, somebody from the U.S. is from the U.S. But to the extent that anybody thinks that that's a racial slur, I'm sorry, but I don't see it. MACCALLUM: OK. Understood. What about \"Cocaine Mitch\"? Some people are -- I think a lot of people would say that that's a big reach and that it suggests something that is simply not true, and that it's such a, you know, sort of tangential association with a ship that had drugs on it ostensibly that is somehow related to his wife's father. You have been the subject of -- you've been so maligned for things that you say you didn't do and that people don't fully understand. So, why would you take that tact with somebody else? BLANKENSHIP: Maybe it's to make the points that you just made. That I've been maligned for things I didn't do. So, but -- the bottom line is that, you know -- MACCALLUM: So, an eye for an eye I guess? BLANKENSHIP: No, it's more or less that, you know, there are things that don't go the way you want them to go. And you know, having cocaine on a family-owned ship certainly should be of interest because cocaine deaths in this country keep going up, and even though that ship -- I think headed to Europe. We still need to be aware that there are cocaine and other drugs moving on the high seas on commercial ships. And if nothing else, it should make us aware that we need to be careful when these commercial ships are docking when your country needs to see what's on them. And certainly, the family of Elaine Chao and McConnell should be no exception to that. MACCALLUM: All right. You know, as I said, people would find that to be a bit of a reach to call them \"Cocaine Mitch,\" but you have said that and that your explanation for it. Let me ask you about this, because if you do win in the primary next Tuesday night, Democrats, you know, are pretty much already preparing ads, no doubt. You've already seen the kind of ads that will be leveled against you. One of them will go after you on environmental issues that they'll say that the method that you used for mining in West Virginia cause cancer in some people, and that you diverted the water source to your own home while you let the water in the rest of your neighborhood, that had a coal slurry in it, be contaminated. So, those will be asked of you, sir. So, what would you say to those charges? BLANKENSHIP: First of all, the house that's in the area is not even my house. So, that's a good place to start. MACCALLUM: Did you provide your own water source in your neighborhood from a different while? BLANKENSHIP: No. No. It's a longer story than you probably got time for, but the city, which is a small town nearby had run water down close to my home on their own, and they gave me a chance to pick up that water. But at that point, no one even knew there was this concern about any wells. And I'm still not sure what the facts are arounds those wells. But it's easy to make up stories, and as you said, they're already running those ads and they're probably going to get beat in the primary. And Joe Manchin has so much baggage that he'll be much easier to beat, so I'm not concerned about being able to beat Joe Manchin. I've beat him two or three times before on issues, and the media slant on these issues with, you know, a water spill or with an accident or whatever are totally different than the behavior of Joe Manchin, which is intentional. MACCALLUM: So, in terms of the fact that -- you know, we brought this up last night -- with regards to your time in prison, which -- and your probation is scheduled to end the day after the primary, is that correct? BLANKENSHIP: Yes. MACCALLUM: OK. Last night, was interesting actually, that neither one of your opponents really went after you about that at all. But here again, if you do win the primary it will be front and center, and I know that you believe that you were falsely imprisoned, but do you think that will be a liability for you if you get into a head-to-head matchup with Senator Manchin? BLANKENSHIP: First of all, I don't believe that I was falsely imprisoned, I know that I was falsely imprisoned. And the reason they don't attack me is they're both attorneys and they know what and 302s are and they know from the filing they made that ten of the 12, to 302s that should have been provided to my defense from the lead witnesses were not, and they know that there was in fact 61, for your legal community out there, 302s that were turned over and they know there were dozens of e-mails that had extremely exculpatory information. So, the case, more likely, or if there's any justice, will be invalidated before the general election anyway. MACCALLUM: All right. Sir, thank you very much for answering questions here again tonight. And good to have you with us. BLANKENSHIP: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Don Blankenship in West Virginia. So, here with reaction tonight, co-Host of the brand-new Fox Radio show -- we're all excited about this -- \"Benson and Harf\", set to debut on May 7th, on SiriusXM channel 450. They already have a Web site, bensonandharf.com. Marie Harf is a Fox News Analyst and former State Department and CIA Spokesperson, and Guy Benson, Fox News Contributor and Political Editor at townhall.com. Congratulations, first of all. GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR AND POLITICAL EDITOR AT TOWHHALL.COM: Well, thank you. MACCALLUM: And that's really exciting, and we're a little upset because I think it's going to conflict with our show in some markets, but that's all right. So, we won't be able to see you as much as we have in the past. But we really do wish you guys good luck. What do you think about the whole thing, Guy? Let me start with you. BENSON: Well, look, I think Chris Stirewalt has a better read on West Virginia than I ever possibly could. But, I can understand given the popularity of Donald Trump in that state why a lot of Republican voters would say here's a nonpolitician watching these other two politicians squabbling. He cracked some joke, doesn't apologize for anything, and he's much more understated in his delivery than Donald Trump, but there's some affinity there. In terms of his confidence that he can get past some of these issues in the general election with the Manchin machine and the Democratic machine attacking him, maybe, but there's that old aphorism in politics when you're explaining you're losing, and he was explaining a lot about his wrongful convictions on the wells, and where the water went, where it didn't. I think that's something that Democrats, we know, are actually trying to boost him, because I think he'd be easier to beat. We will see. MACCALLUM: I want to play one more sound bite from last night -- when I asked him about whether or not he had empathy for the opioid addicts in West Virginia. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Do you have empathy for addicts? BLANKENSHIP: I don't think empathy is going to fix the problem. I think if we stop the drug abuse, we don't need to have empathy and that's more important. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The reason I asked him that is because he has, you know, a reputation for being very tough. He wants to drug test everybody who works for the government, including teachers, and it's a very emotional subject in West Virginia. But you know, you heard his answer. He said no, they need a solution; they don't need empathy. They need a solution and it got a very good response from the audience, Marie. MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANALYST AND FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: Well, they need both. And I was interested when the audience did respond last night, including when he said, you know, I have some -- he made a joke about going to jail, basically. And he said I have some experience with the Justice Department. I'm not sure that will translate to Republican primary voters in the same way. Guy is right, though, Democratic roots are supporting Don Blankenship because they believe he's the weakest candidate. He is no Donald Trump, right? He may say some of the same things, but the delivery, the retail politics -- Don Blankenship does not have that. And yes, Joe Manchin is a Democrat, but he's a moderate one. He has voted with Donald Trump for some nominees, and he's a fairly popular former governor in the state. From a Democratic perspective, we would love to have Don Blankenship as the candidate because we think -- MACCALLUM: That's why they're supporting him and running ads, absolutely. You guys are going to be bouncing from topic to topic with your new show, so we're going to do that here for a moment. HARF: Great. MACCALLUM: Obviously, a lot of attention being paid to Rudy Giuliani, who is going to be -- you'll hear the whole interview tonight on Sean Hannity, but President Trump's new attorney. And here's what he had to say about the changing of the guard on their team. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO DONALD TRUMP: There was the leak of the 49 questions, so that leaves you with, gee, somebody is poisoning the atmosphere here. Unless we have assurances that wasn't going to be a leak, there wasn't going to be a lot of self-serving statements about the interview, then we would do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: All right. So, this is interesting, because The Washington Post reported today, and there are sort of different versions of this, but I want to read this to you: \"In the wake of a testy March 5th meeting, Mueller's team agreed to provide the president's lawyers with more specific information about the subject that the prosecutors wish to discuss with the president. With those details in hand, Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, compiled a list of 49 questions that the team believed the president would be asked.\" According to three of the four people who spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to talk publicly. Now, Guy, if that is true, the questions themselves were based on -- here's all the subjects we want to talk to president about, and according to this, and we are putting calls out to Jay Sekulow to see if he will confirm or deny this. He wrote the questions, that's not what we've been hearing. BENSON: So, I would love some clarity on this. There's a big difference here. If these are actual questions sent over from the special counsel's office versus an extrapolation from a Trump lawyer based on broader conversations about the topics that might be covered. Because we've spent a lot of time in the chattering class going through question by question and the wording. And if the wording was Sekulow's, and not Mueller's, that sort of makes a lot of the conversation moot. Also, if the wording is Sekulow's and not Mueller's, that tells you who leaked this stuff. It was definitely Team Trump and not the special counsel's office. And then, the question becomes what would the motivation be to leak these questions? Could it be to have us talking about it? So, the president says, forget it I'm not sitting down with Mueller -- which I think is frankly probably the strategic good decision. Might've been a little chicanery going on, strategic placement here. MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, we just want to know, you know, if that's accurate or not, because to thinks that you say -- BENSON: Who wrote the questions? MACCALLUM: -- are very relevant in terms of who leaked this information. You think about Alan Dershowitz saying these are so broad, they're designed to entrap him. So, if they were written by Sekulow or compiled by him based on bigger information, that's a different story, Marie. HARF: It's a completely different story and it means that they weren't designed to trap him. It doesn't -- no, they weren't designed to scare him. Jay Sekulow, like a good attorney, was trying to cover all of the issues that they might want to ask Donald Trump about. And so, that's how -- if these questions were written by him, that's how they were written. It's also disturbing, though, that Rudy Giuliani may not have known that, because when he said, oh, gee, well, this seems to have been leaked from someone near Mueller, let's make sure all the presidents attorneys on the same page. MACCALLUM: Well, you know what, I would love for Jay Sekulow to call in tonight and talk to us and clarify this. Honestly, because it does make a difference. HARF: It does. MACCALLUM: Or anyone else on the team who wants to set it straight if that's not the case, if The Washington Post is wrong about this. We will see. Great to see you guys. Good luck with your new project and your new show. We're looking forward. It's going to be a huge hit. BENSON: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, more breaking news this evening, new body camera footage just released showing the SWAT teams as they storm the hotel room of the Las Vegas shooter. The bigger story might be what the police do not want the public to see. And breaking news on the border, you remember the caravan of migrants. Word tonight that are slow but steady stream of them are being let into the United States. This is not what the president wants to see here, so what will the response be from the White House? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The total number of asylum-seekers from the refugee caravan who have been processed up to this point is 47. The fact that they can't move this group of 150 refugees isn't a lack of capacity, it's a lack of political will. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Are you watching that mess that's going on right now with the caravan coming up? Are you watching this? And our laws are so weak, they're so pathetic -- (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: President Trump and his team ramping up pressure at the border as more than 100 Central American caravan migrants push for asylum in the United States. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announcing today that 35 more attorneys are headed there to prosecute illegal entries along with 18 more immigration judges to decide these cases. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We're not going to let this country be overwhelmed. People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. We're sending a message worldwide: don't come illegally. Make your claim to enter America in the lawful way and wait your turn. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, we're receiving word late tonight that slowly but surely, many of those migrants are being allowed to cross the border. So far, immigration officials have processed 28 of the 150 who are requesting asylum in that process is expected to continue. David Wohl, Attorney and Conservative Commentator; Enrique Acevedo is a Univision News Anchor. Gentlemen, thank you for being here, both of you. DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: Hi! You know, David, the administration seems like they don't want to let this happen at all and yet it's pretty clear that some people are being allowed to cross. So, what are they going to do about that? WOHL: Well, to start with, Martha, that video will make great campaign commercials in November for GOP candidates running for office. I mean, it is exhibit A for the case for the wall. But yes, there -- as Jeff Sessions said, there's an appropriate way to apply for asylum. The U.S. embassy in your country of origin, you apply, submit your documentation there. You don't crash our border with no paperwork, no documentation, only a script that has been handed to you by immigration lawyers on what to say and what not to say. When that happens, the appropriate resolution is arrest and beginning the deportation process. And I think that's what Jeff Sessions has just put into action right now. Now, with a handful of people as you indicated, 28, they may feel that it's easier just to simply give them an initial review rather than returning them to Central America because they can't just return them to Mexico -- that's not their country of origin, apparently. So, giving them the initial review does not mean they'll get final asylum and it may just be the lesser of two evils right now. MACCALLUM: Enrique, there are, you know, there's a lot of bars that you have to cross and things that you have to prove in order to substantiate your claims that you request asylum. So, there will be a lot of these people, I would assume, who will not meet the criteria, correct? ENRIQUE ACEVEDO, UNIVISION ANCHOR: Exactly. Requesting asylum is perfectly legal. It's a challenging and long process. Actually, 75 percent of Central American asylum-seekers have their petitions rejected. And we're on track, the U.S. is on track to admitting the fewest refugees since 1980. I've been hearing for years, I've hearing people like David said, that immigrants have to get in line and respect our laws. And now that they're doing exactly that, they find another way to discredit their intentions. MACCALLUM: You know, David, in a piece that I read today, I believe this was in The New York Times, they spoke to someone at the border who's requesting asylum who said of the president, he has no right to deny us asylum. Is that true? WOHL: Well, he has no right to deny an application made in a lawful manner, i.e. at the embassy in their country of origin. He does have the right to stop someone who crashes the border, climbs over the fence with no documentation, no proof that they are who they say they are, no proof of where they come from, no proof that they're actually being oppressed or threatened by gangs in their country. Nothing. Simply a scripted statement given to them by immigration attorneys. Those people are rightfully arrested and processed for deportation. That is what Trump is saying. That was his campaign promise two years ago and that's what he's going to follow through with, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, Enrique, how much of this is a political ploy? You know, not these individual people or the circumstances that they're in, but the caravan itself and the way, as David puts it, sort of, you know, crashing up against this border wall that is there, and negate that everyone is hanging out on. Is it more to make a statement and has it been organized by people who want to make that statement because they know that the president has promised to get tougher on immigration and this will put him in a tough spot? ACEVEDO: Well, as we saw on the package that you showed before our interview, people are getting in line. They are in an orderly process getting in line, waiting for their turn, claiming the requests for asylum. There's no one crashing the border or trying to come across. Like I said, last week -- MACCALLUM: David, what do you say to that, David? I mean, they do look orderly, David. WOHL: They're climbing over fences. ACEVEDO: But that's not against the law. To climb a fence is not against the law. You can just climb a fence. It's not against the law. That's not crashing aborted. You can climb a fence. It's not illegal to climb a fence. WOHL: Enrique, you got here, you came to America in a legal way. Whatever papers you had, you submitted them at the border, you came through a legal port of entry -- ACEVEDO: Just like these people are trying to do, David. WOHL: You're a brilliant and smart guy. Those are the (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: We'll continue the conversation but thank you both for being at here this evening. This story straight ahead, the mastermind of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, could be spared the death penalty because he is claiming that his CIA interrogators left him with brain damage. This idea has come all these years later; they've just decided that this is what happened? The man who interrogated and water boarded him is now breaking his silence because he wants you to understand what happened in that room. He's here next. And new report that North Korea has released three American prisoners. Is it another sign that Kim Jong-un is caving to President Trump's demands, or is the U.S. walking into a trap? General Jack Keane with his theory next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Right now, we have an unprecedented opportunity to change the course of history on the Korean peninsula. This administration will not repeat the administrations of the past. Our eyes are wide open. It's time to solve this once and for all. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: Mike Pompeo pulling no punches on North Korea during his swearing-in today as the 70th secretary of state. The rogue regime reportedly agreeing to release these three Americans who have been held captive in a North Korean labor camp, Kim Dong-chul, Kim Sang- duk, who's also known as Tony Kim, and the third gentlemen who is known as Kim Hak-song. What is behind North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sudden change in tune and is this genuine? Here now, General Jack Keane, Fox News senior strategic analyst, chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. General, good to see you. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Good to see you, Martha. MACCALLUM: This is something the president wanted as a precursor to this, to release these men. KEANE: No doubt about it. Pompeo mentioned it when he met with Kim Jong Un. And just recently, our national security advisor, Ambassador Bolton, mentioned it publicly as a sign of good faith that Kim Jong-un is serious about these talks and about denuclearizing, so let's release these hostages before the talks, and he's doing it. MACCALLUM: What do you make of his concessions? What's different now for Kim Jong Un? Is it that the world is different? Are there different pressures on him within North Korea than existed in the prior generation? KEANE: I think -- well, two things have happened. One is, certainly, his acceleration of his nuclear program and weaponising them on ICBM's. And the speed at which he did that drew the world's attention. And, of course, we transition from strategic patience in the Obama administration, which was actually a concession to him, to the Trump administration. They saw the imminent danger of all that and said this is unacceptable to the security of the American people, and just moved right on it. Maximum pressure, economically, and also putting a military option on the table. And I think the president, the fact that he would never let up on discussing the military option, something his predecessor avoided doing painstakingly, you know, kept this pressure on him. And my sources told me they shut down a revenue about 80 percent before we started blocking the North Korean ports with our Navy ships. So, there is some impact, but they've let their people suffer in the past, and just sort of gutted up and went on anyway and still manipulated us. MACCALLUM: It feels like for some reason that's not working for him anymore. That maybe there is some internal pressure that hasn't existed before. You know, obviously, if they're so much that we don't know about. I find it really interesting that you have the Chinese, and the South Koreans, the Japanese, all scrambling to have meetings. They all want to be part of what they see happening. KEANE: Yeah. And I think what's so different for me is just the sense of urgency that Kim Jong Un -- he's done all of this in 90 days. MACCALLUM: Yeah. KEANE: You know from the Olympics on, and he's made major concessions. Some people, you know, who are always anti-North Korea are flipping about it. But the speed at which he's done it is remarkable. He wants to end the Korean War with an armistice -- and then an armistice by the end of the year. He's taken off the table for the first time, the 28,000 troops we have as a condition for having negotiations. MACCALLUM: This is amazing. KEANE: He's frozen his test programs, which is easy to do. That's to be sure. But he's willing to let inspectors come in and take a look at his nuclear test sites. MACCALLUM: Do you think we'll also get ballistic missile reduction or something else out of this? At some point, does it become untenable to keep pushing for more and more and more in this negotiation? KEANE: Oh, yeah. There's a lot of issues, Martha, and I'm just glad you brought that up. The president has committed to Abe, the head of Japan, to bring up the Japanese abductees, which they've believed they have thousands of. We also will discuss with Kim Jong Un chemical and biological weapons, which are not on the top tier, but they're there, and they're dangerous and we suspect he has them. We're also going to discuss, as you suggest, ballistic missiles. The development of those ballistic missiles and what are we going to do about those missiles. So, we have a lot to talk about. But, central, for sure, is denuclearization. MACCALLUM: General Jack Keane, always good to see you. Thank you very much. KEANE: Good talking to you, Martha. MACCALLUM: So, the Boy Scouts of America just dropping the word, boy. Not really that important part of a title, is it? Moving on to a mission that would include more girls. Governor Mike Huckabee joins us with his thoughts on that. And also this, lawyers for the alleged 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have now come up with a new way to keep him alive. They say that he suffered brain damage at the hands of the CIA. We will talk to the man who interrogated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and he will explain to us what happened in there. Vegas police have just released brand-new body cam footage from that night of the harrowing attack that killed 58 and left hundreds more injured. We're going to bring you inside that hotel room of the Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: Las Vegas police releasing this brand-new body cam footage which depicts the moment that a SWAT team breached the door of Stephen Paddock's 32nd floor hotel suite, after he opened fire on a concert back in October killing 58 people. And what is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Watch some of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to breach. We're breaching. Move up, move up. Canine coming out. Canine coming out. Clear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: The release of this video comes after police failed to convince the Nevada Supreme Court to let them withhold key evidence from the public, including dozens of hours of video, 911 calls, and other internal documents detailing what they found. We are told that we can expect more video, the audio, the documents, all of that, to be released on a rolling basis, and we'll be watching that over the coming weeks. Also, this evening, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind behind the 9/11 terror attacks may have his life spared. His attorneys are now claiming that he suffered brain damage while he was interrogated by the CIA, meaning that the death penalty could be taken off the table. Dr. James Mitchell, the man who carried out that interrogation does not buy it, and he's here in a moment. But first, Trace Gallagher with the back story tonight. Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Martha, the brain scan information involving Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was in a memo written by Mohammed's attorneys and attained by the McClatchy Newspaper Company. The memo states that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had an MRI at Guantanamo on January 31st, and that the scan showed evidence of head injuries consistent with the physical trauma that was documented in the so-called torture report. That's the executive summary produced by the senate intelligence committee in 2014 that condemned the CIA's black site program, saying that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was water boarded 183 times and subjected to walling, where his head was bashed against walls between interrogations. But Khalid's lawyers also fully acknowledge the MRI scans were badly flawed, and that 75 percent or more of the data was unusable. So, defense lawyers want the Pentagon to pay for another, more complete series of MRI's. The Pentagon has refused saying the lease on the portable MRI machine at Guantanamo expired. The machine was originally brought in to the holding facility to study the brain of the captive in the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole that killed 17 U.S. sailors. The MRI of the accused 9/11 mastermind would have to be done at Guantanamo, because congress has forbidden the transfer of detainees to the U.S. for any reason, even medical treatment. For now, the portable MRI machine is still physically at Guantanamo, but a judge told the defense, yesterday, they must justify the need for more scans. It's notable that no information has been released on exactly which experts looked at and concluded that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is suffering brain damage. The Pentagon also won't comment on whether proof of KSM having brain damage would cause the government to drop the death penalty. In a military decision to abandon a capital case, it can be made by the prosecutor, the judge or a jury made up of U.S. military officers. Martha. MACCALLUM: Great. Fascinating background, Trace. Thank you very much. So, my next guest, Dr. James Mitchell, interrogated KSM for the CIA, and detailed all of those encounters in his book, Enhanced Interrogation, which is a fascinating read, and he joins me now. Dr. Mitchell, good to have you back on the program tonight. When I read this report I was stunned. After all of these years, they are now going to claim that he has brain damage at the hands of the CIA? DR. JAMES MITCHELL, INTERROGATED 9/11 MASTERMIND: Well, nothing his attorneys do surprises me. Basically, it's obvious that he's guilty. Everybody knows that he's guilty. And I know it's flippant to say that, but it's true. And now, they're just looking for some way to save his life. So, we have to step back and ask ourselves what is their motivation? Well, their motivation, obviously, is to prep the battlefield to make this -- legal battlefield, to make him appear a victim, to make it appear like he's more human, and to set the grounds for some kind of plea agreement that doesn't involve the death penalty. MACCALLUM: All right. So, you interrogated him. You water boarded him with others in the room, and you walled him, which is that process of slamming him against the wall. Do you. MITCHELL: Stop that. Stop that. Don't even say that. We did not. MACCALLUM: Please correct me. Correct me. Explain walling. MITCHELL: We did not slam his head against the wall. You know, and that's the thing that gets repeatedly said. And, in fact, he was walled no harder than we wall our own soldiers. And there were specifically things that were put in place by the CIA to ensure that the kind of head damage that he's alleging couldn't have occurred. Let me just kind of go through it. There was a special collar that was wrapped around his neck to specifically prevent his head from hitting the wall and to stop whiplash. In addition to that, he was evaluated by physicians when he arrived at the site before the interrogations, during the interrogations. I mean, immediately after interrogations if they looked particularly harsh, routinely, during his stay there, when he was prepared to leave to go to another site and immediately on arrival to the new site. So, there was plenty of opportunity -- and I would point out to your viewers that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other people who destroyed 3,000 Americans and many, many others around the country, including dismembering Daniel Pearl, just because he was Jewish, we see better medical care than our veterans with less wait time, by the way, and better medical care than the average American. I just don't buy this idea that he's suffering from some kind of a brain damage. MACCALLUM: And as you point out, you all painstakingly documented and did scans, and took measures to make sure that this didn't happen to him. Do you have -- is there. MITCHELL: I don't know if they did MRI's. But the point is, that they had physicians observe -- in addition to the evaluations, they had physicians observing the interrogations whose primary task was to prevent that kind of damage from happening as a result -- they could stop the interrogations at any point. And, at one time, stopped an interrogation because the detainee's feet were swollen. MACCALLUM: Yeah. You know, as you point out, this is not a person who cared when he killed thousands of American citizens, and now they're fighting to save his life. And I'm sure you're right that they are just trying to sort of pepper the ground and humanize him in some way, but you make it very clear -- you say that if there's any brain damage in his brain, it didn't come from anything that you folks did. MITCHELL: Well, what we have to keep in mind is that he was a jihadist who fought in jihadi battles for years before he was detained by the CIA. His interrogations took place in two months, March and April of 2003. It's been 15 years. We have no idea what kind of activities he's been involved in since he left CIA custody and went to Guantanamo, or what sort of toxins he was exposed to when he was running around Afghanistan, and Sudan, and Pakistan, and other places. I find it amazing that anyone would think that an MRI could specify that a combatant who had been involved in military received it specifically in some period of months. MACCALLUM: Dr. James Mitchell, fascinating, thank you so much, sir. Good to have you with us tonight. MITCHELL: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, coming up next on The Story, the Boy Scouts of America dropping the word, boy, from their title as they vow to include more girls. Former Boy Scout, Mike Huckabee, has some thoughts on this and he's joining us next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Boy Scout values are American values, and great Boy Scouts become great, great Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: After 108 years, the Boy Scouts of America are changing their name. They'll now be known simply as Scouts BSA, which means Boy Scouts of America, so why? According to the chief scout executive, Mark Surbaugh, we're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and women. In fact, over 3,000 girls have already joined the Boy Scouts. There is, of course, the Girl Scouts as well, and they're still the Girl Scouts, they're not too happy about this. Here to react is Governor Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor, Fox News contributor, and former Boy Scout. No doubt, I'm sure you were an excellent Boy Scout, Governor Huckabee, what do you think about this? MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the Boy Scouts are effectively dead. Look, I don't think a lot of people care whether girls have the opportunity to do some of the same things boys do, but there's always been a reason that these activities were conducted separately by the genders, because it gave them an identity, it gave them something to grow into and camaraderie and fellowship. The same reason you have fraternities and sororities and they're not necessarily mixed in a college campuses. I know this will come as a real shock to a lot of modern people, but there really is a difference between boys and girls in the way they think, and the way they grow up, and the interests that they have. MACCALLUM: I've got to say, I don't have any problem with this, you know. I think the Boy Scouts -- why not be scouts? Why can't the girls and the boys be scouts together? And, actually, when they get into high school they do divide them up by gender again in this organization. I think it's toughest for the Girl Scouts because they feel betrayed by this, and they feel like it's going to hurt their organization. HUCKABEE: And I think it will hurt their organization. But when you say they're going to go back to gender separation when they're older, that seems to me the most logical time that there wouldn't be gender separation. The time to enjoy that camp out with the guys, and for the girls to do the things that the girls would rather do. MACCALLUM: Well, maybe that is what they're trying to avoid. They don't want the camp out with the boys and the girls, that's the problem. So, they have to separate -- it's pretty obvious why they have to separate them when they get into high school, I would say. HUCKABEE: Yeah. But, I mean, Boy Scouts do the campouts. Look, I don't think it's going to cause the membership to go up. I think it's going to cause the membership to go down. They've lost more than half their members over the past ten years. Girl Scouts are struggling. I don't think this is going to cause a lot of parents to say, gee, that's just what I was hoping for. And I'm not sure what their rationale in doing this was. But, you know, this is their decision. They've made it, here we go. MACCALLUM: You know who was a good girl scout the other night, was your daughter Sarah up on that stage. And she was confronted with a mean. HUCKABEE: She was. MACCALLUM: We don't need to replay. I think everybody has seen enough of what happened there. From a dad's perspective, I'm sure that was not easy for you to watch. What was your take away from it, and how did you think your daughter held up there? HUCKABEE: Well, I think she was absolutely, you know, just calm and collected, and she showed real class. I think the tough part was that she was an invited guest, it was one thing. She knew it was going to be tough, but to put her at the head table and then subject her to that kind of ambush and bullying, I thought was inappropriate. But she handled it well and I'm not surprised. She's a tough kid. MACCALLUM: She is. And I think she, you know, she was so stand up herself. She was a better stand up that night than the comedian. Governor Huckabee, it's always a pleasure to chat with you. Thanks for being on The Story tonight. Quick break, more after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So, we've showed you some of what Rudy Giuliani had to say. You can watch the rest of it tonight with Sean as he sits down with the former mayor of New York. That's our story for tonight. Send us an email with your thoughts at The Story at foxnews.com. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7. Let's go to Tucker, my friend in D.C.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on what was a historic day. You've been hearing a lot about the Trump Putin meeting not a summit, but I guarantee that you'll get analysis here that you're not going to find anywhere else. So stick it right here, stick with us through the hour, you don't want to miss a minute. Plus Raymond Arroyo will be here to tell you about a sick cartoon that was published by the New York Times, it is unbelievable. And back state side anti-police protests in Chicago got violent over the weekend after a police shooting. Mark Furman breaks down the surprising revelation in the officers' body camp footage. And Judge Jeanine will tell us how things are only going to get worse for those anti-Trump texting FBI lovebirds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. But first, Trump and Putin go to Helsinki, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. For three hours today, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met a summit in Helsinki. And though the meeting's now in the history books, the fall out and the political tax have just begun. Now so much of the commentary today was devoid of even the slightest hint of context or history, so we thought we'd try to rectify that tonight. He was following a strategy that he's used effectively with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and the President of course was gracious and chummy with Vladimir Putin today. President Trump prefers to turn on the charm in person while using the hammer and sickle behind the scenes. But the president made his objective clear, he was there to begin a true reset of our relationship with Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. As president I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics or the media or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I think that was my favorite line of today, well written. The two leaders did hit on a range of keys issues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity, nuclear proliferation. We discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I spent a great deal of time talking about it (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And indeed it was on that subject of Russian interference in our election that the president gave kind of a verbal gift to his critics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: My people came to me, Dan Coats, came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have just have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I would say this, I don't see any reason why it would be. I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Don't use the words strong and powerful. Immediately following the presser though, you would have thought that Trump actually would have defected to Russia given the mass hysteria. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: You have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president. DAVID GERGEN, CNN HOST: He's with someone like Putin who is a thug, a world class thug, that he sides with him again and again against his own country's interests. JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR: You have the president. The leader of the free world, taking the word of Vladimir Putin who from all accounts inside the US government, the US intelligence committee, the law enforcement community, attacked American democracy in 2016. They came across as playmates on a soccer field. JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: You should call this the surrender summit . (END VIDEO CLIPS) INGRAHAM: Surrender? Now, did I miss something today? Did Donald Trump withdraw U.S. sanctions on Russia? Or did he invite those 60 diplomats and others he expelled in March from Russia? Did he cancel future sales of lethal weapons to the Ukraine? Of course he didn't. But he might as well have given the media and Liberal hyperbole on what happened today. Today's Obama's CIA director John Brennan tweeted in part, \u2018Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors. It was nothing short of treasonous' Why doesn't anybody laugh about that? And why did not one call it surrender, by the way, when in 2009 President Obama nicks the UN missile defense shield that was to be built in Poland. Was that a surrender to Putin? Or was it a surrender or collusion when Obama asked Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev for a little favor until the 2012 election was over? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility. DMITRY MEDVEDEV, RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER: I understand. I'll transmit this information to Vladimir. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I mean they're holding hand and practically spooning. What was that? A profile in patriotism? I don't recall the media kicking up a fuss when Obama joined the Cuban dictator Raoul Castro for a baseball game or normalize relations with that murderous regime, by the way, a puppet of Russia. Now you can also say this, Trump clearly should not have created any semblance of moral equivalency between our intelligence, even if it has its flaws it does, and the assurances of Vladimir Putin. As the recent indictments of Russian agents alleged, there was meddling in the election by partisan members of congressional panels concluded that, so did our director of national intelligence. But it also, no sense, that it affected the outcome of the 2016 election and no Americans were named in last week's indictment. So President Trump probably should have said it that way, addressed it that way. Instead he kind of committed an unforced error. But look, the president is right, at the same time be frustrated by the anvil that the deep state has hung around his neck for two years now. First the elements within the FBI, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok and now Mueller and his ever expanding team. And we know inside the DOJ they basically protected Hillary Clinton while attempting to damn and undermine the legitimacy of Trump's election. And this gnaws at the president and it perhaps explains why he let those wounds get the better of him today. But it is a good thing to improve our relationship with Russia and at the same time we cannot appear to buy their obvious deception while we're standing on the world stage. I'm doing a lot of well, at the same times, but this is a complicated thing and I think while insulting Putin on camera like doing that, Donald Trump versus Vladimir Putin on a total insult fest, that wouldn't have accomplished anything. At the same time, there are other subtler ways to make our concerns and our objections known and the president should have taken that path. US national intelligence director Dan Coats issued a statement in the wake of the summit today. He said the following, \"We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy. And we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security\" Now setting aside the overly dramatic reactions and even the president's at times poor and unfortunate word choice, let's look for a moment at what Trump is substantively doing vis-.-vis Russia. He's building up the military, key. At a NATO Summit, he called out the German-Russian Nord Stream pipeline. In March of this year he imposed sanctions on five Russian entities and 19 individuals for interfering in the 2016 election. The media don't like to remind you of that one of course, that doesn't fit their narrative. And of course he closed the Russian conflict in Seattle. And as I eluded to earlier, he expelled Russian diplomats and suspected spies, 60 of them. So if Trump is Putin's poodle. He has a real weir way of showing it. As writer Russell Meade said in American Interests last year, if Trump really was a Russian mole, he would be doing things like the following, limiting tracking as much as possible. Blocking oil and gas pipelines. Cutting U.S. military spending and trying to tamp down tensions with Russia's ally Iran. But Trump's doing none of that so the selective indignation on the left is truly hilarious. They keep changing their stories. For decades, they favored a conciliatory stance first toward the Soviet Union, then toward the Russian Federation. And now they're all pretending to care about Russia and casting Trump as a Putin surrogate. But it's good to remember just a few years ago how certain Liberals reacted when then presidential candidate Mitt Romney suggested that Russia was a foe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War's been over for 20 years. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY : In many of the areas where we are working to solve problems Russia has been an ally. JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Romney's answer I thought, was incredibly revealing. He acts like he still thinks the cold war is still on. Russia is still our major adversary, I don't know where he's been. JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Mitt Romney acts like he's only seen Russia by watching Rocky IV. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: So which is it? Should we be getting closer to Russia and Putin or should we have a dynamic of constant confrontation and hostility? The Liberals change their views clearly depending on which party has the White House. I think in the end what really matters is how Trump handles the Russian relationship going forward. So despite some of these verbal missteps, the president has already put us, I think, in a better position by engaging Russia and opening dialogue. It's just a start and that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is Scott Uelhinger a former CIA officer based in Russia, Steven Yates the former deputy assistant to Dick Chaney in international security affairs and here in the studio is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Matt your reaction. MATT SCHLAPP, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yeah I think what you said really captures it which is the most important part of this is the policy. Should we be getting along with Putin's Russia? Absolutely. The idea that we have Liberals calling for open warfare is absurd. By the same token, it's fair to criticize the president today. He had some errant answers. He gave some answers that are actually uncoupled from his own foreign policy. I think if we go back to what important, looking at the policy, I think he's got it dead on right. INGRAHAM: Scott your time in Russia as a CIA officer watching Vladimir Putin, you see he never really left the KGB behind. He's crafty, he's very canny, savvy the way he answers his questions. Turns them around on the journalists and so forth but what was your big takeaway from today, the media focusing on Trump's seeming to draw moral equivalence between US Intel services and Putin's assurances? SCOTT UELHINGER, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Well as you had said Laura, the selective outrage of the Liberal media is breath-taking to behold. They criticize President Trump onus as if he was sending $150 billion on a palette to Iran, for example. But in fact our polices directed against Russia are considerably stronger than they were a decade ago and it's starting to tell. Another key point that perhaps you missed was that our present energy policy. Our energy policy of increasing our exploiting of natural gas to Northern Europe is in fact undercutting Russian natural gas and hurting them where they live. It's depriving President Putin of the revenue he needs from mischief making abroad. So our polices are working and in this case, deeds speak stronger than the occasional gaps of the US president. INGRAHAM: Yeah Scott I think if Donald Trump were up there and just started lobbying insults at Putin, I think that gives Putin a real PR victory at home. Because he can go home and say, \"Look we've gotten so much under their skin. Look I stood up to the President\" But you use that for your nationalist gains at home. I lived in the Soviet Union in the old days in 1983 for a semester in college and that was when Andropov was president, that was in the real dark days of the quickie presidential terms back then. But the idea that he was just going lobby insults at him, that is just ridiculous, unrealistic. We don't do that with President Xi, Obama didn't and as far as I can tell neither did Bush. We rolled out the red carpet and China took 50 million of our personnel files during the Obama administration, I've never even heard him talk about it. UELHINGER: That's right and another thing to remember is that we have an unprecedented, incredibly biased press. Now I can't imagine right now if there was, at the Reykjav\u00ack Summit, if President Reagan and Gorbachev having a western media that would be asking Reagan in front of the world's cameras to denounce the leader, in this case Gorbachev as a liar to his face. Because this shows that the progressive mainstream media is more willing to grenade throw in the name of derailing Trump that it is in supporting any positive movement in relations. INGRAHAM: Let's get Stephen in on this. Stephen when Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an evil empire the left went crazy. \"You're sable rattling\" They called him Ronny Reagun, we're going to talk to Craig Surely, a biographer shortly about this about this. They went nuts and it was kicking the hornet's nest with the Soviet Union, we should get along with the Soviet Union. That was during the Cold War now we're post-Cold War, we still have challenges, but now they want to get tough on Russia. I was just howling at those because for those of us who were around this town in the 80s and if we worked in the Reagan administration, you couldn't get a break with the left and is dealings with the Soviet Union. But now they want to set up a shadow government. I want to play something for you Stephen for you to react to. This is Phillip Mudd, former CIA man under Obama, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP MUDD, CNN ANALYST: FBI Director continues the investigation, department of justice continues to support the investigation, congress continues saying that this investigation is legitimate. Curios point in American government, when do we see almost a shadow American government come out and say, \"We cannot side with the government\"? Whether it's the cabinet or the senate, I think that's the big question. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Stephen shadow government needs to form to apparently undue the presidential election. Your reaction. STEPHEN YATES, FORMER WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Well where's a former Obama CIA director calling treason when you need him because that's actually what that would be. And I think we've really really run the limits on absolute Trump derangement syndrome across the board on how people react to this kind of thing. But really I think the President was trying to do two hard things at one time today and it might have been what's tripped up some of the communications. I agree completely on the strategy side of it that you got in the Angle. He's restoring realism, trying to get great power relations back on track, balancing one power against another to try to solve real problems. The proof of this is results, not in instantaneous sound bites but he's also the deal maker. He wants something now and he's jumping in there and I think the deal maker in him used some traits there in the presser that complicated things. And I think he's doing very well on the longer term strategy. INGRAHAM: Fascinating. Matt this is what the media were saying today about what the Intel chiefs should be doing here in the United States should be doing in reaction to what we saw in Helsinki, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: President Trump basically said he believes Vladimir Putin over his intelligence committee. Should the director of national intelligence Dan Coats resign in protest? JAKE SULLIVAN, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO JOE BIDEN: I think the right thing for Dan Coats to do would be to send a clear message and say he can no longer serve this president. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBS HOST: How does Gina Haspel stay on the job? How does Dan Coats stay on the job? He has now rebuked their professional assessment of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Everyone's got to resign apparently because Trump had that press conference. SCHLAPP: President Trump is trying to do what the previous administration tried remember the reset button. Remember your clip about Medvedev-- INGRAHAM: He went like this Matt. He held Medvedev's hand. Can you imagine if Trump held Vladimir Putin's had today? I will translate that to Vladimir later, thank you very much Mr President. SCHLAPP: When other presidents try to start the relationship off on the right foot, they're called warriors for peace. Donald Trump tries to do that and he's called deranged. Look, I agree with you, he had some answers that were off the mark but the policy is right. The president needs to understand he's winning on this, stick to the course. INGRAHAM: He's winning on this and I think there are two things you can hold in your mind at the same time. Number one, having a better relationship with Russia. I've heard Bill Richardson say that on TV today. We had Obama say it, Hillary say, Bush said it. He drove around in his pickup truck with Vladimir Putin, remember that at Crawford? SCHLAPP: He looked into his heart remember that INGRAHAM: And he saw his soul but see I think you could have those two thoughts in your mind. A better relationship with Russia and also have a clear eye view of what Russia's complex history, they're very proud people. They love the motherland as the glory days. They think they don't want them to be behind them but the economy has shrunk, their population is shrinking. They're on many in ways on the decline and they're not the threat that China is to us. I mean they're economy, what is it? Half the size of California's I mean it's ridiculous. YATES: Europe's economy dwarfs that of Russia at this point and that's what made it even more laughable when they were having discussions about NATO and whether European countries should pay their fair share. And I think if Nixon can go to China during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with literally dozens and dozens of millions of Chinese people were killed by their own government. INGRAHAM: 60 million. YATES: And we can talk about geopolitics and real things that need to change in the world because even more lives are at stake if we don't, that's what going on. When you're talking about the nuclear stock pile, it's not just whether Russia uses it, it's whether Russia sells it and proliferates it and so that's the stakes. INGRAHAM: All right fascinating panel. Thank you all, great perspectives. By the way president Trump and Putin are each speaking separately with Fox News tonight but can the US Russia relationship be repaired given the partisan politics here at home. Answers next. Oh boy the drama from today's Trump Putin Summit didn't stop at the press conference. The two leaders each sat down with Fox News this evening. Here's President Trump speaking with Sean Hannity about the impediments to change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: 90 percent of the nuclear power in the world between these two nations and we've had a phony witch hunt deal drive us apart. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: This is the biggest wedge. This was the biggest wedge. TRUMP: It was. It's the thing that he told me when he went in. He said, \"What a shame\" He felt it was hard for me to make a deal because of all of this nonsense. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Meanwhile Vladimir Putin was pressed by Chris Wallace about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: You really believe that someone from acting from the Russian territory could have influenced the United States and influenced the choice of millions of Americans, this utterly ridiculous. CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm not asking about it-- (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining us now for reaction, Ian Bremmer the President and founder of the Urasia Group. Monica Crowely from the London Centre for Policy Research along with Ariel Cohen, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Ariel, let's start with you. You heard the Angle, my view on the Angle, some verbal missteps but the substantive policy coming out of this administration toward Russia in my mind is quite realistic and pragmatic given the difficulties with Russia, the challenges, the deception and also a hope for a better future. ARIEL COHEN, SENIOR FELLOW AT THE ATLANTIC FELLOW: Well definitely we should all hope for the better future. However to expect that Russia is somehow going to change. That they're going to address a terrible crisis in Ukraine, occupation and axation of a Crimea is not realistic. So probably Mr Trump is trying to several things, one he is addressing the nuclear issue. We all need some kind of arms control. Second, I think he's trying to detach Russia from China, good luck with that but if you didn't try you won't know. INGRAHAM: They think that that's a pretty big deal because China's a real threat to the United States-- COHEN: It's a huge deal, nobody's talking about it. China is a huge competitor economically, geopolitically-- INGRAHAM: What's the size of China's economy compared to Russia? Give me the rough estimate? Eight times, ten times? Yeah about that, it dwarfs Russia's economy. COHEN: Roughly, China is probably eight times bigger. It's getting closer to our economy, that's the problem and they're catching up in a number of technologies that are absolutely vital. INGRAHAM: He wants to triangulate China, Russia, does he not? That's part of what he wants to do. COHEN: He's not explaining that and then he getting attacked. But I think the main problem I had watching this summit, watching these dynamics is not the policy but presentation by Mr Trump who now is in a unique position of fighting the intelligence community and fighting most of the media. INGRAHAM: Ian IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT OF EURASIA GROUP AND GZERO MEDIA: I do believe that trying to get the Russians long term on side of the United States against China would be a smarter strategy. China frankly is going to overwhelm Russia economically, demographically but the ability, as Ariel said, of the Americans to do that at this point is really zero. Furthermore if you want Trump to try and triangulate China, you'd want the south pacific partnership. You'd want a good relationship with America's allies and Europe. You'd want a good relationship with America's allies and Japan, Trump's not working on any of those things so-- INGRAHAM: Oh our relationship with Japan is very strong. COHEN: It was. INGRAHAM: Our relationship with the NATO allies from Merkel to Macron even to Theresa May, they all seemed to be positive coming out of that summit. Even the NATO secretary general when he was pressed by Christiane Amanpour, she was trying to get them to say, he said it was a very good summit for us. So they're all lying? COHEN: I was that was true. No of course not. They're being diplomatic because they don't want to break NATO and I', not saying that not true. INGRAHAM: They're got to pay their fair share and the American-- COHEN: I'm not saying that that's not true. I'm just saying that if Trump is trying to build an alliance vis-.-vis China which I think we all believe it's the most important strategic thing to do he's not gone about that very effectively. Look, his foreign policy is not his nag, it's not easy. INGRAHAM: Well he's new to it. In a few moments we're going to hear about some of the major foreign policy blunders by presidents when a lot more was at stake, even at this. But he's a year and half into it so let's see what happens-- COHEN: What I would have liked Laura today, most importantly would have been for him to listen to his advisors. It would have been that two hour meeting at the beginning because he's new to it, not to try and do it by himself. But instead actually have the people around him that are trying to work the United States long term. INGRAHAM: Yeah the bilat stuff that they did simultaneously and beforehand I think I heard was very very positive. But Monica look some of these points are well taken and I think all panel here all believes that China here is the real threat to the United States long-term militarily, it's the largest standing army. The economy's going to dwarf ours, stealing our technology, the South China Sea, they're moving into Africa and beyond. But nevertheless Obama back in 2016 I think it was October or December of 2016, he was talking about the fact that he didn't confront Vladimir Putin on this Russian meddling when he could have confronted it as president. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: It's not like Putin's going around the world publicly saying, \"Look what we did, it wasn't that clever\" He denied it so the idea that somehow public shaming is going to be effective I think doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well. (END VIDEO CLUP) INGRAHAM: All right Monica, few of us on the panel lived in Soviet Union for shorter periods of time or longer periods of time and the idea of shaming Russia on the world stage, I think Obama was right there. You don't get anything from the Russians by shaming them, I think that gives Putin a huge victory at home. Ariel might disagree but Monica your shot at this, Obama was kind of interesting what he said there bit the media seemed to forget this. MONICA CROWLEY, LONDON CENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH: Well yes that's exactly right. The Obama administration was made aware including all the way up to the president himself, certainly during the spring months and then later of 2016, that the Russians were engaged in these active measures to disrupt the American electoral process. What we also forget is that the Russians targeted the Republican National Committee servers and their sort of computerized systems. They weren't able to penetrate those but they were able to penetrate the DNC's. The idea somehow that all of this is new, we know that the Russians have been actively engaged in trying to disrupt American elections, Western elections, really since the advent of the cold war. What different now is that they have these cyber capabilities that take it to a whole other level. INGRAHAM: And they're serious. This is serious. CROWLEY: And they're serious yes. And so while I really support the president's attempt to try and press the reset button with the Russian relationship unlike Mrs Clinton and President Obama and they're failed attempt, I support the overall effort. But the core strength of the American president's power is his moral authority and I would have liked to have seen a stronger public statement on behalf of the president to condemn this. I mean we remember in 2009 Laura, when the Iranian people rose up against the Iranian regime, we pounded President Obama for not at least speaking a word of moral support for them. I would have liked to have seen the president give some moral statement against what the Russians have done, not just to us but to our allies. INGRAHAM: And that's why, Ariel, we pounded Obama when he said to Medvedev, held his hand and said give us more flexibility after the election, I'll transmit your views to Vladimir. We pounded that. The Democrat, the media ignored him. What does flexibility mean? What did he mean by that? We never got an answer. COHEN: But Laura, if you remember President Reagan, he took the high moral ground. He talked about their shining city on the hill, and he also improved the relationship with the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union was ready for that. And I think that model should guard Mr. Trump as well. IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT EURASIA GROUP: Let's just be clear that there are a bunch of things that people were concerned that Trump was going to do that he didn't do. He didn't actually say that Ukraine is done. He didn't actually say that Crimea is Russian. He didn't actually say the Americans are going to stop military exercises in the Baltic. He didn't actually say the Americans are going to pull troops out of Syria. For all of the moral equivalency and the statecraft that he should not of done, the fact that the content of the U.S.-Russian relations today are exactly the same as they were yesterday, and that is an appropriate thing. INGRAHAM: Substance versus verbal missteps. Interesting. We'll see how it goes going forward. And by the way, one of the biggest things missing from today's summit, historical context. But we've got an esteemed presidential historian to go through all that noise. We're going to take a look at The New York Times ugly cultural narrative being created about the summit with Raymond Arroyo next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: While the left and the media are going into absolute hysterics over today's meeting between Trump and Putin, let's put this summit in some historical context. Bestselling author and Ronald Reagan historian Craig Shirley joins me with more. Craig, as you watched this unfold today, did it remind you of any mistakes by rookie presidents in the past? CRAIG SHIRLEY, REAGAN HISTORIAN: Sure. Thank you, Laura. It reminded me in some ways of Kennedy at Vienna with Khrushchev in 1961. They got into a free for all debate over the merits of the western system versus the east. Kennedy couldn't mount an effective defense of the free market or democracy, and Khrushchev came away from the summit very, very unimpressed with Kennedy's performance, which a lot of people thought -- a lot of a historians thought at the time emboldened Khrushchev to keep going with the Berlin crisis and later build the wall, and later thereafter to put missiles into Cuba. Fortunately Kennedy found his steel and forced the missiles out. But it was a disastrous summit by all accounts. Obviously Yalta, also for FDR was also a disaster. He went in there thinking Joe Stalin was a good guy, I'm going to give him what he wants, and I'm not going to ask anything in return. And we ceded millions of people to the eastern bloc, millions of people in now the Warsaw Pact countries who ended up living under enslavement under the Soviet Union for many years. INGRAHAM: What about Nixon and Brezhnev? One of his summits was kind of a disaster. SHIRLEY: Nixon gave too much away to Brezhnev. Nixon and Kissinger were interested in a good photo op, they were interested in the trophy on the wall. Nixon gave grain sales to the Soviets, he gave loan guarantees to the Soviets, didn't really ask anything in return. That was the point, is that Reagan understood what these other presidents didn't understand. The Soviets will take and take and take until you draw a line in the sand. Back in 1964 Reagan understood this in his famous speech for Barry Goldwater. This is that the Soviet Union -- and he knew this from his days in Hollywood fighting off Soviet provocateurs with the Hollywood trade unions -- is the Soviets will never stop until somebody stands up to them. And that is what Reagan understood, what FDR only understood in the last couple weeks of his life where he admitted to a reporter before he passed away that it was a mistake to trust Joseph Stalin. Carter found out he was dismay it was a mistake to trust Brezhnev because within weeks of the SALT-II treaty being signed the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. That's what Trump needs to understand is that the culture, whether it's a Soviets or the Russians, it doesn't matter. They respect strength, they abhor weakness, and you have to deal with them for a position of strength. INGRAHAM: So how would you have advised him to have handled this today differently? SHIRLEY: Well, I would have pointed out the areas of agreement, pointed out the need to keep talking, pointed at the fundamental differences between the United States and Russia, and that there are things that could not be overcome whatsoever. And it's just a fact of life. He should have dealt with my position of strength and not undermined his own intelligence agencies. He can clean this up. Kennedy cleaned it up, FDR didn't, obviously, he passed away. But he can make amends, he can make repairs to this. The point, I think, Laura, is that the mistakes that Trump may today aren't earthshaking. INGRAHAM: They are not substantive. That was the point in my Angle. They are not substantive. They are verbal. It's an approach and tone, which, it is what it is now but he didn't agree to substantive caves is on key issues. We have a pretty realistic, tough approach to Russia. And he just thinks we should try to figure out ways to work together, which is what Obama said, Bush said, Clinton wanted, they all wanted this. And none of it came too much fruition. But Craig, the historical part of this is so important, and I so much appreciate you joining us tonight. If it didn't happen in \"The New York Times\" today, most people think it never happened. So we really appreciate your insight. Thanks so much. By the way, another story, \"The New York Times,\" about how vicious things are getting, recently published his bizarre, idiotic video about the Trump- Putin meeting that some are calling gross and even homophobic. \"New York Times\" bestselling author and Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo is here with reaction. Raymond, what is this all about? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is part of a series that The New York Times opinion page has mounted. They have three installments. It's called \"Trump Bites.\" And this particular video, and again, this is all about narrative, OK. This is what the pop culture and people who aren't focused on policy take away. This one is called \"Trump and Putin, A Love Story.\" I'll read you the description. The not so secret admiration for Vladimir Putin plays out in a teenager's bedroom where the fantasies of this forbidden romance come to life. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have a relationship with Vladmir Putin? TRUMP: I do have a relationship with him. A lot of people would say he's put himself at the forefront of the world as a leader. Russia is like -- I mean, they are really hot stuff. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh, my God, -- ARROYO: We can't show you much more of it. INGRAHAM: Oh, my God. It's stupid. ARROYO: The point is, Laura this is the narrative they are trying to portray, and they are getting a lot of pushback today. I've been flipping through The New York Times opinion pages. On July 7th -- or 6th, rather, they posted a story, \"Why Scarlett Johansson should not play a transman.\" She was about to play transgendered man and a movie. Now, their argument was you can't have someone who is not transgendered playing a transgendered character. So why is it OK to have two straight men in what is essentially a gay romantic comedy? A lot of people are pushing back, including LGBT activists. And I think you have a tweet there for a rather prominent writer. INGRAHAM: Here is the -- we have a tweet by -- this is funny. I have to put this together. We have a tweet by -- no, we have a sound bite by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Should we play that now? ARROYO: No, no, no, go to Mike Drucker. It's Mike Drucker's tweet. I don't have it in front of me. INGRAHAM: Here it is. Sorry. Here it is. It says \"Congrats to everyone doing gay jokes about Trump and Putin, throwing your own beliefs under the bus for a political cartoon they'll never see.\" I see what you're saying. They get caught in their own petard here. ARROYO: And look, people are very upset about this in the gay community, and rightfully so. They are making light of their lifestyle. And in addition to those, if you are the president and you know this narrative is out there, and it's in the pop culture, and it's in movies, I'm going to show you another clip in a moment of a show called \"Our Cartoon President,\" Stephen Colbert's show on Showtime, they too make the same argument. So why you fall into the trap and give them real ammo when your substance tells a very different story? Watch this. This is from \"Our Cartoon President.\" INGRAHAM: I don't think -- we don't have that actually. But the point is well taken. Hold on. The point is well taken. \"The New York Times\" is declining in readership, declining and influence, and this was a Twitter deal they did with this stupid, idiotic cartoon video. It's moronic. It's offensive of course, but it's moronic. This is where journalism has gone. It's all one big \"Saturday Night Live\" spoof video. It's embarrassing, it really is. ARROYO: My problem is I think people want an escape. They don't want to see this stuff. And if you look at the top-rated movies of the weekend, Laura, it was \"Hotel Transylvania\" and \"Antman\" because we've got a lot of monsters around, and heroes are smaller than ever. INGRAHAM: Exactly. And ahead -- thank you, Raymond -- a big-time protest in Chicago over a police shooting, but you won't believe what the police body cam showed footage actually shows. We'll have the full story next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Two-hundred-and-sixty-one, that's how many people have been murdered in Chicago this year, and most of it happening in minority communities on the city's west and south sides. It's an ongoing American tragedy, yet you don't see many protests demanding change. Unless of course a police officer is involved. And on Saturday, officers shot and killed 37-year-old Harith Augustus following a confrontation. A violent protest quickly broke out, and Chicago police say four officers were injured from the demonstrators throwing rocks and bottles, some of which were filled with urine. Police swiftly released body cam footage of the encounter which appears to show Mr. Augustus with a holstered gun around his waist. Protests continued tonight, however. Joining me now for reaction is former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman. So Mark, based on what you have seen in this body cam footage, I've had a chance to watch it a couple of times, do you think these protesters tonight have a legitimate beef? MARK FUHRMAN, FORMER LAPD DETECTIVE: Laura, once again we have a false narrative. Just like in the Michael Brown shooting, you have a false narrative of his hands were up, he was running away, not running towards the officer, but there was nobody camera. Now Superintendent Johnson in Chicago immediately released, something that is really out of protocol and really actually harms an investigation, but he did it do try to save exactly what is happening. And this body cam is the view of an officer in a tactical situation that is crystal clear, something that you will rarely ever see again, crystal-clear, and everything there is the evidence that points to a justified police shooting. I am in shock that the public in Chicago is up in arms about this man acting as he did, armed, with four officers. INGRAHAM: Isn't it the case, Mark, that there's such a level of distrust that it's fomented by some actions on the part of the police but also mostly by these Black Lives Matter protests and organizers who come in and immediately start to stoke public outrage about these incidents. They call for the mayor's resignation -- I am no fan of Rahm Emanuel, but they are calling for his resignation tonight, the resignation of other top city officials, saying they are violating the ongoing I guess consent decree with the government. There is real damage done again, and everyone seems to be afraid to call this what it is. It's crime and reaction to an unfortunate, awful situation. But a lot of these protests turn into criminal activity over the weekend. FUHRMAN: Absolutely. But let's not forget the suspect precipitated his own death. He had many opportunities where he didn't have to have to die, and he chose to do what he did, and he did die. But when you look at this narrative of Black Lives Matter, it is the boy who cried wolf. And pretty soon nobody is going to listen when there is really an incident where they actually should take up protests and actually demonstrate their power to actually get justice. This is not the case. INGRAHAM: And they are comparing this, Mark, to Laquan McDonald, that case, of course, saying this is another police cover up. They're not going to believe the video that is released, they don't believe that. You see stuff online that's all fake, it's a fake video made by the police, it's not really what happened. It's another Laquan McDonald situation. FUHRMAN: The police and the city government of Chicago should just ignore them then. If they are not going to be reasonable and look at body cam footage, you can't do anything more with police officers then put a camera on their chest and have you view what the officer views and actually see the action the officer takes against the suspect and the reaction of the suspect. You can't do anything more. If they are not satisfied with that, then stop placating their demands. Just stop listening. INGRAHAM: And remember, \"hands up don't shoot,\" even when that was proven to be complete malarkey, they still have that in protest signs, \"hands up, don't shoot\" from the Michael Brown case. Mark Fuhrman, thank you so much, always great to have you on. And Lisa Page meeting with members of Congress for a second day of private testimony. So did her lover Peter Strzok fail to tell the truth during his testimony last week? Judge Jeanine Pirro joins us next to analyze. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER STRZOK, FBI AGENT: I think it's important when you look at those texts that you understand the context in which they were made and the things that were going on across America. In terms of the texts that we will stop it, you need to understand that that was written late at night, off-the-cuff, and it was in response to a series of events that included then candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: God, I can't stand him. Sorry. That was Peter Strzok last week telling members of Congress his own text messages about Donald Trump really didn't mean anything. But his former lover, Lisa Page, after two days of private meetings with members of Congress, may be painting a different picture. Listen to Congressman Matt Gaetz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: I found Lisa Page to be far more credible than Peter Strzok. I didn't agree with your characterization of every text message and every piece of evidence, but we did not see the smug attitude from Lisa Page that we saw from Peter Strzok. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now with reaction is Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro, who is also the author of the brand-new book \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals,\" I love the alliteration, \"The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" Judge Jeanine, congrats on the book, first of all. And your book dovetails perfectly into what we have seen with Strzok and Page. But you heard Matt Gaetz and Mark Meaders kind of effusive in their praise of her, saying I wouldn't with everything, but she seemed to contradict what Peter Strzok said on the meanings of some of these text messages. JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE: First of all, Laura, thank you for having me on. And my book, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals\" talks about Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, and all of these people at the higher echelon of the FBI. But you know what's amazing to me. This guy, Peter Strzok, goes before Congress, and in an unapologetic, defiant, sarcastic, smug way, says none of you Congressmen and women, you can't believe your lying eyes, just because I said it, I didn't mean what I said, when in truth, what he said as the textbook definition of bias. So now we've got Lisa Page. And some of these congresspeople are more effusive about her, finding her to be more credible. That's no surprise. There was very little of what Strzok said that was credible. But what was so telling to me, Laura, was they said that there was a suggestion that based upon her testimony, the FBI desired a specific outcome. We don't know yet because we don't have the transcript, and honestly, I don't know why we don't and we probably should. But I think it would be fascinating to see the two of them together testifying and finding out what her interpretation was and his, although with this is plain English. We can both read it and figure out what they were saying. They don't like Donald Trump, they didn't want him elected, and the insurance policy was to prevent him from getting elected, or in the event he got elected, making sure that he would be faced with some kind of investigation, which would be the basis for impeachment. INGRAHAM: This is what Mark Meadows tweeted today after this behind closed doors testimony. He said \"Remarkably, we learned new information today suggesting the DOJ had not notified Lisa Page of Congress' outstanding interview request for over seven months now. The DOJ/FBI appeared to be continuing their efforts to keep material facts and perhaps even witnesses from Congress.\" Judge Jeanine, your reaction to that? That's a wild revelation. I don't think we should have any reason to lie about that. She would be held in contempt if she didn't show up on Friday and continuing today, but they didn't tell her? PIRRO: But Laura, this is part of what the left does! It's like Hillary saying \"I was never subpoenaed on Benghazi.\" Sure you were subpoenaed. Who are you kidding? But we've got a Department of Justice now, Laura, and an FBI that is covering its tracks, that is more interested in protecting its own flanks and not being exposed than it is in confronting and identifying the truth. And unfortunately, we've got a Department of Justice run by a guy named Rod Rosenstein who was part of the swamp. He's part of the establishment. And so for them not to tell Lisa Page she was subpoenaed doesn't surprise me at all. You've got to clean house and that's the end of it, Laura. And I worry that it's not going to happen. INGRAHAM: It's been far too long. And judge, since I have you on, I want to get your reaction on something else. A federal judge temporarily halting the deportation of family units who were reunited after being separated by the Trump administration. Is this judge, by the way, a George W. Bush appointee, overstepping his legal bounds? A single federal district court judge again halting federal policy in this regard. Your reaction? PIRRO: And make no mistake, the ACLU is going to shop and find a judge who is most receptive to whatever it is they are looking for. But I love about this, Laura, is that the ACLU is looking for a one week delay so that parents who have been reunited with her kids can decide whether or not they want to seek asylum. Wait a minute. What do they want to say? Do they want to just admit they came here illegally and were not seeking asylum in the first place? If, as everyone on the left has been telling us, they are here for asylum, you and I both know they could have gone to port of entry. Now the judge is buying into it, saying I'm going to let them decide if they really want asylum. No, they just want to come illegal, judge -- they either want asylum or they should be deported. INGRAHAM: Everybody's got to go out and get Judge Jeanine's book. She is going to be on my radio show this week. We're going to have a much longer conversation. It's going to be a huge bestseller, \"Liars, Liberals, and Leakers,\" \"Leakers, Liberals, and Liars,\" it's the alliteration. PIRRO: \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals.\" INGRAHAM: They're all good. Judge Jeanine. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: This has been a fun day. Just another slow Monday in Trump land, it's been fun. But I want you to tell us your thoughts about how you thought the Trump-Putin summit went, react to the Angle. I always love to read your tweets, even the nasty ones. It's fine, let it vent, let it all out if it makes you feel better. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"Fox News @ Night\" team are up next with a special encore presentation of Chris Wallace's exclusive sit-down with Vladimir Putin.

            "article_content": "The number of Indians apprehended in El Centro, California has soared from about a dozen in 2013 to over 3,000 so far this year; national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports. The surge of Central Americans crossing into the U.S. claiming asylum is no secret around the world. Just a snapshot of those caught entering on any given day is stunning \u2013 Nigeria, Romania, Nepal \u2013 in addition to the hundreds of Mexicans, Guatemalans and Hondurans. But one of the fastest-growing groups of illegal immigrants come not from the barrios of South America or the slums of Africa, but mega-sized cities in India \u2013 8,000 miles away from the tiny town of El Centro, California, where a handful of Indian nationals are illegally entering the U.S. every day, officials say. \"It's a common misconception that we just arrest Mexicans - that couldn't be further from the truth,\" said El Centro agent Justin Casterhone. \"We arrest people from all over the world.\" Unable to obtain H1b visas, which are given to highly skilled workers, because of a crackdown on the visas by the Trump administration, and because of a fear that Sikhs are coming under attack by fundamentalist groups in their country, Indians are heading to the U.S. -- illegally -- in droves. In 2015, agents caught six immigrants from India trying to cross into the U.S. from Mexico. So far this fiscal year, the figure is already at more than 3,400. The U.S.-Mexican border is divided into nine sectors. The smallest is El Centro, a tiny 70-mile stretch just west of the Arizona-California border. That area has become a conduit for those from India fleeing their country. \"Communication is very, very hard,\" said Casterhone, who like most border agents speaks fluent Spanish, but no Punjabi, the native language.\u00a0\"When trying to communicate, we are gonna have to get the interpreter to get the entire story.\" Agents said they arrest roughly five to 10 Indian nationals a day, with most young men claiming asylum as victims of political or religious persecution. Women, who often belong to a lower class in India's stratified caste system, claim abuse or fear of retribution from families in a higher social class. \"When someone marries beneath their caste, or above their caste, the parents generally get really angry about it and can subject the couple to honor killing,\" said immigration attorney Judith Wood, who has represented and won a number of asylum claims on behalf of Indian nationals.\" Unlike those coming from Central America, who generally flee poverty and seek protection from gangs, most Indians claim persecution based on politics, social group and religion. \u201cPeople who are untouchables, the lowest caste, are basically not allowed to participate fully in society,\" Wood said. \"Among members of the Sikh religion, there's a high incidence of torture.\" Most Central Americans pay an $8,000 smuggling fee to cross through Mexico to the U.S. For Indians, it is considerably more. 2008 Mexicans \u00a040,159 Indians 0 2009 Mexicans\u00a0 32,602 Indians 6 2010 Mexicans \u00a031,704 Indians 11 2011 Mexicans\u00a0 29,474 Indians\u00a0 9 2012 Mexicans\u00a0 22,511 Indians\u00a0 9 2013 Mexicans\u00a0 15,141 Indians\u00a0 13 2014 Mexicans\u00a0 12,511\u00a0 Indians\u00a0 32 2015 Mexicans\u00a0 11,320\u00a0 Indians\u00a0 6 2016 Mexicans 14,361 Indians 1,455 2017 Mexicans 12,821 Indians 2,028 2018 Mexicans 15,885 Indians 3,408 \"Some of these organizations are charging Indian nationals up to $25,000 dollars to get smuggled into the U.S.,\" said El Centro Sector Chief Gloria Chavez. \"These traffickers, they are winning on this. Law enforcement is not.\" Chavez said Indians generally fly to Qatar then Ecuador, then travel on foot or by bus through the jungles of Colombia and Panama, through Central America and Mexico to El Centro. Most know to travel without any documents verifying their identity. \"Many use their lack of identification to claim to be one person in Mexico and another one in the United States,\" she said. \"In Mexico, they claim to be an adult because unaccompanied minors under 18 are arrested. In the U.S., the opposite is true. Here, they claim to be juveniles so they must be released.\" Asylum seekers without a criminal history in the U.S. are typically released. The Indian nationals usually head to the local Sikh Temple for a meal, change of clothes and a bus ticket. From there they will go live with relatives until an immigration judge can hear their case \u2013 typically a year or two later. \"They have the right to migrate wherever they want to go,\" Chavez said. \"But there is a legal way and an illegal way. We want them to do it the legal way.\"",

This is a rush transcript from \"Fox News Sunday,\" October 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. A mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It's an assault on humanity. WALLACE: This, just a day after a man is arrested for sending mail bombs to critics of President Trump, raising new questions about inflammatory political rhetoric that sometimes goes over the edge. (CHANTING) TRUMP: Any acts or threats of political violence -- are an attack on our democracy itself. WALLACE: This hour from the Kavanaugh confirmation to confronting politicians and the angry debate over the migrant caravan, we will look at the growing national divide. We'll have the latest on the alleged mail bomb suspect and on the synagogue slaughter. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a very horrific crime scene. It's one of the worst that I've seen. WALLACE: And we'll talk with the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen. It's a \"Fox News Sunday\" exclusive. Then, we'll break down the battle for the House with the leaders of both party's campaign committee, Republican Steve Stivers and Democrat Ben Ray Lujan. Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about calls for unity amid growing partisan rancor. All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) And hello again from Fox News in Washington. We begin with breaking news. Yet another tragedy in an increasingly divided nation just nine days before the midterm elections. The mass shooting Saturday at a synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 dead and six wounded, including four police officers. Witnesses say the gunman shouted anti-Semitic slurs before firing a semiautomatic rifle. The rampage coming one day after the arrest of a man charged with mailing pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. In a moment, we'll speak with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. But first, to Steve Harrigan outside the federal detention center in Miami where the mail bomb suspect is being held -- Steve. STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, we are getting some new information about this mail bomber, some new details about his personality. \u00a0Family members are describing him as troubled, but many coworkers say he was simply flat out crazy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HARRIGAN: Cesar Sayoc, the suspect behind 14 pipe bombs sent to prominent politicians and critics of President Trump will appear before a federal judge here in Miami Monday before being transferred to New York for prosecution. Sayoc, a onetime stripper, deejay and pizza delivery man was arrested at least 12 times for fraud, theft and drugs. He now faces five federal charges and could be sentenced to 48 years in prison. One day after Sayoc's capture, 46-year-old Robert Bowers brought an assault rifle and three pistols into the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. President Trump condemned the attack as pure evil and said the outcome might have been different with an armed guard. TRUMP: If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. HARRIGAN: The president said he will go to Pittsburgh. (END VIDEOTAPE) HARRIGAN: Both the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter were active on social media, spewing hatred right up to the moment of their attacks -- Chris. WALLACE: Steve Harrigan reporting from Miami. Steve, thanks for that. With a spike in political and now religious violence in the recent days, we want to take a look at the growing divide in our country that seems in ever greater danger of boiling over. Here's FOX News White House correspondent Kevin Corke. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It was a call for peace, but for President Trump, taming America's political tempers might prove to be the heaviest lift yet of his presidency. In the 21-month since Mr. Trump took office, the nation's political climate has become increasingly disruptive, disrespectful, even deadly. The latest temper of the time, a mass shooting at a synagogue and the arrest of a suspect who authorities believe sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to Democrats across the country, a reflection of a political culture now awash in vitriol and venom are letters sent to leaders containing the raw materials for ricin have barely shocked senses. And political players mete out harsh judgments with impunity. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: You tell them they are not welcome anymore anywhere! HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER OBAMA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Michelle always says that, you know, when they go low, we go high. No. No. When they go low, we kick them. TRUMP: Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my kind of -- he's my guy. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: When words stop meaning anything, when truth doesn't matter, when people can just make up facts, then democracy, it doesn't work. CORKE: Just who was at fault for the current political environment is a debate that will be had for some time. What is clear is our need to examine how we got to this point and where we go from here. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: We have some serious political differences at home but our opponents are not evil, they're just our opponents. In the end, we must recognize that we are all Americans. CORKE: Chris? (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: Kevin, thank you. Joining me now, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen. \u00a0Secretary, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday\". KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Thank you. It's my pleasure to be here. WALLACE: Let's start with that terrible synagogue shooting. As you view it now, was this an act of terror, was it a hate crime, and how do we better protect soft targets like a house of worship? NIELSEN: Well, Chris, first let me be clear: this was a pure act of evil. \u00a0You've heard that from the president and vice president yesterday, that's what it is. We all condemn this in the strongest terms possible. And as you know, we do an extraordinary amount of planning and training for active shooter events as well just protection of soft targets and crowded spaces in general. WALLACE: I understand that, in fact, DHS officials had been in this synagogue recently? NIELSEN: Yes. As recently as March, we actually conducted a site visit there with our protective security advisor in the area. This is something we often do. WALLACE: And what's the advice, how to handle an active shooter? Somebody comes in to a service in a synagogue, what can you do? NIELSEN: Well each individual location, each individual event is slightly different and that's why the planning and the training is so important. In such events, there is rarely time to think through roles and responsibilities, the response has got to be automatic and that's where the drills and the workshops that we conduct come in. We've trained over 900,000 officials throughout the country. We will continue to do that. In some cases, the advice is to shelter in place, to some is to orderly evacuate, it depends on the circumstances but you should always listen to the individuals they are in charge who will direct you. WALLACE: Let's turn to the mail bomb case. Is there any evidence at this point that Cesar Sayoc had any help in constructing and sending these bombs? Is there a chance that there is an accomplice who is still at large? NIELSEN: Well, as you know, Chris, investigation is still underway. What I can assure you is if there are additional perpetrators, they will also be brought to justice. The president has directed all federal resources to be on top of this. We are, we continue to work closely through the Secret Service and our Federal Protective Services, with the FBI, and state and local officials and we will bring any and all perpetrators to justice. WALLACE: But, at this point, is there any sign that there is an accomplice? NIELSEN: Well as you know, the FBI and their press conference did announce that one individual has been taken into custody, the rest of the investigation is ongoing, and I know that we will learn more in the hours and days to come. WALLACE: I want to hold up, you can't see it, but I'm going to hold up the front page from \"The Washington Post\" from yesterday about the capture of Cesar Sayoc and it doesn't say suspect arrested, what it says is, \"Bomb Suspect Outspoken Supporter of Trump\". What responsibility do you think President Trump bears for the actions of this individual? NIELSEN: I think the president has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow a political -- political violence to take root in this country. I firmly believe in the First Amendment but anybody who uses the First Amendment as a cover to threaten or commit an act of violence will not be tolerated. There is no place for hate in this country. Hate is hate, violence is violence. We will do all we can at the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that such attacks are not perpetrated. WALLACE: We've been talking in this program about the coarsening of our political discourse. During the height of the family separation controversy, you were at a restaurant where you are heckled as you ate in the restaurant and later protesters went to your home and blasted audio, of crying, migrant children outside your home. A couple of questions, Secretary, what those protesters did, do you think that was over the line? And what do you think -- do you think the president's rhetoric and politics have contributed to the growing incivility and rancor in our politics? NIELSEN: I think that folks, you know -- first of all, to the extent that folks exercise their First Amendment rights, that is protected in our country but there is a line when those choose to use the First Amendment to incite violence, to incite disruption, rather than being constructive, that to have conversations that instead tear Americans apart, I do not support that. I -- you know, there is a time very recently Chris where I daily had to review myself, all of the death threats against the great men and women of the Department of Homeland Security who every day wake up to try to enforce the law and protect other Americans. There is an appropriate way to express your solutions, to express your ideas. I welcome them at all times. But these calls to violence, these calls to disruptions, are not effective, not productive and frankly they just contribute to additional deconstruction of our ability to work together. WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to perhaps your day job. You've got a lot of day jobs. Immigration -- there is a report that the president is considering making a major speech this week in which he will announce that he is sealing the border even to people seeking asylum. On what legal basis could he do that? NIELSEN: I think what the president has been saying and will continue to say and certainly what I have been saying is this caravan is not getting in. There is a legal way to enter this country. Those who choose to enter illegally will be stopped. We are working with our partners in Mexico. They have taken unprecedented efforts within their territory to ensure an orderly flow and that those who have no legal right to be there are removed. We intend to do the same but my general message to this caravan is: Do not come. You will not be allowed in. There is a right way to emigrate to the United States and this is not it. WALLACE: I want to ask -- perhaps drill down on this a little bit with you, Secretary, because according to reports, the president may use the same legal authority he did for the first travel ban, which is Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. I fully understand that people coming from Honduras don't have a right to come into the U.S. illegally but on what basis can you say that this caravan poses a national security threat? NIELSEN: We have a crisis of the border right now. We are stopping between 1,500 and 1,700 people a day, trying to cross illegally into this country. This caravan is one iteration of that but frankly we essentially see caravans every day with these numbers. So, I think what the president is making clear is every possible action, authority, executive program, is on the table to consider, to ensure that it is clear that there is a right and a legal way to come to this country and no other ways will be tolerated. WALLACE: I fully understand that and a lot of people would say that we should reform the laws. So, the question I have is, he's talking specifically about a provision where the president gets to protect national security, we're talking in many cases here about women, about children, about babies, how do they threaten national security? NIELSEN: Well I think there's a couple ways to look at this. What I can tell you is last year alone, we've stopped 3,000 -- so first let me back up and let's talk about the caravan, this isn't a ticketed event, you don't have a membership in the caravan. There are -- consistently moment to moment there are those who are raising their hands and saying they're part of the so-called caravan and then there are others who -- yesterday said they are part of the caravan, today say they are no longer a part of the caravan. What we're really talking about is the flow of people that are headed towards United States. They have chosen to break laws along the way. You saw some of them, frankly overwhelm and burst through (ph) the border between Guatemala and the country of Mexico. Mexico has offered them asylum. In some cases, they have refused. Mexico has offered them work permits. In some cases, they have refused. And I think what the president and I are both saying, and we want to be clear on this is, if you seek asylum, do so in the first place, country, Mexico has offered you refuge. If you want a job, that is not asylum. If you want to be reunited with your family, that is not asylum. If you want to just come live in the United States, that is not asylum; there are legal ways to do that. But this is about the rule of law. This is about understanding who is in the flow. And Chris, I cannot tell you as Secretary of Homeland Security, that I know every person in this flow. What I do know is that we stopped 3,000 people a year who have traveled -- of a pattern similar to terrorists from attempting to come in the Southwest border. And as you know, in general we stopped across United States, 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from getting into the United States. WALLACE: I've got about a minute left. I want to ask you about another one of your day jobs, and that's the midterm elections coming up nine days from today. Can you guarantee, to the American people, that their voting systems will be secure, are now and will be up through November 6th, that if you go to vote, that you will be able to do so, and that your vote will be counted accurately, and that there won't be a foreign actor interfering with that? NIELSEN: The goal here, Chris, just as you say, is absolutely to assure Americans that their votes will count, and their votes will be counted correctly. We are constantly monitoring, constantly working with them, sharing information. We'll be setting up a virtual Situation Room on Election Day so that we can vertically support any incident response that's needed and so that we can share any information. We are more prepared than we've ever been and we will continue to prepare, not just for this election but through every election to come in the future. WALLACE: Secretary Nielsen, thank you. Thanks for joining us today. NIELSEN: My pleasure. Thank you. WALLACE: Up next, who and what is responsible for the deepening political divide in our country. We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss, whether it's President Trump's job to play unifier in chief. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) TRUMP: We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party. TRUMP: I would like to think that everybody in America would think it's wrong to spend all your time from a position of power vilifying people, questioning their patriotism, calling them enemies of the people and then suddenly pretending that you are concerned about stability. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: President Trump and Barack Obama with very different views about who's to blame for the ugly political divide we see these days. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz; Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service; Liz Marlantes, politics editor of \"The Christian Science Monitor\"; and Jason Riley from The Wall Street Journal. Well, Congressman Chaffetz, clearly, President Trump is not responsible for the mail bombs being sent to prominent Democrats. The person who created the devices and put them in the mail allegedly, Sayoc is responsible. But does the president bear any responsibility for the growing ugly political rancor in this country? JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, R-UTAH: I'm sure the Democrats would argue that but presidents probably get too much credit and too much blame for what's happening in that rancor. I think the American people, we need a vigorous debate. That is what we do in this country. Political dissent is the American way but there's a point where it crosses the line and becomes too personal when you're up in the face of somebody who's getting dinner, somebody like a Sarah Sanders and whatnot. Certainly, a shooting and violence, that has no place in the American discourse. I thought President Trump was pitch perfect, and I think the call from Schumer and Pelosi should have matched with the president did, but unfortunately, it did not. WALLACE: Mo, I want to hold up again this front page from yesterday of The Washington Post because I've got to say I was really shocked by it. \u00a0I fully expected it to say suspect arrested. Instead it says \"Bomb Suspect Outspoken Supporter of Trump\". That's the headline on The Washington Post. And I went back and looked at \"The Post\" from last year after Bernie Sanders supporter attacked a Republican baseball practice and severely wounded Steve Scalise. No headline there about outspoken supporter of Sanders. So, I guess the question is, is it fair to draw the kind of linkage, front page, suspect outspoken supporter of Donald Trump MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: Yes, I probably would have written a different headline if I work at \"The Washington Post\". But having said that, look, I do not think it is a stretch to argue that the president's comments are helping to stir the pot even further. I agree with the congressman, presidents get too much credit. And I agree that there are people who overstepped the line. I was outspoken when people interrupted Sarah Sanders' dinner or Secretary Nielsen's dinner. I thought that was inappropriate. But when the president of the United States is actually questioning people's patriotism and calling them enemies of the people, and, you know, is saying pitch-perfect words in the wake of a tragedy but then goes into a rally and continues to divide and blame people, I think that is worth examination. I think it is worth exploration. I think we can all do a better job in our own lives at being more civil and being vigorous dissenters and arguing with one another politically, but checking how we do it. I would hope that the president would take some of this to heart as well. WALLACE: Jason, when Congressman Chaffetz talks about the president was pitch-perfect, my initial reaction was which president? Because it did seem this week weak as if there were two presidents. First of all, there was teleprompter Trump. Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We must never allow political violence to take root in America. \u00a0Cannot let it happen and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it and stop it now. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But then there was Twitter Trump. Here he is at 3:14 a.m. Friday morning. Funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, it's just not presidential. Do you think it's fair to say that there were two very different presidential tones here? JASON RILEY, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE FELLOW: Oh, absolutely, Chris. After two years of president Trump I think this is something have come to expect. I do want to say, referring to the headline, the newspaper you put up, if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and social media, that is why. That headline is why. He does not trust the mainstream media to treat him fairly and he is going to continue to use social media so long as the mainstream media treats him in that fashion and his supporters are going to appreciate his use of social media. I think that is exhibit A right there. I think we would like, the country would like public officials to exercise some restraint, to not jump the gun when we see these tragedies happen. \u00a0They'd like Hillary Clinton to do it, they would like Eric Holder to do it, and they'd like President Trump to do it and President Obama to do it as well. It would be nice if they did behave that way. The motives seem to vary when these incidents happen. You mention a softball practice shooter. The guy who shot at the Annapolis newspaper had a different motive. They vary and I think we are trying to shoehorn a political agenda into these actions is wrong. What we should be doing is bringing these people to justice and hopefully trying future acts by -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: But you think that the president's rhetoric is separate and apart. I'm in not -- I'm no way -- I've gotten in some fights on this network about this, I'm in no way saying the president was responsible, but do you think it's possible, that it's useful to say that these events happen in a particular climate? RILEY: I don't think that's useful at all. Anymore than Bernie Sanders is responsible for the softball practice shooter. I don't -- I don't think that's the proper way to look at these situations. These events happen because these people are deranged, the person who shot Gabby Giffords for instance. These are deranged people, and that is what we need to look at. I don't see attaching politics to this as helpful at all. In one case, we had a Trump supporter carrying it out and in the other case we had a Trump opponent carrying it out. So, no. WALLACE: Liz? LIZ MARLANTES, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: What we had seen though with all of these incidents is an increase in really dangerous and ugly radicalization of disturbed individuals online and I think that is something that we need to look at. The same exact process that ISIS uses to recruit people, we are seeing that here with dangerous homegrown extremists in these types of events are on the rise. That is something -- you can talk about the tone of the top or the general political discourse but there is something really ugly going on on the Internet and that is something I need think we need to pay attention to. ELLEITHEE: It's not limited to the Internet, though. I mean, there are -- I mean, when you talked about the media. I mean, there are hosts on cable news who are giving home to right-wing conspiracy theorists and allowing them to move forward -- unchecked -- with these conspiracy theories. CHAFFETZ: There's nobody out there advocating that anybody take any violence. ELLEITHEE: No, no, that's different. That's different. CHAFFETZ: It is different, you're right. ELLEITHEE: That's not what I'm saying. CHAFFETZ: But you're trying to ascribe it to some deaths and some murders and terrorism. (CROSSTALK) ELLEITHEE: We are talking about the tone of our politics. CHAFFETZ: You are associating those with terrorism and it's no wrong. No one party has cornered the market on crazy. (CROSSTALK) CHAFFETZ: You can point on this both ways. ELLEITHEE: This exchange is a reflection of the challenge right now. I am making a point about the challenge of our political discourse and the lack of civility and the fact that the extremes -- as Liz was saying, the extremes are rising and finding more homes to articulate their vision. \u00a0That is what is challenging. CHAFFETZ: I don't think you can point to a specific television show that's advocating this or -- (CROSSTALK) ELLEITHEE: It is everywhere. It is online. It is on cable news, it is in a variety of places and I would hope that everyone, whether they are a television host, whether they are an elected official, whether it's me and my job in academia, that we all do a better job of checking it. WALLACE: Liz, final thought. MARLANTES: I think there's an opening for a politician who wants to come forward and says I want to unite the country, I want to be a healer, not adding to the climate of toxicity that we'd seen. I mean, I was really struck to that package that you play. There was that clip by Nikki Haley, and she had such strong words in the wake of what happened in her state. I think there's a big opening for a politician who wants to be a healer. CHAFFETZ: Completely agree. WALLACE: The one thing you can say, whether it has something to do with politics, nine days before an election, everything has to do with politics. All right. We'll take a break here. See you all a little later. Up next, with just over a week until the November midterms, who's got the advantage? We'll talk with the chairs of the Democratic and Republican House Campaign Committees when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Coming up, the battle for control of the House may be decided by just a few seats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: If the radical Democrats get control, they will try to erase every single thing that we've achieved. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: We'll ask the two House committee chairs about prospects for a blue wave, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Just nine days from now voters will go to the polls to decide which party controls Congress. On the House side, Democrats need to flip at least 23 seats to take over. But races in many battlegrounds remain tight. Joining me now from New Mexico, Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and from Ohio, Congressman Steve Stivers, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. REP. STEVE STIVERS, R-OHIO, NRCC CHAIRMAN: Good morning. WALLACE: Gentlemen, we often talk about an October surprise in the closing days of the campaign and I wonder whether the terrible October surprise this year is the outburst of violence this last week. Congressman Lujan, will Democrats make this an issue, the outburst of violence in our politics, and tie it to President Trump? REP. BEN RAY LUJAN, D-N.M., DCCC CHAIRMAN: Look, first off, Chris, thanks for having me this morning. Look, no one should be politicizing what happened this week, number one. The senseless acts of violence that we see in Pittsburgh, the number of people that were killed while they were at a place of worship is a clear reason why Congress must act to keep people safe, number one. And then also with the number of people who were threatened as a result of those bombs that were being mailed across America. But, look, we should come together as a country. This should not be a political response, but rather a response at how we can further bring us together. WALLACE: Congressman Stivers, can President Trump, clearly not be held responsible for the specific acts of violence, but for a culture, a discourse that contributes to it? STIVERS: Well, I agree with Ben, that we should not be politicizing these acts of violence. As your panel said earlier, hate has no ideology. If you look at the baseball shooting last year, that happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter. We need to come together. I agree with Ben. I want to say that Ben is not my enemy. Democrats are not my enemy. They are my opponents. And while we have different visions for the future of America, different directions for America, we are all Americans first. We need to come together and do what's in the best interest of America. And no matter who wins in ten days, I believe we can come together and make that happen. WALLACE: All right, let's turn to some nuts and bolts, starting with the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls. Going to put them on the screen. On the generic ballot question, which party do you support in our congressional district, Democrats still lead Republicans at this point 49.5 percent to 41.9 percent. Congressman Lujan, does that mean that there still is a blue wave and that Democrats are going to regain control of the House? LUJAN: Look, Chris, while people have described this in different ways, I'm confident the Democrats will win back the House this year. We built our strategy around our candidates. Incredible men and women with records of service. Many of who have served our country in the U.S. military. Former CIA officers, FBI agents who have committed their lives to keeping our country safe. And they're connecting with the American people talking about their personal stories. I never said this would be easy, but we made a commitment to build a battlefield and leave no stone unturned. And that's why I'm confident we will win the majority in just nine short days. WALLACE: Congressman Stivers, the fact is history at least is against you. Since World War II the president's party has lost an average of 28 House seats in the midterm after that new president is elected. And when the job approval is below 50 percent, as Mr. Trump's is now, he party loses an average of 37 House seats. And, again, if Democrats take 23 seats, they take the majority. Congressman Stivers, what makes you think history won't repeat itself again in this midterm? STIVERS: Well, Mike, we've defied history already. We've had a -- we've created a -- WALLACE: I'm Chris, but thank you very much. STIVERS: Sorry -- sorry, Chris. We've defied history already. We've won eight out of nine special elections. We actually have an economy where we have 4 percent economic growth. We have unemployment at 3.7 percent. We have the highest consumer confidence we've ever had. And we've lifted up all subgroups, including record low unemployment among African-Americans and 18 to 25 year olds. So I think people will reward us for what we've done. We have more work to do, but -- and we have great candidates. We have folks who have -- who are incumbent members of Congress, folks who are police officers, military folks. We have folks who are committed to moving our country forward, working together to make a difference. So I think we're going to be able to hold our majority and I feel like momentum is on our side in this last week. WALLACE: Congressman Lujan, I mean the fact is, but all objective standards, the economy is strong. Unemployment is down. Growth is up. Usually the economy, if there's not a war going on, is the key issue. How do you beat that? LUJAN: Well, look, Chris, all across America, hardworking middle-class families are still telling us that their wages and salaries are not keeping up with the cost of living. My Republican colleagues this year do not have a voting record to run on that has actually prioritized hardworking middle- class families. That's number one. Number two is, you look at the data, Chris, with what you put on the board there. While I never look at any one poll, data's on our side, momentum's on our side, the energy is clear, early voting is up all across America. And as long as people continue to turn up and vote, we will do well. The other thing is, we're making sure that the American people know about the voting records of our Republican colleagues when it comes to health care. Voting to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions and moving and agenda forward that would have actually slapped an age tax on people between the ages of 50-64 and resulted in creasing health care premiums, deductibles and out of pocket costs for the American people. That's what we're running on and, again, an agenda anchored around for the people and around our candidates. WALLACE: We have been talking this hour about the tone, the ugly tone our politics has taken. And I want to play some ads that both of your campaign committees, you're the two chairs of the campaign committees, have run against some of your opponents. Congressman Stivers, here's one that the NRCC ran against Democrat Elissa Slotkin in Michigan. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., MINORITY LEADER: I just don't even know why there aren't uprisings. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this the quote/unquote mob? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's going on too long. Liberal extremists tearing America apart. Elissa Slotkin is one of them. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Congressman Slotkin served three terms working for the CIA in Iraq and Afghanistan -- or in Iraq with the CIA and then worked in the administrations of both Presidents Obama and Bush. Is it constructive to call her, of all people, a liberal extremists? STIVERS: Well, you know, I think -- I respect Ms. Slotkin's service to our country in the CIA and in the administrations, but people's views on issues are legitimate and there are contrasts that we need to run so people understand what folks believe. And I think it is fair to say that she is not in the mainstream of Michigan politics. WALLACE: Congressman Lujan, here is an ad that your group that you're chairing, the DCCC, ran against Republican Congressman Mike Kelly in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 2010, car dealer Mike Kelly's elected to Congress. And while there, his net worth increased by millions. So it's no surprise he helped give special tax breaks to car dealers, like himself. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But, congressman, the specific group you site for making that report, the Center for Responsive Politics, says, in fact, his net worth has dropped dramatically during the time in office. It hasn't risen. LUJAN: Well, look, Chris, when we see our Republican colleagues voting for a tax package dubbed by the American people as a tax scam that was prioritizing corporations on the most wealthy in America over hardworking middle-class families, we're going to call them out on their record. But, look, to the point of the question that you're asking, Chris -- WALLACE: Yes, but, that's his record. This isn't -- but, sir, that's his record. I'm talking about his net worth and that's a fact. LUJAN: Well, look, to the point of your question, I think that all committees, and all spenders out there that are investing in campaign ads across the country, they need to be respectful of that tone. But I would agree with Steve that when we're looking at voting records, that I think that that is fair game as well and that we need to make sure that we're all looking to see that we can make sure that we're having a better conversation with the American people, whether it's the last nine days of this cycle or going into next election as well. WALLACE: All right, I've got a little bit over a minute left and I want you to share it equally, so you each get about 30 seconds. Yes, you've talked about the economy. Yes, you've talked about health care, immigration. But to what degree is this election really about Donald Trump, either pro or against? Congressman Lujan, you go first. LUJAN: Look, Chris, I think all across the country our candidates are not really talking about this president much. There's no one that's going to talk more about Donald Trump than Donald Trump, which gives our Democratic candidates the opportunity to connect with their personal stories and talk about an agenda that is built around for the people and how we're going to be able to help lower prescription drug prices, lower health care costs, move a strong infrastructure package and clean up Washington, D.C., with all the corruption. Our candidates are doing well and it's because of our candidates the Democrats will win the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. WALLACE: Chairman Stivers, you have 30 seconds. STIVERS: Well, I think this election is about results versus dysfunction. I already talked about our economic success. We have more to do on infrastructure, lowering health care cost. But the dysfunction the other side would bring, their health care agenda would kick 179 million people off their insurance and bankrupt Medicare on day one. It's -- they have an agenda that's outside the mainstream. They want to abolish ICE. They want to not protect our border when there's a caravan of people coming. LUJAN: Steve, that is just untrue. WALLACE: All right, I knew were weren't going to settle things here, but we appreciate both of you coming on. Chairman Lujan, Chairman Stivers, thank you both. Thanks for your time in these closing days of this heated campaign. STIVERS: Thank you so much. LUJAN: Thanks for having us, Chris. WALLACE: Coming up, which issue will have the most traction in the midterms, health care, immigration or President Trump? We'll ask our Sunday group, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Democrats want to raise your taxes. They want to impose socialism. That's what they're doing. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: If Republicans keep Congress this fall, you better believe they are coming after health care again. And millions of people across the country who count on this are not going to have it. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: President Trump and former President Obama making their closing arguments to voters out of the campaign trail. And we're back now with the panel. Well, Liz, with nine days till the midterms, how do you see the races both for the House and the Senate? LIZ MARLANTES, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR: It's anybody's guess. I mean we really don't know right now what's going to happen. Early voting has been really interesting to watch. Turnout has been high across the board. Seven states have already surpassed their 2014 early voting numbers. WALLACE: More than 8 million people have voted early. MARLANTES: And -- and it's possible that some states will surpass their 2014 total numbers just in early voting according to some experts. So that's a sign that there's a lot of interest. The question is, whose voters are going to turn out? And we really don't know. is there still going to be, you know, a silent Trump vote, like we saw in 2016, or is this the year that Democrats really mobilize young people, minorities, their coalition? WALLACE: We need to point this out though because, Liz, midterms oftentimes, as opposed to a presidential election, turnout is low. This almost seems that it could rival a presidential election in turnout. MARLANTES: Oh, absolutely. And it -- again, Michael McDonald, who's a turnout expert -- an early voting turnout expert, is saying that it's possible that we will see the highest turnout for a midterms since 1914 based on what he's seen so far. WALLACE: And I just want to say right now, I was not around in 1914, so -- but I hear it was a heck of a -- heck of a turnout. Congressman Chaffetz, a lot less talk these days about a blue wave, a sweeping Democratic victory, particularly in the Senate, where I think the kind of conventional wisdom, for what it's worth, is that Republicans are going to hold onto the Senate majority. But aren't there, in the House, a lot more ways when you look at the map for Democrats to get to a 218 majority than Republicans? CHAFFETZ: Yes, I would agree with that. But I was in the House in 2010 when there was a red wave -- WALLACE: Absolutely. CHAFFETZ: And the Democrats lost, I think, some 63 seats and there's no evidence anything like that's going to happen. Keeping the Senate, maybe even gaining in the Senate, I think, is what you're going to see. In a House, it's going to be nip and tuck. It's going to be close. A lot of local issues, like water in California, will play a key role in what's happening in those races there. But I think the week after the selection of the speaker will be fascinating because neither of the presumptive leaders actually have enough votes of 218 to get -- WALLACE: Well, don't talk about that. We have to wait. We can talk about that the week after the election. CHAFFETZ: (INAUDIBLE). It's going to be so close. WALLACE: Let's not burn our political issues. CHAFFETZ: All right, next week. WALLACE: Let me talk about issues, because there seem to be several big ones out there. Health care obviously is. The economy is. The -- immigration and concerns about the economy -- about the caravan and President Trump. Let me start with you, Mo. I'm going to get to you, Jason, in a moment. Which of those issues do you think has the most traction with voters? ELLEITHEE: Look, I think we're kind of living in a populist era and people are feeling that institutions are ignoring them, which is why I think it's really interesting that Democrats -- if you look at Democratic ads across the country, they're focusing on health care. They're focusing on losing the protections for pre-existing conditions. That might be one of the most populist issues Democrats have had in a very long time. And I think it is fueling a lot of these numbers. Trump is being talked about everywhere else. Democrats are kind of trying to find an alternative by Trump by talking about health care. And I think it's helping them. WALLACE: Jason. RILEY: Well, I think the issues that play to the president's strengths would be, one, the economy. We just had reports, third quarter, 3.5 percent growth after eight years of being told 2 percent was the new normal by all the experts. We could be on track to 4 percent growth for the year. It's within reach. So that will certainly play because the Republicans, in the latest \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News poll have a 15-point advantage when it comes to people who think which party does a better job on the economy. I also think immigration plays to the president's strength and I don't know why this caravan issue, why the Democrats think this works for them. It simply plays in, I think, to this lawlessness that President Trump has labeled them with. It plays into the abolish ICE, the sanctuary cities. This is more of the same. And I think this -- this is something that works better for the president than it does for Democrats. So that's another issue -- WALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a minute. We have a Democrat there. What about immigration and the caravan? Is that an effective issue for Republicans? ELLEITHEE: Look, I think there are two couplings of emotions that drive voters in any election, hope and optimism or fear and anger. This is clearly a fear and anger dynamic. And on both -- an election -- RILEY: (INAUDIBLE) -- ELLEITHEE: No, no, hold on. Hold on. I think what has been motivating both sides in the election from day one is anger. Democrats have been angry since the morning after December -- or since November 2016. That has worked very well for them throughout 2017 and has gotten them to where they are now. The Republicans, I think, there was a bit of a complacency. And then between Kavanaugh and caravan, we started to see the intensity and some anger on the right begin to bubble up. The president has been very effective in stirring the pot and trying to keep them as angry as possible. So which is going to -- which is going to win out, we'll find out in two weeks. RILEY: Well, I think that, to the congressman's point, local issues obviously play a big role in midterms. And when it does come to national issues, yes, the Kavanaugh hearings and the caravan have helped Republicans close that enthusiasm gap. But I think with the caravan issue, Mo, this is a massive humanity headed towards the border. This was not spontaneous or organic. These are -- these are people that have been rounded up by activists and -- and immigrant advocates, told what to say to reporters and -- and people at the border. And President Trump is not only right to do something about this, I think he has a duty to do something about this. I'm very pro-immigrant, but I do believe in a sovereign U.S. border and in doing things the right way. This is not the right way to seek asylum to America. ELLEITHEE: Look, I think -- I think Democrats have been using immigration to their advantage for much the past year. When the president and his family separation policy was center stage, you saw a huge outcry, and I think Democrats were able to harness some of that energy and have been saying during this caravan crisis, or, excuse me, discussion, that we need to address this issue at the source and -- and the president's failure to do that has helped add to this. But when -- when push comes to shove and you look at these districts, these suburban swing districts across the country that are sort of the most competitive and the most nip and tuck and people are talking about a caravan versus losing pre-existing conditions, which is going to be more of the motivator, which is going to be more of the driver if we're talking about the politics of this moment? I think pre-existing conditions is going to be the one. WALLACE: Jason Chaffetz, what surprises me is the economy is going so well that you would think that this would be a no-brainer, that Republicans would run on that. And the president, yes, he mentions it, it isn't what he spends most of his time talking about. Is it that -- and you've got about 30 seconds here -- that he thinks and Republicans think people are more likely to vote in anger than in ingratitude? CHAFFETZ: Well, I think the idea that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would have a gavels, that Maxine Waters would be the chairman of Financial Services is something we talk about all the time. There's a criticism the mainstream media doesn't talk about the good news of the Trump economy, and I think that's very real. But people feel it in their pocketbooks and it helps Republicans going into the election. WALLACE: Well, we've got a little bit more time to talk about it, and then, after that's over, the election, then we can talk about the election of the speaker. CHAFFETZ: Yes. There you go. WALLACE: There's always -- business is good these days. Thank you, pane, see you next Sunday. Up next, as we hit the home stretch of midterm campaigns, things are getting even more heated on the trail. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: At the end of an ugly week of political violence, it's reassuring to know most of that campaigning followed familiar lines with tough rhetoric and some funny moments and President Trump usually at center stage. Here's a look at the action on the trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION: Is he no longer lying Ted? TRUMP: To me he's not lying Ted anymore. He's beautiful Ted. SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: And God bless President Donald Trump. TRUMP: Under Republican leadership, America is booming, America is thriving and America is winning because we are putting America first. OBAMA: So when you hear elephants talk about economic miracles right now, remember who started it. MARC MOLINARO, R-NEW YORK GOVERNOR CANDIDATE: I grew up on food stamps. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, D-NEW YORK: Are you saying you don't support Donald Trump? MOLINARO: I'm saying that I'm absolutely committed to the delivery of mental health services. CUOMO: Do you support Donald Trump? MOLINARO: Let's get out of this conversation. CUOMO: Do you support -- JOSH HAWLEY, R-MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE: Have I supported the president? You bet I have, because I think the policies he's pursuing are good for the state. SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D-MO.: The leader of the most amazing nation in the world thinks it's OK to lie all the time. He doesn't need to do that. So, yes, I have to say, I don't like it that he lies all the time. JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: No president has ever led by fear. Not Lincoln, not Roosevelt, not Kennedy, not Reagan. This president is more like George Wallace than George Washington. TRUMP: The blue wave is being dissipated a little bit. I don't hear them talking -- are you guys still talking about the blue wave? ANDREW GILLUM, D-CANDIDATE FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR: Are you all ready to flip Florida blue? Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis are racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist. REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA., CANDIDATE FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR: I'm not going to sit here and take this nonsense from a guy like Andrew Gillum who always plays the victim, who's going out and attacking -- as you -- aligning himself with groups who attack our men and women in law enforcement. BIDEN: Get the hell up and take back the country. TRUMP: Early voting is now underway. So if anybody wants to leave, we'll save your place, you can come right back. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love those signs. We are not crazy! CUOMO: I like kielbasa, but I am -- do prefer Italian sausage. I'm true to my heritage. MOLINARO: We're having a sausage question. I -- I love -- I always loved my grandmother's Italian sausage. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: After this dramatic week, we can only hope for more civil disagreements, even about sausages in the final nine days of the campaign. And that's it for today, have a great week, and we'll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from the border state of Arizona tonight. We have so much to get through. I don't think an hour is going to do it, but we have to fit it into an hour so stay right there. States like this are not just front and center ahead of next Tuesday's mid-terms because of a close senate race. They resonate nationally because the issue of immigration has come to the fore once again.\u00a0\nSince President Trump has refocused attention on the issue, of course he is being labeled a racist. You just heard him refer to that in his speech tonight in Missouri. And tonight, Hispanic border patrol agent and a family member of a victim of illegal immigrant crime will be here to react.\u00a0\nPlus, where the polls stand now and what ads are actually working the most with voters. The men who know the answer is Tom Bevin, Doug Shawn and Frank Luntz are all here. I cannot wit to talk to them. Everything you need to know in this raining days of this midterms.\u00a0\nAnd Democrats, by the way, have long decried dark money and dirty tricks and politics. They are always bemoaning that. Well we're going to layout tonight how they are shamelessly engaging in both this mid-term season. It's off the charts. But first, race to the bottom. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\"\u00a0\nThe better Donald Trump does among African-American voters, the more race obsessed the Democrats and their shameless media enablers become. When young African-Americans leaders were recently invited to the White House by the president, they were instantly derided by the left.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nAL SHARPTON, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK: It was not a summit. It was a make America great rally. The use of young blacks as props which really is an insult to them.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Oh, insult to them Al? Really? Aren't those racist sentiments by the way? Isn't it wrong to lump people into political camps based on their skin color or believe that only authentic African-Americans are the ones who despise Donald Trump?\u00a0\nAnd I thought stereotyping people based on their skin color was the definition of racism. And why should a reverend be speaking on these terms at all by the way? I think what's going on here is they are worried about their prospects. And so now the left are engaged in a coordinated effort to brand Donald Trump as a racist.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have a white nationalist president who is a threat to American democracy.\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN HOST: People know when you say nationalist and smart people know what that is a dog whistle for. That's a wink and nod to white nationalism.\u00a0\nEDDIE GLAUDE CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: But this man doubled down after 11 beautiful people were shot and killed while worshipping. For what? Some ideal of whiteness that Donald Trump represents and spews out of his mouth every single day.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, and that's what Donald Trump thinks about every morning when he wakes up. Whiteness, come on. You are better than that. And then there is this tiresome claim.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSARAH SILVERMAN, COMEDIAN: Trump knows the only way that they can energize their base is through fear.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I thought Sarah Silverman was supposed to be funny. Oh, well, really? Talk about fear, fear mongering. What was Oprah Winfrey doing in Atlanta today if not fear mongering?\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nOPRAH WINFREY, CELEBRITY: I am here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed, who were repressed and oppressed. And I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Got to hand it to Oprah. She is a great speaker, but I kind of I liked her better when she was giving way Toyotas and refrigerators. To try to tie the candidacy of the Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp to the scourge of racism and even lynchings? Come on, Oprah. It's dehumanizing.\u00a0\nIt's completely baseless. It's totally cruel and again, I say, you are much better than that and your are much bigger than that. And I'll also say this to Oprah Winfrey, how is this living our best life now?\u00a0\nThis kind of broad brush race baiting desensitizes us to the real racists out there who should be condemned and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law when they commit heinous crimes and use violence to hurt and maim people of a different race.\u00a0\nBy the way, what did Kemp ever do aside from running against a black opponent? Nothing. For a taste of true racial obsession and outright racism, hear what a few prominent Democrats said this week that didn't get all that much attention.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKARA SWISHER, JOURNALIST: What do you think of Cory Booker and his comment, and fell free --\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I adore him.\u00a0\nSWISHER: No, what do you think about him saying kick them in the shins essentially -- start to get to that kind of political --\u00a0\nCLINTON: Well, that was Eric Holder.\u00a0\nSWISHER: Eric Holder, oh, Eric Holder, sorry.\u00a0\nCLINTON: I know they all look alike.\u00a0\nSWISHER: No they don't\u00a0\nSEN. JOE DONNELLY, D\u2014IND.: Our state director is Indian-American, but he does an amazing job. Our director of all constituent services, she's African-American, but she does an even more incredible job than you could ever imagine.\u00a0\n(EN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I still can't believe that comment. All right, look, come on, it's all race all the time. And in Florida, Project Veritas caught a staffer of a Democratic candidate for governor, Andrew Gillum, saying that they are saying this about Gillum's promises and about the state itself.\u00a0\nOMAR SMITH, GILLUM CAMPAIGN STAFFER: Fairy tales in the modern day begin with once I am elected.\u00a0\nThis is a (BLEEP) up ass state.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.\u00a0\nSMITH: It's a cracker state.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, now, imagine if a conservative staffer for Ron DeSantis were saying something similar. It would be a wall-to-wall news day and night and he and the candidate would be labeled as racist. And a pathetic and a transparent double standard is what we just showed you because you know they are really not going to cover that. That's just some fringe guy making a video.\u00a0\nDemocrats like Gillum and Stacey Abrams in Georgia are featured in endless puff pieces across all media. And most of these pieces focus on their race as their biggest selling point for the candidacy. OK, I assume they are about more than that. They have views and they have ideas. But it's always about race and race for the most part alone.\u00a0\nBut black Republicans like John James running for Senate in Michigan or Omar Qudrat, a Muslim Republican running for congress for California's 52nd district, they are hardly covered at all. So I guess race doesn't matter if you are a Republican. It's not historic at all. The reason again for this leftist race baiting, Trump's policies are working for African-Americans and the results are now beginning to come in.\u00a0\nDemocrats sense it. They are losing their grip on the black community. Black unemployment is down. Black entrepreneurism is up. And the polls are moving. Check out this new Harvard Harris poll. A year ago, President Trump's approval rating among black Americans was a paltry 10 percent.\u00a0\nToday, it's almost triple at 29 percent. And look at this, a year ago, only 17 percent of African-Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. Today, 40 percent approve of his economic prowess. And this may be the most revealing number of all. On the issue of immigration, 15 percent of black Americans like Trump's approach last year, not great.\u00a0\nThis year, again, it's almost doubled, 29 percent approve of Trump's immigration stance. My friends, you might not like everything he tweets, I get that. But Donald Trump is standing up for all Americans. He doesn't care about your skin color. He doesn't care about your ethnicity or what religion you practice.\u00a0\nHe is about America and that is a good thing. And back to Obama for a moment because he is campaigning all across the country. Aside from his incredible example of being -- he's a great father and himself a historic figure. You have to ask this question, what did Obama actually do, substantively do for black America?\u00a0\nAfrican-American wages during his eight years were flat. ObamaCare was a complete and total disaster. And he did little to protect the black community from the competition of cheap, illegal labor. Hardly talked about it.\u00a0\nDo not let the race hucksters convince you to embrace the failure of the past. For the Democrats, this is not about protecting minorities. It's about regaining raw political power even if it means turning American against American and stopping the economic revival we've seen, the best I think we've seen in decades across all races and all ethnicities. And that's \"The Angle.\"\nJoining me to discuss, Kimberley Strassel is a Fox News contributor and editorial board member of the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Niger Innis is a civil rights activist and leader of the Congress for Racial Equality and Jonathan Harris is a liberal analyst.\u00a0\nNiger, let's start with you. How effective do you see these strategies in winning over African-American voters in the midterms? Let's start with what the Democrats are doing. Trump's a white nationalist. He cares about whiteness. He's a racist, embracing racist policies. The drum beat across all media today.\u00a0\nNIGER INNIS, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Well, in the past it's been what they go to in their playbook. They can't talk about the economy and the record low black and brown unemployment. I mean, historic lows since we have been recording these numbers. So, they go to their dirty bag of tricks and they pull out the race card.\u00a0\nYou know, I've been calling it for close to a couple of decades and my father, the great Roy Innis, before me. You know, he called it racial hustling. And the problem is and the reason we take this posture is we come from a civil rights organization, the Congress of Racial Equality where, you know, you want to talk about real voter suppression.\u00a0\nYou know, three of our boys, (inaudible) and Goodman, they became martyrs to the civil rights revolution, were murdered. They lost their lives. They didn't have to show an I.D. They lost their lives. They were murdered by the Klan in Mississippi for registering people to vote. After reconstruction --\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But Nigel, right here what's happening today, Nigel, we have made no progress.\u00a0\nINNIS: That's nonsense.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: There's almost no progress because Donald Trump is president.\u00a0\nINNIS: That's an absurdity and it spits on the grave of all of those brave whites and blacks that gave their lives for the civil rights revolution, for the Civil War 100 years before then. And it really sends the wrong message to young blacks, young whites, Hispanics, Asian-Americans that they actually live in a country because of our constitution and because of the passage of 14th Amendment, that is the freest liberty embracing country not only in the world but in the history of the world.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Jonathan, we have some interesting races across the country. I know you disagree with what Nigel just said.\u00a0\nJONATHAN HARRIS, LIBERAL ANALYTST: Right.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But Stacey Abrams maybe elected the next governor of Georgia. You have Andrew Gillum in Florida. Barack Obama a two-term president, very popular, went out very popular. So, for Oprah to come to Georgia and she's a larger than life figure and she's an incredible person.\u00a0\nDone a lot for a lot of people, then she comes to Georgia and she basically acts like no progress has been made and we are on the verge of having this guy, Brian Kemp oversee mass lynchings of African-Americans. How is that a positive engagement on politics?\u00a0\nHARRIS: Laura, I think what she is doing is acknowledging the fact that Brian Kemp is suppressing over 53,000 votes and that's according to the AP in Georgia. And that this is a long history of suppressing votes in the south by conservatives, by Republicans.\u00a0\nIn 2005, the head of the RNC actually apologized for embracing what he called the southern strategy where the Republican Party embraced racism from white people to get votes. That was what the Republican Party tried to do. That's where this all comes from because that was their strategy, and though he apologized for it in 2005, there is no proof that they've stopped doing it. Cue Donald Trump calling Mexicans murderers and rapists.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, well, we're not -- let's stay in Georgia for a moment because I think this is really important for people to understand what did happen in Georgia. When voter registrations and Kim I know you know about this, you have written about this, the integrity of the vote does need to be maintained.\u00a0\nAnd duplicate registrations, people registered in multiple counties, registration whose names are not quite matching. States all across the country end up cleaning up their rolls. They do it, they've always done it. But this has turned into a racial football in Georgia, Kimberley.\u00a0\nAnd, you know, you heard what Jonathan said, 53,000 have been purged from the rolls or have been suppressed. Is that really what has been happening and is Brian Kemp the culprit?\u00a0\nKIMBERLEY STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, because we've been cleaning up the voter rolls. It's a routine thing that happens out in states year after year and you are not seeing it happen just minorities. People of all races and all distinctions occasionally are pulled off and sometimes it's an error. Often it's just to update the list.\u00a0\nBut look, the rhetoric here has changed so much this election, Laura. We used to talk of -- the complaint used to be well tougher voter I.D. laws. Let's not move to claims of outright suppression. We used to claim that Republicans have latent racism, now you are outright calling them white nationalist.\u00a0\nAnd there is an electoral strategy behind this and it is the speck. Look, you cited that poll, Democrats continue to argue every time there is a poll that says that African-Americans are supporting Donald Trump in greater numbers. But even they will admit that it has shifted a little bit.\u00a0\nAnd in a race this close where two or three points could be the deciding factor, to have African-Americans come out and vote for Republicans or worse in their mind, simply not come out and vote for Democrats, stay home because they are not animated against Donald Trump. That could be the difference between victory and defeat and that is why you see this rhetoric reaching such extraordinary levels.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, both side are accusing the other of ramping up rhetoric for political reasons. Niger, I want to go to what Vice President Pence said today, kind of reacting to what Oprah did in Georgia. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would like to remind Stacey and Oprah and Will Farrell, I'm kind of a big deal too. This ain't Hollywood. This is Georgia.\u00a0\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: How much star power, I mean, Oprah did have an effect in 2008. She really turned out some voters for Barack Obama, there's no doubt about it. She is still very popular. But the economy now is doing well. The economy in 2008 wasn't doing all that great.\u00a0\nBut now the economy in Georgia has picked up, wages have gone up, the great economic statistics that just came out yesterday with rising wages. So Niger, does the celebrity factor work here even using the race card?\u00a0\nINNIS: I suppose there will be some degree of an impact. There is no doubt that Oprah is very popular, but I actually think that come next Tuesday, there is actually going to be a surprise. I don't know that Republicans are going to hold on to the House, but I think they are going to do a lot better particularly in the minority community than people are polling right now.\u00a0\nI think, you often hear of like there's a hidden trump vote that could move the polls 3 to 5 percent. It's not just whites, you know, that are afraid to tell their pollster that they are voting for Donald Trump. You know, there is a rein of terror in minority precincts and among sometimes when an activist, you know, that punish people that are supposed to vote Democrat if you are black, Hispanic or Asian.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Yes, people are afraid. Jonathan -- I ask Jonathan, we're out of time, but Jonathan, don't you agree that it's not a good thing if people are afraid to wear a t-shirt supporting whether it's the Democrat or the Republicans? And now you have people who are literally afraid to wear a MAGA hat. They are afraid because they are going to be called a racist. Is that a good thing?\u00a0\nHARRIS: I don't think they should be afraid. They should be embarrassed however.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, well, they are afraid because, you know, the charge of racism is potent.\u00a0\nHARRIS: They should definitely be embarrassed. No, there should be no fear from expressing your political opinions, but when you are embracing a person and a party who openly advocates for racism, calling themselves a nationalist and things like that, you should be embarrassed to embrace that absolutely. Be not afraid.\u00a0\nINNIS: Everything is racism (inaudible)\u00a0\nHARRIS: Not everything is racism.\u00a0\nINNIS: -- says, you can't throw out the racism card forever.\u00a0\nHARRIS: It's not a racism card.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHARRIS: When someone is being racist, calling them a racist is not pulling the race card. That's not what that is.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, the record low unemployment for African-Americans, that's definitely not racist. I'll tell you that.\u00a0\nHARRIS: Obama cut it in half.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Kimberley, we're almost out of time, but progressive -- well, wages have finally gone up, didn't under Obama. Kimberley, real quick because we're almost out of time, progressivism, does it -- even if they take the house, do progressive policies end up showing us something new this time? Georgia, maybe Florida, new economic boom under a liberal policy?\u00a0\nSTRASSEL: Yes, it's not been noticed, but actually there are very few real progressive candidates out there who are likely to win. Democrats have in fact been keeping a lid on them. Most of the races we've seen have been Democrats trying to position themselves as centrist or moderates. Look out in Arizona, and to the extent that the progressive had all the air time in the Kavanaugh hearing. They are the ones that actually blew the potential for a blue wave so that is not what's winning it for Democrats this year.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I don't think most of them want to talk about the caravan. They don't want to talk about that issue at all because they know it doesn't pull well amongst some constituents. It's a great conversation guys. Thank you so much.\u00a0\nThe reaction by the way to Trump's moves on immigration over the last week have resulted in a common refrain from the left. Oh, what is it? Racist! A Hispanic border agent and the aunt of a police officer killed by twice deported illegal alien tells us why they are offended. Stay there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Tonight we broadcast from the border state of Arizona where immigration will play front and center in the senate race. Very tight tonight between Republican Martha McSally and the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\u00a0\nNow, according to DHS, there are approximately 370,000 illegal immigrants already in the state and thousands more are in mobile mobs barreling towards the U.S. border ready to claim asylum. The so-called caravan. Now the president throwing a wrench into their plans by announcing today a big change to the process. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: Illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into our country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum. Those who chose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country. We will hold them.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Fantastic! I love it. Joining us now with reaction is Art Del Cueto, vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council and host of the Green Line radio show and an old friend of mine, and Pam Owens whose nephew, Detective Michael Davis Jr. was murdered in 2014 by an illegal immigrant who was already twice deported. And Art, first to you, is this going to make a difference in the number of illegals crossing the border especially with this caravan approaching?\u00a0\nART DEL CUETO, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: I think we have a situation where we have a president that actually cares and I think that's what's important. We have somebody -- he is actually making a bigger deal out of it. He's keeping us in the limelight. He's showing that he cares about illegal immigration and that's a huge deal because we haven't seen that before and that's very, very welcome. I hope it stops them from coming across, but the reality is unless you stop the catch and release, it will not stop.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: He said we're going to catch, yes, we're going to catch but we're not going to release. He said that today which a lot of people are questioning. I want to play something for you and for Pamela. This was Jake Tapper of CNN earlier today discussing what the president said. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: We were told by the White House that President Trump would be introducing a new proposal, a new policy when it came to asylum. That's not actually what happened. I don't know of a national security expert who says there's actually crisis at the border.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: He doesn't know of a national security expert who considers it a crisis at the border. You deal with this day in and out. Is this a crisis with the number of people now crossing the border?\u00a0\nDEL CUETO: It's been a crisis for quite some time. It was a huge crisis during the Obama administration. When we started under President Trump the numbers lowered dramatically on his rhetoric alone. I think we missed the mark, the leaders of our agency, but now we are seeing a president that is going to enforce the law. He is not bringing anything new to the table. He is just saying you need to protect our borders. I mean, what a crazy idea, right.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: But it's racist and you are Hispanic yourself. How does it feel to you to have the president called racist, anti-Latino, xenophobe, nativist. Every time he talks tough on the border wants to do something all those names, we just did a whole segment on it, all those names come out.\u00a0\nDEL CUETO: You know, when you don't have an argument anymore and you realize that you are wrong, that's what you have to say, racist. I myself, I've been called an Uncle Juan so many times, a race traitor, why don't you try, you know, stand up for your own race. It's not a racial thing. Border security has nothing to do with race.\u00a0\nThe security of a country has nothing to do with race. I owe everything to this country and the only flag that I will fly, the only flag that I support and the only country that I support is the United States of America. It has nothing to do with race.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: A lot of blue flags in that caravan, the Honduran flag, other flags. I don't see a lot of American flags but --\u00a0\nDEL CUETO: Well, if you are escaping a country because they have oppressed you so badly, would you be really flying the flag of that country that oppressed you?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: That's a great point which I have not thought of. Thank you for raising it. Pamela, I want to go to you because the president has been vilified, Pamela, for raising the issue of illegal immigrant crime. Outrage all day long because he discussed cases such as that of your nephew, a police officer in California.\u00a0\nGunned down in cold blood by Luis (inaudible) Montes who was twice deported and yet came back and killed and then laughed about it in court when he was being sentenced. I've got to get your take on the vilification of this president and his concern about illegal immigrant crime, Pamela.\u00a0\nPAMELA OWENS, AUNT OF OFFICER KILLED BY ILLEGAL: I support everything this president is doing and has done. Our entire family are so grateful for everything that he's done. I get so angry when I listen to what people do say about him because he is not a villain. He is doing what he was hired to do, which is protect our nation and protect our people. That's what he is there for. That's what he is supposed to do.\u00a0\nAnd finally, we have a president who is doing it and Democrats just can't stand it. They have blood on their hands. They should be ashamed of themselves. Listening to the last guest talking about we should be embarrassed. No, they should be embarrassed. And shame on them, all of them. And thank you, President Trump.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I have to say Pamela, I am so stunned when I see people -- I should not be after all of these years. I should just not be surprised at all, but I am stunned. When you have someone standing up for victims, victims who are trafficked, victims of gun crime, guns coming across the border. I know you deal with the fentanyl, Art, as well, coming across the border, and in this case a California police officer, two gunned down. And for him to bring this up is somehow racist? He doesn't care if it's black, white, Asian, gay, straight. It's an American killed.\u00a0\nOWENS: Exactly.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: And that's racist? If you could speak directly to the American people watching this right now, Pamela, about this toxic charge of racism that we heard all day long on CNN and MSNBC, all day long.\u00a0\nOWENS: Well, I can tell you that, take a walk in our shoes and see what it feels like, you would understand. It has nothing to do with race. I don't care what race Mr. Bracamontes was. He murdered two officers as well as I believe the man that he carjacked was a black man. So let's not talk race. It has nothing to do with race. He was a criminal. An illegal alien. He was not an illegal immigrant. He was an illegal alien in our country numerous times illegally. And shame on those who get on the president for doing what he should do.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: They used the charge because they do not have an answer and they know this is a potent issue. As the president said today, if we have time to play it, women want to be safe too, Art. Let's watch that.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: There's nothing political about a caravan of thousands of people and now others forming pouring up into our country. We have no idea who they are. I don't want them in our country. And women don't want them in our country. Women want security. Men don't want them in our country. But the women do not want them. Women want security.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Safety is very important, home, homeland. Those concepts for women, as a woman, you want to be safe. Not everybody is a criminal. A lot of people just want to come and work. We all know that. But sadly, that hasn't been the case. Even right near here, Mesa, Arizona, we've had a big problem in Mesa, Arizona, Grant Ronnebeck, shot in the face.\u00a0\nDEL: But you don't know. That's the thing. If you don't vet these people properly, you don't know. You are here in Arizona. Close to 40 percent of all of the drugs that enter this country legally come through here. And we are coming up on elections. And I think it's very important that people are going to realize when you go to that poll, do you want border security? Forty percent of drugs come through Arizona. Do you want border security or do you want somebody that doesn't care about our borders?\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Sinema is not good on the border. She is terrible on the border. McSally is the only person.\u00a0\nDEL CUETO: You've got to think about it.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Absolutely. Thank you so much to both of you. Pamela, and Art, great to you have on, as always. Pam, thanks for being brave, and brave enough to share that story tonight. We will never forget.\u00a0\nAnd when we come back, the pollsters, they have it all covered for us. You do not want to miss this next segment. Stay right there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Only five days to go until the midterm elections, and tonight we highlight some of the races that Democrats once thought were sure bets. Now it's anyone's guess. Joining me to discuss is Tom Bevan. He's the cofounder of publisher of Real Clear Politics, and Doug Schoen, a Democratic pollster.\u00a0\nAll right, guys, Tom, let's start with you. John Tester out in Montana. He was sailing to reelection. But tell us about some of the dirty tricks that have his challenger, Republican Matt Rosendale, back in the hunt tonight.\u00a0\nTOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER: Well, we did have this situation where the libertarian candidate, he didn't drop out of the race, but he endorsed Rosendale, and threw his support behind Rosendale. But, the Libertarian wasn't get a lot necessarily support in the polls, but even a small shift in this race. We have got Tester up about four points in our Real Clear Politics average. The problem is we've only had one poll, two polls in October. One of them was completed two weeks ago, so we literally have almost no data in Montana to tell us what's going on there. It seems like it's a close race. Trump has obviously been there. And this could be one of those surprises on election night purely because we don't have really good data on what's going on. It hasn't been polled very heavily at all.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Doug, I want to go to you. Down in Florida, things are interesting there, because it looked like Gillum was beginning to build this big momentum. Then we started hearing more about this corruption, getting bribes potentially, the FBI investigation, now stuff with anti- Israel group. And now his lead has been cut in half, and obviously Trump is spending a lot of time there as well. What's going on?\u00a0\nDOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, Florida is a very close, toss up state in both the governor's race, Laura, and the Senate race. And you're absolutely right. Gillum had opened a double-digit lead. Since then we've heard a lot more about a corruption scandal potentially during his administration, travel gifts. And there is also the issue of the role of the president trying to mobilize voters for DeSantis who had been slipping until recently. I see this as a very close race, slight advantage to Gillum, but no more.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I want to go now Missouri where Claire McCaskill, guys, is a very interesting place. She made a comment is Donald Trump's border security policy, specifically talking about I think the wall and other things. Let's watch what she said.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nSEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D\u2014MO.: The impression he is giving Missourians that somehow the Democrats are in favor of our border being overrun. I am not. I support the president 100 percent doing what he needs to do to secure the border.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Tom, McCaskill is like a border hawk. She's going to be wearing a MAGA hat soon, riding the border. What's going on there?\u00a0\nBEVAN: So McCaskill is the Lucy with the football for Republicans. Every cycle they think they can get her and remove her and kick her out of office, and she always survives. This year seems a little bit different. And that comment is one of the reasons why. She is also running ads saying, look, with people on camera saying, look, she is not one of those crazy Democrats like Bernie and the others. If this race definitely has a different feel to it. The polls are very, very close. Our Real Clear Politics average has Josh Hawley up two points. But this race is definitely close. You can't really count out McCaskill. She is a hard campaigner, she's a good campaigner. She's obviously doing what she needs to do to try and win this race. But this one feels different. I think she might be end up on the short side five days from now.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: We just saw that graphic come up on Trump's approval rating for the economy. Great news for him on the economy, 51 percent approval rating. And his numbers in both Florida and in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn very good. But I want to move up to New Jersey for a moment, Doug, because Bob Menendez is another person who has been just mired in various scandals. But he's still holding on to a lead over Bob Hugin. Could that perhaps change?\u00a0\nSCHOEN: It could. And Laura, the only thing that is tethering Bob Menendez up at this point is the fact that the state is so very, very Democratic, and as long as I can remember going back over 20 years it's been represented by Democrats in the Senate. That being said, the lead in the polls that I have seen is down to somewhere between four and six points. So it's a tossup according to Charlie Cook. It could go either way. But the democratic nature of the state make Bob Menendez ever so slightly a favorite.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Tom, we are out of time. But a quick question. Could it be that in some of these polls people are actually afraid to say they will vote for the Republican? You find that sometimes in workplaces, they've afraid to say I'm a conservative. Is there something about pollsters that people might not always be truthful, or are or they pretty straight with the pollsters?\u00a0\nBEVAN: There was an effect that we found in 2016 where Trump's numbers were higher actually when the poll was conducted with the robo-call, was an IBF poll, which means that instead of talking to a live pollster, if it was press one if you support Donald Trump. Trump actually got higher slight higher rates in those types of polls as opposed to talking to live pollsters. So there is a big of that effect. We may see it come back here in 2018. But it's very hard to quantify by each individual poll.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Laura, Democrats like polls more than Republicans and answer them in slightly higher numbers, which effects the ultimate results as well.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Can't wait. Guys, thank you very much. Great insights.\u00a0\nNow, we have been reviewing the hottest and most effective ads this election cycle. But we want to bring in someone, an advertising guru. You know old Frank Luntz. He's going to break them down for us. Stay there.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: A good campaign ad can completely change the course of an entire race. And there is one man who studied their effectiveness for years. Joining us now is Republican pollster and ad guru Frank Luntz. Frank, great to see you. I know you are in Georgia. I am here in Arizona. And I want to start with an ad from President Trump. Let's watch.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When I look at the way things are, it reminds me how far we have come.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: These numbers, they are depressingly --\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The economy is growing even more slowly than we thought.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Things are starting to change. There is more opportunity and security to I have invest in the ones that matter. But this could all go away if we don't remember what we came from and choose the right future.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Frank, what do you think about that one?\u00a0\nFRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: It's clearly a partisan ad, but to my surprise in the testing that we just completed, that ad was celebrated. Democrats responded almost as favorably as Republicans because it dealt with an emotional appeal that the public wants. A mom and her daughter desperate for things to get better. And people actually do -- Democrats even give Trump credit for improving the economy. So that was right on the mark. It's one of those rare partisan ads that are effective.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: I want to play an ad from Brian Kemp in Georgia. Stacey Abrams getting some help from Oprah today and Will Ferrell earlier this week. But let's watch this.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nBRIAN KEMP, R, GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm Brian kemp. I am so conservative, I blow up government spending. I own guns that no one is taking away. My chainsaw is ready to rip up some regulations.\u00a0\nI've got a big truck just in case I need to roundup criminal illegals and take them home myself. Yep, I just said that.\u00a0\nYou want a politically incorrect conservative, that's me.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, How did that do? How does that one do?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: Fantastic among Republicans, awful among Democrats. And actually people who are independent wonder is this guy serious or is he a good old boy. All of these ads are going to be shown Monday night on HBO and Vice News. We have tested over 250 of the political ads, and that one among Republicans is in the top 10. But Democrats when they look at it, they say no way.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: OK, let's move on to Bob Hugin, because I'm going to stake it on Hugin beating Menendez. I might be wrong, but I have hope for New Jersey. I love the state of New Jersey. It's corrupt, but it's a beautiful state in many ways. I want it to get better, so I want Hugin to win. So let's watch this ad.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are difficult times. Things are better for us than they were for our mothers, grandmothers. Now we are going through another change, and it will make life better for her.\u00a0\nReading this sworn FBI affidavit containing allegations bob Menendez traveled abroad to have sex with underage prostitutes, one thing became clear. We'll never be able to explain a vote for him to her.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nLUNTZ: Brilliant. Brilliant.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: What do you think about that one?\u00a0\nLUNTZ: There is no other word to describe it. It is brilliant because there is a special relationship between a mother and a daughter, and this is one of those places where the Me Too movement is alive, and it's alive on behalf of the Republicans or against the Democrats. I believe that there are a series of ads right now that may cost Bob Menendez the election, and that is one of them right there.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Thanks so much, Frank. Fantastic.\u00a0\nDemocrats used to claim, by the way, that when it comes to dark money and dirty tricks, they are totally above board. It's all the Republicans who do that stuff. But tonight we have information showing that they are intently engaged in both this election season, and we're going to show you next.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Don't you love it when Democrats, or frankly anyone is claiming moral superiority on an issue, then they end up doing it, like we're not going to use dark money in politics or dirty tricks. But tonight we have information that the Democrats are heavily utilizing both. First the tricks. Anonymous and potentially illegal mailers targeting Republican voters in Montana, Indiana, and Missouri attempting to scare them into staying home. And then there is the dark money. The \"New York Times\" reporting on a group called the Hub Project. It's run by Obama alums match with a stated goal of funding progressive candidates to the tune of $30 million this cycle, mostly through anonymous sources.\u00a0\nJoining us to discuss is Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, I thought the Democrats were against these practices. They abhor them. They abjure them.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION: No, the parties have switched, Laura. The wealthy and the poor are in the Democratic Party and the middle-class has fled. You can see that in the 2008 and 12 and 16 campaigns. They vastly outraised Republicans. Obama was the first president to refuse public financing of campaigns. He paid a $375,000 penalty for fines.\u00a0\nAnd then you look at the wealthiest 20 counties in the United States, 15 of the 20 are Democratic. The great wealth, Laura, in this country is no longer mining or agriculture or steel. It's high-tech. It's media, it's high finance. So Apple, Google, Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook. That's why we have $1 billion coming into this race.\u00a0\nAnd I'll just end by thinking that it's not always logical how you spend that money when you have so much of it. Some of it is very sloppy on their part. They feel that Ted Cruz is public enemy number one, maybe Devin Nunes is public enemy number two. And they are pouring $75 million into a Senate race they are probably not going to win that could have been used a lot better elsewhere. But Nunes here where I am in central California, he's sort of Emmanuel Goldstein of \"1984.\" They have two minutes of hate and they're not distributing the funds to candidates that would have a far better chance than his opponent.\u00a0\nBut you're right about the malfeasance. It's sort of like the ends are so justified, that they are so noble, redistribution, identity politics, equality, that any means necessary to obtain them are considered OK.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Victor, can I get you to weigh in on the race baiting that we started the show with tonight. We're here in Arizona, immigration ground zero, 40 percent of all illegal drugs come in through Arizona, as you know. It's a really important state. But the race card being played all day long, and frankly for most of this election cycle against supporters of president and his agenda and so forth. Your final thoughts on that?\u00a0\nHANSON: It's the same idea, though. It's flipped. So the civil rights people that were in large part in the north, at least, Democratic, now they believe that your superficial appearance is essential rather than incidental to your character. And it's conservatives who are live and let live. It's just incidental what a person looks like. They flipped just like the money question that we discussed earlier.\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: Well, I think people are getting tired of it. I really do. I think it's an insult to true racism and epitomizes true racism. Victor Davis Hanson, thank you so much.\u00a0\nAnd everyone, I want you to stay there for a preview of a very important INGRAHAM ANGLE from Arizona tonight. We're going to continue right when we come back.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nINGRAHAM: You just heard from Art Del Cueto from Border Patrol who just told us how important this state of Arizona is to the entire immigration debate. Tomorrow we'll bring you a special focus group of Arizonans of every political stripe to discuss this pressing issue. We'll also talk with Senate candidate Martha McSally as she looks to close the deal versus Kyrsten Sinema.\u00a0\nSo be sure to turn in. It's going to be a very important \"Ingraham Angle\" tomorrow night.\u00a0\nThat is all the time we have tonight here. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team is there in Washington to take it away. Shannon.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, right, talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the family photo during the G7 Summit, Friday, June 8, 2018, in Charlevoix, Canada. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) President Trump isn't known for his sweet talk -- but his sweet toss is now world-famous. Amid tensions at the G-7 summit earlier this month, Trump reportedly tossed Starburst candies in front of embattled German Chancellor Angela Merkel and quipped: \u201cHere Angela, don\u2019t say I never give you anything.\u201d The \u201cunexplainably juicy\u201d moment at the otherwise sour meeting of world leaders in Canada was revealed by Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer, who said the incident came during a huddle at the end of the summit when Trump was being pressed to sign a joint statement. \u201cTrump was sitting there with his arms crossed, clearly not liking the fact that they were ganging up on him,\u201d Bremmer told CBS News. \u201cHe eventually agreed and said okay, he\u2019ll sign it. And at that point, he stood up, he put his hand in his pocket, his suit jacket pocket, and he took two Starburst candies out, threw them on the table and said to Merkel, \u2018Here, Angela, don\u2019t say I never give you anything.\u2019\u201d That huddle became an online sensation after a photo emerged of an exasperated Merkel facing down a sitting Trump. The president has pushed back on the claim that it was a sign of disagreement -- and has released other pictures that show a more relaxed atmosphere. \u201cI have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for!\u201d he tweeted. Yet, Trump has had a turbulent relationship with the German chancellor -- whom in 2015 he accused of \u201cruining Germany\u201d -- particularly on the subject of immigration. On Monday, days after claiming they had a great relationship, he said that Germans are \u201cturning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.\u201d Trump appeared to be referring to Merkel\u2019s struggle to keep her coalition in tact after Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has pledged to implement a tough migration policy in which asylum seekers registered in other countries could be turned away at the border. Merkel has disagreed with the policy, fearing that it could fracture the E.U., but Seehofer has threatened to carry it out anyway. Merkel will travel to Brussels later this month to talk with E.U. partners about a common European solution and Seehofer has delayed enforcing the policy until then. But if there is no solution by July, it risks breaking up Merkel\u2019s coalition and sparking new elections, where the rise in popularity of the right-wing Alternative for Germany could spell trouble for Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats.",

            "article_content": "The president speaks to supporters at a 'Make America Great' Rally while stumping for GOP Senate candidate Josh Hawley. President Trump continued his spate of rallies in the final days before next week\u2019s midterm elections with a stop in Missouri Thursday night. At an airplane hangar in Columbia, the president tried to boost the Show Me State\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill. A Fox News poll published this week shows the pair tied, with each garnering 43 percent support among likely voters. Trump described Hawley as a \"Missouri patriot\" and predicted that \"in just five days, the people of Missouri are going to retire far-left Democrat Claire McCaskill,\" a remark that drew loud cheers from the audience. \"I need everyone to show up and vote, you've got to vote for Josh,\" Trump said. \" ... He's a star in our country. He is going to be something special. He's going to represent you for a long time and he's going to represent you well ... Claire McCaskill promised to represent the people of Missouri, but she broke that promise and joined radical Democrats in Washington. She's not representing Missouri.\" The president joked that McCaskill has \"been saying such nice things about me,\" a reference to recent comments in which the senator supported Trump's move to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border\u00a0in a bid to prevent Central American migrants in a caravan\u00a0from illegally crossing the frontier. \"She now, all of a sudden, loves border security,\" Trump said of McCaskill. \"Where did that come from? ... The fact is, she wants to get elected, and then she's always going to vote against us, folks.\" Trump won Missouri by 18 percentage points in 2016, and the state is considered to represent the best chance for Republicans to pick up a Senate seat and increase their slim majority in the upper chamber of Congress. When Hawley took the stage, he compared McCaskill to Trump's opponent in 2016, Hillary Clinton. \"Claire McCaskill has spent her lifetime in politics, just like Hillary. Claire McCaskill has made a boatload of money on federal taxpayers, just like Hillary,\" Hawley said. \"Claire McCaskill even has a phony foundation that rakes in millions of dollars a year [and] pays no taxes, just like Hillary. \"Claire McCaskill wanted us to call Hillary Clinton Madame President,\" Hawley concluded. \"Well, on November the 6th ... we're going to call Claire McCaskill fired.\" The president arrived in Missouri\u00a0fresh from announcing at the White House that his administration would require asylum-seekers to\u00a0\"lawfully present themselves\" at a port of entry a move\u00a0seemingly meant to deter members of the\u00a0caravan from attempting to cross the U.S. border. \"Republicans want strong borders, no chaos and no caravans,\" said Trump. \"We called up the military because we're not going to let people come into our country ... illegally. Not gonna happen.\" \"These are tough people,\" the president added, noting reports of violence by members of a second, smaller migrant caravan. \"These are not angels. These are not little angels. These are tough people and we're not letting them into our country ... We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and through merit.\" McCaskill has been criticized by some of her fellow Democrats after she told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report\u201d earlier this week that was not a \u201ccrazy Democrat,\u201d echoing a radio ad released by her campaign. \u201cWe have a state senator here in Missouri that actually advocated for the assassination of President Trump,\u201d McCaskill told anchor Bret Baier. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy Democrat.\u201d The lawmaker in question, Maria Chappelle-Nadal, responded on Twitter by calling McCaskill a \u201cpiece of s---\u201c and added that the senator \u201cdeserves to lose\u201d and \u201cis not a Democrat.\u201d MCCASKILL SWIPES AT 2 DEMS WHEN ASKED ABOUT 'CRAZY DEMOCRATS' Also this week, Hawley\u2019s team accused McCaskill\u2019s campaign of being behind mailers encouraging GOP-leaning voters to back third-party candidates. One mailer said Hawley could not be trusted to \u201cprotect our gun rights,\u201d despite that candidate securing the National Rifle Association\u2019s endorsement. A McCaskill spokeswoman told the Kansas City Star that the senator condemned the mailers and would work to end so-called \u201cdark money\u201d efforts in politics. HAWLEY: MCCASKILL'S SHIFT TOWARD TRUMP A 'BUNCH OF NONSENSE' Thursday\u2019s rally was the second of 11 planned appearances by the president in key battleground states between Oct. 31 and Nov. 5. Former Vice President Joe Biden visited Missouri on Wednesday and the state will also host Trump\u2019s final rally before Election Day.",

            "article_content": "Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich goes on 'The Ingraham Angle' to discuss the modern American left's midterm tactics. This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" October 16, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington, D.C. Tonight it is just, can you believe it, 21 days before the midterm elections. We have a lot of ground to cover for you. The American voter, you have a lot to consider, so much on the line. The largest caravan in a decade approaches our southern border. The president's response and mine are ahead. Plus, the new tactics of the left might not be so new (inaudible) 1968? Well, former speaker Newt Gingrich on the parallels between that faithful year for the Democratic Party and what is happening today. And we will have a new series for you tonight, \"Hidden Scandals,\" how the media's coverage of certain Democratic candidates really amounts to a cover-up. And tonight, our analysis of a Texas senatorial candidate, of course, Beto O'Rourke, you want to stick around for that. Victor Davis Hanson is also here. But first, the midterm border rush and possible electoral crush. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. As our cable competitors are devoting hours of coverage today to the president's tweets about Stormy Daniels, voters I think are just tuning im out. Why? Because the voters are smarter than the media thinks they are, as usual. Americans outside the leftist activist bubble are focused on issues that actually affect their daily lives -- pocketbook issues. Like the stock market jumped 500 points today. Tech stocks way up -- that's good for your 401(k). And the Labor Department reported that there are 7 million job openings currently in the United States. And our industrial output is surging, all fantastic news. But Americans also see some trouble on the horizon as well. Lawlessness at the border that no advance society should tolerate. Now, we have another mass of people, as many as 4,000 I am told, another so-called migrant caravan making its way from Honduras to the United States. And President Trump has had just about enough. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have the dumbest immigration laws in the world. The world laughs at us, but we are getting them changed. We need some more Republicans. We need some votes. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I will say. And for many years voters have been telling politicians, enforce the border and close immigration loopholes. In fact even on the issue of legal immigration, and a lot of people don't know this, the country is not clamoring for big increases. Check this out. Only 28 percent of Americans want immigration levels increased. Twenty-nine percent of Americans want them decreased. Now (inaudible) as you see want them just to remain the same. Of course most politicians continue to just ignore the wishes of the people, so what they do is they continue to expand things like distant relative chain migration. They refuse to allocate money to the building of the entire wall of the southern border. And they refuse to pass legislation to allow for immediate border turn backs of anyone crossing the border illegally. And of course, Democrats are just against all tightening of the current ridiculous rules for asylum. Donald Trump won the presidency in large part because he wouldn't accept the status quo on immigration. And as usual, he was five steps ahead of most every Republican congressman on the issue. In July, Gallup found that Americans identified immigration as the top issue for them going into the midterms. Last month it was the second most important issue tied with just general economic problems. Democrats thought, I think, that a focus on the difficult issue of child separation, a practice that the administration has now ended, that that would turn out voters and get Democrats or Latino voters really excited to get out there. But I don't think it is working for them. And remember back in 2016, the Latino voter turnout rate did not increase. Despite Trump's push for the wall and a lot of stronger immigration enforcement. And of course Hispanic Americans are themselves disproportionately affected by the impact of illegal immigration, and their neighborhoods and their communities. And ditto for black Americans. The good news is that as the second caravan drama unfolds, it turns out that some establishment Republicans are waking up to the wisdom of Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: It makes the immigration debate more on Trump's terms. You know, there is no right to come to America. We can have rules about who comes and where is Mexico? Mexico needs to help us because the last time I checked you just can't walk from Guatemala to here without going to Mexico. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh, yes, and today the president warned the president of Honduras. If a large caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, he's going to cut off foreign aid. Vice President Pence has separately warned the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to tell their people do not make the dangerous trek to America saying the U.S. will not tolerate this blatant disregard for our border and sovereignty. By the way, Honduras is on track to receive $65.7 million in foreign aid from the U.S. in the upcoming fiscal year, 2019. But back to the midterms, as frustrated as so many of us are with the Republicans and what they failed to do at the border, well, the cause may be totally lost if the open borders Democrats take the House while the president is focused on important things like abolishing the illegal immigrant gang MS-13, Democrats want to abolish ICE. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can replace it and we can replace it with a humane agency that is directed towards safe passage -- (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: --instead of the direction of the criminalization. (ED VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Safe passage? Everybody come on in. And Warren and Ocasio-Cortez are not alone of course. There are a lot more like them that believe the same thing. Again, the choice could not be clearer for the midterm voters. There so much on the line for America. We'll Trump get the funding for his wall? Will the mass migration from other poor countries in Central America be stopped at all? Ever! Will travesty such as birthright citizenship finally be ended? Will we mandate, e-verify to penalize businesses who gain the system to keep American wages low? Of this my friends you can be sure, your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants. If Republicans choose to unite, however, behind the presidents immigration policy, the way they just did in the Kavanaugh fight, this will stoke voter enthusiasm even further ahead of the all too important midterm elections. And that is \"The Angle.\" All right, joining us now with reaction here in studio with me Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, and Jose Aristimuno, is a Democratic strategist and former DNC deputy press secretary. All right fellows, just a moment ago the president anticipating \"The Angle\" -- I'm sure -- tweeted about this very issue saying \"We have today informed the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens or others to journey through their borders and up to the United States with the intention of entering our country illegally, all payments made to them will stop.\" In other words end. Tom Homan, you are the one with the most experience in this issue. Is the president right here in his approach? TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF ICE: Yes, I think he needs to throw down the gauntlet. I mean, we give these countries a lot of aid. I think that the other issue that the president should be aware of is that the remittances running to the billions of dollars. These countries get billions of dollars a year from their citizens who live in this country illegally that sends money back to those countries and that amounts to billions. So, that's another thing needed to address. But when it comes to this caravan, as I said last night, the president needs to work with Mexico. Mexico needs to stop them on their southern border not issuing transit visas and turn them around right there in the southern border so they don't get to the United States. INGRAHAM: Jose, U.S. foreign aid the Honduras -- it is not a lot compared to what we give to other countries but it is not chump change either. Put up the graphics, 2017 we gave them $144 million, natural disaster that year; 2018, $52 million, this year $65 million projected. Guatemala, they're trying to stop the caravan from coming through to Guatemala. It hasn't worked so far. In 2017, $229 million, again natural disaster; 2018, $76 million, 2019, $69 million projected. What about our sovereign right to protect our borders from what amounts to an organized effort to crush or rush the border right before the midterm election? JOSE ARISTIMUNO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: First and foremost and with all respect to Tom, let me just say that it makes no sense for the president of the United States to threaten Honduras and say hey, I'm not going to give you this money if you let these people go through Guatemala and Mexico what have you. It makes no sense. Less money for Honduras, less money for Central America? What's going to happen? More crime in those countries and the caravans are just going to get bigger. It makes no sense. I don't think the president thought this through and just happens almost every day every time he tweets. He should stop tweeting altogether. But to your point, Laura, these people under international law and on U.S. law have the legality to go to our borders and seek asylum. They can do this and they should do this because as we know every single year, a percentage of those people can actually stay in this country. These are people who are fleeing horrible, horrible conditions. INGRAHAM: How many other countries exist on the earth where people would like to flee generally a corrupt government? Because on Honduras and Guatemala, they've had corruption (inaudible) throughout the entire region for so many years. So is that really is the standard and that seems to be what the standard is today, de facto, then we better prepare. I mean, this is going to be a wholesale migration from Venezuela where we have seen 2 million people flee. Ultimately they can get from Venezuela up to Central America, up to Mexico and the United States, and you would be OK with that? ARISTIMUNO: They should have a right to do so. I'm not saying every single -- I'm not saying every single -- let me be clear, I'm not for open borders. I don't think every single migrant -- I am not saying every migrant who crosses the border should have a legality to do this, but they should have a right to at least be heard, that's what I'm saying. INGRAHAM: We don't have the facilities to hear millions of millions of people which if that is the standard we'll ultimately (inaudible). But Mark Krikorian, you know, we are a giving country, we are a compassionate country. We do help people in need all across the globe. On CNN today, this reporter who is Leyla Santiago, who's covering the migration, she is very pro-migrant, but nevertheless she made this point following on what Jose said. (BEGION VIDEO CLIP) LELYA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Many of the programs that this money pays for, those programs are to try to prevent violence, to try to help people with poverty. So, if that aid is taken away, the people who run those programs will tell you that you will likely see more immigration. You will likely see larger numbers at the U.S. border. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Mark. MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: There are plenty of ways we can put pressure on these countries. I mean, really, what is the point of being a superpower if you can't try to get a tiny little country in your backyard to do what you want? And honestly, the most important target of this kind of pressure is actually not Central American countries, it is Mexico because they are all passing through Mexico. Mexico is the much more functional state. It is wealthier, its government works better which is why Mexico really is responding, I think, to the pressure because I just saw on the way over here, they are sending large numbers of federal police, (inaudible) down to southern Mexico to stop these people from getting over. And that is the key before they ever get here. INGRAHAM: Our relationship with Mexico with the incoming president AMLO is actually going to improve. This deal with the new NAFTA U.S.-Mexico- Canadian agreement (inaudible) it is actually a good new start. I don't think they want to muck that up now. Tom Homan, and this is right up your alley. August 2017, the border arrest between the ports of entry, and just in the month of August 2017 over 22,293. Let's put up the graphic. August 2018, 37,544, and these are people crossing between the ports of entry. That is a 68 percent increase, Tom, from year to year in a month. Monthly tab, year to year. HOMAN: Then why would they stop? I mean, you got the Ninth Circuit says we can't detain families more than20 days. We got a judge saying you can't separate, then we got a judge -- (inaudible) we're separate, we can't deport. We can't detain enough of them because Congress has not funded ICE properly. ICE is asking 20,000 (inaudible) 40,000 and to get back to my friend here, as far as they have a right to claim asylum. People who leave Honduras have passed through Guatemala and Mexico. They are no longer in fear of persecution in that country. So this isn't about escaping fear and persecution, they can make asylum in Mexico. This is about getting to the United States. And 80 percent of those people that claim fear lose their cases in the immigration court. They're taking advantage of that low threshold in the system. They're taking advantage -- 80 percent, not just a fact, stone cold fact. INGRAHAM: Under Obama they were turned back to 80 percent. HOMAN: Eighty percent and (inaudible) ARISTIMUNO: How would they know? Tom, how would they know if they don't get to a border and they actually get to be heard? How would they know? HOMAN: Again, they pass through two other countries before they get to the United States. Many claim asylum in Mexico to escape fear and persecution in Honduras. (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: It's not on international law. It does not count as a country where you can't claim asylum. I know that is a fact that Mexico might want to change that, but Mexico is a place where you are allowed -- and they have actually accepted asylum request by some of the migrants, not that many. I want to talk a little bit about who is funding the caravan. There is a question in the Honduran foreign ministry, corruption everywhere there, but they identified today, foreign ministry spokesman cited political sectors as culpable, unidentified political influences. Somebody is funding these caravans. There is no way that these people who are the poorest of the poor can afford, what is it, $4,000 to $7,000 Tom, per migrant per crossing with the cartels you got to pay, with the human traffickers sometimes are involved in getting the payoffs. Who is paying for this? Someone is paying for this or they are selling themselves or their family members into some type of slavery of some period of time to pay for this. Does that not raise some questions here? HOMAN: I think it raises the question. I think it is more important (inaudible) we need to educate American people on this by not controlling our borders, by not controlling this caravan because this caravan comes across (inaudible) because all the loopholes that Congress (inaudible) fix are going to be released. It will entice more people to come. The money, we are bankrolling the very criminal organizations that smuggle these people, are the same organizations that smuggle drugs, smuggle guns, and have killed (inaudible). So this -- INGRAHAM: Congress has to act. Congress has got to act! The president I think is doing about as much as he can here. It puts the migrants lives in danger. It puts children's lives in danger and it helps the cartels become more and more powerful. Jose, I want to play for you, this is Rafael Hernandez who is a Honduran immigrant. He is one of the members of the caravan. Now, this is in Spanish but you can read the subtitles about why he is moving with this massive -- massive fellow Hondurans. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): The reason for being part of this march is to be part of the American dream, to improve ourselves again, for our children, for our family. The motivation for us to migrate are the many shortages we face in our country. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK. I understand that. Pretty much a lot of people want to come to United States but he is not sighting (ph) a credible fear of persecution. He basically just wants to come to America because probably a lot of his family members are already there. Friends that told him when you come here I'll get you a job. That is not a potential asylum. ARISTIMUNO: And I agree with you 100 percent. So, we should do a better job as a government to amplify and to communicate to other countries, to know, hey, it is not easy to get asylum. You can come and you can try but most folks are not going to get it. So, I don't -- INGRAHAM: -- stop asylum applications at the ports of entry. ARISTIMUNO: That's crazy. INGRAHAM: Well, ports of entry make it more dangerous and they have to make that 1,000-mile trek. Why not to apply from their home country? Mark? ARISTIMUNO: They don't have that luxury. KRIKORIAN: Yes., See, the thing is you are saying that they're not going to get asylum, and most of them, even under Obama, 80 percent of people who went through the -- INGRAHAM: Were denied. KROKORIAN: -- were denied. But the point is, they are already in the United States. They been working may be for several years already while their case has been going on. And when they are finally denied at the end, they just don't show up and nobody is looking for them. So the whole point is to get in. INGRAHAM: They get here and then it's like get out of Guatemala or Honduras free card, correct. You get to stay, you're never going to be deported unless maybe you commit a violent crime, and even then sometimes you can come back, and so they know they're going to be able to stay. HOMAN: Less than five percent of family (inaudible) case immigration have been removed. And the gentleman you saw being interviewed, the reason he didn't use the asylum claim because he has been coached by the criminal organization in Mexico. Once he gets to Mexico, believe me, he will be trained exactly what to say to CIS to (inaudible). INGRAHAM: Everyone seems to say the exact same lines, like you start looking at the lines, they are all the same lines. My friends, thank you so much. And for more on why Trump won and how the GOP could do it again, grab a copy of my new paperback out, \"Busting the Barricades: What I Saw at the Populous Revolt.\" Now in bookstores everywhere, you'll love it. And up next, Newt Gingrich here in studio to explain how closely today's Democratic Party might resemble what we saw from some of them in the late 1960s. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Twenty-one days until the midterms and Democrats look to be selling, I don't know, something new like 1968 all over again. The more you see the visuals, the tactics, the lack of any tangible policy prescriptions, the more you start to realize that they are embracing the same themes -- victim culture, mobs versus jobs, stripping away law and order, hatred fo the president, and so on and so on. Hear with his thoughts on this and the segment we just talked about, the mass of humanity crushing our border, former speaker of the house, Newt Gingrich. He is also author of \"The New York Times\" best seller, \"Trumps America.\" Mr. Speaker, it's so great to have you in studio. Now, we know -- I know you want to talk about what we just talked about first so I'll let you hit that because I think this immigration issue is not the most important issue facing the country today in the eyes of the voters, economy and that, one of the top two or three. And Donald Trump has always been ahead of everyone else on this issue and now we have another scene of lawlessness coming up through Mexico and Honduras. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: First of all, I think Kevin McCarthy has offered the best bill and committed to bring it up in December to really do whatever it takes to strengthen the border. But let me just make one key point about all this. This is insanity. No country -- imagine it was your home and people down the street said, you know, I like your home. I think I want to come and claim I need refuge. And 6,000 people show up to your home and say, I really hope you'll take care of me. It is crazy. And we ought to adopt a policy that says to the Mexicans, nobody is crossing the border. So, if you don't want to stop them coming in from Honduras, they are going to be in Mexico. And I would do whatever it takes to control the border. Period. End of story. INGRAHAM: Congress has to act. They have to screen the asylum laws. They've been -- I mean, I'm glad McCarthy has come along to the gospel here. GINGRICH: The asylum law won't necessarily work if you actually control the border because they don't enter U.S. space. INGRAHAM: But they can walk in through a port of entry and claim asylum under current law. We have to change that whole process. GINGRICH: Well, I'm for changing that, but I'm also for saying that the ports of entry if necessary, if Mexico won't cooperate in stopping these people, it will be amazingly difficult for anything to get through the ports of entry. INGRAHAM: That would get their attention pretty quick. GINGRICH: You know, in about three days. INGRAHAM: Anyway, but you agree this is a big issue and a big opportunity for Republicans. GINGRIUCH: It is the fate of the United States. You open this country -- I have Gallup did a world survey, 165 million people would like to come to the U.S. You couldn't possibly observe that. Even left-wing cuckoos can't believe that. INGRAHAM: Americans don't want at the Gallup poll and let's say Americans don't want it. All right, Newt, 1968, one of our mutual friends (inaudible) and I were talking the other day, one of the great guys in radio and one of my old, old friends. He said, do you see some of the parallels going on here? It looks that they're going to move right from 1972 and nominate a far left guy, of course George McGovern in 1972, but before that it was a build up of lawlessness and a lot of violent hatred. GINGRICH: Actually (inaudible) in Des Moines last -- look, the hard left -- INGRAHAM: And quite surely (inaudible). GINGRICH: Which is now much of the left is committed to believing that they have the right to bully you, to attack you, to trash you. Antifa has said publicly, this is a hard left group, that they are intent to go in, destroy offices if they fell like it. And you just said in Portland, people are being harassed while the police sit there and watching. So people need to understand, the left today, the Democrats today stand for breaking up the whole process. Abraham Lincoln said it brilliantly at Cooper Union when he said, \"you will rule or you will ruin\" (inaudible) southern slave owners. Well, the modern American left resembles those southern slave owners and their commitment to rule or ruin. And that is why you are seeing scratching the Supreme Court door. INGRAHAM: Favorite image of the year. GINGRICH: Yes. And my goal is to ensure that the next 40 years, the closest they get to a Supreme Court seat is scratching on the door. INGRAHAM: Well, do you think this is a moment for Republicans, they united behind the Kavanaugh confirmation and look at what happened. The country was motivated and they are excited. This isn't fair. We wish all the best of all these women but it is not fair. Basic principle of fairness. GINGRICH: I had a woman call to me last night who said, she had been a Democrat. She's 75 years old, she has switched parties after Kavanaugh and every member of her family in four states had switched and she said she was disgusted. This was no longer the party of John F. Kennedy. INGRAHAM: Well, again, we have a situation where America and a midterm cycle usually, you know, you see the party in power lose seats. There have been a few occasions in which that did not happen. When was that? GINGRICH: That's right. Well, it didn't happen in 1934, it didn't happen in 1998, didn't happen in 2002. I think this year we're going to gain seats in the Senate for sure. And I think the way that things are developing right now because of Kavanaugh, I mean, these people are disgusted with the Democratic Party and a little frightened by it. I think we might actually shock them in the House. INGRAHAM: Project Veritas did on one of their undercover sting videos, and this involving -- yes, but this involving Claire McCaskill and a staffer talking about whether she is really, you know, open-minded on certain issues. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You were saying that you think she's more progressive than she lets on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think so too. I think she's a lot more open-minded to like alternative routes to things but she can't be open about that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because this is a 19 point Trump state. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because she would completely isolate the moderate Republicans. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like we have to lie to get elected. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Essentially. (END VIDEO CLIP) GINGRICHL: Well they do have to lie to get elected, that is why Bredesen is lying in Tennessee, that is why McCaskill is lying, that's why Sinema is lying, that's why Heitkamp is lying. I mean, go down the list - why Donnelly (ph) is lying. Look, there is a simple test every American can apply to your candidate for senator. Are you going to vote for Chuck Schumer? If you're going to vote for Chuck Schumer, you're a liberal. Period. End of story. I mean including (inaudible). People mostly (inaudible) the mansion. If you honestly believe what you claim you believe, how come you're not voting for McConnell? INGRAHAM: One also mentioned, you know, voted for the disastrous Obamacare, which was a complete disaster. GINGRICH: Of all these folks running back home, they say I'm really not the person you thought I was in Washington and I didn't mean to do it. And please elect me again. They just know how to say them straight up. If you're going to vote for Schumer you are a left-winger. You're putting left-wingers in power and therefore I have to vote against you. INGRAHAM: Yes, I know we have these people like in the 7th district of Virginia, Dave Brat (ph) of course, the unseeded Eric (inaudible), one of the big signs of this populist revolution coming when that happened. I mean, that's a tight race. That could go either way. And I look at the Virginia -- Commonwealth of Virginia -- you can't choose the Democrats here. I mean, that is going to take your state backwards. You want to go forward. Dave Brat (ph) and so many people like him are supporting Trump. This is why the economy is growing. This is why we're seeing optimism growing. GINGRICH: Well, that's why the line you used last week are the choices is jobs or mobs is real. I mean, let's be clear. We have the lowest black unemployment in history, we have the lowest Latino unemployment in history. \u00a0We have the largest number of unfilled jobs in history. The economy is growing. And the fact is, the Democrats promised to throw all of that away based on their socialist ideology. INGRAHAM: And the left still thinks that devoting hours of coverage to Michael Avenatti and Stormy Daniels, and the president sent a tweet out and a phrase which I don't think he should have done, but they think the voters are going to turn out because of a tweet. They still don't get it, Newt. GINGRICH: No, they don't get it. But people ought to look at this stuff and say to yourself, do you want a party which has been delivered results for the last two years, or do you want a party dedicated to resistance? \u00a0Because that is really what the choice is. And I think the average American is going to look at what is happening, and I think they're going to conclude that in fact Republicans have been doing a pretty darn good job, and the Democrats are, frankly, kind of scary. INGRAHAM: Results versus resistance, Newt Gingrich, we love having you. GINGRICH: Always fun. INGRAHAM: Thanks so much. And the Democrats were sure that Hillary Clinton could leave them to victory with a coalition of women that included white women, but when that didn't happen, they became the new enemy. We reveal the examples, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: When 52 percent of them voted for Trump on election day, 2016, the left found a new target to deride, white women, an odd voting bloc to alienate ahead of the midterm elections, don't you think? In the last couple of weeks, though, they've been called white privilege apologists. A \"New York Times\" opinion piece noted that they will defend their privilege to the death. Following the Kavanaugh votes, Susan Collins and others supported the basic principle of due process were called, quote, rape apologists by the women's march. And who can forget earlier this year when Hillary Clinton claimed white married women only voted for Trump because of their husbands. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, D- FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We don't do well with married white women. And part of that is an identification with the Republican Party, and an ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining me now to react, FOX News contributor Rachel Campos- Duffy along with speaker and activate Jamila Bey. Jamila, is it wise to alienate a voting bloc that is pretty big? White women? Some of the things that are being said, it is like a whole voting block stigmatized based on their race. I thought we were supposed to get away from that? JAMILA BEY, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Clearly. You're right, we are supposed to get away from that. I don't think it is an issue of stigmatizing and entire voting bloc. I think it is looking at people who don't vote in line with the particular group we are talking about. So if we're talking about the left, which is a multitude of people who just left of center, there are a lot of opinions. There's a lot of diversity. And they are talking about the white women who voted for Donald Trump. They're not talking about all white women, and I don't think -- INGRAHAM: White women can't vote for conservative? BEY: Every American should have the right to vote for whoever he or she -- INGRAHAM: I agree with you. Let me play this. Michelle Bernard, who was a -- she is great. I'm sure you'd say she's great. I don't know her. She made an interesting if not controversial point on AM Joy. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE BERNARD, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I do not see any reason for Democrats to believe that after the Brett Kavanaugh hearings we are going to see a flood of white women, particularly Republican red state feminists, come out and vote for Democrats. Whatever is going to happen in the midterm elections, it is going to be because of the vote of black women and other women of color. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Rachel Campos-Duffy, your reaction to that? RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think this whole thing come everything we have seen over the last three weeks, Brett Kavanaugh, Kanye West, the total meltdown by the left about that, the lawsuit in Harvard between the Asian-Americans who are suing over affirmative action at Harvard, and even Senator Warren with her clinging to the idea that she still is this hope, that she is Native-American, what we are all seeing is the death throes of identity politics. It is finally, I think, reaching the ends of its game where it has become so ridiculous to tell people because they are women or because they are black or because they are Asian or white how they should think and how they should vote. People are rejecting this en masse. Frankly, I think it is why they voted for Donald Trump in 2016, because as crazy as some people might think he was and how unpredictable and how untraditional he ran his campaign, they felt this was the last hope to try and break this down. I think it's starting to break down. And I think that's why you saw what you saw this whole week, especially with Kanye. \u00a0And now you see they are going after white women and telling them that they are traitors of their gender. It is ridiculous. INGRAHAM: Here's something I wanted to read to Jamila. This is from The New York Times. The headline is \"White Women, Come Get Your People\" by Alexis Grenell. This October 6th. This is part of it. \"White women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources from mutual gain. So it seems that white women are expected to support the patriarchy, marrying within their racial group, reproducing whiteness, and even minimizing violence against their own bodies. So white women who voted for Trump did so to prop up their whiteness.\" I have got to say, that is one of the wildest things. I read a lot of wild things. I don't know anyone who thinks that way and I don't know any women who are smart, working at home or working out of the home who vote because of their husbands or think about a patriarchy monopolizing their thoughts. \u00a0Jamila, you seem a purely smart person. How is that not really condescending to women? BEY: Let's be real aside. People tend to -- aside from the Carville marriage, Carville-Matalin, most people marry people who think similarly. CAMPOS-DUFFY: Why do you assume that the women are following the men? BEY: I'm not making that assumption at all. CAMPOS-DUFFY: I know lots of marriage where the men can agree with the women. BEY: What I am saying is it is not a hard point to make that like marries like. You tend to marry somebody you think like. If that is the argument that was made in a \"New York Times\" piece, it's not -- INGRAHAM: It's an obsession with the whiteness. Again, I just think the obsession with race is not breaking through I don't think to a lot of people. They just want a better life. They don't want the obsession, as we saw the other day with Stacey Abrams in Georgia where she said, I represent black, white, disabled, differently-abled, pacific islander, and then she said at the end, documented and undocumented. Everything is too hyphenated and everything is too segmented. I think people want to be more unified and more hopeful about just being together as Americans like we were after 9/11. Like what is wrong with that? BEY: I certainly don't hope we have to see a terrorist attack on American soil again before we recognize that -- INGRAHAM: I'm just saying -- CAMPOS-DUFFY: We don't have to go back. BEY: I know you're not saying that, but I'm saying we can find that in other ways. INGRAHAM: I bet if you and I say down for a half-hour we could find five major things we actually agree on, about kids, about conservation, about how to treat animals. I think that's a lot of stuff we agree on. And Rachel Campos-Duffy, I think, though, President Trump does have to be careful. The women's vote is sensitive. Tonality matters to women. The tone does matter. I don't think the horse-faced thing was smart. I have to say that wasn't my cup of tea. CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was grotesque. It was grotesque. It was unnecessary. \u00a0That said, we need to get away from talking about gender and skin color and who is more oppressed and who is the bigger victim. We need to talk about ideas. And we don't need to go back to 9/11, Laura. What we need to do is go back to what MLK said, which is we need to be about the content of our character and not the color of our skin. That is the America people want back again. And I think that they are voting that way, and they are responding to that because they are tired. They're just exhausted from identity politics. INGRAHAM: I think we have to end on that, unfortunately. But what a fantastic conversation from both of you, Jamila and Rachel, thank you so much. And the new cycle, by the way, has in many ways you could say been breaking towards Trump lately. Victor Davis Hanson is here to explain exactly why that is, plus his reaction to the suggestions that President Trump is somehow to blame of the Saudi journalist being killed. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Are Democrats destroyed what was shaping up to be a really huge blue wave? The approaching caravan has put the focus back on immigration, an issue the Democrats have completely ceded to the president as far as I can tell. And the Kavanaugh battle revealed the left's shameless tactics. \u00a0And the calls, of course, for incivility from Eric Holder, Cory Booker, Hillary Clinton, they show they care more about promoting anger than solving problems. Kick them when they are down. Joining is now to discuss, Victor Davis Hanson, senior at the Hoover Institution. Victor, it is great to have you with us. What do you make of the recent political calculations we have seen from the Democrats, many of them of course with 2020 ambitions? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION: It is almost like they're wolves I wolves' clothing. I thought that they would at least try to disguise their empathies and politics before the midterm. But your past segment about white this and white this and white supremacy and white women, this is a time after the 2016 lessons that you should be appealing to the white working class if you want to win those states and yet they're not doing that. We saw during the Kavanaugh hearings, why not protect American jurisprudence. We all support due process. But when we get done with that circus it was as if the Democrats wanted to be on the side of the French Revolution. And then when we had all these demonstrations, Antifa and scratching like maenads on the Supreme Court doors, you would think that somebody in the party would speak up against that. But instead if you collate what Cory Booker said or what Eric Holder said or even Hillary Clinton, it was almost as if these people were seen as the paramilitary wing of the Democratic Party. And then the height of silliness, why now would Elizabeth Warren come out when you have this high profile trial, suit by Asian-Americans against Harvard in the same city, and then proclaim that she is one percent, maybe, one percent at best and therefore all along really was a genuine minority. \u00a0She should have apologized. And then it is all topped off by this caravan, and what are the Democrats going to do? Are they going to say let them in because they have a right for refugee appeals or something? Anybody knows in their right mind that you can't have a nation when people storm across the southern border by intent and they are empowered by the Mexican government. So all of these issues -- INGRAHAM: It's a huge plus for the Republicans, Victor. The president is so far ahead of everybody else on this issue of immigration, all the other politician. He sees it. He knows it's a problem. He wants to fix it. He is very frustrated with Congress, as he should be. But I also want to talk about foreign policy, Victor. That is really your forte in many ways. This Khashoggi murder at the consulate in Turkey, the Saudi consulate, there are actually liberals blaming this on, somehow on the chaotic foreign policy of President Trump. And he addressed these general issues tonight with Trish Regan. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You will start here, what is happening? Turkey is looking at it very strongly. We're all looking at it together. But Turkey and Saudi Arabia are looking at it very strongly. \u00a0And it depends whether or not the king or the crown prince knew about it, in my opinion. Number one, what happened, but whether or not they knew about it. If they knew about it, that would be bad. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I don't think most American voters, aside from the barbarity of this, the American voters, this isn't the issue that motivates them on the election time. It might be something we have to deal with, but it is extremely complicated. HANSON: Yes. To paraphrase Winston Churchill about the Soviet Union, it's a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery. When you go into an embassy you expect that to be a sanctuary, and we are living in 2018, not the medieval period where you draw and quarter bodies. So that is stunning and shocking. But on the other hand, and also Mr. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident, he went to university in the United States, he wrote op-eds, so there was a lot of drama to this. But on the other hand, a lot of our shock has been that -- we are not shocked by what Saudi Arabia does. That is embedded with our relationship with Saudi Arabia. That said, what we're worried about in geostrategic terms is we've had an alignment now with the Gulf monarchies, the moderate Arab states, Israel, believe it or not, to confront the existential treat of a nuclear Iran and its terrorist appendages like Hezbollah or Hamas or people in Syria. So we don't want to jeopardize that new alignment. And yet we don't want to condone it, and I think Trump is trying to square that circle. It is very difficult to do. INGRAHAM: It is a balancing act, VDH, and the president is trying to do it. It is not easy. But the idea that he can be blamed. Richard Haas was like, at some point an amoral foreign policy becomes an immoral foreign policy. U.S. foreign policy under Trump has reached such a point -- we won't even bother with that. But the Council on Foreign Relations is not exactly I think speaking for most Americans. Thank you so much, Victor, we really appreciate it. And coming up, we have a new series for you just ahead, hidden scandals revealing with the networks will not tell you about certain candidates. \u00a0Our expose in part of Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now to a new segment ahead of the midterms, Hidden Scandals, what the media are not telling you about certain candidates. With the midterm elections just three weeks away the media are picking teams. And one of their favorite players this cycle is Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat darling challenging Senator Ted Cruz for his Senate seat in Texas. \u00a0Outlets have published glowing profile after profile, fawning all over the new lone star star leftist before he even won a primary. On February 19th The New York Times affectionately dubbed Beto the lone star longshot. TIME magazine in May said Beto O'Rourke is on a long, hard road. But they described O'Rourke as handsome and charismatic. This past August, Esquire wrote \"Meet the Man Democrats Hope is the Next Obama.\" Going on to ask, \"Is this the man who could save the world from Trump?\" And finally Vanity Fair went to the place that sends a shiver up any Democrats leg, calling him Kennedy-esque. As it turns out, Beto, whose name is Robert Francis, is more Kennedy-esque than we thought. What those features failed to fully examine is O'Rourke's 1998 DWI, the details of which were much worse than previously reported. \u00a0Now, the news, details that were finally revealed in a August 31st \"Houston Chronicle\" piece. Beto had this to say when confronted about the incident during a debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BETO O'ROURKE, D- TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE: I did not try to leave the scene of the accident, though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense. And I will not try to provide one. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But Beto's answer here directly contradicts the police report obtained by the \"Houston Chronicle.\" In it a witness reports that O'Rourke was driving drunk at a high rate of speed, then lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median into oncoming lanes. The witness, who stopped at the scene, later told police that O'Rourke had tried to drive away from the accident. The media's incessant puff pieces on Beto O'Rourke have scarcely mentioned a 20-year-old DWI, downplaying the incident if they even mentioned it at all. What is more, the press, which prides itself on accountability, has shown little interest in calling out the lie. All right, we'll be right back. Last bite is coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's time for the last bite. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL MOORE, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER: He outsmarted -- he may be the smartest candidate ever to run for the president of the United States. And he continues to outsmart the left and the liberals and the Democratic Party. And unless they start to respect the fact that he is going to be in office for two terms they will not prevent that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Poor Michael. Does he ever wash that baseball cap? God bless him. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"Fox News @ Night\" team, take it from here, Ms. Shannon.\n\u00a0Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

BRIAN KILMEADE, GUEST HOST: Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" I'm Brian Kilmeade, once again filling in for Tucker, while he enjoys a vacation with his family well earned. The most controversial battles of the 2018 mid-terms are being fought right now in, guess where, Florida. On Election Night, Governor Rick Scott had a big lead over incumbent Senator Bill Nelson for that Senate seat. But since then, a constant stream of votes in Left-leaning Broward County and Palm County has appeared to chip away at Scott's leads, who went from 40,000 now to around 15,000. There's plenty of reason to be suspicious of that as well. Now, Broward County has a long history of electoral problems. Let me refresh your memory. In 2000, they contributed to the Florida recount mayhem. Just two years later, primary election in the County was a disaster with broken voting machines, uncounted ballots, no-show poll workers. 2003, they get their act together? No. More than 17,000 mail-in votes were returned as undeliverable. In 2004, County officials grossly mishandled absentee ballots keeping thousands from reaching voters in time. It's only gotten worse more than a decade later. In 2016, the County was sued, once again, for mishandling absentee ballots and was also caught illegally destroying ballots even as a lawsuit over primary outcome was pending. The woman responsible for that is still in charge of counting Broward's votes today, and that is mind-boggling. Yesterday, on this program, Marco Rubio denounced the whole process for violating Florida's own election laws. Today, President Trump joined in on the attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you look at Broward County, they have had a horrible history. And if you look at the -- the person, in this case, a woman, involved, she has had a horrible history. And all of a sudden, they're finding votes out of nowhere. There's bad things have gone on in Broward County, really bad things. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: And the President's off in Paris now. Various members of the press though claim that simply by being concerned about possible fraud, it's the GOP, not Broward County that is behaving like a banana republic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: You actually have Republicans Marco Rubio in the fevered swamp of conspiracy theories. Donald Trump like (ph) this is third world-- MIKA EMILIE LEONIA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC'S MORNING JOE CO-HOST, FORMER CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Can it be a little less obvious? SCARBOROUGH: --this is third world country stuff coming from the Republican Party. MAX A. BOOT, AMERICAN AUTHOR, CONSULTANT, EDITORIALIST, LECTURER, MILITARY HISTORIAN: Listening to Rick Scott, I mean his primary evidence that there is fraud seems to be that his voter margin is going down, which would seem to be an indication that he's not getting as many votes as he would like. CHARLES MCRAY BLOW, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, COMMENTATOR, VISUAL OP-ED COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES: What we see proof of is the exact opposite of what he's describing, which is actually voter suppression, not fraud. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Right. Even though they were supposed to tell us how many votes there were by closing time, 30 minutes after the polls closed, we're still doing this two days later. But it's Republicans that are really showing voter suppression. Craig Patrick is the Political Editor and Chief Investigator at WTVT for Fox Tampa Bay's affiliate. He's covered politics in the area in Florida for many years, and joins us tonight. Craig, it's always Florida. And again, we're brat -- we're back in Broward County. What's the latest? I mean I -- I'm sure you spoke to the -- to the Scott camp too. I just spoke to them 10 minutes ago and they said they got -- a Judge said 7 o'clock Eastern Time, I want all the ballots to the Scott camp. They got them. They said they call it a huge document dump. But it's not actual documents. It came to them in terabytes. What can you tell us? CRAIG PATRICK, WTVT FOX TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: I can tell you that Broward County has had a long history of blunders that predates this by a -- a wide clip. If you're looking at why these ballots keep trickling in, the vote count keeps going up, this is coming from provisional ballots all across the state, people who showed up at the wrong precinct or maybe didn't have their ID combined with some vote-by-mails that came in on Election Day. And those are trickling in from some Republican strongholds too in North Florida, but it is disproportionately, absolutely Southeast Florida and Broward County. You gave a great summary of the problems Broward County has endured. But the list goes on and on. We're talking about a county a couple of years ago that forgot to print a medical marijuana amendment on some of the ballots leaving it blank that at one point, a while back, released vote totals while people were still voting. Oops, you weren't supposed to do that. And with that, Republicans and Democrats alike are very concerned about Broward for different reasons. Democrats concerned that maybe a goofy ballot may have caused a lot of people to overlook the Senate race because it was tucked in the lower left below the instructions may have cost Bill Nelson votes. Then you have the Scott camp, Marco Rubio and others looking at Broward County's recent history of breaking the law, illegally destroying ballots, raising suspicions in their minds as well. And with this, once again, it's all about Florida, and it is all focused on Southeast Florida. KILMEADE: The way I understand it, Craig, and correct me, by noon tomorrow, Broward County's got to tell us who voted for who and -- and what the -- what the totals are. Now, they were supposed to-- PATRICK: Yes, yes. KILMEADE: --right? So, 30 minutes after the polls closed-- PATRICK: Yes. KILMEADE: --they were supposed to submit all their ballots. They didn't. So, for Republicans to -- for a Republican candidate to win and then to hear about uncounted ballots and then see their lead dissipate knowing that they broke the -- they broke the rules already, why is that voter suppression? You just can't have votes coming in for weeks. That's called we had a -- the kids head off (ph) from school for a reason. It was Election Day. PATRICK: And that's exactly Governor Scott's position on this. The Democratic position would be because of the blunders that exist in Broward County that go way back in time under the leadership of Snipes who was appointed by former Governor Jeb Bush. She is a Republican appointee. They have qualms with long-running blunders that they say have affected Democrats and Republicans alike. And again, they point to what they think may be either a machine calibration issue or a funky design of a ballot, in which case a race like this one-- KILMEADE: Right. PATRICK: --can be easily overlooked. This is something though that's going to come out in the wash. We will find out in the course of a recount if there is something to that or not. KILMEADE: And by the way, when you mean by funky ballot, evidently, the bottom left you would know you voted of the -- of the ballot was the senate race, up top was the governor's race, so everyone seemed to vote for governor-- PATRICK: Yes. KILMEADE: --and not as many for senator. A lot could be because you had an exciting brand new candidate, Andrew Gillum. That was a lot more interest it seems in the governor's race regardless. Democratic lawyers are going to push on this and basically try to devalue the ballot. They're going to look for a -- another statewide count. But we're not talking about 500 votes. We're talking about now 14,000 votes and over 30,000 votes-- PATRICK: Yes. KILMEADE: --in the -- in the governor's election. Unbelievable. Craig Patrick-- PATRICK: I -- I think, yes-- KILMEADE: --thanks so much. PATRICK: --thank you. KILMEADE: All right. Meanwhile, protesters in Florida are denouncing Brenda Snipes. You saw that, split the screen with them there. I should have explained that to you, people going crazy. The Broward County Supervisor of Elections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROWD CHANTING USA) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Supervisor of Corruption (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Supervisor of Corruption (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Supervisor of Corruption (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Supervisor of Corruption (ph). UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Supervisor of Corruption (ph). (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: So who is Brenda Snipes? And why is she provoking such a strong reaction? Why does she still have a job? Lisa Boothe is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Women's Voice. She joins us right now from undisclosed location. LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, OUTNUMBERED, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Brian. KILMEADE: I just saw you Lisa. Why aren't you in studio? BOOTHE: I'm in D.C. visiting family. So-- KILMEADE: All right. Now, you're supposed to check-in (ph) with me today. So, Lisa, who-- BOOTHE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. KILMEADE: --who -- who is this woman? BOOTHE: Well, it's your former guest comment, she was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003. But she is a Democrat and she has been elected ever since to the position of the Supervisor of Elections for Broward County. Now, Broward County is the second most populous county in the state. It is also the most Democrat as well. And it's not just Republicans who have been critical of her either. The Miami Herald called Broward County the most controversial Department of Elections in Florida. So, she's also received wide criticism from all around, really dating back to even 2004, where she failed to send out, I think it was something like, over 50,000 absentee ballots from individuals who had requested them. But also, just look at what happened in this year alone. A Judge just ruled that she was in violation of Public Record Laws from Florida for not fulfilling Rick Scott's campaign's request. You also go back to May and a Federal Judge found that she was in violation of both state and federal law for illegally destroying ballots in regard to a 2016 primary between Debbie Wasserman Schultz and a Bernie Sanders guy, who sued. And mind you, the destroying of these ballots happened in the midst of a lawsuit she was facing regarding public records request regarding those ballots. So, that's kind of sketchy. And then, you also go back to August and a Judge ruled in flavor -- favor of the Florida GOP that she was privately looking at absentee ballots so that they couldn't be contested or looked at by other people, a judge ruled in favor of the Florida GOP regarding that. She's also gotten in trouble for releasing voting information 30 minutes prior than the closing of the polls in-- KILMEADE: And that was 2016. BOOTHE: --2016, when that's -- it was actually the same primary where she got in trouble for destroying the ballots with-- KILMEADE: Right. BOOTHE: --Debbie Wasserman Schultz. So she -- there's been a whole, you know, a whole thing-- KILMEADE: Right. BOOTHE: --even dating back to 2004 that she's received criticism over. KILMEADE: Right. BOOTHE: And it's not just from Republicans. KILMEADE: Lisa, not only is she doing a bad job. Almost anybody else in the state could be doing a better job. So I -- so I asked the Governor's Office. I said, \"Why isn't she fired?\" And they said, \"It's a lot harder to fire somebody if they're elected.\" So there's it's much more complicated than, let's say, you or I. We can get fired right away, you know? But now, I guess it's a little different there. Bottom line is she -- that's where the focus is. It's extremely Blue area. You cannot blame the Scott camp for being worried. BOOTHE: Well and he-- KILMEADE: Final thought? BOOTHE: --well he could have removed her for incompetence. There's precedent for that. The person that was in that job before her was removed for that very reason. My understanding is that's not really the approach of the, you know, Rick Scott administration. But I -- I think it's very clear. She's incompetent. And there's a lot of questions regarding what she's doing in Broward -- in Broward County. KILMEADE: All right. Let's see tomorrow, Saturday at noon, we're supposed to get the totals. Hopefully-- BOOTHE: Right. KILMEADE: --we can move forward from there. Lisa, thanks. BOOTHE: Thanks, Brian. Have a good night. KILMEADE: You too, OK. Events in Florida evoke another high-stakes race nearly two decades ago, the 2000 Florida presidential recount. Could Democrats be seeking a more successful replay of that election? Ken (ph) Blackwell is a former Ohio Secretary of State and Senior Fellow with the American Civil Rights Union. The ACRU took part in the 2000 recount fight and, more recently, sued Broward County's Election Supervisor for not adhering to federal law to keep accurate voter rolls. Man, were they ahead of their time? The case is now before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Can I laugh -- Ken Blackwell, great to see you. Can I laugh when other networks-- KEN BLACKWELL, AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS UNION SENIOR FELLOW, FORMER OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE: Brian, good to be with you. KILMEADE: --or other channels or commentators say the Republicans are trying to suppress the vote. What are you talking about? The voting day is over. They're the ones who didn't hit the bar they were supposed to. And now, when Republicans say why are we still counting votes, they -- they say the Republicans are being aggressive, you know, trying to -- to change a verdict. They would -- Rick Scott was up by 40,000. BLACKWELL: Oh absolutely, look, the -- the -- the forces on the Left, the Democrats and -- and -- and their allies are trying to push this to what I call within the margin of litigation. They -- they -- they are manufacturing voters and they're doing it with an architect, Superintendent Snipes, who has a record of gross incompetence and -- and fraud. And -- and it is a shame that she's still in this position given the fact that through her own admission, she -- she lacks the -- the management skills to provide an election that has integrity and has the -- the confidence of the -- of the voters. Brian, look, at the end of the day, what is going on now is akin to a banana republic and a failed state. And that's -- that's a shame because the people of -- of Florida, the legitimate voters who came out-- KILMEADE: Right. BLACKWELL: --and -- and voted cannot have their legitimate ballots negated by corruption-- KILMEADE: Right. BLACKWELL: --fraud and -- and voters who are being manufactured. KILMEADE: Ken, you're one of the few people that I'm going to be speaking to tonight for the next few weeks that knew how bad this was before the election and was actually taking action against it. How did we get to this point where she's still had a job, that Broward County wasn't straightened out, that 67, 66, or 65 other counties got their act together, went electronic after the embarrassment of 2000, and this one still hangs in the balance? BLACKWELL: Well look, let me -- let me go to -- to the Bible on this one. In John 3, there's a saying, \"Those who would do evil love the darkness.\" We have been pushing and pushing for transparency, and there has been a great resistance to that transparency. And so, in the shallows (ph), you know, we are now witnessing the manufacturing of voters. You know, we're -- we're -- we're seeing a welcome mat to Voters Without Borders. And as a consequence, what we have now at risk is the integrity of the election that could change the course of governance in America. KILMEADE: Well, the documents did come in as lawyer -- at the -- as the Judge demanded today. They do not know how many ballots. The Scott camp is now count -- counting them by noon tomorrow. Broward County has to come up with a -- a decision on who voted for whom and how many. We still do not have the overseas and military ballots. That's typical. We don't know if we're going to have to dip into them. BLACKWELL: Absolutely. Absolutely, Brian. Look, you know, the great Vince Lombardi used to always say, \"His team's never lost the game. Sometimes, the clock just ran out on them.\" Well, you know, if you look at what's going on in Broward County, what they are basically saying is that they don't lose elections because they don't let the clock run out-- KILMEADE: Right. BLACKWELL: --until they manufacture the voters that they need to win the election. That's just crazy. KILMEADE: Two quotes you gave you. John and you gave me Vince Lombardi. Good job. Thanks a lot, Ken Blackwell. Appreciate it. BLACKWELL: Good to be with you. KILMEADE: All right. I hope we will get a resolve to this. Meanwhile, Florida is not the only election that has gone haywire at the last minute. In Arizona, Democratic Kyrsten Sinema has taken a 20,000 vote lead over Martha McSally. What's happening there? We'll examine it, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: All right. On Tuesday night, it looked like Republican Martha McSally had managed to defeat Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona Senate race. That's what the polls were trending, and that's what we thought the result was. But, just like Florida, more votes have been surfacing, and they've been trending heavily Democratic. Yesterday, Sinema managed to take the lead for the first time in the tally by about 9,000. President Trump weighed in today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Now in Arizona, all of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes. And she's -- the other candidate is just winning by a hair. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: All right. Now we're joined by Trace Gallagher. Trace, I understand Sinema's expanded her lead up to o -- over 21,000 now today. Is that correct? TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: It is. And it's all about the mail-in ballots and where they fall, Brian. The way it works is in Arizona, if the signature on the mail-in ballot does not appear to match the signature on the sealed envelope then election workers in all 15 counties call the voters and try and fix or cure the issue. In fact, they call it curing. But Maricopa and Pima Counties, urban areas where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema performed better were allowing ballots to be cured after the election. So, Republicans sued to stop the process, saying calling voters after Election Day is a violation of state law. They argued that if some counties were allowed to cure ballots for several days after the election, then all counties had to be allowed to do the same thing. And today, a Judge agreed, giving the entire state until November 14th to end the so-called curing of ballots. Experts applauded the added oversight. But they say it really should only affect a small number of votes. President Trump, you said earlier, weighed in. He also said and I'm quitting -- tweeting -- quoting here, \"Just out in Arizona, signatures don't match. Electoral corruption. Call for a new election? We must protect our democracy!\" though it is very highly unlikely that a new election will happen in Arizona. Brian? KILMEADE: Well we might have to wait till next Wednesday, right Trace? GALLAGHER: Exactly. Next Wednesday, the 14th you should find out by 7 o'clock Eastern Time exactly what the final count should be. KILMEADE: Meanwhile, Trace I know you're occupied with the fire raging through Southern California. Thanks for concentrating on Arizona for us. I appreciate it. GALLAGHER: Yes. KILMEADE: Yes. GALLAGHER: Yes. KILMEADE: Wiping out everything. Meanwhile, Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. He joins us right now. So, know what, I don't really see much of a scandal in Arizona. The more people I talk to from Arizona they just say this is kind of the way we do things, which is something we should probably examine-- CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes. KILMEADE: --because we do have to wait till next Wednesday. I understand, Chris, with Sinema up top, she does have to tighten her belt because the counties that have -- that have been uncounted, the ballots are up to 457,000 uncounted, and some of them are in strong Red areas, how do you expect this to go? HAHN: I expect Sinema to win. I think this margin will hold. Probably, she might even increase it a little bit. Most of the outstanding ballots are either in her Congressional district or in Maricopa County, which is the home of the biggest city in Arizona. She's going to win this election. I think, most Republican strategists I've talked to last couple days feel the same, and they're just counting the ballots out there. I know the President's trying to -- to put a -- a spin on it. But no, they're counting. That's what they do after an election. They have mail-ins there. And the worst thing a -- an Election Commissioner wants is a close election because you wind up going a couple of days after and people get frustrated. We're in a instant gratification culture, and we're just going to have to be patient. They -- they don't take office till January 1. We've got plenty of time to figure it out. KILMEADE: So, if you're Rick Scott, do you blame him for being a little ticked off today? Even though he's the Governor of the State, he's looking at Broward County and he just cannot believe that this -- that County and Palm County are the two ones who don't even get close to doing what they're supposed to do, again. And that is telling us how many people voted 30 minutes after the polls. 65 other counties did it. No problem. HAHN: You know, if I'm Rick Scott, I'm thanking Broward County because-- KILMEADE: Oh. HAHN: --they messed up the design of their ballot and 25,000 people didn't vote for United States Senator. Those same 25,000 people voted for Agricultural Commissioner. I'm pretty sure that they weren't excited about Agricultural Commissioner. So, he should be thanking them, not using the power of his Office to try to intimidate election workers, who have till tomorrow-- KILMEADE: Right. HAHN: --to give him the results. And if he's got a problem with the way things are going there, that's what the courts are for. He went into court today to seek some relief. He got access to those ballots. And I think we should let it play out. Let's see where the votes go. They're going to count all the votes. And really, the margin of victory here might be those 25,000 ballots-- KILMEADE: Right. HAHN: --so he should be happy for that incompetence. And I don't like that incompetence at all. But I don't think there's a lot of dubious activity when it goes to counting the votes there right now. But there is dubious activity when the Governor of the State of New York -- of -- of -- of Florida utilizes his Office to intimidate those workers-- KILMEADE: Intimidating? HAHN: --and then Conservatives -- Conservatives send a mob to protest-- KILMEADE: Right. HAHN: --outside of them as they're trying to do their job. KILMEADE: Right. And by the way, Chris, I don't know if you have a monitor there, but we're actually splitting with a live shot of Fort Lauderdale as they ask each other, \"How did we get into this mess, again?\" When you'd say -- when you look at this, if you're Rick Scott, I don't know what he could do from county to county. But in Broward County, which, as you know, is mostly Blue, they have been riddled with-- HAHN: Yes. KILMEADE: --riddled with problems. In 2000, we know about what they did with broken machines, uncounted ballots, and no-show workers, undeliverable ballots, absentee ballots. In 2016, Chris, they closed -- they closed the -- and posted the election results 30 minutes before the election actually ended while the polls were still open in the county. They have been a mess. So right now-- HAHN: Yes. KILMEADE: --they're holding everything up. So, if you look at what they're doing-- HAHN: Well-- KILMEADE: --they're the ones who missed their deadline. HAHN: Yes. Look, the deadline's tomorrow at noon. And they're going to, if -- you know, hopefully they'll make that deadline. And remember, that's one of the biggest counties in Florida. These small counties where, you know, they seem to go overwhelmingly for Scott and DeSantis, they don't have as many people as Broward. In fact, there are more people in your building right now than in some of those counties. So there's -- there -- you know, there's a reason why this takes a little bit long -- longer. And hopefully, they -- they get it done right. But we need a uniform system so that this doesn't happen. KILMEADE: Lets you and I go down to Broward County and make them -- make them drill days before to get it done. There are bigger counties with more ballots and they're able to pull it off. But again, we're stuck in Florida. And again, we're stuck with controversy. HAHN: I agree. KILMEADE: Hey, you know who's getting rich? HAHN: I'm with you, Brian-- KILMEADE: The lawyers. HAHN: --but you're buying. KILMEADE: You got it, absolutely. HAHN: I'm with you. KILMEADE: All right, thanks Chris. HAHN: OK. KILMEADE: Great to see you. Have a-- HAHN: Thank you, Brian. KILMEADE: --have a fantastic weekend. All right, we'll see how that goes. Meanwhile the mid -- the mid-term elections have done nothing to stem the Left's meltdown over Russia, and the Mueller investigation. That story is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: All right. President Trump has landed in Paris. The President is in France to celebrate Armistice Day on November 11th, which will mark the 100th Anniversary of the end of World War I. And just before arriving, the President kind of ticked off, tweeted angrily about French President, Emmanuel Macron, writing, \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\" We'll continue to cover the President's visit to France unscripted, always fun, throughout the weekend. Meanwhile, with the 2018 mid-terms finally over, you might have hoped that the Left-wing protesters would finally calm down. After all, they got the House. But if you did hope for that, it was a foolish hope. In coordinated rallies across the country, last night, protesters turned out to protest in support of Mueller investigation and against the firing of their new idol, Jeff Sessions. Talking heads in the press played along. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL FRANCIS MOORE, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, LEFT-WING ACTIVIST: We now have a constitutional crisis within the constitutional crisis. We now have a state of emergency within the state of emergency. This has gotten very dangerous. MATTHEW MILLER, PARTNER AT VIANOVO, MSNBC JUSTICE & SECURITY ANALYST: This is a national emergency. I don't think you can overstate the gravity of the situation. The broad public, you know, this is the time to, you know, maybe take to the streets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is worse than Watergate. MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: He has been absolutely outrageous in the way that he has called names, outrageous in the way that he has threatened, outrageous in the way that he's promoting himself all the time. He wants to act like a dictator. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Get used to that voice for the next two years. Dan Bongino is a former Secret Service Agent and NRATV contributor. He's also the author of a brand-new book. It's great. It's called Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump. And he joins us right now. So, this guy's temporary, Matt Whitaker, he's going to be acting, President's going to talk to a few people, make him Attorney General and try to get him confirmed, probably happened. What's the problem with Matt Whitaker? DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE, FORMER NYPD OFFICER, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR, SPYGATE AUTHOR: There is no problem with Matt Whitaker, Brian. The Left is an emotion-based, well they're a bunch of Romper Room kids. I mean when are we going to learn as conservatives, I'm serious, to ignore these Looney Tunes? They move from one outrage campaign to the next. Today, it's Whitaker. Yesterday, it was Kavanaugh. Before that, it was the travel ban, the immigration crisis at the border. It's an endless outrage campaign. There's nothing wrong with Whitaker. The fact that Whitaker made some commentary on cable news about a case everybody was talking about does not disqualify him from acting impartially. I mean we just had Brennan and Clapper on cable news. Brennan accused the President (ph)-- KILMEADE: Clearly (ph). BONGINO: --of treason. Now, I want to make sure everybody gets that on the record, so now he cannot be appointed to a position in the future, either. I mean it's just another outrage campaign. Please, just ignore this stuff. It's nonsense. KILMEADE: So, what they're saying is Whitaker is going to come in. He's been a critic of Mueller saying things like the President's finances, as a commentator, like you are, if you took-- BONGINO: Yes. KILMEADE: --office right now, they would roll up the Dan Bongino tapes and say, \"How can he do that?\" You say, \"Well I'm a citizen and I'm allowed to have an opinion.\" Whitaker is a citizen. He's allowed to have an opinion. In his opinion, the Mueller investigation going to the President's finances is a no-go zone. Now he's in charge. And people worry that he's going to collapse the Mueller investigation. The President has -- has held his tongue for two-- BONGINO: Yes. KILMEADE: --not his tongue but he's not -- he's held back on Mueller for two years, right? BONGINO: Yes (ph)-- KILMEADE: So, why would he -- why would he -- why would he stop now? BONGINO: You know what's hysterical about this? He had an opinion. So did Andy Weissmann, who is Bob Mueller's chief pit-bull who emailed Sally Yates. We've seen the emails. He's investigating Trump now, congratulating Sally Yates for defying Donald Trump. Andy Weissmann is investigating Trump. And I get it everybody, oh Whataboutism. You're damn right it's Whataboutism. Oh, you just told us that you're not allowed to have an opinion or you're conflicted. Weissmann has an opinion and for on that matter with Whitaker, not -- because I don't want to get off that topic. Whitaker said something perfectly practical. The Mueller investigation and the probe was designed to probe Russian collusion. There's nothing in there about Trump's finances or his business deals. That was a perfectly accurate and appropriate opinion. This is just another outrage camp. Ignore it. Ignore these people. KILMEADE: Well who do you think or who would you like to see and who do you think the President will put in that spot? Pam Bondi from your state-- BONGINO: Yes. KILMEADE: --I know the President really respects her. Chris Christie was in there yesterday. BONGINO: Let me -- let me throw something out there. Some of the audience may -- may jump back. But we -- I would love to see Ted Cruz. You get a double whammy out of this. You get a solid constitutional conservative who will never fault. This guy is principled. KILMEADE: He's tough. BONGINO: We know it. We love him. Secondly, you get an open seat in Texas. The Dems will pour a bunch of money in there into Fool's Gold again. We'll get Beto number two. They'll waste all their money and time. They won't spend it in other Senate seats, and we win again in Texas. I think it's a great plan. KILMEADE: In your opinion, is the President looking back at the Whitaker controversy and letting it worry him in Paris today? BONGINO: I don't -- I don't think so. I mean, of course, he's probably paying attention to it. But the President's gotten very good at ignoring ridiculous Romper Room like far Left outrage campaigns. This is another one. It -- it'll blow over by next week. These rallies are ridiculous, anti-Sessions rallies. They -- they were accusing Sessions of being a Russian colluder a few months ago-- KILMEADE: Right. BONGINO: --now they love Sessions or pro-Sessions rise (ph). Even I'm getting confused about the Left. KILMEADE: I -- I was amazed because 8,000 people in New York got together to protest the firing of Jeff Sessions as if he's (ph) their idol, if they could pick him out of a lineup. BONGINO: Go to McDonald's. Have a coffee, folks. Chill out with the outrage campaigns. Please, take the weekend off. KILMEADE: You take the weekend off. You're in every show-- BONGINO: I -- I know. I can't. I'm up here. KILMEADE: --here (ph). What's going on? BONGINO: Plus, I heard you were guest host. And so, this was great-- KILMEADE: I'm honored. Fantastic. BONGINO: --in studio. KILMEADE: And I don't -- I'm so glad you didn't wear a tie. I regret-- BONGINO: Never. I'm not wearing a tie-- KILMEADE: --wearing a tie. That's how cool you-- BONGINO: --ever again. KILMEADE: --look, all right (ph)-- BONGINO: Actually, I'm sorry. But I can't do. I can't even make a tie. My elbows are arthritic so-- KILMEADE: That's right. Well that's what happens-- BONGINO: --yes-- KILMEADE: --when you do the U.S. TV (ph)-- BONGINO: --it sticks every time (ph)-- KILMEADE: --OK. BONGINO: --yes. KILMEADE: Thanks -- thanks, Dan. And thanks for your service. All right. Meanwhile, the migrant Caravan is still on its way north. And President Trump is preparing for its arrival. His Executive Order and the story that will handle this Caravan is coming your way. Watch as we take a wide shot and go to break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I just signed the Proclamation on asylum, very important. People can come in but they have to come in through the ports of entry. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: All right. Meanwhile -- it's good thing the President stopped before he went to Paris. He had a lot to say. The Central American migrant Caravan is still snaking towards the U.S. border. Now President Trump is responding, as you just heard, to its approach by tightening U.S. Asylum laws. This is really -- I'm very curious about to see if he's (ph) going to withstand a test. In a Proclamation signed this morning, the President says that nobody caught illegally entering the U.S. will be allowed to claim asylum after the fact. They'll never be citizens. The move is already facing a legal challenge. Andrew Arthur is a former Immigration Judge and Law -- Law and Policy Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, he joins us right now. Andrew, first tell me what this Executive Order with this Proclamation says. ANDREW ARTHUR, FORMER IMMIGRATION JUDGE, LAW AND POLICY FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: The Executive Order actually bars the entry of individuals who are entering the United States illegally to the United States. He's using his authority under Section 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA to do that. KILMEADE: So, he's saying, \"If you try to sneak in and, you know, you go and you claim asylum, you're not going to. If you don't go to the port of entry, you are never going to be a citizen. So you better go to the port of entry, and you better go in the right way, and then we'll hear what you have to say and see if it adds up to it -- to -- to the level that we accept you for asylum,\" right? ARTHUR: That's correct. And what the President is attempting to do is to channel everybody who has what's called a credible fear claim through those ports of entry so that they can enter in a orderly and legal fashion, rather than sneaking across the border, where we have to use our Border Patrol agents to go out and find them that it puts huge stress on the 16,000 Border Patrol agents who patrol the 1,900 miles of the border every day, and it -- it makes the system break down. So quite frankly, this is the best possible solution that we could have to have those people go through the port of entry. That will also give those people encouragements to applying to third country, Mexico, which is a asylum-granting country as well. KILMEADE: Yes. You know, I -- I -- I read that in the last fiscal year, 140,000 Central and South Americans have come to this country illegally. So now, if you ferry them to the port of entry then all of a sudden some are going to say this takes forever. The process is going to be so long, the -- the word's going to get out that it's not easy to get into this country anymore, and it'll have a positive ripple effect. That's the hope, correct? ARTHUR: That's exactly the hope. Right now, we're seeing about 2,000 people a day who are inadmissible to the United States, who are apprehended. The President is attempting to stem that flow. And that's even before the Caravan of individuals from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala even make it to the United States. So, you can imagine how much worse it's going to be once they do actually make it to this country. And the President's attempting to proactively, again, funnel those individuals into the ports of entry where they can be processed in an orderly fashion. KILMEADE: So, do it the right way. Work yourself towards a Green Card, you make the Green Card citizenship or do it the wrong way and blow it. Well, you're never going to be a citizen. There is this -- something called spared from deportation by qualifying for a lesser status notice, withholding of removal. That's in the bylaws. We'll see if this can withstand a legal challenge. But you just told me in the break that you think this is very creative and a very -- this is a very well-thought-out provision. ARTHUR: I really think that the President has had the experience of having his other Executive Orders and Proclamations subject to many layers of judicial review. And I think that they've done a very good job of crafting this one to sustain those challenges. KILMEADE: All right. And the ACLU will be there to test it. Thank you -- thank you so much Andrew Arthur. ARTHUR: Thank you, Brian. KILMEADE: OK. Let's move ahead. After disappointing mid-term, the Left is attacking GOP voting -- voting women based on their race. That story's next. Plus, Tucker's back after the break. He'll break down the mid-term results with Senator Joe Lieberman, Independent Joe. And I've been hitting the road on my book tour. I may be coming to a town near you. I'm going to Malden tomorrow with Curt Schilling, and the great Howie Carr, then Vero Beach on Saturday with Dan Bongino, hopes he join me at Vero Beach Book Center, then over to Fort Myers in the same day. Can I do it? Go to briankilmeade.com, find out more about Andrew Jackson and the Miracle of New Orleans, now out on paperback, and Number Three in the world, our world. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: Here we go. The Florida mess continues and the confusion reins (ph). We have just gotten word that Palm Beach County is going to defy a Court order and refusing to comply with that Court order that says by 7 o'clock tonight, they must tell the Scott camp and give the Scott camp all the ballots so they know how many people voted in their County. This is what's happening in Palm County right now. They have told -- excuse me, this is Broward. In Palm County -- Palm Beach County, they were just flat-out refusing to comply. So, if you are upset with Palm County right now it's not that you want to suppress the vote, it's because they are not following the rules, like Broward County broke them but we -- but we -- Broward County broke the rules. But at least they complied with the court order today. Palm Beach County is not. The Scott camp will have a statement shortly. Now this. Tuesday's mid-terms didn't quite turn into the Blue wave Democrats were hoping for Florida side. And in the aftermath, they decided to scapegoat women as a group. Now, on The View, yes, it's still on, Joy Behar says Republican women are simply too stupid to vote for anyone else. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: The women who still like him say that he is a protector, so they-- SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT & ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: Yes-- BEHAR: --so they (ph)-- HOSTIN: --a hero. BEHAR: --that he protects-- HOSTIN: Their way of life-- BEHAR: Right. HOSTIN: --and -- and their values. BEHAR: They don't know the different between (ph) a predator and a protector. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: Meanwhile, in one Vogue article, it blasted White women saying, \"As sure as Black women have proven themselves to be the often- underappreciated backbone of the Democratic Party, White women voters are establishing themselves as maddeningly, confusingly unsisterly.\" Not sure what that means, which is why I don't get Vogue. Online, Chelsea Handler tweeted this. 59 percent of White women voted for Ted Cruz. Now follow me here. We need to vote for the best interests of others and stop thinking about ourselves. I am not deep enough to follow that but Allie Beth Stuckey is. She's got a great podcast. Allie-- ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Thank you. KILMEADE: --make sense of this. Are White women too stupid to vote for anybody else? STUCKEY: I don't think so. But apparently, that's the thought on the Left. We hear this a lot not just in regards to White women but that if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, you're not just wrong but you're a bad person. And right now, we're hearing that especially about White women because they tend to vote, at least a large portion of them, for Republican candidates. And what the Left, and particularly, Leftist feminists cannot understand is that it's not that we're voting against the sisterhood, it's not that we're voting against women's interests, it's that we have different values that we do think are in our best interests. We are pro-life. We are pro-Second Amendment. We are pro-secure borders. That's not bigotry. That's not immoral. They're just our values. KILMEADE: You know, the thing is, I don't even feel comfortable reading the intro to this segment. I don't feel comfortable saying White women, Black women, older men (ph)-- STUCKEY: Right. KILMEADE: --we keep on-- STUCKEY: Exactly. KILMEADE: --segmenting ourselves and putting ourselves into boxes and categories. It's-- STUCKEY: Exactly. KILMEADE: --all counter-productive (ph). STUCKEY: I felt completely uncomfortable writing the term White women in the article that I wrote for a Town Hall. But it was really just using the Leftist terminology. And what we see increasingly, which I think this is very troubling on the Left is that they insist upon judging people by the color of their skin, by their political affiliation and their sex, rather than the content of their character. So, rather than talking to someone like me and asking me about my values, they say you're White, you're wrong because you're a Republican, and because you're a woman, you're also a traitor. KILMEADE: So, I watched Bernie Sanders make a comment and I'll paraphrase. He says essentially the reason why Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum didn't win it seems is because they don't feel -- White people don't feel comfortable yet voting maybe for the first time for a Black person but eventually they will. How wrong is that to say, to write, to think? STUCKEY: Well, of course, there are no statistics whatsoever backing that up. I am sure and, again, I don't even like talking about people based on the color of their skin. But I'm sure that most White people would say I'm going to vote for someone based on my values. KILMEADE: Right. STUCKEY: I don't really care what their religion is or what their skin color is. KILMEADE: Right. STUCKEY: But that's just not true on the Left. It's about, you have to fit into their ideology or else you're immoral. KILMEADE: Allie Stuckey, have a great weekend. Thanks so much-- STUCKEY: Thank you so much, Brian. KILMEADE: --for your insight. All right, we forge ahead. After Tuesday's mid-terms, Tucker sat down with former Senator, one of the great guys in Washington, Joe Lieberman. Here's his conversation with Independent Joe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Senator, thanks a lot for joining us tonight. JOSEPH ISADORE LIEBERMAN, INDEPENDENT POLITICIAN, ATTORNEY, FORMER CONNECTICUT SENATOR, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: I'm delighted, Tucker. Good to be back with you. CARLSON: Thank you. Thank you. So, as the results were coming in last night, and it was clear that the Democrats were going to retake the House of Representatives as predicted, MSNBC announced that one of the top priorities of the incoming controlling party would be to obtain Donald Trump's tax returns. Do you think that's the mandate of this election? LIEBERMAN: I don't. Whether they go for the President's tax returns or not is up to them. But that certainly shouldn't be their priority. I want to give you my personal perspective on left side (ph). CARLSON: Yes. LIEBERMAN: I'm the Chairman of a group called No Labels. We've been working to encourage bipartisanship in Congress. And this year, for the first time, we actually got into campaigns of people who were part of what we call the Problem Solvers Caucus. We raised over $15 million. We supported 28 candidates. 14 Republicans, 14 Democrats, and -- members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, 23 of them won. And the Democrats who won, which I think is why the Democrats now control the House, were actually more moderate, independent-minded problem solvers. So, I don't think they're -- they're going to go to Congress to get President Trump's tax returns. I think they're going to go to try to get something done for their constituents and their country. CARLSON: So, and -- and I think all of us hope that that's -- that that happens. LIEBERMAN: Yes. CARLSON: What -- but it does raise the question who's in charge of the Democratic Party? So, is that caucus bigger than the Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez caucus, which is substantial? LIEBERMAN: I don't know how many -- I don't think there're many people who are exactly where Ocasio -- Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is really a self-proclaimed socialist, I think-- CARLSON: Yes. LIEBERMAN: --weak on foreign policy and defense policy. Basically, wants the government to take over a -- a lot of the economy. But what -- what worried me when she was elected, Tucker, was that a -- a lot of people, including some potential Democratic presidential candidates, began to run after some of the positions she was taking, including, calling for the abolition now of ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. I mean that-- CARLSON: Yes. LIEBERMAN: --that's ridiculous. How can -- you may disagree with its policies but how can you have a country where there's no group enforcing immigration and customs laws? So, I -- I think this is yes -- what happened yesterday is -- was -- was good for Democrats in the House, but it's also a warning. I think they regained the majority by running more moderate candidates and suburbs. And moderate Democrats actually lost in the Senate and that showed, I think, some strength in President Trump, who worked hard to defeat a lot of those moderate Democrats. So there's -- there's -- there's good news and bad news and warnings for both parties here. And the last thing the Democratic Party should do, if it wants to have a chance to win the presidential election in 2020, is to follow after Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez. There's just not many people who believe that in America, thank God. CARLSON: I don't know how many Democratic strategists watch this show. I hope all of them. And I hope they write down your advice. LIEBERMAN: Yes. CARLSON: Senator, it was great to see you tonight. LIEBERMAN: Thanks Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you for that. LIEBERMAN: Good to be with you. CARLSON: Thanks. (END VIDEO CLIP) KILMEADE: All right, Joe Lieberman, great guy. Meanwhile, more breaking news out of Florida. We're going to go back down to Florida right after this. Don't move. Tucker Carlson not in, but he's thinking of us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KILMEADE: Chaos in Florida. They're embroiled in yet another election scandal. Phil Keating all over it. Phil, what's the latest? PHIL KEATING, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Brian, as we speak, provisional ballots are still being counted in Broward County at this hour, just hours after two critical court victories for Republican Governor Rick Scott. Scott's campaign for Senate sued the Election Supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties for more transparency and better access to observe the process. The Judge agreed. Tonight, Palm Beach County is appealing, asking for a stay. We should know more tomorrow. Brian? KILMEADE: Phil, stay all over it. I know you will. Tucker will be back on Monday.

            "article_content": "The military heads south to harden the border as a Central American migrant caravan approaches. William La Jeunesse reports from Fort Bliss, Texas. The first 100 active-duty troops have arrived at the U.S.-Mexican border to provide support for Border Patrol agents as a caravan of migrants slowly makes its way northward from Central America, a Defense Department official told Fox News on Thursday evening. The troops are doing initial assessments at the port of entry in McAllen, Texas. The official said there are about 2,600 troops now at staging bases, largely in Texas, with several thousand more expected to flow in through the weekend and move into California and Arizona. U.S. Army soldiers, assigned to 309th Military Intelligence Battalion and 305th Military Intelligence Battalion, working together to hammer a stake into the ground while setting up tents on Fort Huachuca, Arizona, on Thursday. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Brandon Best) The Pentagon said more than 7,000 active-duty troops are being sent to the southern\u00a0border, with more possible. President Trump has said the number could reach 15,000. Trump has drawn\u00a0a hard line on immigration just ahead of the midterm elections. Last week, officials indicated that 800 to 1,000 troops might be sent. On Monday, they announced that about 5,200 were being deployed. The next day, an Air Force general rejected a news report putting the figure at up to 14,000. The troops going to the border areas of Texas, Arizona and California are a small fraction of the nation's roughly 1.3 million active-duty service members, and the mission is set to last only 45 days. Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, who as head of U.S. Northern Command is leading\u00a0the military operation, dubbed \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d has argued that the caravan is a potential threat, although he has not fully defined the nature of that threat. Migrants from Central America, including many families and\u00a0hundreds of children, are slowly moving north, though they remain\u00a0hundreds of miles from the border. One group got into a violent confrontation with Mexican police at the border with Guatemala, throwing rocks.

Brandon Best) \u201cI think what we have seen is we\u2019ve seen clearly an organization at a higher level than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen violence coming out of the caravan and we\u2019ve seen as they\u2019ve passed other international borders, we\u2019ve seen them behave in a nature that has not been what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d Trump said he told the military mobilizing at the border that if migrants try to throw rocks at soldiers, they should act as though the rocks are \u201crifles.\u201d Soldiers from the 591st Military Police Company boarding a C-130J Super Hercules from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, on Wednesday. (US Air Force photo by Airman First Class Daniel A. Hernandez) Trump made the comments Thursday in a speech on immigration. He promised an executive order sometime next week that would ban migrants from claiming asylum if they cross the border illegally, and would set up vast tent cities that would hold anyone coming over the border. U.S. immigration laws say migrants seeking asylum can do so no matter how they arrive at the U.S. Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In a Trump administration hit by leaks, infighting and people looking out for themselves, Sessions fought to make America a better country. There are always aftershocks immediately after campaigns. The first one of the 2018 mid-terms arrived pretty quickly on Wednesday afternoon. The president fired his Attorney General: Jeff Sessions. For more than a year, the president has publicly criticized and ridiculed Sessions, so it was not very surprising. Now, the president has the ability to replace Sessions with a new appointment since Republicans held the Senate, clearly, he saw no reason to keep him around. Now, in theory, going forward, Jeff Sessions could challenge Doug Jones in 2020 to reclaim the Alabama Senate seat that he gave up to serve the president as Attorney General. If he did that, he'd almost certainly win. He's one of the most popular people in the state. We asked a source close to Sessions about that and he said that's probably not going to happen. Sessions will probably just retire into private life. And if he does that, of course, we will wish him the best. But it will be, and we should say this, a loss for the country. Donald Trump's longshot presidential campaign succeeded because he promised what so many voters wanted and, yet, what so few politicians were willing to campaign on because they are cowards. Among his many promises, the most important was his pledge to reverse decades of deliberate neglect and treat our national borders like they're real, like our country matters. Nobody understood that message better than Jeff Sessions. He understood it immediately. He was one of the president's first and most unwavering supporters, I think the first in the Senate, and it was because of immigration. When the president took office, he gave up an essentially lifetime post representing\u00a0Alabama to help fulfill Trump's mission. Sadly, the country was going another way. Within about five minutes of the 2016 election, Democrats decided their defeat was not about immigration or an abandoned middle class. It was instead, you'll remember, about Russia and the conspiracy between Vladimir Putin and Trump. Now, Republicans said they didn't believe that story. And yet, for some reason, many of them allowed Democrats to reframe the entire political debate in the country and make Russia the single biggest issue in American politics. But Jeff Sessions did not fall for that. He never let himself get distracted from the mission at hand. While everyone else obsessed over dossiers and FISA warrants, Sessions worried about the mission he was hired to do. He introduced a zero-tolerance approach to immigration prosecution. He treated illegal entry into the United States as a crime because it is a crime. His DoJ issued new opinions to restrict the exploitation of asylum laws in this country. He fought to strip federal funding from sanctuary cities. Courts ruled against him but he did everything he could to get those things done. His epartment accelerated the hiring of immigration judges, didn't get a lot of attention, but it's a big deal. More cases can be heard and deportations can take place more quickly. That's a service to America and also, by the way, to the people being held. On DACA, Sessions' refused to defend that program, which is unconstitutional, really, and induced the president to end the program. Sessions wasn't just effective at immigration though. He rolled back the Obama administration's soft-on-crime policies across the board. He pursued tougher penalties for drug dealers that earned the condemnation not just of liberals but of wealthy libertarians, who decided the war on drugs was a total disaster. This, at a time, when more people were dying every year of drug ODs than died during all of Vietnam. But the decadent decided, \"Oh, it's immoral to prosecute drug dealing.\" OK. The population knew differently because their relatives were dying. Of course, Sessions also ended the Obama administration's harassment of local law enforcement that helped drive a surge in violent crime in major cities. -- If you live in one, you know what we're talking about. Sessions did all of this even as the president who appointed him attacked him in public. Those attacks started more than a year ago after one of the president's public rebukes. We traveled with Sessions, just by chance, to El Salvador where he was pushing a fight against MS-13. Sessions made it clear he was in the cabinet to get results and would serve as long as the\u00a0president would have him. Here\u2019s this exchange from our interview with him: CARLSON: He [President Trump] has said again and again in many different forms throughout this barrage that you should have acted differently, you should have not recused yourself from oversight of the Russia investigation. Do you agree with that? JEFF SESSIONS, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, you know, I\u00a0understand his feelings about it because this has been a big distraction for him. But, Tucker, I talked to experts in the Department of Justice, people who have trained in that. I'm confident I made the right decision. CARLSON: You said the criticism was hurtful, and the president has made it really clear that he doesn't seem to want you to run the Department of Justice. Will you continue to run it? SESSIONS: Well he can make that clear at any time. I serve at the pleasure of the president. CARLSON: Yes. SESSIONS: If he's -- he wants to make a change, he can certainly do so and\u00a0I would be glad to yield in that circumstance. No doubt about it. Sessions wasn't perfect, obviously. He never seemed like an especially good administrator of a large agency. He sometimes got rolled by his staff. The Russian investigations have shown that FBI and DoJ are deeply politicized. And Sessions never seemed to fully get a handle on the\u00a0permanent bureaucracy beneath them. But if you take three steps back, here's what you see: In an administration beset with constant leaks and infighting, and people looking out for themselves and only themselves, Sessions was may be one of the very few people who never forgot why he was there, to make America a better country. We can only hope that his replacement will do the same. Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on November 7, 2018.",

            "article_content": "As the migrant caravan approaches the U.S. border, the president issues emergency national powers to limit the number of asylum claims; Trace Gallagher details the new policy. The Trump administration announced Thursday that migrants who attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally will not be eligible to claim asylum under a new rule meant to crack down on \"meritless\" claims. The rule,\u00a0which prevents migrants from claiming asylum if they do not do so at an official border crossing,\u00a0is the latest attempt by the White House to handle a surge in migration to the U.S. from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. President Trump is expected to formally enact the rule in a presidential proclamation Friday and will invoke\u00a0the same powers he used to push through a version of the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court, according to senior administration officials. \"Consistent with our immigration laws, the President has the broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest to do so,\" Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a joint statement.\u00a0\" ...\u00a0Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it. \u00a0Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\u201d The announcement was the latest push to enforce Trump's hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to scrap them. A senior administration official said the White House hopes that by funneling asylum claimants to ports of entry, officials will be able to assess and adjudicate the claims more rapidly. The official did not say where asylum-seekers would be housed should they arrive at those ports of entry in large numbers. The official added that the rule was not retroactive\u00a0and only covers future asylum claimants. Migrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved. According to DHS, the department has seen a 2,000 percent increase since 2013 in migrants claiming that they have \"credible fear\" of persecution should they return to their home country.\u00a0In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world. A senior administration official said Thursday that the vast majority of such claims are \"non-meritorious.\" Administration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \"withholding of removal\" -- which is similar to asylum, but doesn't allow for green cards or bringing families -- or asylum under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The rule change is likely to be challenged in court.\u00a0Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said they were clearly illegal. \"U.S. law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree,\" he said. The asylum section of the Immigration and Nationality Act says a migrant is allowed to make a claim up to a year after arriving in the U.S., and it doesn't matter how they arrive -- illegally or through a border crossing. Curbing immigration has been a signature issue for Trump, who pushed it hard in the days leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections, railing against caravans of Central American migrants that are still hundreds of miles from the border. As of Thursday, there are more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas. The military is expected to have the vast majority of the more than 7,000 troops planned for the mission deployed by Monday, and that number could grow. Trump has also suggested he'd revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \"tent cities\" to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations Thursday. The administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. Trump has long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown clogged. Officials have turned away asylum seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return later. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing. It's unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. About 4,800 migrants are sheltered in a sports complex in Mexico City, some 600 miles\u00a0from the U.S. border. Several smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south; officials estimated about 7,000 in all were in the country in the caravans. The migrants are largely poor people and many say they're fleeing violence; more than 1,700 were children under 18, and more than 300 were children under age 5.

            "article_content": "Why now? Is the left afraid of a red wave and the wall? Instead of playing politics with people\u2019s lives and sending out angry tweets, President Trump should be in the business of saving people\u2019s lives and should stop treating immigrants like a dangerous enemy force invading our country. Despite the president\u2019s tweetstorm Thursday, the roughly 4,000 men, women and children from Honduras fleeing violence and poverty who want to travel through Mexico toward the U.S. do not pose a threat. Like generations of immigrants and refugees before them, these immigrants are seeking better, safer lives in America \u2013 as President Trump\u2019s paternal grandparents, his mother and two of his wives did when they immigrated to the United States. And contrary to the president\u2019s campaign rhetoric, the immigrants coming here now are not members of an army of drug dealers, rapists and other criminals. The president tweeted Thursday morning: \u201c....The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA. Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border. All Democrats fault for weak laws!\u201d USMCA is the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on free trade awaiting ratification. The president said in another tweet: \u201c...In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..\u201d As the Honduran immigrants head toward the U.S.-Mexico border, we face a challenging moral and policy circumstance. This requires a response from the American government. The question is: what type of response? President Trump offered his solution in his tweets \u2013 end aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; call up the U.S. military to close the southern border; and scuttle the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. All while blaming Democrats. Less than three weeks from the midterm elections, this purely political solution is sure to energize a segment of the president\u2019s base. But it doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem. As the president\u2019s tragic \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy proved, not even taking children from their parents will keep Central American families from seeking a better life elsewhere. So, let\u2019s understand the problem and take a rational approach. El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras remain among the\u00a0most violent countries on the planet. To stop people from fleeing desperate circumstances, local, regional and international policies must be in place to stem the bloodshed and create real opportunities for economic development. President Trump should propose more targeted aid and incentives to grow the economies of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, while promoting the rule of law. Over time, if people can find work and live securely, they won\u2019t make the trek north. The U.S. currently provides approximately $500 million annually to these three countries, combined. This represents 0.012 percent of our federal budget. The Trump administration should also put in place a policy of setting up U.S. refugee processing centers in local areas near the communities that people are fleeing in Central America. This would enable mothers and fathers to get answers to their asylum requests before they trek 2,000 miles with their children, only to be turned away at our southern border \u2013 perhaps with the involvement of the U.S. military. About the military at the border: It sounds powerful, but it is neither necessary nor practical. The Border Patrol is already the largest law enforcement agency in our country and has not been able to justify its own desire for more agents. Finally, at our border, the president should spend taxpayer dollars wisely. This includes having the resources to fairly adjudicate asylum claims, so people who do not have a compelling case would be denied entry faster. It also includes ensuring that our ports of entry, where most attempted illegal smuggling takes place, have the necessary infrastructure and manpower. That\u2019s how we can protect the border and facilitate commerce and trade. Yes, we need a secure border; but we also need a smart border. After separating babies from parents along the U.S.-Mexico border and drawing ire and outrage across the country and around the world, now the president is threatening to use military action against men, women, and children who are fleeing a hopeless situation. America is better than this. Through our policies, we can show that we are a nation of laws and a nation of grace.",

            "article_content": "James Comey didn't just deviate from the rules. This is a rush transcript from \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" June 16, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And thank you once again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. Kellyanne Conway, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Anthony Scaramucci and Tomi Lahren are among my guests tonight. But first, a very important opening statement. I am a believer. I believe in the system and I believe in justice. I dedicated more than 30 years to the criminal justice system and the assignment of blame. Tonight I am not angry. I am just dumbfounded, disheartened and disappointed over the long awaited, often delayed Inspector General's report on the actions of the Department of Justice and the FBI in the handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation. The report's conclusion, 568 pages later, FBI Director James Comey was insubordinate. There were a few mistakes and a few errors in judgment, and although there was some bias, there was no evidence of bias in the handling of the e-mail investigation. This report mimics Comey's conclusions in the email case itself. Both the Inspector General and Comey make out a provable case, then conclude there is no case. Nothing changes. The deep state hard at work. I don't know about you, but I am so tired of lessons learned. They say Comey deviated from the rules, deviated from the rules? Comey and his FBI cabal fixed a case. Hillary not indicted for her crimes yet an effort to frame Donald Trump for no crime. And no bias in the conclusion because no one said \"Yes, I was biased,\" or said simply \"I am not biased.\" That's it. Every day in this country, murder cases are tried for where there is no admission of guilt, and only denials. And yet, jurors decide the accused intentions based on what they say, what they do what they don't do. Determining someone's intent is not that difficult. Intent can be determined like this, take a look at these texts. \"We'll stop him from being president.\" It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die when you are 40. Hillary should win 100 million to zero. \"America will get what the public deserves.\" And let's add a new one folks, from an FBI lawyer. \"Viva la resistance.\" Gee, isn't that Obama and Hillary's mantra. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand those statements. They not only indicate a biased hateful state of mind, they imply unequivocally a willingness to take official action to impact the election. How do you pledge resistance against the President while you are investigating him, and the inspector general says, there was no evidence of improper considerations impacting the investigation? Folks, Comey didn't just deviate from well-established practices. He didn't even do an investigation. He covered for it by having the same people handle both the Hillary case and the Trump frame up. Folks, it doesn't happen this way. This case is not about mistakes or errors in judgment. It's about a deep state trying to drag a crook across the presidential finish line and trying to destroy the man Americans wanted in the Oval Office. Example, Jim Comey said he had to step into Loretta Lynch's role because she wouldn't recuse herself after secretly meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac. That's baloney. He didn't just step into her role to prevent an injustice, he stepped in to her role to declare Hillary not guilty, and Jim if you are such a champion of truth and justice, why did you go along with Lynch calling a year-long criminal investigation a matter. Why did you say Hillary was extremely careless so as to not use the words grossly negligent, which would make her actions criminal and when brought before Congress, Jim, you punt and say, don't think grossly negligent applies. First-year law students across this country laughed at you. You take a case from normal field agents to investigate with no grand jury, no search warrant, no subpoenas and you give away immunities like candy with no requirement that those immunized testify against anyone. Investigators across the country laughed at you. And when you found Hillary's deleted emails that were marked \"C\" for classified, you decide to believe her when she said it was only a reference to the letter \"C\" in the alphabet in spite of the fact there was no A or B before C. People in the intelligence community laughed at you, Jim, and when you wrote an exoneration of Hillary months before you interviewed her and 16 main witnesses saying it's done all the time, attorneys across the country laughed at you. Come on, Jim, you acquitted her because like Hillary, you, Lynch and even Obama communicated government information via private e-mails, and you placed as many Trump haters as you could like your friend Mueller in charge of the make believe Trump collusion on the case. I want to know from this Inspector General's report, why don't we know what judge signed the FISA warrant? Who renewed the FISA warrant? And what actions they are taking now, now that they know they were conned by a corrupt FBI agent? And why was Peter Strzok arguably the most of corrupt FBI agent in American political history put on the Mueller team to destroy Donald Trump with his girlfriend Lisa Page? Why is he still working and why am I paying his salary? Why is Rod Rosenstein allowed to refuse to provide records and documents to Congress. And why is he allowed to threaten to subpoena records of those in Congress without any criminal investigation? Why Rosenstein didn't hand over the most of incriminating of all the texts, \"He won't win president. Don't worry, we'll stop him.\" A clear and unequivocal attempt to obstruct a Presidential campaign. Why are the DOJ and the FBI allowed to lie to a Federal judge and say, \"We have no e-mails between us on the Loretta Lynch- Bill Clinton tarmac meeting.\" Why can Loretta Lynch lie and use a personal e-mail and a fake name for government business? Tell me how many times does someone have to lie to an Inspector General before they are just not believable? Why does Hillary Clinton just days after she meets Bill the attorney general on that tarmac say she will keep Loretta Lynch on as AG if she wins as president? We are not stupid, and why does the IG not recommend a leaked prosecution when there are 65 phone calls from a reporter to a top FBI official? Why did Christopher Wray have to be brought to the White House to be convinced that McCabe needs to go? Isn't the FBI supposed to figure that stuff out on its own? I am worried. I am really worried. This report is nothing more than a white wash of the deep state by the deep state itself. There are great people in the FBI -- men and women -- and I have had the honor of working with them. But they are embarrassed because they know how bad Comey and company destroyed America's confidence and that esteemed FBI. And there are great people in government, many of whom you have seen on this show. Congressman Ron deDantis, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin, Matt Gates, Andy Biggs, Senators Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson, Chuck Grassley. These people are fighting the deep state as obstructionist Democrats like Pelosi, Schumer and Schiff stare into the cameras and turn truth on its head. They are not real Democrats, they are demon rats. That's what I said, demon rats. And until the Republicans learn to fight like they do and go with a narrative no one veers from, they and socialism will run amok in this country. We need people in Washington who believe in truth and justice and are not offended by the term law and order and believe in consequences. This is not a banana republic. This is the United States of America with a justice system that needs to be protected. It's time for those people who are not interested in supporting President Trump to get out of his way and that means you, Jeff Sessions. It's time for to you put on your big boy pants and start acting like the AG, and if you can't get on board with this President, then get the hell out of his way. Let me be clear to all you critics. I am not looking for that job. I am an ordinary American who was brought up to believe in truth and justice. And like thousands and hundreds of thousands of men and women in law enforcement, we are just damn embarrassed and hang our heads in shame with the likes of Comey and his cabal as well as the impotent inspector general's report which is nothing more than proof the deep state is alive and well in Washington, DC. That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. Now, joining me now to react to my opening and all of the development this week, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. All right, Kellyane, good evening. I am very disturbed by the inspector general's report. What is your take on it? KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Everyone should be disturbed and I am very disappointed that so many people just want to react rather than report. Really dig through all 550-plus pages, Jeanine because there is so much to unpack here, and people really should not just cherry pick the results of this report depending on their political point of view or conclusions that are in search of evidence. They really should be very disturbed in unison that we have people at the top echelon in the FBI, not the rank and file, good and decent men and women who do their job well every day, at the tippy top of the FBI, really trying to tip the scales. By the way, they lack such political instincts. They didn't see the Donald Trump revolution coming. They of course view what Hillary Clinton did a month or so later, which is insult his followers. Call into question their intelligence and mental fitness. Who they are. These are cultural leaks in the deep state under our nose, people laugh sometimes and flick it away when folks talk about the deep state, it is right there. Read the inspector general's report. Now, this should be the beginning, not the end perhaps of this conversation. Folks can ask -- I think they can ask Mr. Horowitz for more information. Congress if they are interested in learning more, they can certainly continue to pursue this and perhaps, they should in the interest of transparency and accountability. Jeanine, let me make very clear, folks, don't kids yourselves, we would know zero, we would know none of this if Hillary Clinton had been elected, and not Donald Trump. You wouldn't know what was going on at the tippy top echelon of the FBI. And who the heck was giving Jim Comey a hero's welcome two short months ago for this silly book about leadership and morality of all things. I don't need a lecture from Jim Comey about loyalty, morality, and leadership. It's embarrassing that people killed the fatted calf and rolled out the red carpet for his book tour when yet again, we see him putting himself before the process, a grandstanding, showboating, but more importantly, subverting the process. He was insubordinate and he went outside of Loretta Lynch's, the attorney general's responsibilities, I think, to act on his own and people should be very concerned about all of that. PIRRO: Let me ask you this, you know, for me and you're so right, I mean, I have read a lot of these 568 pages. I don't know how much it weighs, but the bottom line, Kellyanne is that they didn't make a criminal referral. They have said five FBI agents should be referred for disciplinary actions. Everybody is still working. No one is forced to be fired. There is no criminal referral as they did with McCabe. How do you think the American people are going to react to this? CONWAY: I hope they will react because -- but only if this is given a little bit more oxygen. That is my initial point that there is not a ton of coverage on this IG Report in the mainstream media right now. A little bit here and there. They checked the box on it. But we deserve a deeper dive. Jeanine, you can't with a straight face credibly say that we've spent over -- well, actually two years, next month will be two years since the Russia investigation started. Just the Mueller investigation is a year old. If for two years they have been investigating something against this president that doesn't exist, and yet people think that we should all go spend all this money and go on indefinitely about that. We are here -- you actually have some information that should -- I think animate Americans to want to hear more. But it's being ignored by those -- and I think some in the media are uncomfortable that people in the media were accepting -- excuse me, giving tickets to games and meals to FBI agents. That's very uncomfortable. PIRRO: Uncomfortable, people have gone to jail for that. Politicians have gone to jail for that kind of thing. CONWAY: Again, that's right. PIRRO: And this is the FBI, but I want to ask you about the Donald Trump -- the president tweeting today that, \"Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with Republicans. I think we've got that tweet, yes, on the screen for a change. This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at three things -- high taxes, high crime and obstruction.\" What now -- there is going to be a meeting, Kellyanne on Capitol Hill on Tuesday regarding the whole issue of immigration. What do you think is going to happen? CONWAY: The president as he is wanting to do is trying to bring everybody together to come up with some commonsense plan, but he cannot be more clear about what his vision on immigration is. He wants to have a sovereign nation that has physical borders. He wants to build the wall, obviously, but he also wants catch and release to end. He wants a merit based immigration system. He wants more ICE agents. You know, the Democrats think what the president is trying to say there is that these Democrats refuse to provide the funding necessary so that you can expand the detention centers, that you have more ICE agents -- some common sense measures and they have been saying -- and by the way, Donald Trump got here a year and a half ago. The immigration issue including at the border has gone on for a long time and if the two Presidents before him tried to deal with it also, Operation Streamline under President George W. Bush and President Obama (inaudible) in 2014... (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: Why does President Trump take the blame for what other presidents have did? Why is it so difficult? Why are these concentration camps for kids when they separate a parent from a child? CONWAY: That is really a horrible description and it is insulting -- I have talked to some people over this weekend. It's insulting to people who have had families in concentration camps who then perished. But I want to put that very charged rhetoric aside and make the very clear point that this President, he brought Democrats to the White House. They held court for an hour. But all the Democrats wanted to talk about was DACA. They just wanted to talk about the Dreamers. They never raised this with him. PIRRO: Okay, all right, Kellyanne Conway, thanks so much for being with us. CONWAY: But he'll be there to try to get a good policy in place. We need to fix immigration's complex set of problems and it will require a complex set of solutions. This is a great test, Jeanine, do the Democrats want to fix it or do they want an issue in the fall? PIRRO: They want an issue on the fall and all right, Kellyanne, thanks so much. And here with more on the continuing fallout from the IG Report, Congressman Ron DeSantis, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. All right, Congressman, you know, I understand that there are five FBI agents who are being referred for disciplinary action. That seems to be the toughest thing that came out of this 568-page, I think it is about five inches, six inches high report. What say you? REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FL, MEMBER OF HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, I think that's kind of a conundrum here, it's that the report has damning facts and evidence. They did a good job doing that. They were not really willing to draw the obvious conclusion on some of this stuff. Guys like Peter Strzok should be prosecuted. Let's look at this text message on August 8, Jeanine that we didn't have access before this where Lisa Page is going to Peter Strzok said, \"Trump can't be President, can he? Can he?\"  And Strzok says, \"No. No, he can't. We'll stop it.\" PIRRO: We'll stop it. DESANTIS: And they did not -- and that was a week after that same Peter Strzok who is saying he is going to stop Donald Trump from being president opens a full-blown counter-intelligence investigation against Trump's campaign based of an off-hand statement at a bar. They never produced that text message to Congress. Somebody deleted it. The OIG and the report said that they were able to get it forensically. PIRRO: That message that we're just hearing about, hold on, the message that we are just hearing about was deleted? DESANTIS: I think it was either withheld from production or the IG says they think it may have been deleted. Bottom line is, all of the other text messages from that day were produced. There was some human agency, I think that had to be involved to not produce that because all of those text messages were initially produced in 2017. Well what was happening in 2017? You had all the hoopla about the collusion investigation. Had this text message landed before Mueller was appointed and people see the guy who is running the whole thing said we are going to use it to stop Trump. That would have totally taken the blue out, so whether it was Strzok, whether it was Page, whether it was somebody else, we need to know who did that. To me, that was a major obstruction of justice. PIRRO: Congressman, listen, I am so fed up with this because you guys have been doing this with all due respect. And I gave you credit in my open. You know, I think you guys do a great thing. My viewers are fed up. They want to know why is there a different system of justice for the ordinary Americans than for them. They can destroy evidence. They can tamper with evidence. They can conceal evidence. They can change the rules. They get away with it and ordinary men -- look at Manafort. Not that I give a darn about Manafort. But this guy is in jail right now and people have violated the law and they are getting a check from us. DESANTIS: Well, Judge, you are looking at the person who wrote the original criminal referral to Sessions where I had 15 members of Congress join me to refer all these people, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page. We've already referred them to the justice department. The OIG was not willing to do that. We did it in Congress. Sessions has not gotten back to us. So a lot of us are on the case, and I think this damning text message, the fact that it was not produced, to me that's obstruction whether it was Page, Strzok, somebody else in the bureau, we need to get that answer. We're happy to have Horowitz come testify. We are going to ask him about that. PIRRO: Yes, but that's just so -- Congressman, okay, you're going to ask him about it. let's just assume that we find out that they actually you know, were obstructing, there is no one in the Justice Department to prosecute. There is no special -- second special counsel, and I have got to go. So you and I can talk until we're blue in the face, if there is no one at the Justice Department doing anything, what difference does it make to quote a very famous woman. DESANTIS: Look, if the Justice Department has let us down on this, then we should have had a second special counsel long ago. PIRRO: All right, Congressman Ron DeSantis. Thanks so much for being with us. Next, more on the IG report as The Mooch comes to \"Justice.\" Anthony Scaramucci joins me live in a moment to talk about the report and more as \"Justice\" rolls on. PIRRO: Developing tonight, the fallout continues for what we know from the Instagram report, high-level anti-Trump bias in the FBI. Joining me, former White House Communications Director for a few days, Anthony Scaramucci, good evening. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: They call it The Mooch. It was so short, Jeanine, you can't call it a Scaramucci. PIRRO: It's The Mooch and that is Scaramucci. I got it. I got it. All right, Anthony, are you at all surprised by the IG Report which actually doesn't recommend any criminal charge or any further investigation. It just said, you know, there were a few errors in judgment when there are so many fundamental flaws that all went in the favor of Hillary Clinton. And I am not going to ask to you repeat the report. But where do we go from here? SCARAMUCCI: The problem is that I am sure the President is probably disappointed with this report because it's not 100% accurate. They've sanitized and glossed over things that actually happened and so you are getting the teeny top tip of the iceberg, Judge, and what is down deep below that is a real manifestation of corruption against the Trump campaign, the candidate Trump, and then eventually when he was president. And so I think that Director Comey, I just find the sanctimony of his book, now, I have read the book in preparation for some interviews, and I went back to it tonight to look through the levels of sanctimony. He knew this report was coming out. He knew his friends in the FBI would protect him and sanitize this report. And I have got to tell you something, the president once again correct. He talked about people eavesdropping on him. They talked about informants or spies whatever you want to talk about. He made the right judgment in firing James Comey, despite the fire fight that ensued thereafter. And so for me, I am disappointed in the report, but I am not surprised, Judge that these people protect each other. PIRRO: All right, you're not surprised. You're disappointed in the report. Everybody feels the same way. Where do we go from here? What do we have to do to change things so that people are accountable. SCARAMUCCI: Well, I mean, I think this what the president is absolutely best at. And so, I think once he steps back and he digests all the information, my guess is he is going to appoint people that he trusts that are on both sides of the aisle for that matter and they are going to come up with a protocol to protect these agencies from these sinister rogue type people and so, my guess is by the end of the year or certainly maybe after the election, the president will probably have a protocol or a suggested protocol to use on a going forward basis to protect Republicans and Democrats. And so what you know being a judge, that we are all subject subservient to the rule of law in our country, the president knows that better than anybody and so it is going to be incumbent upon him and I believe it will be one of his legacies, Judge, that he returns the luster and the glory to these organizations that they deserve. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: Well, he can't do it -- Anthony, he cannot do it with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein running the place and if the Dems win the House, you know as well as I do what they plan to do. And so, we can't wait until after the election. SCARAMUCCI: No, I understand all that. But I do think that even if -- and by the way, I predict that we are going to keep the House. But even if we don't keep the House and they move for the nonsense towards impeachment, the President's poll numbers will likely get stronger. I mean, the American people are on to the political intrigue and the political shenanigans and the politics of personal destruction that take place in Washington. I think they believe the President and take him at his word that there was absolutely no collusion inside the campaign. PIRRO: Well, yes, first of all there is no... SCARAMUCCI: All he was trying to do is... PIRRO: Go ahead, Anthony. SCARAMUCCI: No, I said, all he is really trying to do is improve the American economy, improve the quality of life for all Americans, and how about wages, Judge. For the first time in 12 years, there has been sustainable wages for middle and lower middle class families. So, the guy is doing a great job despite all of these head winds and obstacles. PIRRO: All right, well, let's just hope that the American people see it and his poll numbers are great, so everything in that regard is good. Anthony Scaramucci, thanks for being with us. ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I am Robert Gray. Heightened security at the world cup after a taxi plows into a crowd in Moscow. The vehicle jumped a sidewalk near Red Square injuring at least eight people, including two from Mexico.  The crash is believed to be an accident. Russian police detained the driver. Chaos in a Venezuelan nightclub. Seventeen people were killed when a tear glass canister caused a stampede for the exits. Hundreds of people were packed into Los Cotorros club for a graduation celebration when a brawl broke out. Witnesses say the tear gas was launched from inside a bathroom.  Eight people are in custody, including two teens believed to be responsible for setting off the tear gas. I am Robert Gray. Now back to \"Justice with Judge Jeanine.\" PIRRO: Welcome back to \"Justice.\" President Trump is heading to Capitol Hill this week to talk immigration with the GOP. Here to talk about that and more, political commentator Tomi Lahren and former aide to Chuck Schumer, radio show host, Chris Hahn. All right, guys, the issue of children being separated from their parents at the border is one that for some reason is getting tremendous traction. And anyone who is a parent has to feel a lot of emotion about it. And even as a judge when I was sentencing a parent to jail and the child would be in the courtroom, it's tough stuff. But Chris, aren't parents ultimately responsible for their own actions in this regard? CHRIS HAHN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes. But we have parents who are presenting themselves at the border for asylum. International law says we should treat them with dignity and respect. This is a policy that was initiated by the Trump administration. There is no legislative fix needed here. In fact, the US Attorney for the southern district of Texas, Patrick Ryan just said today this is a policy that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump initiated themselves. So, I think, we've got a pun -- there is a very big difference though between people criminally crossing the border and presenting themselves at the border for asylum. I think we have got to do something about this right now. The President can do it right now, just write a letter. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: So, Chris, are you suggesting that they are all asking for asylum, and Tomi, is there a difference between the President's policy and the law? TOMI LAHREN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS: The president has said he has zero tolerance for illegal immigration. Excuse me. This president has said he has a zero tolerance policy for illegal immigration, yes, as Americans we feel for anybody that is crossing the border because we know this is the greatest nation on the face of the earth. However, this is a nation of law. So, I say to those parents and to those children, if you do not want to be separated, do not cross the border illegally. Follow our laws, follow the process. That's the best way to ensure that your family stays together. PIRRO: Go ahead, Chris. HAHN: So as I just suggested to you, Tomi, so I just suggested, when you are presenting yourself at the border for asylum, you are not crossing the border illegally. You are following a procedure. It's at that point that this administration has decided to take those parents and separate them from the children. That not only violates international law, it violates Matthew 25, and anybody who believes in that should be ashamed of this policy. LAHREN: Chris, are you trying to tell me that every single person that is going to the border that they are separated from their families, they are all seeking asylum? None of those are illegal immigrants that are trying to come in to this country and then live and work in the shadows and take advantage of our American system. HAHN: People who are seeking asylum. PIRRO: Okay, Chris, the question is very simple... LAHREN: All of these people are seeking asylum? Really? PIRRO: Chris, you know as well as I and Tomi know, not all of them are seeking asylum. Come on, let's not kid each other. Now, for those who are come across illegally -- wait let me finish the question, for those who are coming across illegally, and not seeking asylum, some of whom have already been deported who are bringing children. The law is the same as it was when Barack Obama was President, and Bush was president. So the president has not changed anything. In fact, this President offered the Democrats the opportunity to keep the -- some of the DACA kids here, 1.8 million of them and the Dems wouldn't go with it. You are just trying to make the president look bad. HAHN: No, this is the president -- no, the president is treating people who are sneaking under a fence, the same as people who are coming through a door, Tomi, they are treating them the same and that is not right. LAHREN: I want to ask you a question, Chris. This is very important because I know you and many on your side of the aisle talk a lot about compassion, and I agreed with you when you show compassion as a Christian, I believe in that as well, but where is the compassion for American citizens? Where is the compassion for legal immigrants living in this country that expects the rule of law to be followed and expect border security and border enforcement? Where is the compassion for those individuals? Does that not exists because President Trump is going to make sure it exists and that is why we elected him? HAHN: Tomi, that that you do unto the least of them you do unto Christ. PIRRO: Oh, Chris. HAHN: And we know what is happening at the border right now. It is an abomination. It is an abomination. PIRRO: What is an abomination? Every time a judge sentences a parent to jail, is that an abomination? Is that an abomination? They make the choice. Were the 200 people not responsible for their own actions and their behavior? When do you bring children across the border illegally? HAHN: They are presenting themselves for asylum. They are not criminals. They are not doing anything illegal. PIRRO: Really? How many breaking the laws? How many years? HAHN: They are presenting themselves for asylum. PIRRO: Chris, are they breaking the law coming here? HAHN: No, they are not. PIRRO: Let Tomi talk now. LAHREN: Chris, you can shout as many Bible verses as you want. I believe in the Bible as well. I believe in what you are saying about compassion but the thing is this, you can't have a nation without a border. We need to make sure the borders are secure. I know you are going to keep telling me that all of these individuals that are crossing the border are seeking asylum. But we know that that is not true. We have got 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants living in this country and those individuals are not seeking asylum. We have a problem at the border. This president has a zero tolerance policy for it, so if the Democrats want to come to the table. That's fine. But here on out, this president has made it clear, don't come to this country and complain about the rule of law. HAHN: Tomi, let me ask you a question, since you've asked me a few. Is it right when people are seeking asylum for them to be separated from their kids? Should the president stop that from happening right now? LAHREN: I believe first and foremost, we need to make sure we have a secure bored and of course we need to deal with these individuals. HAHN: Answer the question. LAHREN: We need to make sure we have a streamlined process that also starts with a wall. That starts with border enforcement so we can figure out who is coming over here and why they are coming over here. Right now we don't know. We don't know who is coming over. (CROSSTALK) HAHN: What about the asylum seekers? Should they be given... PIRRO: You know guys what this reminds me of... HAHN: When they show up at an official process for an asylum, should they be treated differently, Tomi? PIRRO: Chris, you are like a broken record. We all know it's not all about asylum. Tomi Lahren, Chris Hahn... HAHN: Truth. It is the truth. PIRRO: Thanks so much for being with us. \"Street Justice\" still to come. Plus, what an honor for Alec Baldwin. He makes the list for one of the most of outrageous things I heard this week and Charlie Kirk is here to break it down. Next. The 2020 election will be here before we know it. Take a listen to who thinks he'd be a great president. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) ALEC BALDWIN, AMERICAN ACTOR: If I ran, I would win. HOWARD STERN, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY: You would? BALDWIN: I would absolutely win. By 1,000%. STERN: Where are you? (CROSSTALK) BALDWIN: If I ran for president, I would win, hands down I would win. STERN: Because you would be the funniest, most of exciting, most crazy campaign. BALDWIN: So there's many things this country needs to do that are so obvious. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: And that's just one of the most of outrageous things I heard this week. Here to break it all down with me, Turning Point USA, founder, executive director, Charlie Kirk. All right, Charlie, what's your take on that sound from Alec Baldwin. CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: Well, look, you've got to remember, you know, he has been \"comedian\" for a couple of years now during the Trump resistance. I don't find him too funny anymore. It's like, comedy has completely lost all their substance. But look, you have to remember, he couldn't even keep a job at MSNBC because he got fired for an anti-LGBT slur. PIRRO: That's right. KIRK: You think he can keep a job, as a late night host there, you're somehow supposed to win the Democrat primary and then the Presidential cycle? He has a horrible temper. He can't keep anything for more than a couple of months. And this kind of illustrates a broader point is that comedy is dead. The left has killed comedy in America. It's almost as if what they say when they are serious has become comedy and when they say, when they are trying to make a joke isn't very funny at all. Because I found him trying to say that he is going to win to be quite comedic, but I don't think he meant it as a joke. PIRRO: Okay, all right, let's get to Chelsea Handler's tweet. She is always good for outrageous. \"Hey, syphilis brain, it's nice you have such sympathy for high level criminals yet not for kids being ripped from their parents by the thousands now. This is your policy. The Trump policy, not the Democrats. Everything you say is a lie. Your skin color is even a lie. Your hair.\" That's Chelsea. What do you say to her? KIRK: That was so funny I forgot to laugh. So, look, here is what's so interesting about Chelsea Handler, she is another one of these \"comedians\" that has descended into this political hatred of this president, but let's talk about the immigration issue right here. They are selectively talking about these deportation centers where allegedly, these kids are being held immorally. Now, look, you have to remember, a lot of the images that were spread on the internet of these were during the Obama administration. Where was Chelsea Handler calling out President Obama back in 2014? Was she down there picketing and protesting? Hey, Nancy Pelosi, were you there visiting with the rest of your Democrat colleagues when all of these images were actually taken? Of course not. They are using selective outrage on a very particular issue that they want to try to drum up outrage and hatred in support of this president, you know why? Because he's succeeding across the board. He is the most successful president in our lifetime. He's bringing peace to the world. The economy is roaring. They have to pick some micro issue that by the way, President Obama ignored himself. PIRRO: Yes, indeed, all right, and finally, Senator Schumer. He took to the Senate floor and he said -- sound here, all right. (VIDEO CLIP STARTS) CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: By granting a meeting with chairman Kim, President Trump granted a brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it has long craved. To the United States, it's permanent proof that we have legitimized the brutal dictator who starved his own people. (VIDEO CLIP ENDS) PIRRO: Charlie, we have a very short time, what's your take on good old Senator Schumer? KIRK: I like him to say those same words when Obama met with the Castro brothers in Cuba. Really quick on this, President Trump is bringing peace to world and some of the Democrats have found something wrong with it. They would rather see conflict and war than Trump get credit for peace. PIRRO: Well, there is no question about it, Charlie Kirk, thanks so much for being with us tonight. KIRK: Thanks, Judge. You're the best. Thank you. PIRRO: And last week, it was a taxi cab. How did I get around for this week's \"Street Justice?\" You're going to enjoy this one. I jumped in a taxi cab last week. So, this week for \"Street Justice,\" I decided to hail a different type of transportation and the topic, a curious decision on the Miss America pageant. So, here I am in Manhattan trying to find out what New Yorkers think of their taking the swimsuit competition out of Miss America. Me and my pedicab driver, Kenny are hitting the streets. All right, so Kenny, let's hit it, Kenny. How do you feel about the fact they took the swimsuit competition out of Miss America? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's ridiculous. That's what it is all about. PIRRO: It is for you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely. PIRRO: You won't watch if they are not in their bathing suits? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't really watch it anyways, but I mean, it's a beauty contest, so it's part of the tradition of it. They want to change everything. PIRRO: So, it's not good. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't think they should just change anyway. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look at my body, do you think I care about that. I would never win those swimsuits. I think the girls do like it though. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: I feel like I am in Ben Hur. This is my chariot. You don't have spiked wheels, do you? They're lost, so... Let me ask you a question. They took the swimsuit competition out of Miss America. How do you feel about that? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's disgraceful. That was the whole point of watching it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they were beautiful and I think they should be seen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that's great. PIRRO: Why, you're going to watch it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll still watch it. It gives them more intellectual -- it gives these women -- it kind of shows these women that they have more brains than body. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What would males say? That's too bad that they took that out, but a female would say, that's awesome. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's too bad. PIRRO: Will you watch it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Probably not. PIRRO: Do you think the numbers will move down? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. I think the women will be more in tune. PIRRO: But what do you think they should they substitute for the swimsuit? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A dance contest. PIRRO: With the women or with men? What do you think of that? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I guess, it's sign of the times. PIRRO: What do you think of that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do I think of it. PIRRO: Your wife is looking at you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am disgusted. It's not right, is it. What do you think? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to be looking at the pretty ladies in swimsuits. PIRRO: Why do you think they did it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's political correctness gone mad. PIRRO: So, Kenny, I will ask you, what do you think of the fact they took out the swimsuit competition with Miss America. KENNY: I have to admit, when I did watch it, you know, I did kind of wait for the swimsuit competition to check it out. PIRRO: The truth ultimately comes out. Admit it, Kenny. KENNY; Yes, I do. I admit it. I love the swimsuit competition. Put it back in. PIRRO: We'll be right back. Get ready for the best book of the summer. My new book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" It comes out in July and you won't be able to put it down. You can get the truth and justice in this book and you can preorder it right now on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Finally, tonight I want to wish all the wonderful dads out there a very Happy Father's Day. Thank you for watching. I am Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way. \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up. We will see you next Saturday night.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on how President Trump is stoking the right with a sudden focus on hot-button issues. President Trump is spraying the landscape with a deluge of issues, as if from a firehose, and saturating the political debate in the process. Not all the issues will work in the GOP's favor, but one thing is certain: With two weeks until the midterms, Trump is driving the news agenda. And the Democrats, lacking a national spokesman \u2014 or at times a national strategy \u2014 are being forced into a defensive stance. The Democrats are still favored to take the House, though not with the huge blue wave that the party had once envisioned. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll gives Democrats a 9-point lead among likely voters \u2014 though not necessarily in the most competitive districts \u2014 while also giving Trump his highest approval rating, 47 percent, as president. The main challenge for Trump is to boost Republican turnout in an off-year election, and that's why we're seeing the sudden rollout of issues, especially of the hot-button variety. Chief among these is immigration, which is why the president is warning of a caravan of Honduran migrants that has made its way to Mexico and is headed toward the U.S. border. In fact, Trump tweeted yesterday, he will start cutting off, or substantially reducing, foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salavador because they're not stopping illegal immigration. More important in political terms, Trump is claiming, without offering evidence, that Democrats somehow instigated the caravan, and that \"Middle Easterners are mixed in\" with those from Central America. The idea is to cast these thousands of migrants as a scary mob that is threatening the United States. And if Democrats want to defend the potential illegal immigrants, Trump would welcome that debate. In the same vein, The Washington Post reported that the White House is considering a new policy that would detain migrant families but give them a choice: parents could remain with their children in an immigration jail for months or years while pursuing asylum, or voluntarily split up, with the child sent to a government shelter while a relative applies for custody. This would seem to give the opposition party an opening, given the uproar over family separations that caused the president to change his original policy. But there hasn't been a forceful response, and the leak enables Trump to say he's continuing to crack down on illegal immigration. Last year's Trump tax cut doesn't seem to be a big selling point on the trail, so \u2014 voila! \u2014 the president told a rally over the weekend that he wants another \"very major\" tax cut. Never mind that this is moot for the moment: Congress won't be in session through the election. Never mind that no details have been provided. And never mind that it would further explode the deficit, which jumped 17 percent last year, to $779 billion, and is heading toward a trillion bucks. Trump and Steve Mnuchin say this new tax cut would be aimed squarely at the middle class (didn't they say they about the last one, in addition to the corporate rate reductions?). And middle-class folks are the ones they want to vote. Surely it's just a coincidence, two weeks before Nov. 6, but The New York Times has just learned that the administration is considering a move aimed at transgender people. According to a memo, gender would be narrowly defined under the Title IX law as a biological condition determined at birth by genitalia \u2014 that people would be deemed male or female and this could not be changed. Again, the transgender community is not exactly Trump's base, but the proposal is designed to generate outrage on the left that can be used to the GOP's advantage. And by the way, Trump just happened to announce over the weekend that he is pulling the U.S. out of a nuclear arms control treaty with the Russians, who have been accused of violating the agreement struck by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. It's a way of showing that despite the Mueller probe he is getting tough with Moscow. The move has generated strong criticism \u2014 from some Republican lawmakers. The point isn't whether these are good or bad policies; indeed, some will never become law or could be quietly shelved after the election. But day after day, Trump is using his media megaphone to push politically potent themes on the right, and the Democrats haven\u2019t quite figured out how to counter him.",

            "article_content": "Nunes referring 17 current and former DOJ and FBI officials to heads of House Judiciary Committee. Republican congressman from California speaks out on 'The Ingraham Angle.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" July 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" A big show tonight to kick off this holiday week. House Intel chair Devin Nunes is redoubling his efforts to find out whether the Trump campaign really was under surveillance. He has something exclusively to share with us tonight. Plus the left just cannot stop comparing themselves to the bright ones. Of course the Conservatives are the Nazis, Ben Shapiro joins us for reaction to a vile new slur against him. Meanwhile anti-Trump forces are salivating over the prospect that Michael Cohen could flip. Of course flip on the President, but did he really imply that in an ABC interview today? But first, the Democratic melt down and the war on ICE, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. There were about 700 or so leftist marches over the weekend organized to protest President Trump's zero tolerance approach to border jumpers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: We have children being housed in cages crying for their mommies and daddies. We know we are better than this. DIANNE GUERRO, ACTRESS: Do we want to be an America that values children and families? TABOO, RAPPER: I would say the power of the people shall and will be stronger than the people in power. Did you hear that Donald Trump? Where's the love Donald Trump? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I don't even know who that is, who that last person is. What is that? They were fulminating, about family separations, of course, at the border despite the fact that President Trump ended that policy two weekends ago, do they not read. Of course, what all of you smart people already know, because you watch the Ingraham Angle, the left isn't really worried about the kids. Is that cynical? Well, maybe it is but if they really worried about kids, they would be at regular rallies in Chicago and Baltimore where still an unacceptably high number of children are left fatherless of even die themselves because of gang bangers and fighting turf wars. Now what's most upsetting to these protesters is that despite all their efforts, Trump's approval numbers keep edging up. So they're only recourse is to demonize Trump as a heartless baby jailor. Do you know something they say, kids in cages? Kids in cages, you hear that all the time. Well it's also an opportunity, of course, for Democrats to trot out new radical policy positions. Now, ever since that 28 year old socialist in New York, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez beat Democratic incumbent, of course Joe Cowely, Democrat from leadership number four in the party, the party's old guard has been reeling. Now they're straining for relevance and tripping all over themselves to align with that millennial socialist. They want to now abolish Immigration Customs and Enforcement because that was a big part of her platform, look at how well she did. So again, rather than challenging her flawed thinking, this the Homeland Security's major enforcement arm, let's not forget, Democrats have decided to just dash leftward and endorse her idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We believe that we should protect families that need or help and that is not what I.C.E is doing today. And that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works. SEN. DICK DURBI, D-ILL.: Look at I.C.E, what a group of incompetents. At this point they are focused more on toddlers that terrorists. And instead of focusing on bad rats from coming in and stopping dirty drug money from going out, they're focusing on separating kids from their families. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Hey Dick, the policy doesn't exist any longer. And anyway, I.C.E does not separate kids at the border. Like many of the protesters surrounding Durbin, it seems like they're all confuse I.C.E with customs and border protection. It's border patrol that arrests illegals at the border and runs them through processing. I.C.E is the law enforcement agency that was set, remember, after 9/11 to protect us from international security threats, particularly those posed by the people in the country illegally. So how ironic is it that four New York politicians, Senator Gillibrand, Mayor De Blasio, gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon and Congressional candidate Ocasio Cortez are now leading the abolish I.C.E movement charge, nifty. Well the problem for all of them is that the people just aren't buying this. The latest Harvard Harris Poll shows that 88 percent believe that families who cross the border illegally should not be separated, 76 percent want secure borders. Then 53 percent believe we should prosecute those entering the border illegally, while 64 percent believe that you should send the border crossers back home. But no matter where they stand on the nuances of immigration policy, a whopping 70 percent want stricter enforcement of existing immigration laws. So how are you going to do that exactly if you abolish the agency that's charged with investigation human trafficking, drug smuggling, weapon smuggling? I.C.E is the agency that also tracks down criminal illegal immigrants and then they remove them from the country. Democrats claim that they're for that. So if criminals make it over the border, are we just to let them wrought across the country? Good luck on turning that into a platform that actually wins votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You get rid of I.C.E, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house. I love that if issue if they're going to actually do that, they're seriously talking about that because you are going to have a country that's crime ridden. The border patrol agents, I.C.E, these people are incredible. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well the President understands the political calculus here and his zero tolerance policy, remember, brought border arrests in June down to their lowest level since February, according to the AP, that's was the story. But if Democrats think melting down a national law enforcement agency with 20,000 employees that's working to keep Americans safe and communities across the US as a solution? I think they have another thing coming. It not only sounds like an idea that you'd hear at some undergrad student center, over some like Ben and Jerry's, it's also dangerous. The Democrats push to abolish I.C.E and it's as off key as the entertainment of some of their rallies over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIN MANUEL MIRANDA, COMPOSER AND ACTOR: I'm just going to sing a lullaby that I wrote and this if for those parents. And we're not going to stop until they can sing them to their kids again. JOHN LEGEND, SINGER: We treat asylum seekers with compassion. We don't seek to punish them for trying to do what's right for their families. MIRANDA: Oh as if you outshine the morning sun, my son. When you smile, I fall apart. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Side note, wasn't he nominated but he lost the Tony for best musical performance, best actor but he was nominated though, come one. Hamilton was fantastic, his writing, his composing. As Trump scores a win after the one on the economy, international relations and trade and now the second Supreme Court pick, the spirited Democrats are looking for hope somewhere so what did they do this weekend, other than listening to some off key performances? They turned to the one, the community organizer in chief himself, Barack Obama appeared with all the little people at a Beverly Hills fundraiser this weekend making his first appearance in months. He declared the gathering a mope fee zone and while the word is that he's been devoting himself to fundraising in his library and writing his memoirs, Obama is now on a DNC fundraising swing commanding more than $100,000 a plate. And without mentioning Trump, he told the swanky crowd, \u2018This is a moment of great urgency and you're right to be concerned,\". Then with a self-referential air he mused, \"We shouldn't expect politics to be entertaining all the time, and Christina Aguilera was wonderful but you don't need to have and amazing singer at every event. Sometimes you're just in a church basement making phone calls and eating cold pizza\". That's easy for him to say, he spent a lot of the last year between like Tahiti and Richard Branson's private island in the Caribbean. Cold pizza though for the other people. Well, in many ways the explosion of protests that tilts to the left, the ineffective Democratic leadership, all of this is the fulfillment of what Obama first ushered in his party. The Obama era and the party it left behind always prized style over experience and results. And now a new generation of inexperience charismatic leftists are moving to the fore of the party. They're giving speeches they're leading marches and they're resisting Trump. But original thinking and a governing strategy continues to elude them. With every tack to the left, they merely estrange themselves from the vast middle and working class of this country, catering only to the progressive elites in Manhattan and Malibu. Should this continue come November, well voters, even the Democratic ones, may be pulling the lever to abolish the Democrats, and that's the Angle. Joining us now with reaction is Democratic Congressman from Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi, former Pennsylvania Congressman and Democrat Jason Altmire and Democratic Strategist, LeDawn Jones. Let's first go to the Congressman, I feel like the Democrats are in a way where Republicans were kind of 2009 before the Tea Party really got going and their looking for traction somewhere. Now it's abolish I.C.E where, of course, I.C.E was working to deport people in large numbers when Obama was President but I didn't hear any of these fancy pants politicians talk about abolishing I.C.E back then so how does it actually get traction now, Congressman? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI, D-ILL.: Well thank you for having me on Laura. I think that the way we get traction is basically connecting to the real economic problems of working families and presenting our agenda for making sure everyone gets on the up escalator of the economy. If you're working poor, how do we get you into the middle class? If you're in the middle class, how do we allow you to succeed? And if you want to start and grow a small business, how do we allow you to do that as well? I think that's how you take the majority. INGRAHAM: But isn't that what President Trump is doing right now? I mean he's bringing people back into the work force who hadn't been working, who basically gave up hope. Now they're returning to the workforce in very large numbers, some people say we have a dearth of employees, we need more in the country. But wages are starting to go up. African American unemployment very low, all-time low. Latino unemployment also at almost a record low so I get what you're describing and I think it's great. The problem is Trump is already doing it. KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well let me just point to a couple of things that people talk to me about every single day, just take for example healthcare. They're seeing their healthcare expenses go up under the Trump Presidency. The markets are becoming more and more unstable despite bi-partisan efforts to try to stabilize it. It appears that the Trump administration is not interested in necessarily doing that. A second issue that-- INGRAHAM: Okay so Obamacare will be your argument then? Mrs. Jones I want to go with you on that because, of course, what the Republicans worried about is that with Obamacare, contrary to what was argued, premiums would start to go up. It didn't happen immediately but when you mandate that people go into a pool of insured who obviously they are high risk because they have pre-exiting conditions, that cost is going to have to be spread around. Insurance is going to have more bills to pay, and rates start going up up up up up. That's exactly what's happened so it's no surprise that a lot of these exchanges couldn't keep up. How are you guys going to get the traction you need with this economy as hot as it is? LADAWN JONES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well the traction is already there and we're already seeing by the messages being spread, you know, I don't want to get back into the Obamacare debate and whether it's god because we've already seen Trump work very hard to dismantle Obamacare and the Healthcare that many Americans said that they need. But the way that we get the traction is with the recent elections. Democrats learned in the 2016 election that there is a voice trying to heard and rather than trying to move to the center to gather the votes of people who clearly were on a difference plane, those are the Trump voters and because you can't attract those voters so we have to stick to our principles. And our principles are making America a place for everyone to live. A place that has humanity and care and that includes healthcare, that includes sound immigration policy that is fair and right and just and humane. And that goes across the board and I think Democrats have learned-- INGRAHAM: But the polls aren't showing that Mrs. Jones and I hear what you're saying and I think that you're doing the best you can under the circumstances. But the polls aren't bearing that out. Most people believe that of you come into the country illegally, it's sad when your family gets separated, no body want to see that but it's your responsibility. You made a decision to cross the border, you didn't go into a normal port of entry and now you're complaining that America doesn't have a heart which is what one woman did today who was reunited with her daughter. It's nice that she was reunited but she made that decision. I understand the hard argument, I get the compassion argument but Americans have been struggling for like three decades and haven't seen a raise. There's only so much of the love you can spread around when your own family, an American citizens or an American veteran on the street is having trouble. JONES: That's amazing though. So many Americans, at least those in your circle, complain that the reason why immigration is a problem is not just safety because they're taking American jobs. INGRAHAM: They have taken American jobs. They actually interviewed people who had their jobs taken. JONES: Things have change, we have avocados that are dying on the vine. There are farmers who are struggling to find people to the work. So it's not that they were taking jobs, they were doing jobs you didn't want. INGRAHAM: That's fine 5 percent of the work force. And the argument that Americans are lazy is a loser Jason we got to get to you. This is what Chuck Todd said today, he's no great fan of the President, about where the Democrats are at this moment. Let's watch (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK TODD, MNC HOST: The announced retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy this week helped make one political reality clear. Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning and the Democrats right now are reeling. But the Democrats reaction this week to the Kennedy retirement proved anything, it's that the Democratic Party has not figured out how to succeed in the Trump era. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Jason, you reaction. JASON ALTMIRE, FORMER PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN: I saw that Chuck said that and I think he's right. I think he accurately diagnosed the problem. The Democrats if you go back say six months had controlled all the cards going into the midterm. You have the historical loss of seats by the incumbent party, you have some missteps that were made by the administration. The Democrats that successfully prevented the repeal of Obamacare where winning on the generic ballot had an issue that was very politically beneficial to them as well as, I feel, being on the morally just side in preventing the forcing the change in policy of the separations at the border. And then to move further to the left because of one election that occurred in one Congressional district now, to encourage uncivil disobedience. To confront the administration, members of the media, in a way that is outside the bounds of normal political discourse in this country. The Democrats are in great danger of blowing the advantage that they worked so hard to create. INGRAHAM: Now Congressman I want to go to you on this because there's now this effort that's kind of gone viral. A young African American male who, I've never heard of before, goes on, I think he tweeted this originally that's when I saw it. You'll watch, let's see. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON STRAKA: As from a year ago I was still a Liberal. I reject a system which allows an ambitious, misinformed and dogmatic mob to suppress free speech, create false narratives and apathetically steam roll over the truth. I reject hate. These are the reasons why I became a Liberal and these are the same reasons why I am now walking away. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Yeah that's another one. The guy who originally started it was African American. Okay so interesting, is that just kind of a kitschy thing that doesn't really connect with you. Or could that be the Democrats version of nightmare where people say, \"Okay, I'm a Democrat but I'm not for like harassing people in a restaurant. I'm not for abolishing a wing of an agency of 20,000 employees that fights human smugglers and drug cartels, like I'm going to walk away from that\". Are you worried about that? KRISHNAMOORTHI: Look, I'm concerned when we can't necessarily disagree without being disagreeable. We have to learn to talk to each other. We have to learn to talk to people who disagree with us if we are going to persuade them and come to our side. That's what I have to do in my district which is a suburban district of Chicago in the Heartland. I think that that being said I'm going to stay true to my principles. I believe, for instance, in making sure that the right to healthcare is still preserved for Americans, that people can educate their children and that they can afford childcare and at the same time see their wages go up. I believe that we can stay true to those principles, talk to people on the other side and also as someone mentioned earlier, also advocate for a humane treatment of immigrants and others true to our American tradition. INGRAHAM: Mrs. Jones, Trump actually has done away with the family separation policy yet these rallies, they keep acting like it's still in existence, it's not, he did away with it. KRISHNAMOORTHI: Laura can I address that for one moment please? INGRAHAM: Okay real quick, we got to get back to Mrs. Jones. KRISHNAMOORTHI: Yeah I think the one thing that people are still very upset about is there's still about 2,000 children who are separated from their parents, we don't know how they're going to be reunited with them. The second thing is-- INGRAHAM: The administration announced the date for that happening. But look guys, again, the Democrats whole platform, as far as I can tell, to reach voters is resist Trump and family separation policy that doesn't exist, it's getting fixed and abolish I.C.E. That's like the main deal that's getting all the media coverage and again, Mrs. Jones I want to go back to you. You have to win Pennsylvania, you have to win Ohio, you have to win Wisconsin, you have to win Florida. It might work in the Bronx or work in Brooklyn, or work in Malibu or Brentwood or even Madison, Wisconsin, but the vast majority of Americans in those heartland states, that's not what they're worried about. They want bread and butter issues, your reaction. JONES: That's true and so those folks in the heartland of American should know that in Trump's firts three months of being President, he cut so many programs and federal programs and urban programs that included urban and rural business opportunities, water opportunities. So if we're worried about cutting federal programs then let's talk about it. They should get cut-- INGRAHAM: I don't they're worried about federal programs. They're worried about the jobs but they already have them now. We're out of time guys. Fantastic segment, thank you so much. We'll have you back, we'll have you on radio and then you can come on tomorrow. By the way surveillance abuses against the Trump administration coming up. House Intel Chair Devin Nunes is tightening the screws in his investigation into alleged surveillance abuses of the Trump campaign. The Congressman in now referring the names of 17 current and former justice department and FBI officials to the heads of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees for interviews. Just hours ago he added ten more names to the list, this time former Obama state department employees. Joining us now with more exclusively is Congressman Devin Nunes. Congressman, it's great to see you. Now, I know people across the country are getting ready for the fourth of July but Devin Nunes wants more information. I'm playing devil's advocate here, when will it end? You're always complaining about documents, now you're complaining about people but there are a lot of people on this list that are new names to people like Victoria Newland. Tell us why you want her to testify. REP. DEVIN NUNES, D-CALIF.: Well first of all I want to make sure the American people know that this is just one more step in the process. I think we've been very transparent about how we've conduct this process. We went on to Pfizer abuse and other matters and I've said for a long time that we are looking at the state department. When we began looking state department, you had Victoria Newland and other people who decided to go out and talk about things publicly which actually helped our investigation out quite a bit. The reason why is we still don't understand how this investigation was actually opened but we know that many people in the Obama era state department were involved in the opening of that investigation. So it all comes down to how did the information make it from supposedly from an Australian High Commissioner Ambassador to the FBI? So we know that that didn't come through what I would call Pfizer's Intelligence, it wasn't real intelligence product. It somehow short circuited that process. We also know that many people in the state department were also meeting with Christopher Steele. Christopher Steele is the person who was hired by the Democrats to dig up dirt on President Trump. So this is why this investigation has taken a while, but the good thing is that I believe that Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte, I believe that their task force will interview these people and they will interview them in public so it will be the first time during this entire investigation that the American people get to see actual questions get answered to these potential witnesses. INGRAHAM: Again, now why would the state department be involved with the Christopher Steele Dossier issue? Again, phony Dossier, Christopher Steele, MI6, worked as an agent, supposedly has all these Russian sources. And why would this woman Elizabeth Dibble be on your list. She was the deputy chief of the Mission in London for the state department? That seems like someone you might be looking at for one of the people put into the Trump campaign, allegedly, as an informant, correct? NUNES: Well I wouldn't go there but the two parallel tracks here, you kind of touched on both of them. So one we have the London episode, somehow information made it from the Australian government to the FBI. We believe that went through London and somehow went to the Obama state department but then ended up in the justice department. So that's one track, the second track is Christopher Steele. What on earth was Christopher Steele doing meeting with state department officials? Why was the Steele Dossier that supposedly the FBI was trying to get their hands on, why was that also going through the state department? So a lot of people had their hands on the Steele Dossier including many people in the media who knew about the Steele Dossier. And this is really a collapse. What we're having anything to do here as the legislative branch of government, we're having to do the work that the media won't do because there are very few in the media that actually cover this story to try to get to the bottom of it and that's part of what's taking so long. Typically you would have a free and fair and transparent media trying to get to the truth but in this case we haven't had that. INGRAHAM: So Jonathan, is it Weiner, was on your list. Who was he and, I guess several months ago, he said he's being unfairly targeted by you? NUNES: Yeah that was quite interesting that he thought that we were targeting him because, at the time, we weren't sure exactly what he knew or didn't know but thankfully he was very clear in the statements that he made that he was one of the people that was looking at the Steele information and was conveying that information in some form or fashion to the FBI. So look, we want to interview these folks. These folks work for the American tax payer, they were paid by the American tax payer. INGRAHAM: But how do you compel that Congressman? How do you compel that? I'm sorry, you can subpoena them? NUNES: Oh they're going to testify. Well they can plead the Fifth but this isn't like the documents where we've had to continue to fight with the justice department in order to have access to documents. This is much different, these are all American citizens. If they do not agree to appear under oath and testify, then they will be subpoenaed, that I can tell you for sure. INGRAHAM: I want to get your reaction to something Congressman Schiff, ranking Democrat on your committee said about you and your colleagues last week on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: The four horsemen of this apocalypse have been Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy, Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan. They have been leading the charge, basically to require the justice department to give them materials that can be leaked of fed or misrepresented like the infamous Nunes Memorandum in the service of the President. And in the meantime they do enormous damage to these institutions. Ultimately they'll be held accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Sounds like a threat Congressman. NUNES: Yeah, we are not going to be threatened by the Democrats. They are the ones that have all this blood on their hands. They are the ones who have completely destroyed the FBI and DOJ. How did they do that? They did that by digging up dirt, the Clinton campaign dug up dirt, put it into a dossier, fed into the FBI, and the FBI used our counterintelligence capabilities against a political campaign. That's what happened here. So the Democrats in the House and Senate, they continue to want to obfuscate. They continue to want to cover up. If we'd listened to the Democrats, we would have never even found out that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paid Christopher Steele to generate this dirt on President Trump. So I tend to ignore everything that they say. We continue to do our work day in and day out to get you the truth, and gradually we are gritty to the truth. And I believe as these hearings take place and testimony is are given to Congress, it will be much needed sunlight in this investigation. I think the American people will begin to see who is telling the truth and who's not telling the truth. INGRAHAM: Congressman, I think we all want an open session. A lot of us are getting tired of this closed session deal where the America people are kept in the dark, and then people come out, and somehow mysteriously we hear little bits and pieces about what happened, or the flavor of what happened behind closed doors. With someone like a Victoria Nuland, other Obama State Department people, and maybe even Joseph Pientka who interviewed Michael Flynn, he could -- sources tell me he could be a potential whistleblower to tell what he actually understood in that interview, namely, reportedly that Michael Flynn did not lie. NUNES: I agree with you 100 percent. I agree with you 100 percent, and that is partly why I am sending these names over to Judiciary and Oversight Committee because they already have a task force that has been convened. They should be able to do all of these hearings in the public, full transparency, so that people can watch on live television. That is my recommendation to the committee chairman. I believe they will follow that recommendation. And they may have other names. So far we sent them the 17 plus the 10, it's 27 names we have sent them. We will be sending a more names here later this week this week. INGRAHAM: All right, congressman, thank you so much for joining us tonight. We really appreciate it. And former Trump attorney Michael Cohen breaks his silence, but why? What is going on there? And could the left to be missing his true message? Dan Bongino and Chris Hahn debate next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: The big questions I asked him is, what will you do if prosecutors come to you and offer you leniency in return for information on President Trump? He said he wanted to respect the process, didn't get into specifics. But he added that is, and he added this with emphasis, \"My wife, my daughter, and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.\" Nothing there about loyalty to President Trump. In fact, he didn't praise President Trump at all during that 45-minute interview. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That from ABC's George Stephanopoulos recounting a 45-minute conversation he had with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. Predictably the suggestion that he would not pledge loyalty to the president meant only one thing to the never Trump crowd. He's going to flip. Is that really the case? Let's bring in Dan Bongino, NRA TV host, and Chris Hahn, former aide to senator Chuck Schumer. Dan, we've been hearing that Michael Cohen is going to flip. I think you and I were talking about this last week. He's going to flip, he's going to flip, he's going to flip. So Stephanopoulos sits down, he got the very dramatic photo sitting across from each other with a guy whose basic potential jail time. I don't blame him to be worried about his family. But it has to always be through the prism of, OK, we have more bad news for Donald Trump. What is this? DAN BONGINO, NRA TV HOST: Yes, this is the umpteenth thousandth time, we've got him now, here we go. We heard this about Flynn. Flynn was going to flip. Then we got the fake news story. We actually had a journalist leave at network today supposedly because of reporting that story in advance. I'm really getting tired of it. You're right, you do have to view this through the prism of the media that just can't stand Donald Trump. We don't know what is going on in Cohen's head. Is he trying to cozy up to the media to get the media on his side to a public pressure campaign. But Laura, the one takeaway from this I think the audience needs to understand is this is clearly now an investigation into a person, not a crime. The investigation is into Donald Trump. They will do anything to get him. This has nothing to do with collusion, we know it because it was referred to the southern district from the special counsel. So they are looking for Trump. They're not looking for a crime. INGRAHAM: Chris, this is what Michael Avenatti said about what Cohen really wants here. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL AVENATTI: This is Michael Cohen trying to send a message to the president that he wants the president to pay his legal bills or he's going to flip. He's playing games of the American people. If he has information that is damaging to this president, and I know for a fact that he does, then he should come forward and state it and disclose it now. What he's doing is playing games by giving these off-camera interviews, like you saw today. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Chris, your reaction there? CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: I don't know. I don't know what Michael Avenatti was trying to say there. Here is what my takeaway is. Two weeks ago when we were talking about him potentially flipping we were reacting to an ABC News story which had a single byline, George Stephanopoulos. Today, he gave an interview to George Stephanopoulos. So I don't know if those two things are connected, but they might be. So we don't know if they are going to do and what he might have. As for the attorneys leaving, which was a big conversation and him taking on a new attorney, that has been a sign that people are about to make a deal and maybe he is about to make a deal. What he is going to make that deal on, I don't know. But there is nobody in America that knows Donald Trump better than Michael Cohen, at least as far as a lawyer goes. And we know he was the president's fixer. But we already know those things. So we want to know exactly what else the guy has. As far Flynn, Flynn did flip. And next week, he will be in court, and we all know exactly -- INGRAHAM: Yes, but Chris, you heard what he said, Avenatti. First of all, he said, I know for a fact. He knows for a fact -- he is representing a porn star. He knows for a fact. He knows for a fact it's going to be damaging to the president. Going back to Dan's point, this is about Trump. If Mueller sends it down to the southern extract, or Rosenstein sends it down to the southern district after Mueller sends it to Rosenstein, and gets down there, and now you can do things, you can look for information in a new venue with someone, you're right, who is closer to the president. HAHN: I hear that argument a lot. This is about Trump. Well, if Trump did nothing wrong, then why is everybody so worried about it? Michael Cohen was his fixer. What was he fixing? INGRAHAM: You know something, that fixer phrase -- and Dan, you can chime in here. I am so tired of hearing fixer. It's like fixer, fixer, fixer. What do you pay a lawyer for? Whether it's a parking ticket, you want a parking ticket and say I can't wait in line, or a speeding ticket, yes, I need you to handle it. A fixer, meaning fix the situation, I am going to pay you a lot of money per hour for you to fix my problem. So when they say it's a fixer, that is just more spin, more lingo. Of course every lawyer is a fixer or they're not worth it. Go ahead, Dan. HAHN: The court found he didn't work as a lawyer. BONGINO: Seriously, Chris, I thought better of you. I mean this. Is this seriously going to be the new liberal take? Please, don't embarrass yourself in the media by continuing to say if you didn't do something wrong, you have nothing to worry about. Are you serious? I'm going to sit a cop in front of you house -- HAHN: Yes Let me stop you. BONGINO: Listen to me, hear me out here. You had your chance. You had your chance. HAHN: I'm sure you defended stop and frisk with the same thing. BONGINO: People like you say that. No, no, don't distract. People like you say that because you've never been a police officer or a federal agent like I have, and you don't understand the awesome power to ruin somebody's life. HAHN: Hey, man. I am an attorney. I worked for a criminal court. I do. BONGINO: You have never done it. You have never once put handcuffs on people. Not one time. INGRAHAM: That's not how it supposed to work. (CROSSTALK) HAHN: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm an attorney. I work at criminal court. I know the awesome power. BONGINO: Chris, you're talking like a -- end of story, and you know it. You don't know squat. You've never done that. INGRAHAM: OK, guys, I don't want to get -- BONGINO: The president is not a kid on the street with no lawyer. This is a very wealthy man who has all the -- (CROSSTALK) INGRAHAM: Stop, stop, stop. You guys stop, stop for a second. Americans across the country are like -- stop. Stop for a second. You are both very passionate about this. But I think the point is, and civil libertarians on the left used to really care about this. There is only, like, three that I can think of right now, and two are people I know closely, whether it's Dershowitz and a few others, used to care about the power, unbridled power of prosecutors. I was a criminal defense attorney. I know Chris you're an attorney, dealt with criminal matters. It is a serious, awesome power. HAHN: It is. It is. INGRAHAM: The problem here in this situation is it started as Russia collusion and now we are at Michael Cohen is a fixer, and we are going to take all his computers and his phones and turn the screws on him so he's worried he's not going to see his children and his wife for 20 years. That is where we ended up. And I don't think that is where the country ever understood that the special prosecutor to end up through all these side channels, to end up with this southern district. I don't think that is what people expected. And that is not what the special prosecutor statute really was supposed to be all about. But you can close it out. HAHN: Michael Cohen did not want to comment on the Russia collusion thing. He did say that he respected the investigation that Mueller was doing, and he wouldn't comment on that Russia meeting at the Trump Tower. So look, we don't know what is going to happen. I hope nothing bad happened. I don't want to think that our president committed any crimes. But let's get to the bottom of it and end it. INGRAHAM: OK, so we went from Russia collusion, the election tampering, to a stripper-porn star who is cashing in on her 15 minutes of fame, and Michael Cohen and some check that somebody wrote -- again, starting off, it sounded really nefarious with Russian collusion, and now we are here. And a lot of money has been spent and a lot of time has been spent. And I think Mueller's approval numbers are going down for a reason. All right, guys -- BONGINO: They are investigating Trump. INGRAHAM: They are investigating one man. And roadkill, the carnage on the side of the street are people like Cohen, which is a sad thing. HAHN: They are following the evidence where it leads. INGRAHAM: All right, happy Independence Day to both of you. It's a new low, by the way, for the left. It's a horrific holocaust insult getting lobbed at Ben Shapiro. Ben joins us to respond next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: The unhinged left sinks even lawyer. Joshua Topolsky, cofounder of the tech website \"The Verge\" has sparked an uproar after a vile attack against conservative commentator and writer Ben Shapiro, tweeting, quote \"Ben Shapiro is the Jew who helps other Jews onto the train.\" Topolsky has now deleted the tweet, but not because it's disgusting to compare Shapiro, who is Jewish, to a Nazi collaborator, for other reasons. And in a follow up he tweeted, quote, \"I deleted it because a mob of the rightwing babies who were flooding my mentions, and it was frankly pretty annoying, as were the DM death threats.\" Joining us now to respond is \"The Daily Wire's\" Ben Shapiro. Ben, we are always talking to -- when the left is unhinged. And you have a special way of unhinging them. But this was really -- I keep saying a new low, but this really is a new low. I've never heard of this person before, but I guess he is kind of big and the tech world. Where are we here? BEN SHAPIRO, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: I've been called worse by better. So that's the way things go I guess these days. I guess that he works for, said that he works over at Vox, and then it turns that he was not in fact a cofounder of FOX, if he was from VOX, and VOX is not sending its best. That is all I can really say about it. INGRAHAM: But we have an individual who works for this tech website, saying that someone who is unobservant Jew is helping put other Jews on the train, meaning, I guess, the Trump train, can't ever look past that. But he's obviously -- I think he is Jewish, as well. But coming from him, who I believe is Jewish, does that have any special significance to you? Is it kind of a self-loathing deal? What is it? SHAPIRO: Not particularly. I think he is calling me a Nazi. But he wouldn't be the only one. The way that the left works these days, anyone who disagrees with them is a Nazi. So it really isn't a giant surprise. And I always find it ironic when the left attacks me as an alt-right Nazi considering I was literally the number one recipient of alt-right hatred in 2016 according to the Anti-defamation League, which is not a rightwing source. INGRAHAM: Right. And Ben, there are others on the left who have gone from their never Trump mania to just completely out of touch with reality of politics today. One of them is, I guess, a blogger for The Washington Post who is on television quite a bit. Her name and name is Jennifer Rubin. Lets' watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER RUBIN, WASHINGTON POST: Sarah Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss, no muss after lying to the press, after inciting against the press. These people should be made uncomfortable, and I think that is a life sentence, frankly. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: You should be made uncomfortable for life. It should be a life sentence. You notice that the words that the left and the never Trump, I don't know, Republican, or Bush, I don't know idea how you describe Jennifer Rubin because there's literally no constituency other than like Bill Kristol for what she says. But they now use this criminal imagery. Trump is jailing babies. They are criminalizing parenthood with the separation of families. The concentration camps, the detention centers are concentration camps. It's all -- it's beyond descriptive. It is descriptive in this criminal, over-the-top, purposely outrageous manner. What of that now, coming from, I guess, a former Republican? SHAPIRO: She is obviously engaged in the endorsement of thug tactics, and this is the desperation to which the left and some people formerly of the right have driven. Jen Rubin is a person who not only endorsed Mitt Romney and pushed very hard for Mitt Romney. Just a few years ago she was suggesting that Roe v. Wade needed to be overturned. Now she says that any judge who is appointed to the Supreme Court by President Trump cannot want to overturn Roe v. Wade. There's a certain derangement obviously that's set in with a lot of people where they have reversed principles that they supposedly once specifically because they don't like Donald Trump, which I find not only troubling but morally vacuous. And when you look at Jen Rubin saying stuff like Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be made uncomfortable for life and she doesn't have a right to be comfortable in the United States. She does have a right to basically not be mobbed when she goes out to a gas station or when she goes out to eat dinner. The same people who are saying bake the cake to religious bakers are saying that it's a wonderful thing when a restaurant owner decides to deny service to someone based on political affinity. Now, what people are the left have even gone further than that. They are talking about not just about restaurant owners saying they don't want Trump employees in their establishment. They are talking about how it is now Ok for mobs to descend on other people's establishments and drive people out of those establishments. That is what happened to Kirstjen Nielsen. So the level of insanity to which the left devolves every day is a testament to how much President Trump us in their heads and a testament to how their utopian idealism under President Obama has absolutely collapsed. INGRAHAM: And the farther left they go, the higher his numbers seem to go. So they don't see the correlation. But perhaps saner minds will prevail ultimately. Ben, have a happy Independence Day. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. And just ahead, a wild story out of Colorado to bring you. Tens of thousands of acres burning and a case of arson. The shocking revelation of who was behind it, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now this is truly insane story of Colorado. An illegal immigrant has been arrested for arson after authorities reveal that he was behind starting a forest fire that has now destroyed about 53,000 precious acres of land. Jesper Jorgensen, whose nationality is Danish, according to The Denver Post, was nabbed by Costilla County Police Department and will be handed over to ICE. Don't you want to abolish ICE? And of course that agency insisted on tracking him down, as well. Yet, they are largely responsible for bringing this matter dresses going down to what we said in \"The Angle.\" To discuss, we are joined by Colorado State Senator Larry Crowder who represents Costilla County. Is it Costilla, I'm doing the Spanish version, or is it Costilla. STATE SEN. LARRY CROWDER, R-COLO.: No, it's Castilla. INGRAHAM: OK, great, fantastic. It's great to see you. And a very difficult situation for you in Colorado. CROWDER: It is. Right now we have made a confirmed house loss of 104. They are just letting people go into their properties to evaluate, and it is just a small percentage of the acreage. We don't know exactly what the total loss of will be at this point in time, but it has been concerned that 104 houses have been totally burnt. I've seen pictures of -- INGRAHAM: The heartbreak. I don't mean to interrupt you but we have limited time. CROWDER: I understand. INGRAHAM: The house, it's terrific. It's horrific. The loss of property, of wildlife, of habitat. But we found out that the illegal immigrant, senator, an illegal immigrant has been charged with this. This, after we have had a weekend of protests to abolish ICE, which is largely responsible for nabbing him and getting him into custody. Your reaction to that aspect of this horrific story? CROWDER: It is just kind of sickening. Right now we've had what they call a stage two under FEMA, no outside fires. So whether or not it was intentional or whether it was an accident, it still is a situation where there should not have been outside fires exposed. So it is terrific. And currently, we are reported at five percent contained and the biggest thing with that, our winds have died down considerably today. I think that -- INGRAHAM: Here's the problem. He shouldn't have been in the country. I know you are trying to dance around that, whether it was arson -- CROWDER: No, I'm not dancing around it. INGRAHAM: But he should not have been in the country, senator. Not have been here. CROWDER: That's right. That is correct. But if you look at his Facebook page, the anarchy that he has professed over a period of time, shows you basically -- yes, I would like to see this individual deported right away. INGRAHAM: Well, there are a lot of people believe that ICE should be abolished. In the Democratic Party, major figures who are going to run for president, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, the list goes on and on, watch ICE abolished. They found this guy, nabbed him at least, and want to get him in custody and out of the country we hope. CROWDER: The federal government is responsible for our borders, so ICE should not be abolished. ICE is a legal procedure that we go through. So I thought it was comical that people wanted to do away with ICE. It's about protecting this country. That's what it's about. INGRAHAM: And 37 percent of your estate is now immigrant population, a very large illegal immigrant population in your state, and people think it's all great to have all these illegal immigrants. Well, sometimes we see what happens. Thank you very much. Our prayers are with you and all of the citizens of Colorado. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: We were debating whether I should tweet out a photo of what I was doing about six and a half hours ago. I think we have decided, just for fun, we're going to tweet it out. You have to go to Twitter. I haven't posted it. I will post it in about 30 seconds. It's a little foggy. Be sure to tune into radio tomorrow morning and great show tomorrow night. One of my favorite people to talk to anywhere is joining us. The one and only Suzanne Somers is going to stop by. Until then tell us how we're doing @IngrahamAngle. I always love to read your tweets. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Raw video: Defense Secretary Mattis responds to reporter questioning if the deployment of troops to the southern border is a political stunt. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphatically denied a reporter's suggestion Wednesday that the deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border is part of a political stunt ahead of next week's midterm elections. \"We don't do stunts in this department. Thank you,\" Mattis told a reporter who posed the question after a Pentagon meeting with Mattis' South Korean counterpart. The defense secretary added the deployment was to provide \"practical support\" to the Department of Homeland Security and was based on a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The deployment is in response to the approach of a caravan containing an estimated 4,000 Central American migrants. The Pentagon said late Wednesday that it had identified 7,000 who will be participating in the mission at the border. Approximately 2,000 National Guard members\u00a0previously have been dispatched to the frontier over the past six months. The White House repeatedly has warned members of the caravan that they will not be allowed into the United States. In an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Monday night, President Trump vowed that the migrants \"are not coming in\" and said the administration would build \"tent cities\" to house asylum-seekers. \"We're going to have tents,\u00a0they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum, they get out,\" the president said. TOTAL IMMIGRATION TO U.S. RECENTLY TIED ALL-TIME RECORD On Wednesday, Trump told reporters at the White House that \"anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel\" could be sent to the border, \"on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border.\" Federal law prohibits the military from acting as a domestic police force, which means the troops going to the border cannot\u00a0detain immigrants, seize drugs from smugglers or have any direct involvement in stopping the caravan. Instead,\u00a0their role largely will mirror that of the existing National Guard troops, including providing helicopter support for border missions, installing concrete barriers and repairing and maintaining vehicles. MIGRANT CARAVAN 'MORE SOPHISTICATED' THAN PAST GROUPS, HOMAN SAYS The new troops are set to include military police, combat engineers and helicopter companies equipped with advanced technology to help detect people at night. Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster: Nuggets from the passing parade\u00a0- Centrist Dem: Age of House leadership a problem -\u00a0Audible: need some ice for that burn? - The fox says: five stars NUGGETS FROM THE PASSING PARADE\u00a0\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to alarm you, but Labor Day is in 17 days. Now take a deep breath and go get some more sweet corn\u2026 As you wait for the water to boil, how about some pre-weekend political nuggets for an appetizer? -\u00a0Much of the overheated analysis the trial of\u00a0Paul Manafort\u00a0on tax evasion and corruption charges has centered on what the potential verdict could mean for the larger efforts of Special Counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into other Russia-linked skullduggery in American politics. If jurors were to acquit President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman on all 18 counts it would certainly be a setback for Mueller and would give the president another talking point. But a couple of things to remember: The president can turn out talking points like Dunkin\u2019 does donuts so whatever happens, he\u2019ll call it a win. And second, Manafort is facing potentially even more serious peril in his\u00a0other\u00a0federal criminal trial\u00a0set to begin next month in the District of Columbia. We say it so often that we imagine you are well and truly tired of it, but here we go again: Rushing to judgements in matters like the Mueller probe is strictly a bad idea. Let the matter play out and do your best to be fair-minded, skeptical and patient in the meantime. -\u00a0We had to laugh at word that jurors asked to be excused early on Friday from their deliberations because one juror had a previous engagement. We remember covering trials with judges like\u00a0Jim Stuckey\u00a0and\u00a0Irene Berger\u00a0back in Kanawha County, W. Va. where such a request in a high-profile trial would have guaranteed the jury a one-way ticket to sequestration for the weekend eating cheap pizza in a motel room. Sheesh. -\u00a0As he left for the weekend, the president seemed pretty pleased with what he hath wrought with his move to revoke the security clearance of former CIA Director\u00a0John Brennan. And it definitely hits a lot of good notes for Trump, since it 1) stokes partisan enmity, 2) causes odd contortions in his detractors and 3) gives him a symbolic way to swat at the investigation into his campaign. The question now is whether this will be like other such Trump gambits, like his ill-fated commission to prove right his claim that he actually won the popular vote. On those jobs, Trump does some follow up trolling but basically lets the matter drop. The blowback he\u2019s gotten from serious people in the intelligence community would stand as a strong caution against further moves. One would suppose that the current CIA director and others would reinforce the idea that further political gamesmanship on national security is unwelcome.-\u00a0Speaking of executive inspirations that lead to administrative hangovers, Trump\u2019s much ballyhooed military parade in Washington is going to be postponed until at least next year citing cost overruns. If the Pentagon keeps kicking the can on this, they will kick it too close to 2020, by which point it would be a $90 million re-election campaign kickoff. The whole business is pretty cringey whenever they might do it since there\u2019s no ostensible excuse other than giving the president the chance to glory in martial might. But doing so less than a year from re-election would be a big no-no. -\u00a0A source said to be close to Trump\u00a0told\u00a0the preferred destination for White House whispers, Axios, that\u00a0Trump\u2019s increasing use of executive authority isn\u2019t alarming because he\u2019s not inclined \u201cto do anything that erodes separation of powers \u2014 at least, nothing that exceeds the historical rate at which executive power has expanded.\u201d Talk about defining deviancy down for the imperial presidency! That would be like a fat man saying that he won\u2019t eat anything to cause him to gain weight \u2013 at least nothing to gain weight faster than a busload of Weight Watchers refugees at a smorgasbord. If executive power continues to grow at the same pace it has since the 1930s, the legislative branch will be a comment box at the end of the White House driveway before too long.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Race watchers say much about the track records of endorsers. Rep.\u00a0Suzy Creamcheese, D-Pa., lost her primary so that must mean that her backer, Sen.\u00a0Joe Madadatz, shows less clout for 2020 and so forth. And there\u2019s value in that, to be sure. Plus, candidates can lessen their own capital by backing losers. Just look at where the current president has and\u00a0hasn\u2019t\u00a0endorsed in recent months. But don\u2019t forget the real purposes of endorsements for the endorsers. First, it can have positive clout connotations when right. It also builds a network of allies across the country. But maybe most of all, endorsements send powerful messages to activist voters. It can speak far louder than words in telling potential supporters who you mean to be. To that end, we give you.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0and her pick of\u00a0Deidre DeJear\u00a0for Iowa secretary of state. DeJear is African-American, like Harris, yes, but she\u2019s also a young businesswoman. It\u2019s a pick that reinforces Harris\u2019 brand but also broadens it.\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Do you remember that time Trump nominated Judge\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh\u00a0to the Supreme Court? Yeah,\u00a0the Nats fan. Anywho\u2026\u00a0 While you\u2019ve been watching all of the n-word accusing, clearance stripping, parade cancelling, ostrich jacket photographing, American greatness denying falderal Kavanaugh\u2019s popular support has improved markedly. The\u00a0latest poll\u00a0from Quinnipiac University shows support for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination up four points from last month. Some of this is to be expected as Republicans grow more familiar with the nominee\u2019s name, but it is certainly evidence that the Democratic effort to paint him as some extreme choice hasn\u2019t drawn much water so far. We\u2019ve said before and say again: The major challenge for Democrats will be finding a way to climb down from opposition that neither jeopardizes red-state senators nor the ambitions of 2020 aspirants sitting in the Senate now. In baseball, they call it an intentional walk\u2026THE RULEBOOK: LOOK AT US NOW\u201cA strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it.\u201d \u2013\u00a0John Jay, Federalist No. 2TIME OUT:\u00a0IT\u2019S A GASSmithsonian:\u00a0\u201cArmed with the latest technology of the day and observations made by other Western astrophysicists, [Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen] was determined to pry open the secrets of the galaxy. On August 18, 1868, Janssen managed to do just that. He became the first person to observe helium, an element never before seen on Earth, in the solar spectrum. At the time, though, Janssen didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d seen\u2014just that it was something new. The mid-1800s was an exciting time to peer at the heavens. A new instrument called a spectroscope was upending the field of astronomy. Similar in design to a telescope, the spectroscope worked like a super-powered prism, dispersing light into measurable wavelengths. An early model had allowed physicist\u00a0Joseph Fraunhofer\u00a0to observe the sun in the early 1800s, but he was puzzled by black lines interrupting the normal colors. These black lines were named for Fraunhofer, even though he didn\u2019t understand what they were. That knowledge would come several decades later, with German researchers Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD Trump job performance\u00a0 Average approval:\u00a041.2 percentAverage disapproval:\u00a052.8 percentNet Score:\u00a0-11.6 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0up 0.2 points [Average includes: CNN: 44% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Gallup: 39% approve - 56% disapprove; IBD: 41% approve - 50% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 41% approve - 51% disapprove.]Control of House Republican average:\u00a041.4 percentDemocratic average:\u00a048.2 percentAdvantage:\u00a0Democrats plus 6.8 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Democratic advantage up 0.2 points [Average includes: CNN: 52% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 51% Dems - 42% GOP; Pew Research Center: 46% Dems - 39% GOP; IBD: 45% Dems - 45% GOP; NPR/PBS/Marist: 47% Dems - 40% GOP.] CENTRIST DEM: AGE OF HOUSE LEADERSHIP A PROBLEMRoll Call:\u00a0\u201cThe chairman of the centrist New Democrat Coalition wouldn\u2019t say Friday whether he would back\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0for House Democratic leader but he did vocalize an issue with the current leadership team. \u2018The fact that our top three leaders are in their late 70s \u2014 I don\u2019t care who those leaders are \u2014 that is in fact a problem,\u2019 Connecticut Rep.\u00a0Jim Himes\u00a0told CNN. Pelosi, 78, has said she plans to run for speaker again if Democrats win the majority in November. House Minority Whip\u00a0Steny H. Hoyer, 79, and Assistant Democratic Leader\u00a0James E. Clyburn, 78, are interested in running for speaker should Pelosi fail to get the votes. Himes, 52, who chairs the 68-member New Democrat Coalition, declined to say whether he\u2019d support Pelosi for speaker. \u2026 Still, Himes noted that Pelosi has a strength that recent Republican speakers, including\u00a0Paul D. Ryan\u00a0and\u00a0John A. Boehner, have not demonstrated \u2014 an ability to keep her caucus together and pass major legislation such as the 2010 health care law.\u201d Meet the \u2018Trump Democrat\u2019 who is changing the game -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cA Democrat seeking a U.S. House seat in deep-red West Virginia bills himself as a \u2018Trump Democrat\u2019 -- even though he has claimed the president \u2018hasn't done s---,\u2019 backs a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and opposes a border wall.\u00a0Richard Ojeda, an Army veteran and state senator who\u2019s been branded as a \u2018JFK with tattoos and a bench press,\u2019 initially captured attention after revealing that he voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. He\u2019s now running against Republican\u00a0Carol Miller\u00a0in West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which President Trump won by nearly 50 points in the 2016 presidential election. Yet a poll from June indicates that Ojeda's message of populism \u2013 including support for the coal industry and hopes of seeing Trump succeed as the president \u2013 has resonated with potential voters, putting him in a 6-point lead against Miller.\u201d Nevada House race a hot one -\u00a0Roll Call:\u00a0\u201cRepublicans are largely on defense this cycle, but a new GOP poll shows they have a potential pickup opportunity in Nevada\u2019s 4th District. Two former lawmakers are facing off for the open seat in suburban Las Vegas: Democrat\u00a0Steven Horsford\u00a0and Republican\u00a0Cresent Hardy. The internal poll for the Hardy campaign and the National Republican Congressional Committee showed Horsford and Hardy in a dead heat. Both candidates were tied at 41 percent, with 17 percent of those surveyed undecided, according to the polling memo provided first to Roll Call. The poll only tested Hardy and Horsford, and not any of the four third- or no-party candidates who will be on the November ballot.\u00a0Horsford won the newly created seat in 2012, but was unseated by Hardy two years later. Hardy, in turn, also only served a term before losing in 2016 to Democrat\u00a0Ruben Kihuen, who is retiring amid sexual harassment allegations.\u201d Barr goes on attack as formerly safe seat threatened -\u00a0NYT:\u00a0\u201c[Andy Barr] finds himself in one of the country\u2019s most competitive midterm races against a first-time candidate,\u00a0Amy McGrath, a Democrat and a former Marine combat aviator whose life story made an instant connection with voters. That has transformed the race into a tossup in a district that Mr. Barr won by 22 percentage points only two years ago. The incumbent is, by many measures, a good fit for the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, moving seamlessly among the country club and horse industry elite in Lexington and in the more rural areas that reach Appalachia. \u2018The hallmark of my representation is accessibility,\u2019 said Mr. Barr, 45. But the dark tones that advertising in the Lexington media market took on last week attest to a different kind of campaign brewing.\u00a0The ads are similar to ones Republicans have used around the United States, trying to paint Ms. McGrath, 43, as \u2018too liberal\u2019 for the district and a tool of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. Mr. Barr\u2019s ad also shows Ms. McGrath calling herself a \u2018feminist\u2019 and saying that she voted for President Barack Obama.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYCalifornia GOP gubernatorial nominee Cox clarifies: Waiting in line at the DMV is not worse than the Holocaust\u00a0-\u00a0KXJCMichigan House Democrat apologizes for racist slurs against rival\u00a0-\u00a0Detroit Metro Times Je t\u2019aime mon Quebecois!

And living in such a pleasant corner of Florida as you do, I would imagine demoralization would be hard to come by. But our job here is to tell it like it is, or at least as we see it, without fear or favor. This is going to be a rough year for Republicans and it will take something on the order of a miracle for them to save the House. The Senate looks more promising for your team, but overall the GOP is in a tight spot.

Thursday, St. Elmo Steak House tweeted that Winston the fox arrived alone in the backseat of an Uber, \u2018safe and sound!\u2019 Earlier in the night, the restaurant said the fox was taken from its 1933 Lounge last Friday night. The restaurant posted surveillance footage that shows the perpetrators nabbing the fox. The restaurant even offered a $250 gift card to anyone who provided information that led to the safe return of the \u2018beloved friend.\u2019 The restaurant said if the perpetrators brought him back unharmed, no hard feelings, they would celebrate his return with a round of drinks on the house. Along with surveillance video, St. Elmo also jokingly edited a photo of Winston onto a bottle of its sauce, saying it was \u2018actively evaluating all tactics\u2019 to assist in his safe return.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cTo be doing every day what you enjoy doing is rare.

            "article_content": "President Trump is making immigration his closing argument before the midterms by announcing the White House is working on executive action to change the rules for asylum seekers. John Roberts reports for 'Special Report.' President Trump\u2019s actions announced Thursday and in previous days to protect our southern border from illegal immigrants should be welcomed by all Americans because they will protect our national security and reduce the flow of deadly illegal drugs into our country. The president is right when he calls the entry of illegal immigrants gathered in caravans now traveling through Mexico \u201can invasion.\u201d While his critics accuse the president of playing politics with the immigration issue, in reality he is fulfilling his responsibility to defend our nation by sending several thousand troops to protect our border and taking other actions. In remarks at the White House on Thursday the president said he will require immigrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to \u201clawfully present themselves\u201d at a port of entry. President Trump also announced the end of the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy under which illegal immigrants apprehended by U.S. law enforcement officers are given court dates and then released \u2013\u00a0 enabling many to melt into the population, never show up in court and remain in the U.S. illegally. The president\u2019s plan to review and tighten the controls over our immigrant asylum process also makes sense. As he pointed out, U.S. law requires that people applying for asylum need to show a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of prosecution for political, religious or a small number of other factors \u2013 not simply that they are coming to America to escape poverty and improve their living standards. We\u2019ll know more about President Trump\u2019s proposals next week, when he said he will issue a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d executive order on immigration. Earlier this week the president indicated that he will attempt to reverse the concept of birthright citizenship for the children of people in the U.S. illegally. Legal experts differ on whether the 14th Amendment to the Constitution requires that anyone born on U.S. soil automatically acquires American citizenship \u2013 even if the child is the son or daughter of an illegal immigrant. President Trump has said he believes he has the power to end birthright citizenship for such children by executive order. If he takes the action, it is sure to be challenged legally and the case will inevitably wind up in the Supreme Court. \u201cCaravan\u201d is the latest term in Orwellian Newspeak for what we call a collection of several thousand individuals, of dubious origin and organization, who are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S. southern border. All of them have been clearly warned not to come and President Trump issued that warning again Thursday. Yet they are coming. There is a disconnect between politicians and influencers who manufacture ideas of open borders and ordinary citizens who are the emotional and ideological consumers of those same ideas. Americans watch images of people walking through Central America and Mexico and experience a variety of emotions. Many of us feel guilt and compassion. On TV we see the suffering of impoverished migrants walking day after day \u2013 hungry and tired, sleeping on the streets. Because we live in far better conditions in the U.S., many of us want to help those less fortunate. And many Americans feel outrage at the suffering of migrant families being separated at our border and held in detention. So it\u2019s natural that many Americans want to hold someone in our own government accountable. Powerful stuff, these things called feelings. And there\u2019s no question that Democrats are exploiting these feelings to get more votes in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections as they seek to use the issue of illegal immigrants to falsely portray President Trump and Republicans as cruel and uncaring bigots who hate all immigrants. Nothing could be further from the truth. President Trump has said many times that he welcomes legal immigrants \u2013 his own mother was a legal immigrant and so is first lady Melania Trump. \"Mass uncontrolled immigration is especially unfair to the many wonderful law-abiding immigrants already living here, who followed the rules and waited their turn,\" the president said Thursday. But as President Trump pointed out, we can\u2019t simply open our borders to all the people around the world who want to come to America. There are more than 7.5 billion people in the world \u2013 but only about 329 million live in the U.S. How could we cope with the sudden influx of hundreds of millions \u2013 or even a billion or more \u2013 immigrants from around the world coming to our country if we allowed whoever wanted entry to move to America? There is not a single Democratic politician, pundit, contributor, or celebrity who is going to open up their usually lavish homes to let the illegal immigrants in the caravan move in for an extended stay while they get their feet on the ground. There is not one of them who is going to take on a vow of poverty and surrender his or her wealth for the comfort and support of illegal immigrants. No, they expect the American taxpayer to fork over billions of dollars to feed, house, educate, assimilate and provide health care to wave after wave of illegal immigrants. If President Trump keeps his promise at his press conference, then the illegal immigrants in the caravans heading to the U.S. \u2013 as well as other immigrants \u2013 are going to be stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border. If violence results and any of the migrants are killed, no doubt the Democrats will use their deaths for political propaganda purposes to get votes and strengthen their drive to impeach President Trump. Conversely, if the main caravan of illegal immigrants and more following behind it are allowed to enter the U.S., we can expect more illegal immigrants to follow. As President Trump said Thursday: \"If these caravans are allowed into our country, only bigger and more emboldened caravans will follow \u2013 and you see that's what's happening now.\" Once we lose our border protection, the road to citizenship, voting and welfare benefits for a flood of new immigrants will be all but paved. Americans now buying caravan T-shirts \u2013 based on their emotions of guilt, compassion, and outrage \u2013 will gradually see those emotions replaced with fear, frustration, and resentment. But by then it will be too late. Our nation will have already slid too far down the path of losing its identity.\u00a0My advice to President Trump is to hold firm. Yes, America is a nation of immigrants \u2013 but the immigrants have to enter legally. Throwing open our borders to everyone who wants to enter is impractical and could cause grave harm to our nation and the American people.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Justice with Judge Jeanine,\" November 3, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE: Breaking tonight with this agenda on the line, President Trump crisscrosses the country from Montana to Florida today as we go down to the wire to the midterms. Hello and welcome to Justice. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for keeping \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" on the \"New York Times\" bestsellers list for 13 weeks. We have a big show on deck tonight with Kellyanne Conway, Lara Trump, Congressman Darrell Issa, Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens, just to name a few. We'll also have more from the President, his latest rally tonight in Pensacola, Florida. But first my open. Now, I don't care if you like him or you don't like him. You don't have a choice. On Tuesday the issue is simply do you care about what's getting done or some left wing whackadoo subjective view about the way it's getting done. The left prefers style over substance. They prefer interpretation over fact. The subjective versus the objective truth and reality. Why? Because they hate him. That we are even having this conversation is ridiculous. The only thing that matters are results. You can certainly have a conversation about how he says things. Okay, I'll give you that. But what makes you right? You are so blinded by hateful vitriol and disappointed by your 2016 loss that you can't see straight. Instead, let's take a moment to look at the facts. It's simply insane. Every metric is up. The economy is through the roof, just like he said it would be. The longest positive growth streak on record. Unemployment at 3.7 percent. The lowest in almost half a century. GDP as high as 4.2, the strongest consumer confidence in decades. Are you even listening? What this means is if you want to get a job, you can get one. If you are African-American, you never had a better chance to work than now. If you are Hispanic, you've never had a better chance of getting a job. If you are Asian American, it's never been better. If you are a woman, you have a better chance of getting a job than in the last 50 years. If you are a youth, a better chance than in the last 50 years. If you care about a better life, so you can pay the rent, pay the mortgage, educate your kids and maybe even take a vacation, then this is the America you want to live in. Do you really want to go back to the days of Obama and the demon rats where manufacturing jobs were quote \"a thing of the past?\" There are now more than 446,000 new manufacturing jobs. That's what I said, more than 446,000. Almost a half a million new manufacturing jobs. A hundred thousand of them supporting the production and transport of oil and natural gas. Construction, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, all major gains. Wages for American workers are going up. If you work at Walmart or Amazon, they are actually raising your pay. Why? Because they know you have other opportunities to get a job in the Trump economy. If you are a veteran, you have already gotten the raise just like he said he would. Do you remember when 22 veterans a day were committing suicide, couldn't even get a doctor's appointment? The Democrats may believe they knew nothing about it. Obama said he read about it in the newspaper while rewarding VA Hospital staff who threw away requests for appointments. Now, veterans have access to private sector healthcare options and they don't have to rely on the VA. The man's promise keeping is relentless. He promised us jobs and gave them to us. He promised he'd move the embassy to Jerusalem and he did. He promised he would break the Iran deal and he did. He promised he would get rid of ISIS and he did. He promised he'd rebuild the military and he did to the tune of $700 billion. Everything is better, but you don't like his style. You don't like him. You are concerned about the rhetoric and who we are.\u00a0\nWell, if you don't care about results and things getting better and things getting done, but instead the way you see it getting done, then by all means, vote for a Democrat. I thought that liberals were live and let live. Why do you care about how he chooses to lead? Why are you so focused on your hatred of Donald Trump?\u00a0\nWhy do you dismiss his results? Obama like Hillary missing the spotlight comes out again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Suddenly, Republicans are saying they are going to protect your preexisting conditions when they literally have been doing the opposite. That's some kind of gall. That's some kind of chutzpah. Let's call it what it is. It's a lie. They are lying to you. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: It's a lie. They are lying to you. You are the one who promised that we could keep our healthcare and our doctor when you knew it was a lie at the time. Instead, while Republicans run on their record, Democrats promise to impeach him, to keep investigating Justice Kavanaugh when there is actually a criminal referral to the Justice Department against the woman who said that Kavanaugh and his friend raped her several times. Yet these phoneys promise is to upend the Constitution. The presumption of innocence. Keep the borders open. Try to control our speech, control what he say, how we should say it, and of course, they will continue with that good old Russia collusion delusion. And they call us fear-mongers.\nRemember this? Riots over conservatives speaking. You tell me hot fear\u00a0\nmongers are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: You cannot be civil with a political party that want to destroy what you stand for. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D\u2014CALIF.: If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station. You get out and you create a crowd. And you pushback on them and you tell them they are not welcome. SEN. CORY BOOKER, D\u2014N.J.: Please, don't just come here today and then go home. Go to the Hill today. Get up and please, get up in the face of some Congress people. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: Michelle says that when they go low, we go high? No, no. When they go low, we kick them. NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF\nREPRESENTATIVES: In terms of the bonus that the corporate America received versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic. CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER, DEMOCRAT: This executive order was mean spirited and un-American. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Actually, if you look at the outrage of Congress people, it looks like we have more to fear than they do. Facts don't lie. They cannot be influenced. All these cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, Philadelphia -- all with high crime rates, failing schools and poverty, all have one thing in common. Democrats in charge. The last Republican in charge in any of these cities was between 70 and 150 years ago. Now, that unemployment of African-Americans is the lowest in history. Think again.\u00a0\nWhat do you have to lose? You know, folks, we are not paying attention to any of the left's noise just like we didn't in 2016. So are you ready to challenge history? Where every party in power for virtually the last century suffers at the polls?\u00a0\nAre you ready to challenge history like you did in 2016 where they told you, you just as well go out and vote because the queen, the one they tried to drag across the presidential finish line was going to win? If you like more money in your paycheck, if you like being able to find a job, if you like the direction this country is on, put the pedal to the metal and get you and everyone you know out to vote. Vote for the America that is great again. And that's my open. If you love my opening statement, you are going to love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one best seller, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and so much, counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Good evening, Kellyanne, thanks for being with us tonight. KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: That was a barn burner stem liner, Jeanine and you were absolutely right on so many levels. Look, a lot of the analysis from them sounds like it did in 2016. They are still running content free campaigns. That's their business. But I'm going to focus on two - a tale of two different views on what's gone low. You know\n- when you talk about what's gone low with the Democrats, it's uncivil, uncouth, uncharitable many times. When you talk about what's gone low under President Donald Trump, it's called the unemployment rate. We lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs under President Obama's administration in the previous eight years. We gained over 400,000 manufacturing jobs. I want you think about that for a moment because everybody pretends that the economy is just a bunch of numbers, it doesn't have impact. Chuck Schumer said it's just - it doesn't matter to the average American. It doesn't give them any more dollars. This has been a boon to the job creators, the job seekers and job holders.\u00a0\nIf you have a job, you actually have job mobility now. Beyond job security, you can move around to another job and you can look for better benefits. Something closer to home. The deregulation, what he's doing at the border, what he's doing with our military veterans. That's why what I termed in 2016, the quote, \"undercover hidden Trump voter\" to international ridicule. And of course, it was true, they are going to be out there on Tuesday and I'll tell you why. They are so tired of arguing with people in their circle of life about their support for Republican policies and for President Trump's agenda, that they don't talk about it anymore. The big mouths are all out. There's not a single hidden vote anywhere for the Democrats. Not a single hidden vote anywhere for the Democrats. I'm telling you, look at the lines in Bozeman, Montana today just to see the President. The media will say, \"But will they vote?\" No, they stood in line for three hours, but they are not going to go and vote. Of course, they're going to vote. PIRRO: But Kellyanne, the thing that amazes me is that Barack Obama is now out mocking the President. And, you know, saying look, the economy is so good -- I think we have sound on it. Let's take a listen to it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: I know - I do have to make this point because right now, Republicans are all \"Look, the economy is so good.\" Where do you think that started? (Cheering and Applause) OBAMA: When did that start? (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: So, Kellyanne, I ask you. He is coming out now saying that he's responsible for all this - these jobs. What do you say to that? CONWAY: People don't believe that and there has been polling that's been done to prove that. It also just seems like a very odd and somewhat pathetic argument from a former President who is on tape also saying that 2 percent or less in growth in GDP is the quote \"new normal.\" Under President Trump, it's been over 4 percent for several quarters. And then he also said, \"Well, what's Donald Trump going to do? Wave a magic wound and create new jobs?\" No, it's called deregulating and undoing the Obama regulations.\u00a0\nThat's what aggravates him so hard. Bit by bit, President Trump is undoing the Obama legacy, not because we sit around talking about Barack Obama, I hardly ever hear this name said in this White House. It's because those were wrong policies that was taken as sort of a socialist, pro-government America. This President has said to industries that were flat on their backs, manufacturing, construction, mining, I'm here for you. We are going to open up those factories. We're going to bring those jobs back, we are going to renegotiate trade policies, deregulate and cut your taxes. All of that is why we have an economic boom. It didn't start under President Obama, and if it had, a single Democrat would have voted for President Trump's tax cuts. Barack Obama is the only Democrat I know who thinks the Trump economy is doing well because he wants to take credit for it. So people know what they feel they know. They have seen their paychecks. They know what they seen in their savings accounts. People know that they are doing better. They are more peaceful and prosperous. And Jeanine, I don't sit around in the beltway or in a bubble or up and down the East Coast or on the West Coast, I go out and I travel and I talk to people. I don't curate the Republican audience, people come up to me from all over the country. Some aren't so nice, I pray for them.\u00a0\nThey've been working miserable for four decades, but most of people will come up to me and say I didn't even vote for President Trump, or I don't much like this or that, tell him thank you. Tell him thank you for keeping promises, for turning Washington upside down. He delivered, and those results, that progress, that delivery, that matters most of on Tuesday. PIRRO: I think we're going to see an interesting Tuesday, Kellyanne Conway, thanks so much for being with us tonight. CONWAY: We are not even talking about losing in the Senate. Think about that. That's historic. PIRRO: That's right. CONWAY: Thank you. PIRRO: Dan Bongino and Chris Hahn still on deck ready for one final debate before America votes, you don't want to miss it, but next, President Trump's daughter-in-law and Trump 2020 senior advisor, Lara Trump joins me live to make her closing argument for the President's agenda before Tuesday's crucial election. My live interview with Lara Trump is a moment away. Stay with us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are just days away from one of the most of important elections of our lives. This is a big one.\u00a0\nThis is a very important election. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Breaking tonight. President Trump making the case for his agenda at a rally in Pensacola, Florida just three days before the crucial midterm elections. My next guest has traveled the country campaigning for these midterm election, Trump 2020 senior advisor, daughter-in-law to the President, Lara Trump joins me now. Good evening, Lara. LARA TRUMP, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Jeanine, great to be with you. PIRRO: All right, you are a strong female Trump family surrogate just back as I understand it from Nevada, Georgia, West Virginia in the run up to the Tuesday midterms. You were also on the road in 2016 and I was able to see you on part of that journey. Compare 2016 to the 2018 midterm. Is it different? Is it similar? L. TRUMP: You know what, it's very similar. I think honestly, Jeanine, one of the only differences I'm seeing is that the President's name is not directly on the ballot, but people, I think understand that is equally as important if you voted for him in 2016, to get out and vote in the midterms for Republicans. I am telling you, the turnout everywhere, the enthusiasm - and by the way, Jeanine, the enthusiasm among women and this is something that the Democrats always tout that they have the women's vote. Women after they saw what happened to Brett Kavanaugh are ready to vote for Republicans. I feel really good about things going into Tuesday. The enthusiasm is there.\u00a0\nEverybody has to get out to the vote. They have got to take their friends, their family, everyboyd out Tuesday and vote for Republicans. PIRRO: You know, what's interesting about this Lara is for the first time in history, an ex-president, Barack Obama to be specific, is coming out and doing something that hasn't been done. He's out campaigning virtually against the Republicans and the President, calling them liars and talking about the numbers and healthcare. What do you say to that? L. TRUMP: Well, first of all, they must be pretty scared on the Democratic side if they are pulling out the big guns and they have Barack Obama out campaigning for the Democrats. I think they are very scared because this is a President who is delivering results for the people. As it relates to healthcare, the President has said a million times that the Republicans are the ones that want to give you a good healthcare plan. Excuse me, Obama gave everybody probably the most of horrible healthcare plan in the history of the country with Obamacare. People's lives were essentially destroyed by it in many cases having to work two and three jobs just to pay their premiums, so we finally have a President who understands and he wants to help people. I think it's very telling by the way that Barack Obama is out there on the campaign trail. PIRRO: Interesting, and while you were speaking, Lara, we put up a tweet from the President saying that he was going to totally protect Republicans and he was going totally protect health insurance as it relates to preexisting illnesses. But I think that the Democrats are also saying that women are better off under Democratic leadership, and I'm going to ask to you listen to a sound bite. Oprah Winfrey who is out in Georgia on Thursday. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OPRAH WINFREY, AMERICAN ACTRESS: I'm here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were you suppressed, who were repressed, and oppressed. And I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Okay, so as it relates to women as Oprah comes out and campaigns for women and then says because they have been oppressed, they have got to - in that case vote for the female Democratic candidate for governor, what say you? L. TRUMP: Well, Oprah is great. I loved her show, but I think women are incredibly smart. And women like results, Jeanine. Guess who is delivering results for women in this country? President Donald Trump. How about the fact that women's unemployment is at a 65-year low right now under this President. This President wants to make sure that their families have a great country in the future. That is what women care about. We are so much safer as a country under this President. And you know what, hey might not tell their friends, they might not talk about it a lot, but I think women are by themselves in a voting booth on Tuesday.\u00a0\nThey are going to vote for Republicans because they understand Republicans are going to continue the great trend we have seen under President Donald Trump. PIRRO: Lara Trump, thank you so much for sharing your Saturday night with us. L. TRUMP: Thanks, Jeanine. PIRRO: All right. So what's really at stake when you go to the polls? Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens from Turning Point USA are here together to lay it out and next Dan Bongino and Chris Hahn get their final say before American votes. It's a panel battle you can't miss. Who is going to win? EBONI K. WILLIAMS, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Eboni K. Williams. Emotions run high in Pittsburgh just one week after the deadly synagogue shooting. Hundreds gathered outside the Tree of Life synagogue. There they prayed and sang during a healing service. Eleven people were killed when Robert Bowers allegedly opened fire. Similar services took place all across the country. The shooting is being called one of the worst attacks on Jewish people in the US. Crews in Indonesia say they have located the fuselage of a crashed air liner. They also have reported hearing a ping locater that maybe from the cockpit voice recorder. Lion Air flight 610 went down last Monday just minutes after takeoff. It's still not known what caused the crash, all 189 people on board were killed. I'm Ebony K. Williams. Now back to \"Justice with Judge Jeanine.\" PIRRO: Just over 48 to 72 hours, before the midterm and a lot for my panel, the battle bout tonight, let's get right to it. NRA TV host Dan Bongino, former senior aide to Chuck Schumer, radio show host, Chris Hahn.\u00a0\nAll right, guys the President is talking about the caravan and the fact that he is determined to protect this nation and allow people who are legal. Legal immigrants to immigrate, but right now, the southern border looks like there is a surge coming across and they were violent from Guatemala to the Mexico border. Knocking down the walls and the fences, and now the immigrants are suing our government saying they have a Constitutional right to be here. Chris Hahn. Tell me why they do? CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: We are going to spend $200 million of the people's money for a campaign stunt. PIRRO: That's not the question, don't start down that road. Chris, answer the question. Do they have a constitutional right to be here? Yes or no. HAHN: I don't know, and I don't think they do. I think they have a right to seek asylum which is what they plan on doing when they get here, but we should all be appalled by the waste of taxpayer money for a political stunt. You in your opening, Judge, said it right. The President should be running on his record. The economy is doing well, jobs are up, but the President chose to scare his base, to get them motivated. This should be called operation Joe Donnelly or Operation Tester because that's what this is all about sending troops to our border. PIRRO: All right, nobody cares about that. Dan Bongino, what do you say, do they have a constitutional right to be here? DAN BONGINO, NRA TV CONTRIBUTOR: They don't. I can't believe Chris just said that on a national cable news program. Did he really suggest that he's unsure if they have a constitutional right to be here? Judge, do you understand - this is the modern liberal. You ask them a basic simple question that seriously, my daughter in first grade can answer for you. I'm not even kidding. Do foreign nationals have a constitutional right at any point to enter the United States when they choose and how they choose it and he's unsure of the answer? Folks, listen, Election Day is coming up. Wait a minute, Chris, I didn't interrupt you, buddy. I did not interrupt you. HAHN: I didn't said I don't care if they do. BONGINO: Chris, good. There you go. There's your answer, but folks, I want you to understand, Election Day is coming up and Chris's answer is epidemic of a bunch of people on the left who completely feel the same way that you can just waltz in whenever you feel like it. PIRRO: Okay, so now, Chris, what the President is doing is he is enforcing our laws, and he is saying to those coming from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, unlike President Obama who basically invited them all in, he is saying, \"You can't come here, you don't have more rights than anyone else from any other part of the world. What makes you think that you have more rights and you can just invade or come in as a group.\" And there are thousands, tributaries, California, Arizona, Texas -- I don't think it's funny if you live in New York and you suffered from some of the gang members who have killed Americans, then it's not so funny. Why can't we screen them, Chris? HAHN: Well, look, I want to screen them. They are coming to seek asylum, but here is how you know this is fake. The President will go visit the troops at the border unlike the troops we have in Afghanistan which he never had the courage to go visit. So this is something that we know is not real. This is not an invasion. This happens all the time. It's ginned up to get the base motivated, and by the way, it might be working politically. The president may be an evil genius, but he is a little bit genius to get his base worked up this way. PIRRO: I don't think he's evil. What do you say, Dan? BONGINO: Chris, listen, man, that's just gross. I mean, what's going on with you lately? You're like losing your mind. Why would you suggest the President of the United States, whatever personal gripes you have with him?\u00a0\nAgain, people can see this, Chris. This isn't like, we are not on like a private internet chat room here. People can see this. HAHN: I got it. BONGINO: This is dumb stuff. Why would you suggest the President of the United States doesn't like the troops? Listen, let me just tell you something I know, maybe I shouldn't but I'll tell you anyway. I've still got friends in the Secret Service who unlike you actually know the President. Chris, listen, you are not going to talk over me. You may do that, but not me, I don't play that game. Listen, I have people - I know friends who actually work with this President. They don't share classified info with me at all, but they have told me multiple times how much he adores - not likes, but adores our cops, our firemen and our military. So you saying that like it's some political stunt and he doesn't have the guts to visit them, you should really just retract that and save face now.\u00a0\nYou've humiliated yourself. HAHN: Go visit them. PIRRO: Last word, Chris Hahn. We're going ... HAHN: I'll say this, Dan, when the President goes to visit them in Afghanistan, I will retract it. But right now he still hasn't gone. PIRRO: Wow, okay. BONGINO: That's just a dumb thing to say, Chris. PIRRO: So, that's where we are. The President visiting Afghanistan. I don't know if the American people are concerned about that before Tuesday.\u00a0\nDan Bongino, Chris Hahn, thanks. And by the way, I'll buy you both dinner if you show up and seat here next to me for your next debate. Anyway ... HAHN: All right, cool. BONGINO: Let's do it. PIRRO: Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk are on deck, but Republican Congressman Darrell Issa is next. What should we be worried about if the Democrats take the House? Find out in a moment. What will change in Washington if the House flips? I spoke about that and more with Republican Congressman Darrell Issa. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) PIRRO: Congressman, thanks for being with us tonight and you are retiring at the end of this year. You've held that seat in the 49th District in California since 2003. And the two people vying to get that seat are Democrat Mike Levin and a Republican Diane Harky. What I found so interesting in this, is that, among those who have already voted in that district. This guy Levin seems to be up 80% among those who believe that healthcare is the most of significant issue in the race. So my question to you is, did I miss something on healthcare? Why are we all after sudden talking about healthcare? It's like the Democrats biggest talking point.\u00a0\nWe got rid of the individual mandate over the last two years. What happened? DARRELL ISSA, US CONGRESSMAN, CALIFORNIA, REPUBLICAN: It is interesting that we actually have driven down the cost of healthcare under Obamacare during the last couple of years by getting rid of some unnecessary regulations, and yet the voters are in some cases being driven to be concerned again. That's scare tactic on healthcare. In the case of Mike Levin, to be honest, he has $8 million or $9 million pummeling just absolutely distorting Diane Harkey's record. Well, Diane Harkey quite frankly is being outspent about seven or eight to one. So it's not a fair match. It is one of those challenges where her race wasn't funded, and... PIRRO: It wasn't funded by the Republican Party? ISSA: Not a penny. PIRRO: But you had that seat for so many years. I mean, somebody has to think that unless something significant changed, that a Republican can win that district, although you're pretty special, I assume. ISSA: I am not that special. The reality is that seat could have been held in a normal year, but the hundreds of millions of dollars just in those races just last week, $11 million came in from Michael Bloomberg to spread over four candidates, almost two million of which, I believe went to Mike Levin to beat up the highest ranking Republican in the state of California, Diane Harkey with a splendid record. But Michael Bloomberg has become - has certainly become an ardent Democrat trying to flip the House. PIRRO: Indeed, all right, I want to move on. You were Chairman of House Oversight. And you know what investigations and tale, I believe you were chairman from 2011 to 2015. Now, there have been multiple reports that the Mueller-Russia investigation is winding down. And certainly, without any indictments of any Americans connected to Russia collusion, no Russia collusion proven. And yet, Adam Schiff from your land of California couldn't stop himself any time he got in front of a camera to talk about Russia collusion. And I have a quote here, I mean, there are so many like this where he says, \"There is plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.\"\u00a0\nNow, if the Democrats win the house, he's going to be in charge of House Intel. Can we expect another two years of, \"It's there, it's there, it's there.\" I mean, aren't we tired of this yet? ISSA: Oh we absolutely can expect that. Adam Schiff who had access to all the classified information where there is no collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians has managed to say, well, it's in plain sight. Well, it's in plain sight in fake dossiers that were produced and paid for by the Obama administration. And so you can expect Adam Schiff, a former Democrat US Attorney to be out there talking about things that he can't tell you the source, but he's going to swear exist. That's what he has been doing for the last two years of the Trump administration. Well, Congress and the Trump administration have been building a robust economy, getting rid of regulations. PIRRO: I just have a few seconds left, with the - the numbers in the economy just yesterday. The unemployment rate, 3.7 and the jobs going up. I mean, what is your projection as it relates to the House? Does any of that stuff matter? ISSA: Well, you know, all of the good work done by the Republican House, that's going to come to a halt and we're going to be frozen. The good news is the Trump administration's deregulations will continue. Many of the things that have caused to us have increases in export of oil, increases of export of durable goods - that's going to continue. But it is a challenge, because so much of what was the agenda the last two years that the President signed is in danger of coming to a halt and that's a real shame because the economy today has negative unemployment, more people look - more jobs are being asked for than there are people to fill them. PIRRO: All right, Congressman Darrell Issa, thanks so much for being with us. ISSA: Thank you, Judge. PIRRO: Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens are next, and do you want some last minute insight before you go to the polls on Tuesday? Don't miss this. It's the race to the finish, and so much is at stake in these midterm elections, and here to talk about why they believe young people will make the right choice on Tuesday, Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens. They both join me now. Guys, thanks for being with us. I know that you guys have been crisscrossing the country also trying to get the vote out. Let's talk about the youth vote. All indications are that young people generally don't vote in the midterm. Is that the case? Charlie? CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: Well, you know, usually youth turnout in the midterm is around 40 percent to 45 percent, but all indications show that we are going to have some spiked enthusiasm. Candace Owens and I have been barnstorming the country going to college campuses through our Turning Point USA campus tour, and I can tell you, there are more young people than ever that are interested and supportive of this President's agenda. As Candace and I always say, there are some record highs in this administration, but there's also some record lows.\u00a0\nLowest over black unemployment, lowest ever Hispanic unemployment and the lowest youth unemployment in 60 years. So our own generation's well-being better pull that Republican lever come up on Tuesday. PIRRO: All right, and Candace, what are you seeing as you go around the country as it relates to young people and their voting. Are they going to come out? CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: Look, they are going to come out because they are tremendously enthusiastic, and look, there almost seems to be a tacit understanding that the stakes are higher this time around. We are deciding between two very disparate viewpoints of what America should be. It is either going to be run by the left who believe in mob rules and feminism, radicalized feminism, just believe women, chasing down congressmen and chasing conservatives out of restaurants or are we going to vote for the founding principles and the Constitution and what our founding fathers laid out for this country. So they understand that the stakes are higher this time around. I really think you're going to see a high voter turnout in terms of the youth. PIRRO: Okay, now, I'm going to ask both of you. The polls are indicating that, you know, first they said there was going to be a blue wave. And now, they say they are very confident that the Democrats are going to win.\u00a0\nI mean, do you feel that, that those polls are accurate? Charlie, I'll start with you. KIRK: No, and Candace and I, you know, we always are looking at this record turnout in early voting for Republicans in states like Arizona and states like Florida and states like Michigan. I mean, look at these national polls. We just don't see the continuity there. And remember, back in 2016, the polls were so terribly wrong. And I believe that the polls are being used as suppression tools to try to keep the Republican base at home, to try to make it seem as if the Republican base does not have - we don't have a chance to win these elections. And so the message for every Republican voter out there right now and every Trump supporter, vote like it's a general election. Vote as if Donald Trump is on the ballot because he is. If you give the power back to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, they're going to try to impeach this President and try to prevent his very successful agenda. PIRRO: All right, Candace, I want to go to Florida. You know, Florida is the 1 percent state Governor Rick Scott won by 1 percent, Trump won by 1 percent . Obama won by 1% when he ran against Romney, 1 percent. So we've got two people, Ron DeSantis and Andrew Gillum. You guys, as you crisscross the country, what do you think about this Florida race in particular, Candace? OWENS: Well, look, I think if you are interested in making America Venezuela, then you're going to vote for Gillum. If you're interested in preserving what Florida has become and you want to see the economy go up, then you know what the decision is. You have to vote for Ron DeSantis. I mean, it's crazy what he's talking about making it a socialist state. And this is what's at stake. What we're talking about here, the extreme left. I mean, it's scary talk, but I think that Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott are both going to pull through and it's going to be a major win in Florida for us. PIRRO: All right, and what about that, Charlie, I mean, we all know Ron DeSantis from his work in Congress and his work in identifying some of the wrongdoing and some of corruption at the upper echelons of the FBI and the DOJ. Why isn't that translating or is it translating in Florida for him to become governor? KIRK: Well, remember, every single poll that Florida had, the major polls were wrong going into 2016. The experts had Donald Trump down three to six points to heading into Election Day. And look, Candace and I made multiple stops in Florida, in many different parts of the state and there is a general consensus of support of Donald Trump, and I think they are going to come out and support Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott. Florida is a very diverse state. You have the panhandle where the President just was, where it's more socially conservative, and then of course, you have the I-4 corridor, which is your kind of more stereotypical suburban voter and then of course Southern Florida with a lot of migrants from the north east, well, not migrants, but people that have moved of course from the northeast going to Florida. And so this is going to be a very tight race. It is going to be focused on turnout and I think Ron DeSantis is going to win when it comes down to the wire. PIRRO: And Candace, let's talk about Gillum. I mean, you mentioned before the idea of turning Florida into Venezuela. You know Florida as Charlie just indicated, there's a lot of people who are there retiring, there are a lot of senior communities. I mean, people don't like the idea of the concept of socialism and taking care of everybody. To them, they worked their whole lives. And now they want to retire and not have to pay for everyone else. Whereas this guy Gillum is actually coming out and saying the police are the enemy, the police are plantation owners putting African-Americans in cages. OWENS: That's correct. He's an extreme leftist. Listen, he's getting desperate. That's why he's pulling the race card suddenly and he is accusing his opponent of racism because he is failing ideologically to connect with the voters in Florida, so he's trying to scare them. He is trying to make them emotional, trying to use fear based tactics. Which is why in the end, I don't think it's going to work. I am about - you have Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis and those are going to be the two people that pull away in this race and I have no doubt about that. I am feeling tremendously optimistic about Florida. PIRRO: Well, all right, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. OWENS: Thank you.

Steny Hoyer proposes an amendment to 'slam the door in the face of the Russian bear' and other adversaries that seek to steal the integrity of our elections. They began chanting \u201cUSA, USA, USA\u201d-- but it wasn't a Trump rally. House Democrats on Thursday erupted into the chants on the floor of the House of Representatives after House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., delivered a fiery speech condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for election meddling and accusing Republicans of not doing enough to ensure security of future elections. \u201cSurely, we can rise above pandering to party and Putin to act on behalf of our freedom and our security,\u201d Hoyer said to applause from Democrats, over the bangs of the gavel as the House was called to order by the speaker. Democrats then began chanting. Republicans didn\u2019t join in. It came as the House moved forward with a spending bill that eliminates new funding for election security grants to states, amid protests by Democrats who say Republicans are not doing enough to prevent Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \u201cWe have sworn an oath to defend our constitution and our liberty against all enemies foreign and domestic,\u201d Hoyer said. Congress approved $380 million in the current budget for a grant program overseen by the federal Election Assistance Commission. Democrats want to continue funding through 2019, but Republicans say money is still available to states and new spending is not needed. A Democratic amendment to extend funding was defeated, 182-232.

            "article_content": "The smoke is clearing from the most expensive midterm elections in American history and the outlines are just becoming visible. The smoke is clearing tonight for the most expensive mid-term election in American history. The outlines are just becoming visible. The results, it turns out, are confusing.\nIt wasn't exactly a draw but both sides can claim victory. And, of course, they are. In the House, Republicans did slightly worse than average in a mid-term election. In the Senate, they did a little better.\nSome of the races played out as referendums on the president's first two years in office. Other races had nothing at all to do with Trump. In some races, hard-edged ideologues won. In others, doughy moderates did. It was basically a patchwork. There are no obvious takeaways from what happened last night. But there are some useful lessons. What exactly have we learned from 470 individual congressional elections, some big governors races, and a full\nyear of political debate?\nWell the biggest news is that Democrats just won back the House of Representatives after eight years. They are thrilled with that, obviously. And yet, they don't appear to have any idea how they did it.\nAs of tonight, there really is no Democratic program or platform or message. There's no Democratic plan for making the economy stronger or the country safer. There's only Donald Trump whom they despise. The entire Democratic message is Trump.\nThe President is often accused of narcissism, of making everything about himself. But on that point, Democrats agree with him. They think everything is about Trump too. It was a big moment last night when it had just become clear that Democrats would re-take the House. It was really the apex of the night. And at that apex, a senior Democrat called the set at MSNBC to announce his party's top priority now that they have regained power. \u201cI've spoken to a senior Democratic source on the Ways and Means Committee,\u201d said MSNBC anchor Ari Melber, \u201cwho says tonight, breaking news, they do intend to request President Trump's tax returns. Getting your hands on those Trump tax returns, as everyone knows, would be a big deal for the Committee.\u201d\nGetting Trump's tax returns. That's the priority for Democrats \u2013 not infrastructure, not wages, not the looming threat of China or drug ODs in this country, the shrinking middle-class, not even healthcare. Trump's tax returns \u2013 that\u2019s what Democrats really want.\nOK. Maybe they'll get them. Maybe they'll get those returns. What then? What exactly will we learn from Trump's tax returns? That a casino owner once employed a clever accountant? That he made less than he claimed he did?\nWill anybody be shocked by any of that? Will anyone care about any of that? Or as with the Stormy Daniels saga that went on forever, will voters find themselves titillated for a moment and then lose interest? What do Trump's tax returns have to do with them anyway? Their premiums haven't gone down. It's all just noise. Almost all of this is just noise. And for the rest of us, there's a pretty simple lesson. And you'd think Democrats would have figured it out. But they have not figured it out.\nCongressman Jerry Nadler will likely be the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Just today, Nadler was on a train back to Washington from New York and he was overheard by somebody laying out his legislative priorities.\nFirst on the list \u2013 impeaching Brett Kavanaugh and removing him from the Supreme Court. Apparently, that's what Democrats really believe voters want more than anything else. \"Get that Kavanaugh guy\noff the court.\"\nCongressman Adam Schiff of California meanwhile is poised to take over the House Intelligence Committee. He's been the ranking member there for the last couple of years. He says that come January, when he takes over, his main priority will be intensifying the Russia probe because it's not intense enough or long-standing enough.\nSchiff apparently thinks that he can prove that Vladimir Putin somehow stole the 2016 election with a few dozen Facebook ads that hardly anybody saw. Can Schiff really prove that? Who knows? Maybe.\nWhat we can know for certain is that nobody outside Washington will care at all if he does prove it. The entire Russia conversation is irrelevant and dumb. That has been proven already. It has nothing to do with anything, and everybody knows it.\nDemocrats are the only ones who don't know it yet. As of right now, the entire Democratic platform can be summed up in one sentence: \"Donald Trump is a bad person. Whoa.\"\nThat's what they plan to run on in the next presidential election, which incidentally starts today, right now. Good luck with that. It's a virtual guarantee that Trump will serve a full eight years, if you make it about him.\nAnd by the way, so is all the race talk. That's not helping you. Somewhere along the way, Democrats became convinced they could win elections by denouncing voters as racist. The Andrew Gillum campaign just tried it in Florida. Remember? He was asked about the FBI probe into him. \"You're a racist for asking\" was essentially his response. Stacey Abrams' surrogates tried it also in Georgia. Did it work? No. It rarely works. Why would it work? Here's a bit of hard-earned knowledge from almost 30 years of covering campaigns. When you call voters immoral, they don't like it.\nAnd yet, the Left continues to throw out the racist slur, probably because they enjoy doing it. It makes them feel good about themselves. ABC News\u2019 Byron Pitts said this last night about the Gillum race: \u201cI think for me, progressives in places like Florida and Georgia, they'll be incredibly disappointed, and they'll be giving their White neighbors the hairy eyeball tomorrow, right?\u201d In other words, ABC News is telling us Andrew Gillum lost because of his skin color, and he lost because of the behavior of people of a certain skin color. ABC News knows that.\nYou hear things like this all the time, every day. And yet, curiously, nobody ever bothers to prove any of it or even try. Why? Because it's unprovable, and that's the appeal.\nRacism is now anything you don't like. A racist is anyone who's in your way. Hurling allegations of bigotry are, from the perspective of the Left, the quickest way to get what you want. That's why they do it. It happened again today at President Trump\u2019s press conference.\u00a0 Here\u2019s his exchange with PBS Newshour\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor:Alcindor: On the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening White nationalists. Now people are also saying\u2013Trump: I don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.Alcindor: There's some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting White nationalists because of your\u2013Trump: Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.Alcindor: \u2013rhetoric. What do you make of that?Trump: I don't believe. I just \u2013 well I don't know. Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African-Americans? I love our country. I do. You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world. And I don't mind helping the world. But we have to straight down our country first.\nNow that happened at the president's briefing, so you may not even have seen it because you're living a real life, and not glued to the Internet. But trust me, if that had happened even just a few years ago, it would have been everywhere. It would have been international news. An accredited White House reporter calling the president of the United States a White supremacist? Holy smokes.\nBut now it's just any other day on cable news. Nobody really believes that the reporter means it. It's posturing and, therefore, it is boring. The claim racist is losing its power from overuse. Diminishing returns have been reached. If you've got a problem with nationalism, it might be better just to argue against nationalism. That way we might all learn something.\nIn the meantime, Republicans should understand that Democrats call them bigots not because they believe they are bigots or even because they care if they are bigots. Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan are still allowed in the Democratic Party, after all.Democrats obviously aren't too concerned about bigotry or they'd kick those guys out first step. Democrats make the charge because they hope it will bring them power. And power is what they want. It's all they want.\nRepublicans lost an entire chamber of Congress last night. Nobody rioted this morning. Nobody blocked intersections or looted liquor stores. You didn't see Republican consultants on television this morning\nquestioning the results or attacking the House of Representatives as illegitimate as an institution.\nIt didn't occur to Republicans to do that. It was just an election. You lose sometimes. That's how Republicans think. That is not how Democrats think. They lost a few seats in the Senate last night.\nAlready, they're denouncing the Senate itself as somehow undemocratic. The talking points have gone around. They're all reading them. Joy Behar today on The View tried to read them. Ultimately, she misread the talking points. But she gave it her best shot.\u00a0 Here\u2019s an exchange she had with their guest, Matthew Dowd:Dowd: So Democrats won the popular vote last night by 8 million votes, right? But they lose U.S. Senate races in red areas so--Behar: Because of gerrymandering a lot of it.Dowd: Well that's not gerrymandering, that's the Constitution. The districts are gerrymandering but the states are part of the Constitution.\nWell you can't gerrymander a Senate election, of course, because it's statewide. Joy Behar probably doesn't know that. She probably doesn't know really what the Senate is. But she knows power. And like a lot of the Democrats you see on television, she will say whatever it takes to get power.\nRepublicans should understand that. But it's not just Democrats who should have learned something last night. There were major lessons for Republicans too, ones they should pay attention to. Here's one: Voters care about campaign promises. If you don't fulfill your campaign promises, it turns out they notice, they remember, and they don't care for it. In 2016, Republicans in Congress promised to, I don't know, build a wall, get rid of Obamacare, de-fund Planned Parenthood. They got elected on those promises. They didn't do any of them once they got elected. Maybe that's one reason they lost the House last night.\nHere's another lesson: Immigration matters, not just on the level of individuals and families and caravans \u2013 the things that we debate every night \u2013 but on the level of entire populations. Immigration changes who\nlives in a country and who votes.\nUltimately, that's why it matters. You never know that from listening to the coverage of immigration stories. You would think the question of who comes into your country and under what circumstances was entirely a moral issue, really a question of personal decency. Good people are for open borders. Bad people are against them. It's always the message including today.\nHere was CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta at the president\u2019s briefing today: Acosta: As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion. It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.Trump: Thank you for telling me that. I appreciate it.Acosta: Why did you characterize it as such and \u2013Trump: Because I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion.Acosta: But do you think that you demonized immigrants \u2013Trump: Not at all. No, not at all. I want them--Acosta: \u2013 in this election to try to keep \u2013Trump: \u2013 I want them to come into the country but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process. [Pointing to another reporter] You can go ahead.Acosta: Let me ask one other question. Are you worried \u2013Trump: That's enough. That's enough. That's enough.Acosta: Mr. President, I was going to ask one of the \u2013 the other folks \u2013Trump: That's enough.Acosta: \u2013 pardon me, Ma'am. I'm \u2013 I'm \u2013 Mr. President \u2013Trump: Excuse me, that's enough.Acosta: \u2013 Mr. President, I had one other question if I may ask on \u2013Trump: David \u2013 let's go.Acosta: \u2013 on the Russia investigation. Are you concerned that that you may have \u2013Trump: I'm not concerned about anything with the Russian investigation \u2013Acosta: \u2013 indictments \u2013 that you may have indictments coming down \u2013Trump: \u00a0\u2013 because it's a hoax.Acosta: Are you \u2013Trump: That's enough. Put down the mic.Acosta: \u2013 Mr. President, are you worried about indictments coming down in this investigation?Trump: I'll tell you what. CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN.\nAcosta is such a buffoon. But he's such a buffoon that the White House apparently felt it had no choice but to respond. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders put out this statement:\n\"President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter's colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. As a result of what happened today, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.\" So that's today's Jim Acosta sidebar.\nBut whatever else the exchange you just saw was, what it really was, was a diversion from the political reality of immigration. Here's the political reality. California was once a solidly Republican state for generations. It is now among the most democratic. Why? Immigration.\nDifferent people live there. And not surprisingly, they vote very differently. Something very similar is happening right now in Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, many other states, and that was reflected in last night's vote totals.\nCheck the numbers. Democrats, obviously, know this. That's why they oppose borders because it helps them win elections. Republicans, by profound contrast, have been very slow to pick up on this. They're very literal. They still think immigration policy is about virtue.\nRepublicans also seem to think that their economic message is working. They're very proud of the tax bill they passed in Congress, the Congress that they will control not much longer. Paul Ryan's always talking about his tax bill.\nAnd by the way, there's nothing wrong with tax cuts. But Republican strategists seem to forget that a huge percentage of Americans don't pay federal taxes. By definition, they don't care very much about tax cuts \u2013 cuts to taxes they don't pay.\nFor them and for many others, the economy is not measured in stock prices and GDP numbers. Their concerns are tangible concerns. What does gas cost? Can I afford to live in a safe neighborhood? Will I go bankrupt if I get sick?\nThese are real questions for tens of millions of people. The party that effectively addresses these questions generally wins elections. Republicans, for whatever reason, tend to ignore these questions. And\nthat's a big reason they just lost the House.\nBut there's a larger question that we ought to meditate on. The Republican Party is a conservative party. Republicans are supposed to care about families, not just a little bit, but above all. And yet, increasingly, the American family is vanishing.\nYoung people can't afford to get married or to have children. Take a look at the numbers sometime. They're publicly available. They are shocking. And they foretell an ominous future for all of us.\nA country without strong families is a weak country. It is a volatile place, a chaotic place. It's a place susceptible to political demagoguery. It's what America is becoming. If you want to stop that slide support families. It's that simple.\nPut another way, if your supposedly conservative economic program doesn't make it easier for young people to get and stay married and have kids, how is it really conservative? If couples are too poor to have children and you're not helping, why should I as a conservative vote for you?\nI should not vote for you. I will not vote for you. I will work against you. That is my pledge. Supporting marriage and children is the best, maybe the only way for Republicans or any of us to save the country. It will also win them elections. They should start right away.

            "article_content": "President Trump calls Florida's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum a 'stone-cold thief,' praises Republican senatorial candidate John James, and tells members of the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S. that they are 'wasting their time.' President Trump staunchly\u00a0defended his status as a nationalist and rejected any responsibility for last week's apparent pipe bomb mailings or the deadly shooting Saturday at a synagogue, in an exclusive interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham Monday night. Trump also suggested that\u00a0GQ Magazine correspondent Julia Ioffe \"must be some kind of a sick woman\" after she claimed hours earlier on CNN that he\u00a0had \"radicalized\u00a0more people than ISIS.\" She apologized shortly afterwards on-air, saying she had \"exaggerated.\" Cesar Sayoc, who allegedly sent explosive devices to CNN and several\u00a0 top Democrats, among others, \"was insane a long time before,\" Trump told \"The Ingraham Angle.\" \"You look at his medical records. He was insane for a long time,\" Trump added. He went on to deny strenuously that he had any connections to anti-Semitism in the wake of Saturday's deadly shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. The president has noted that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka are Jewish. \"I just received an award from the State of Israel from [Prime Minister] Bibi Netanyahu, thanking me because I moved the [U.S.] Embassy to Jerusalem, making Jerusalem the capital of Israel and I just did that -- now how many presidents said they were going to do it and they never did it?\" Trump said. Trump accused major media outlets, including The Washington Post,\u00a0of hypocrisy, saying they didn't blame Bernie Sanders for the attempted assassination of several lawmakers at a Republican congressional baseball practice last year. That attack, which nearly killed House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and wounded several others, was carried out by left-wing gunman James Hodgkinson, who had worked on Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. UTAH MAN ARRESTED EARLIER THIS MONTH AFTER POISON RICIN SENT TO TRUMP, PENTAGON \"Bernie Sanders had a fan who shot a very good friend of ours, Steve Scalise, and other people,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"He was a total maniac. Nobody puts his name in the headline, Bernie\u00a0Sanders in the headline.\" Meanwhile, liberal critics roundly\u00a0accused Trump of speaking in coded, roundabout dog whistles when he declared at a rally in Houston\u00a0earlier this month that \"I'm a nationalist,\" saying he was willingly associating himself with white nationalists and Nazis. \"A globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much,\" Trump said at the rally, which was organized to benefit incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz.\u00a0\"And you know what? We can't have that. You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist. ... Nationalist. Nothing -- use that word. Use that word.\" \"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.\" The concept of nationalism, Trump told Fox News on Monday, is entirely distinct from white nationalism. The president was unequivocal when Ingraham asked if he'd like to clarify his remarks on the subject. \"No. To me, I don\u2019t have to clarify,\" Trump shot back.\u00a0\"It means I love the country. I look at two things: Globalists and nationalists. I\u2019m somebody who wants to take care of our country because for many, many years, our leaders-- you know this better than anybody-- our leaders have been more worried about the world than about the United States, and they leave us in a mess -- whether it\u2019s the wars, whether it\u2019s the economy, whether it\u2019s debt, whether it\u2019s all of the things that they\u2019ve done, including putting in the wrong Supreme Court Justices and we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve really put two great ones in.\" TOP DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BACKS TRUMP '100 PERCENT' ON INBOUND MIGRANT CARAVAN He continued: \"No, I\u2019m proud of this country and I call that 'nationalism'; I call it being a nationalist and I don\u2019t see any other connotation than that. Now, as soon as you make any statement nowadays with the political correctness world, they make a big deal. I\u2019m not a globalist, but I want to take care of the globe, but first I have to take care of our country. I want to help people around the world, but we have to take care of our country, or we won\u2019t have a country, including -- we have to take care of our country at the border.\" The president also told Ingraham that Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for Florida governor, should not \"be allowed to continue on with the race,\" after the state ethics commission released documents that showed he accepted tickets to the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" from an undercover FBI agent in the summer of 2016. Fox News currently assesses the Florida gubernatorial race between Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis as a toss-up. \"Well, the FBI offered him tickets at $1,800 apiece and he took them -- he took a trip with the same FBI agent -- I guess he was posing as a developer or something -- the man stone cold took this stuff,\" Trump said, echoing his comments earlier in the day on Twitter. \"I don\u2019t even think he should be allowed to continue on with the race.\" He added that Gillum is a \"stone cold thief.\" Gillum responded to the controversy at a debate earlier this month, saying: \"My wife and I take vacations and we pay for our own vacations \u2026 I don't take free trips from anybody.\" And on Monday, Gillum attacked Trump directly: \"This man has a responsibility to stand up and to speak out against hatred and division. And instead every single day he gets on Twitter and goes to rallies and he stokes fear. His only goal is to make us afraid of each other so that we don\u2019t trust one another so that we don\u2019t respect each other\u2019s humanity anymore,\u201d Gillum said. Asked whom he would like to face in the 2020 presidential election, Trump cast a wide net, just a day after his former rival, Hillary Clinton, declared in a New York event, \u201cI\u2019d like to be president.\u201d (Clinton also insisted she would not consider another presidential bid until after the Nov. 6 midterm elections.) \"So far I like them all,\" Trump said, referring to the field of prospective Democratic nominees. When asked about Clinton's comments specifically, he responded: \"I like her too. I like them all. I don\u2019t see anybody that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy running against. And, you know, that could happen, but I don\u2019t see it right now.\" Trump took a shot at one potential contender, rival billionaire Tom Steyer, saying on Sunday that he's a\u00a0\"wacky\" and \"crazed & stumbling lunatic\" and that \"if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!\" TRUMP TAKES ON PROMINENT LIBERAL WHO BLAMED HIM FOR INCENDIARY RHETORIC The remarks came after Steyer -- who was one of the\u00a0prominent liberals to receive a threatening suspicious package\u00a0last week -- said he \"absolutely was blaming\" Trump for creating an atmosphere in which \"anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.\"\u00a0Steyer seemingly implicated Trump's rhetoric not only in the apparent pipe bomb mailings, but also in the deadly shooting Saturday. Trump is set to visit\u00a0Pittsburgh on Tuesday to show support for the victims at the synagogue there. Separately, Trump\u00a0reiterated that migrants in the Central American caravan making its way through Mexico to the U.S. are \"wasting their time\" because \"they are not coming in. ...\u00a0We\u2019re not letting them into this country.\" The president also indicated his administration likely would respond to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's interrogatories. \"It\u2019s ridiculous that I have to do anything, because I didn\u2019t do anything, but yes, we will probably do something, yes we will respond to questions,\" he said.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0No, free market conservatives are not becoming Dems -\u00a0Trump\u2019s Tampa rally shows dominance over Florida GOP - Poll: Heller, Rosen in dead heat for Nevada Senate\u00a0-\u00a0White House scales back shutdown threat -\u00a0One ugly baby NO, FREE MARKET CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT BECOMING DEMS\u00a0There\u2019s been considerable discussion around the idea, encapsulated in a\u00a0Politico piece\u00a0today, that the business community is gravitating toward Democrats in the era of Donald Trump. While the idea has just the right man-bites-dog appeal for an editor scrounging for summertime think pieces, it strikes us as wrongheaded for a few reasons. First, many of the biggest in big business\u00a0already\u00a0had a blue hue. Never forget that the bigger a company, the more likely it is to favor government regulation and intervention. The small- and medium-sized business guys and gals are the free marketers. The companies with the deep pockets to play the influence game and the profit margins to survive burdens that would crush smaller competitors are no bastions of libertarian thought.\u00a0 If you think you will be with the winners, you\u2019re all for the government picking winners and losers. When the drug lobby lined up to back ObamaCare, for instance, it was treated as a shocking reversal for a right-leaning industry.\u00a0Pffffttttt\u2026 Second, given the expected Democratic gains this fall, we would naturally assume that trade groups that rely on friendly relations with the powerful would start hedging their bets. It happened\u00a0in 2010\u00a0and would logically happen the other direction in 2018. Tracking these kinds of contributions is significant not because it is a leading indicator, but rather because it is a lagging one.\u00a0 Businesses are responding to the same trends we all see, not acting on their preferred outcomes. But like political betting markets, such donation trends have the advantage of crowdsourcing. Donors generally care deeply about how they\u2019re spending their money, and many corporate donors are less interested in shaping outcomes than they are in being favorably positioned for what comes next. Third, this is not happening in a vacuum. As the Republican Party continues its transition away from conservatism and toward populist nationalism, there will be many on the free-market side of things who abandon a party that embraces economic interventions for its own preferred winners. But there\u2019s zero indication that Democrats will be a welcoming home for the devotees of\u00a0Milton Friedman\u00a0and\u00a0F.A. Hayek.\u00a0 Democrats are rather busy right now trying to find some way to absorb and channel the energy of newly empowered activists on the far left without terrifying suburban swing voters. The idea that there is room in the Democratic Party of the future for the champions of free enterprise sounds as fanciful as the onetime notion that the Tea Party-era GOP could be a lasting home for upscale moderate Democrats put off by the excesses of\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But none of that is to say that there isn\u2019t a sea change taking place inside the Republican Party right now. And certainly\u00a0the rupture\u00a0between\u00a0President Trump\u00a0and free-market evangelists\u00a0Charles\u00a0and\u00a0David Koch\u00a0and the donor network they have built over the past decade is a significant piece of that. As we have discussed before, Trump would probably benefit from a Democratic takeover of the House. His 2020 chances would be improved for a number of reasons. Swing voters concerned about keeping him in check would be calmed, Republican infighting would be minimized by the end of substantive policy discussions and Trump would have a foil in the new House speaker to run against until Democrats pick their nominee two years from now. While the Democratic House anguished over articles of impeachment and wasted time on showboat-y oversight hearings, Trump could lament their obstruction and radicalism. Conversely, if House Republicans hold on with a diminished majority, they will be expected to govern. Which they would be unable to do. Additionally, the Republicans who remain after a shellacking will be far more pro-Trump. Imagine if 35-40 House Republicans lose this fall. They would overwhelmingly come at the expense of moderate, Trump-skeptical Republicans who represent swing districts where the president is unpopular. The Freedom Caucus might not be able to pick the next speaker of the House, but they\u2019d have a darned strong voice in picking a minority leader.\u00a0 But there are other virtues for Trump in a midterm loss.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s onetime soothsayer\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0is trying to emerge from exile after the president dumped him for his backbiting, leaky ways in the White House. In an\u00a0interview with New York magazine, Bannon outlined his vision of how the GOP needs to dump dissenters and focus on maximizing participation of core supporters \u2013 a mostly male coalition he called \u201cDeplorables Plus.\u201d \u201cThe Republican college-educated woman is done,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. They were going anyway at some point in time. Trump triggers them. This is now the Trump movement.\u201d Now, this may not be a sound approach for winning a midterm election where the districts most at risk for the GOP are districts where Trump did poorly two years ago, but it is a potential model for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. After the refiner\u2019s fire of a midterm defeat burns through the GOP, Trump would be freer to run without so many conservative sticklers grousing about ideological transgressions or behavioral excesses. Trump rightly sees the pro-market, traditional conservatives like the Kochs as a threat to his 2020 ambitions and to his ability to remake the Republican party in his own image and attitude. And such conservatives rightly see that Trump is undoing a multi-generational effort to remake the GOP as a party of Goldwater-Reagan-style classical liberalism. But the idea that conservative, free-marketers are heading for the Democrats or that Democrats would even have them? We say again: Pfffftttttt\u2026 THE RULEBOOK: RUNNING IN PLACE\u201cIt is often, by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes, kept in a state of inaction. Its situation must always savor of weakness, sometimes border upon anarchy.\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 22TIME OUT:\u00a0\u00a0DUMPSTER DIVINGThe Sacramento Bee: \u201cMax Brown\u00a0was picking through an Incline Village dumpster for a community service project when a collection of 1980s cassettes caught his eye. \u2026 Then he noticed the substantial pile of worn books buried beneath them.\u00a0\u2026 It wasn't until six months had passed that Brown offhandedly bent back the cover of one of the books and saw \u2018from the library of\u00a0Thomas Jefferson\u2019 inscribed on the open page. \u2026 After Google searches and Library of Congress inquiries, Brown discovered records suggesting that Jefferson had purchased copies of two of the dumpster-found books in 1818 and had rebound them with a new cover. \u2026 Brown shared this information with Endrina Tay, a staffer at Jefferson's presidential library. \u2026 Tay concluded that two of the books Brown found were indeed Jefferson's own \u2026 But just as much as this revelation gratified Brown, it frustrated him.

Jeb Bush and crushed the state\u2019s sitting Sen. Marco Rubio. Now, as president, he\u2019s asserting his dominance over the Republican party in the nation\u2019s most important swing state as he lands in Tampa on Tuesday to rally for Rep. Ron DeSantis\u2019 surging gubernatorial campaign ahead of Florida\u2019s Aug. 28 primary. Heading into the primary season, DeSantis was little-known to Republican voters. But then Trump tweeted support for him in December and followed with a second tweet in June, sending DeSantis zooming ahead of his primary opponent. \u2026 \u2018Trump is vertically integrating the Republican party,\u2019 said Rep. Matt Gaetz \u2026 \u2018He\u2019s reshaping the Republican party not just in his rhetoric, that story has been written a thousand times, but through a personnel standpoint,\u2019 Gaetz added, calling the Tampa rally \u2018a message to House Republicans.\u2019\u201d Poll: Scott leads Nelson in Fla. Senate race -\u00a0Orlando Sentinel: \u201cGov. Rick Scott has opened up a narrow lead over U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in their Senate race, according to a new Mason-Dixon poll. Scott led Nelson by 47 to 44 percent, a small shift toward Scott from the company\u2019s February poll that showed Nelson with a slight one-point lead. Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, based in Jacksonville and Washington, D.C., conducted the survey of 625 registered Florida voters on July 24 and 25. \u2018The overall trend line is running in Scott\u2019s favor, as his support has slowly but steadily increased over the last 17 months, while Nelson\u2019s has remained static,\u2019 the poll said.\u201d Desantis teaches kids to build \u2018wall\u2019 in campaign ad -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cEven Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis\u2019 kids know he supports President Trump. The GOP gubernatorial hopeful highlighted his Trump-themed talks with his two children in his latest campaign ad.\u00a0\u00a0In one clip, DeSantis plays with blocks with his daughter, coaching her to \u2018build the wall.\u2019 He also tries to teach his daughter to talk by pointing out the \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 words on a Trump campaign sign. \u2026 Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, saying he would be \u201cstrong on borders, tough on crime [and] big on cutting taxes.\u201d Kraushaar: Trump has the golden touch in GOP primaries -\u00a0National Review: \u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt that the Republican Party has been reshaped in President Trump\u2019s image, just look at the impeccable record that his endorsed candidates have achieved in primaries this year. Trump is the GOP\u2019s King Midas, turning even some underwhelming candidates into unbeatable juggernauts\u2014at least among rank-and-file Republican voters. Ever since Trump awkwardly waded into the Alabama Senate race, his endorsees have won nine of the last 10 contested races\u2014including a clean sweep in primaries.\u201d POLL: HELLER, ROSEN IN DEAD HEAT FOR NEVADA SENATEReno Gazette-Journal: \u201cUndecided voters could play a major role in Nevada come November as the race for U.S. Senate and governor are locked in a virtual dead heat. The contest for U.S. Senate between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen is statistically tied in the Silver State, according to a Suffolk University/Reno Gazette Journal poll released Tuesday. Heller is facing a higher unfavorability rating among likely voters. About 41 percent of voters have a negative view of the incumbent while 39 percent have a favorable rating. Meanwhile, 34 percent of voters gave Rosen a favorable rating compared to 27 percent who gave her a negative view. There's another challenge facing the Democratic challenger: name recognition. About 16 percent of likely voters have never heard of Rosen \u2014 higher than any other major candidate on Nevada's ballot this fall.\u201d Poll: Cuomo holds two-to-one lead over Nixon\u00a0-\u00a0Siena College: \u201cWith a little more than six weeks until primary day, Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a two-to-one, 60-29 percent lead over Cynthia Nixon in the battle for the Democratic nomination for Governor \u2026 \u2018Liberal Democrats are strongly with Cuomo, while moderates are overwhelmingly with Cuomo. Nixon trails among men by 26 points and an even larger 34 points with women. Cuomo has the support of three-quarters of black Democrats and two-thirds of Latinos,\u2019 Siena pollster Steven Greenberg said. \u2018More than 80 percent of Democrats supporting Cuomo say they are voting for him more than voting against Nixon, however, 60 percent of Nixon voters say their vote is more against Cuomo than it is for her. Nixon has the anti-Cuomo Democrats but she\u2019ll need to expand on that to make this race competitive.\u2019\u201d Pence stumps for Balderson in Ohio -\u00a0Cleveland Plain Dealer: \u201cIn the final days of an intense campaign for Ohio's 12th Congressional District, Vice President Mike Pence visited Monday to rally support for Republican Troy Balderson. The vice president's appearance in GOP-friendly Licking County illustrates both the competitiveness and the importance given to the Aug. 7 special election among Balderson, Democrat Danny O'Connor and Green Party nominee Joe Manchik. Democrats are hoping to flip the Central Ohio district that they have won exactly once since 1940, giving them momentum as they attempt to recapture the House in the November midterms.\u201d Trumpified GOP flipping Connecticut\u2019s electoral map -\u00a0AP: \u201cIn this year\u2019s election, candidates for statewide office often stump east of the Connecticut River, reaching out to the many blue-collar Republicans who enthusiastically backed Donald Trump in 2016 and now complain they\u2019re fed up with the Democrats at the state Capitol. In Ashford \u2014 a community of 4,300 about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Hartford \u2014 Gerald Nagy, the Republican chairman of the Town Committee, is seeing the shift before his eyes. \u2018Over the last year, since last summer, I have had 10 guest speakers in this room speaking to this committee,\u2019 Nagy said. \u2018The candidates see an opportunity.\u2019 While Democratic candidates in Connecticut and other traditionally blue states have been exploiting Trump\u2019s unpopularity, hoping it will bring out voters, GOP contenders are courting newly discovered pockets of Trump supporters for the Aug. 14 primary. WHITE HOUSE SCALES BACK SHUTDOWN THREAT\u00a0WSJ: \u201cPresident Trump has been threatening to close down the government if Congress doesn\u2019t meet his immigration priorities, but he has privately agreed to put off a potential shutdown or any fight over border wall funding until after the midterm elections, an administration official said Monday \u2026 Mr. Trump supports a plan to avert a shutdown before the election by passing some less-controversial spending bills and a short-term patch that would keep the rest of the government running, the administration official said. \u2018The president made it very clear to the leadership that a fight was coming and he\u2019s done putting it off \u2026 he understands the political practicalities of having to put it off until after the election but it\u2019s coming in early November and early December \u2026 The president sees merit in having this battle after the election.\u2019\u201d GOP leaders yawn at Trump\u2019s shutdown threats -\u00a0Politico: \u201cPresident Donald Trump keeps threatening a government shutdown over his border wall. And Republican leaders keep ignoring his warnings. The congressional GOP is intent on sending Trump a series of government spending bills over the next two months that would fund the vast majority of the federal government. And despite the president\u2019s statement on Monday that he would have \u2018no problem doing a shutdown,\u2019 Republicans seem sure that he\u2019s not talking about a funding lapse right before the midterm elections. \u2026 Asked whether he took Trump's shutdown threats seriously, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) replied: \u2018No. He knows that would be a disaster. I think he wants to throw everything out there so everyone knows it\u2019s an important thing. He knows the game.\u2019\u201d Senate digs through record number of documents on Kavanaugh -\u00a0USA Today: \u201cSenators have begun the deepest dive ever into the writings of a Supreme Court nominee, digging into a record 1 million-plus pages of legal opinions and emails from Brett Kavanaugh's career as a federal judge, White House attorney, and assistant to the prosecutor who investigated former President\u00a0Bill Clinton. The massive volume of Kavanaugh's records dwarfs those of the last two Supreme Court justices to be confirmed \u2013 Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan. Senators reviewed about 182,000 pages of documents on Gorsuch and about 170,000 pages on Kagan. \u2026 Democrats and Republicans are battling over whether they should have access to more as they debate the merits of President Donald Trump's nominee. The fight centers on whether senators should see emails and other documents from Kavanaugh's time as staff secretary to former President\u00a0George W. Bush, from 2003-2006.\u201d JURY SELECTED IN MANFORT TRIAL\u00a0\u00a0WaPo: \u201cA jury of six men and six women has been seated who will decide whether President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is guilty of several felonies. Paul Manafort is on trial in Alexandria federal court on bank- and tax-fraud charges brought by the special counsel investigating Russian involvement in the 2016 election. \u201cNothing you do as an American citizen is more important than jury duty,\u201d Judge T.S. Ellis said. Prosecutors allege he failed to pay taxes on millions he made working for a Russia-backed political party in Ukraine, then lied to get loans when the cash stopped coming in. Potential jurors had already answered written questions regarding their knowledge of the case and their ability to set that knowledge aside. Based on their answers, Ellis rejected more than three dozen people because they had competing obligations or indicated they could not be impartial.\u201d Trump team preparing report to counter Robert Mueller -\u00a0USA Today: \u201cRudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's lawyer, said his team was preparing a \"counter-report\" designed to rebut any accusations that special counsel Robert Mueller makes in his expected report about the Russia investigation. Giuliani told USA TODAY that he believed Mueller's team is \u2018writing the report as we speak.\u2019 Giuliani's own team worked on its \u2018counter-report,\u2019 which he said would be released after his team reviewed whatever Mueller filed with the Justice Department. It's unclear whether the special counsel will file anything with the DOJ. \u2026 Giuliani said he had no firsthand knowledge of Mueller's plans, but\u00a0\u00a0he expected the special counsel to file something by Sept. 1, two months before the midterm elections. Lawmakers struggling to develop a response to Trump-Putin -\u00a0AP: \u201cCongress is producing an unusual outpouring of bills, resolutions and new sanctions proposals to push back at President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to Vladimir Putin, shore up relations with NATO allies and prevent Russian interference in the midterm election. But it remains uncertain if any of their efforts will yield results. Lawmakers are struggling with internal party divisions as well as their own onslaught of proposals as they try to move beyond a symbolic rebuke of Trump\u2019s interactions with the Russian president and exert influence both at home and abroad. And while many Democrats are eager for quick votes, some Republicans prefer none at all.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYJohn Kelly to remain Trump\u2019s chief of staff through 2020\u00a0-\u00a0WaPoTrump isolated from GOP amid talks with Europe\u00a0-\u00a0WashEx \u2018A cloud of weed and French-fry exhaust\u2019:\u00a0Dems contemplate a long strange 2020 trip\u00a0-\u00a0Daily Beast Trump administration mulls a unilateral tax cut for the wealthy\u00a0-\u00a0NYT Grassley, Feinstein probe alleged misconduct at migrant detention centers\u00a0-\u00a0AP Mystery sting targets Shaheen for dirt on Russia sanctions\u00a0-\u00a0Daily Beast Facebook identifies \u2018political influence campaign\u2019 targeting midterms\u00a0-\u00a0NYT Warner lays out plan to protect consumers from big tech\u00a0-\u00a0Axios AUDIBLE: TUNE IN, TURN ON\u2026\u201cI'm thinking, 'Man, I must be dropping acid.'

FROM THE BLEACHERS\u201cI am a die-hard supporter of the President\u00a0through and through. Genuine or not, he stood up for the heartland when no one else would and that goes a long way. I am a teacher who pays dues to a union that doesn\u2019t represent my political interests. My husband works in a steel factory, so to see Trump bucking the old school globalist Republican orthodoxy is a welcome change. The fact that the economy has continued to roar despite the fearmongering of the \u201cfree traders\u201d SHOULD be a recipe for strong GOP elections in 2018 and 2020. But like your column on Friday pointed out, I fear we are living through an age where \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d less and less and elections are more a result of whether or not we just plain old like someone. If the Democrats are as fired up as they appear to be about our President\u2019s anti-PC stance, I think that will be the driving force in any national election while he is our President. What I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s actually not the economy, in my opinion! Does that mean I\u2019m stupid?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Shirley Middledich,\u00a0Terre Haute, Ind. [Ed. note:\u00a0Ha! Our politics fail us when they fail to reflect the baffling, contradictory wonderful complexity of human nature. Before \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d the saying was \u201cpeople vote their pocketbooks.\u201d And while economic concerns may be at the top of the heap of issues for most voters, we still have to pay attention to what\u2019s in the rest of the heap. And, most importantly, the context. Politics, like much in life, depends not on how well you do, but rather how much better you do than expected. Trump has made good use of the claims his detractors made about him in 2016. Democrats argued that a Trump victory would mean nuclear war and an economic depression. Every day with peace and prosperity therefore can be cast as a win for Trump. But every day of beating those expectations bumps the bar a little higher for 2020, something he will have to bear in mind.]\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0] \u201cThe problem with the Dems is they are moving too far left. I\u2019m not a Trump voter, more of independent, but I voted for\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0because I thought at least I knew what she was about and she seemed willing to make some compromises, while Trump was all over the map. I used to vote Republican down the ballot, but the Tea Party movement and some of the far right crazies scared me away. Now the left seem to be doing the same with this Cortez nut who wants to provide free this and that and the other. If Bernie or her runs in 2020, I fear I\u2019ll have no options left, and I\u2019ll probably just go back to voting Republican by default.

But I certainly take your point. Both parties are radicalizing and leaving a growing majority of Americans feeling alienated. I would submit, though, that **ahem** market forces will work to rectify the problem. Either one party or the other will find a way to scoop up the neglected moderate majority or another party will show up to pick all of that low-hanging electoral fruit that both left-wing socialists and right-wing nationalists are leaving on the tree. The other possibility is that events will intervene and force us to grow up and act like Americans again.

ONE UGLY BABYKENS-5: \u201cTwo people have confessed to stealing a shark from the San Antonio Aquarium and concealing it in a stroller. According to the Leon Valley Police Department, a male suspect reached into the tank and removed a gray horn shark from an exhibit. \u2018Security footage indicated that the suspects brought their own net to capture the horn shark\u2019 the aquarium said in a statement. \u2018After grabbing the shark they entered into one of our filter rooms where they poured the bucket of bleach solution that employees used for the disinfection of tools into our cold water exhibit filtration system, causing harm to other wildlife. (If it weren't for the fast acting experienced staff, the bleach would have done more damage.) They then used the sanitation bucket to aide in transportation of the shark into the stroller and hurried up the stairs and out to the parking lot.\u2019\u201d AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026 \u201cThings can\u2019t get any worse, we hear, so why not shake things to their foundation?

Let\u2019s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\u201d Trump tweeted Friday morning. The president\u2019s tweet comes as Florida\u2019s Senate battle between outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott and longtime incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson continues to heat up\u2014as late-arriving ballots in largely Democratic counties are fueling accusations of political shenanigans. Scott and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have brought lawsuits against Broward County, alleging they are hiding critical information about the number of votes cast and counted. The campaign also brought a suit against Palm Beach County, where they charge that the election supervisor there illegally used her own judgment to determine voter intent when reviewing damaged or incorrectly filled-out absentee ballots, while refusing to allow impartial witnesses to monitor the process. On Friday, Nelson's attorney Marc Elias announced that they would file a lawsuit to extend the deadline for vote counting.

            "article_content": "President Trump addresses the press at the White House after Republicans make gains in the Senate but lose control of the House to Democrats. President Trump, in a lengthy and contentious post-midterms press conference with reporters, touted Republicans' expanded Senate majority and declared the party \"defied history\" compared with past elections -- even as the GOP lost control of the House. \u201cIt was a big day yesterday,\u201d the president said during a nearly 90-minute press conference in the East Room of the White House. \u201cIncredible day. And last night, the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House.\u201d Trump emphasized how the number of Republican senators increased under him \u2013 unlike former President Barack Obama, who saw a loss of Democratic senators in his first midterm elections in 2010. That year, Democrats lost six seats in the Senate and lost 63 seats in the House. \u201cThis election marks the largest Senate gains for a president\u2019s party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy\u2019s in 1962,\u201d Trump said. Republicans are on track to gain up to three seats in the Senate, while losing more than 26 seats in the House after Tuesday\u2019s vote. In gubernatorial races, Democrats made steady gains, expanding their power at the state level but nevertheless fell short in key contests where they had hoped to flip Republican seats. Trump, during the press conference, took questions on a variety of topics and blamed the House losses on a combination of factors, including retirements of Republicans and incumbents who didn\u2019t embrace him. \u201cWe also had a staggering number of House retirements, so it\u2019s a little tough,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are seats that could have been held pretty easily.\u201d The president listed a number of Republicans who lost on Tuesday, faulting them for not embracing him and his agenda. Among those he mentioned were Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock, Illinois Rep. Peter Roskam and New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Bob Hugin. \u201cMia Love gave me no love and she lost,\u201d Trump said of the Utah congresswoman. \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u201d The president acknowledged that he could oust some people from\u00a0the administration in the wake of the vote \u2013 though he didn\u2019t list names of those he may fire. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is among those most frequently mentioned as a possible post-midterm departure. \u201cThere\u2019s no great secret,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA lot of administrations make changes after midterms. I will say that for the most part, I\u2019m very very happy with this Cabinet.\u201d The president also said he would consider some Republicans who lost in Tuesday's elections for administration roles but he didn\u2019t specify anyone. The press conference turned testy with reporters at times. After an exchange with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, a frequent media foe, over the migrant caravan and the Russia investigation, the president lashed out at the reporter and told him he treats White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders unfairly. A White House aide tried to yank the microphone from Acosta's hands. \"I think you should let me run the country and let you run CNN,\" Trump told Acosta. \"CNN should be ashamed for himself having you work for them. You are a rude terrible person.\" Trump accused another reporter of a \u201cracist question\u201d for asking if he was \u201cemboldening\u201d white nationalists for referring to himself as \u201cnationalist.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question\u2026why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans?\u201d Trump said, adding that her question was \"so insulting to me.\" Facing the likelihood of investigations from a Democratic-controlled House, Trump said Wednesday that if Democrats pursue investigations, Republicans could return fire from the Senate. Trump said he would adopt a \u00a0\u201cwarlike posture\u201d if Democrats investigate him. \u201cThey can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said. He added, \"I think I\u2019m better at that game than they are, actually, but we\u2019ll find out.\u201d In a humorous moment, a reporter asked Trump if he planned for Vice President Pence to be on his ticket in the 2020 election. Trump then turned toward Pence in the room, and asked, \"Will you be my running mate?\" Pence accepted.",

            "article_content": "President Trump addresses the press at the White House after Republicans make gains in the Senate but lose control of the House to Democrats. America woke up Wednesday as divided as it was the day before the midterm elections, driven even further apart by two political parties that spent the campaign appealing to their base voters rather than trying to unify the country. These strategies may have worked to produce partial wins for each party, but they only further weakened the fabric of a country that craves unity, not division. The person elected president in 2020, I believe, will be the candidate who brings Americans together across party lines. The voters meted out rough justice in a split decision Tuesday. They enabled Democrats to flip control of the U.S. House and replace Republicans as the majority party there. But at the same time, voters gave Republicans a bigger majority in the Senate. House Republicans lost support in part because they made a mess of health care when it became clear that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had no real plan to replace ObamaCare. Ryan then said he would not seek re-election, as did 40 other Republican House members. Yet Ryan has continued on as speaker to serve out the remainder of his term, staying on as a message-less leader of House Republicans. Voters made clear Tuesday they had had enough of the gridlock-creating divisions in the chamber that Ryan has been unable to end. In the Senate, it was the Democrats running for president who overreached and lost their credibility through their unbridled opposition and character assassination leveled at now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. The Democrats faced the wrath of the voters for their excessive partisanship. And despite a roaring economy benefitting all Americans, President Trump also chose to appeal to his base rather than to the entire electorate as he campaigned for GOP candidates around the country. The president made the decision to double-down on his campaign against illegal immigration to bring out his core supporters, while the Democrats hit on health-care and anti-Trumpism to bring out their base. President Trump stumped in Republican strongholds, while President Obama traveled to urban Democratic areas to campaign for Democratic candidates. The strategy of both was to motivate their supporters to cast ballots, rather than trying to win over new supporters. Once they become the majority party in the House in January, the Democrats will gain the power of the purse, plus subpoena power to investigate President Trump and his administration. And with a larger GOP majority in the Senate, the president will now have an easier time getting his nominations of high-ranking federal officials and judges confirmed. This includes a new attorney general to replace Jeff Sessions, who resigned Wednesday at the request of\u00a0\u00a0President Trump after frequently incurring the president's public wrath. The attorney general also has subpoena power, plus Justice Department attorneys and the FBI under his or her control. The day after the midterm elections, everyone emerged as both a winner and a loser. But here\u2019s a thought: might the Democrats and Republicans work together to make both parties \u2013 and more importantly the country as a whole \u2013 winners? In the wake of the midterms, our elected representatives in Congress and the president are faced with a choice. They can give us two years of gridlock, House impeachment efforts against the president, and escalating rhetoric and fights from both directions. Or, members of Congress and the president can call at least a partial truce and realize that it is in the best interest of Democrats, Republicans and the American people if they dedicate themselves to making progress for our country, rather than to pursuing partisan advantage 365 days of the year. A Democrat like Rep. John Gottheimer, D-N.J., who is co-head of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, easily won re-election Tuesday in a solidly Republican district because he reached across party lines to find compromises. This is what 80 percent of voters have said consistently they want their members of the House and Senate to do \u2013 replace conflicts and confrontation with compromise and cooperation. The same in true when you ask voters about President Trump. In the last Harvard Caps/Harris Poll, the president had a 57 percent approval rating on the economy \u2013 but only 27 percent of the electorate likes him. President Trump may be growing the economy and disrupting Washington, but he has a huge \u201cpersonality deficit\u201d that is dragging him down and costing him the across-the-board support that a president with such good economic numbers would usually get. The strong economy got the president through the midterms, propping him up despite a 60 percent negative opinion poll rating for Republicans. But if the Democrats nominate a presidential candidate from the center in 2020 \u2013 someone without the kind of baggage that Hillary Clinton brought to the presidential race two years ago \u2013 the president would likely face a crushing defeat. However, the Democrats have their vulnerabilities as well. Only 27 percent of the country is even liberal. And so the Democrats\u2019 lurch to the left and obstructionism \u2013 known as \u201cthe resistance\u201d \u2013 is also creating a disconnect with what the electorate wants. That prevented Democrats from winning the kind of victories Tuesday they had hoped for two years after the election of Trump. Democrats also have a 60 percent negative rating and so they are a reluctant rather than enthusiastic choice of too many voters. President Trump needs to realize that his rhetoric and style have to change if he wants to keep his job for another six years. Democrats must abandon their plans for endless investigations and focus instead on making deals on infrastructure, criminal justice reform, health care and immigration. Whoever changes direction and heads for the center over the extremes has an opportunity to capture the hearts and minds of 60 percent of the voters rather than earning the enmity of those voters. Moving toward the center would be tough choices for both Democrats and Republicans given the dynamics in each party right now. But imagine if both President Trump and the Democrats did the right thing here \u2013 not only would they both have a better chance at winning elections, but they also would be making America a better, stronger country in the process.",

On 'The Story,' Kristian Saucier speaks out about the double standard. This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" July 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SANDRA SMITH, GUEST HOST: Good evening, Jon. Thank you. Breaking tonight with a fierce battle brewing in the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance with the Senator who could make or break the confirmation process, making a stunning announcement. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" Republican Susan Collins, said the White House has told her that it has expanded its shortlist of potential candidates beyond the 25 that have been publicly disclosed. It comes as Collins and others have expressed concerns about the names that are out there, particularly when it comes to the issue of abortion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE: A candidate for this important position who would overturn Roe v. Wade would not be acceptable to me, because that would indicate an activist agenda that I don't want to see a judge have. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: So far, the White House is staying tight-lipped on who these other judges might be. But the President did reveal he is already -- he's already met with a number of the candidates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I interviewed and met with four potential justices of our great Supreme Court. They are outstanding people, they are really incredible people in so many different ways, academically, and every other way. And I had a very, very interesting morning. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is live at the White House with more on this, this evening. Good evening, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sandra, good to see you. President Trump is moving rapidly to get those interviews done because he wants to get the clock started so he can get it, make it harder and harder for Democrats to try and justify any delay in terms of confirmation beyond the midterm election. So, what we're seeing is the president likely to get his nominee through in the end, because the precedent has been set for just a simple majority. The moderate Republicans who you saw there, who support abortion rights could foil that plan. That's why in his exclusive interview with Fox's Maria Bartiromo, the president stressed he will not ask any candidate about Roe v. Wade at all. He wants to try and secure yes votes from those two pro-choice Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. We just heard from Murkowski, says she's keeping her cards close to the vest for now. Collins indicated she'll oppose anyone who would vote to change existing law, and abortion administration officials revealed today that the White House Counsel Don McGahn, has been detailed to shepherd the eventual nominee through the Senate. It's interesting because you mentioned, Collins is saying it's McGahn who told her that because of her concerns, the administration is expanding its list beyond the 25 names of potential court picks that the president unveiled in the campaign. But the administration has to be careful not to stray too far from that list of more conservative names if they go to moderate they run the risk of upsetting evangelical conservatives who have stuck with the president and love that list. Sarah Sanders would not answer whether the president wants to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and the president suggested the list is actually getting smaller, not bigger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: I think the president should not feel bound by that list. And instead, I should seek out recommendations to ensure that he gets the best possible person. TRUMP: I'll be meeting with two or three more and we'll make a decision on the United States Supreme Court. The new justice that'll be made over the next few days and we'll be announcing it on Monday, and I look forward to that. I think the person that is chosen will be outstanding. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: Now, given the possibility of a no-vote from a Republican like Collins, on top of the fact that Republican John McCain has not been voting at all, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may need to reel in some Democrats. Particularly, the three moderates who supported Justice Neil Gorsuch, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin. As for the push by Liberal Democrats like Chuck Schumer, the Senate Leader, to try and delay this passed the midterms. We should point out that factually, four of the last eight justices were confirmed in a midterm election. Sure it's going to be hard for Democrats to make the case to delay this beyond the midterms. Sandra? SMITH: Ed, thanks for setting it up for us. Are we going to see the president back away from his campaign promise to appoint anti-abortion judges? Judge Andrew Napolitano is our Fox News senior judicial analyst. We called on him to answer that question for us tonight. How important is this issue going to be, and how are we going to see it play out this week in the president's pick? JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, if the president chooses somebody from the list of 25 which is he has repeatedly said he will do. Then, Senator Collins is going to be disappointed because everybody on that list is pro-life. Now, the president is careful in his choice of words. He's not going to say to the five or six or seven that he finally interviews, \"Hey, are you interested in overturning Roe v. Wade?\" He wouldn't be that direct with them. The choice of those names as a combination of outsourcing and the White House legal counsel office giving -- getting enough background about these 25 that the president and his supporters are satisfied that they are the Scalia like who might now say, Gorsuch like person that he promised throughout the campaign and throughout his first year and a half as president that he would nominate. If he does nominate somebody that Senator Collins doesn't like as that Henry just explained, they're going to have to find a few Democrats who want to attach themselves to the president's coattails this November, to vote in favor of the nominee. SMITH: The interview process, what was your reaction when you heard the president in that interview with Maria Bartiromo, say he won't be asking the candidates about Roe v. Wade? NAPOLITANO: I think the president is concerned with how the person thinks and what their attitude is about the role of the judiciary in our lives. So, I have been suggesting to the president and others, he ought to be looking for something called judicial humility. This is not personal humility, but this is a recognition that when Madison wrote the Constitution, he intentionally put the judiciary after the president and the president after the Congress. The Congress writes the laws. The Congress and the president set policy. The judiciary doesn't set policy, it refers to the policy choices of the other two branches of the government. If he finds a nominee with that attitude, plus conservative instincts, well, that's a home run for him. Because then, he will have accomplished his goal of appointing someone who is like Scalia, which he said many, many times during the campaign. SMITH: You know the White House -- (CROSSTALK) NAPOLITANO: But the -- but the Democrats -- I got to finish this, will make abortion the issue. Because they are wedded to this issue, and because they know that about 67 percent of the public thinks that some form of abortion ought to be lawful. SMITH: You know, Sarah Sanders at the White House briefing this afternoon was pressed by a reporter, why is the president rushing this? Why July 9th? That's Monday, that's a week from today. She said look, this list was come up with two years ago. NAPOLITANO: She's right about that and the president has said -- (CROSSTALK) SMITH: Do you think he knows who it is right now? NAPOLITANO: No, I don't. But I think that Ed Henry was right that the president will have the advantage once that name is out there. If it looks like he can't decide and this goes on for another month or so. Then, it's going to look as though, there was some weakness behind the choice, that's the last thing the president wants to convey. He wants to convey strength and certainty behind this nominee, and that's what I think will come on Monday. SMITH: What does this battle look like this week? Set it up for us, judge. NAPOLITANO: It's going to be tough if the person is really seriously pro- life because you will -- you will lose Senators Murkowski. Murkowski and Collins. SMITH: Collins. NAPOLITANO: And then, you'll have to get one of those three Democrats. John McCain, regrettably won't be voting, so, it's going to be very, very tight. I wish it weren't a gun pro-life, but I wish it weren't on just one issue. Abortion is a very small part of what the Supreme Court does. And if he appoints someone who's in their 40s or 50s, that person could serve for a long time. And we need to examine their thinking on a broad array of things. The presumption is that the president gets his person. And that person doesn't have to prove themselves to the Senate. Rather, the Senators who don't want that person has to dislodge the candidate. SMITH: Huge implications for this presidency. Huge implications for the country. NAPOLITANO: Yes. SMITH: Judge Napolitano, thank you. NAPOLITANO: Always a pleasure. SMITH: All right. Well, NBC's Chuck Todd, making this observation yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK TODD, POLITICAL DIRECTOR, NBC NEWS: The announced retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this week, helped make one political reality clear. Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning and the Democrats right now are reeling. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Joining us now, Ned Ryun a former White House staffer under President George W. Bush, and founder and CEO of American Majority. And Juan Williams, co-host of \"The Five\" and Fox News political analyst. Juan, that was -- that was an interesting concession on his part if you -- if you can call it that. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, that you mean that the president's winning, Sandra. SMITH: Yes. WILLIAMS: Well, I don't think it's any question. I think you have the left literally in a frantic state over the idea that the Supreme Court will have another conservative judge and that potentially, it would become a rubber stamp for a conservative agenda including doing away with abortion rights. SMITH: Well, Ned, I'm sure you too, are going to give us a sampling of the battle that lies ahead in the upcoming days. What are your expectations from the president? NED RYUN, FOUNDER, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Well, my expectation is Trump understands fully what's at stake. He knows that does evangelical and Catholic base broke late for him. And they broke late on one issue as the Supreme Court. And he rewarded them by giving them, Neil Gorsuch. And I think Trump understands if he's going to turn the evangelical and Catholic voters into foot soldiers in 2020, he needs to give them another Neil Gorsuch. And I -- you know, the base really wants a 40 something federal Society judge. And I think, Trump also understands a couple of more things, Sandra. He understands as a master brander, if he does this correctly, this will be the Trump court. He gets to rebrand this court for posterity for at least a generation. And he also understands that if he does this correctly, he will put the Supreme Court out of the reach of the left for a generation or more. And at the end of the day, this could be his most singular accomplishment as president. So, he's fully aware of what's at stake and he understands what his base wants. SMITH: And they'll be able to get him someone over the finish line, Juan? WILLIAMS: At this point, you'd have to say the odds favor President Trump and the Republicans. They have the vote, Sandra. And I don't see that obviously, you don't have the filibuster McConnell, did away with the filibuster on this. And he blamed Chuck Schumer in the like but he was his action. I think, the key here, though, Sandra, is politics. And I think that's why you see people talking about stare decisis, you know. The idea that you adhere to precedent. Is President Trump going to put in somebody there off the Federalist Society list of potential nominees who was about undoing precedent as we know it specifically on Roe v. Wade? What we have seen from Neil Gorsuch is he was willing to go in, and I think it's two weeks ago, undo a decision with regard to agency fees or dues paid to union members. Undo that, and the question then becomes so, are we -- if we create a Trump court? As Ned was saying, are we really just going to undo all the precedent, all the standards that we have adhered to as a country? Those - - that dues status stability? RYUN: But -- SMITH: Ned, respond to that. Ned? RYUN: But, but, but, but, Sandra, I think terrible decisions don't make for a good precedent. And there are many of us on this side that feel 45 years ago. It was a very activist -- judicial activist decision that path that did Roe v. Wade. And we think it should be overturned, pushed back to the states, and if people want abortion on demand, they can go through the constitutional amendment process. But I will say this, Sandra. I think, the one thing that's going to come into play, those 10 red state Democrats that are up for re-election in 2018. They have to fight or they're going to be in trouble with their left base. If they fight too hard, they're going to offend the blue-collar working class. And I think, they're going to find themselves in a very, very tough position. So, I'm very curious to see what those 10 red state Democrats Senators do on this whole nomination fight. WILLIAMS: You know, I think Ned should be honored for being honest that the agenda is to undo Roe v. Wade. I just got to say, Ned, two-thirds of the American people support Roe v. Wade. SMITH: All right, so, Collins made her point very clear that she will not support a nominee that is going to do that. So, is it going to come down to those two Republican women, Ned? RYUN: But I -- But I will point out this, Sandra. The thing that Collins' said that was interesting, she doesn't want to back an activist judge. And again, exhibit A for judicial activism in a lot of our minds is Roe v. Wade. I do think that there will be some Democrats coming into play if Murkowski and Collins, say they're not going to vote for whatever Trump puts up. I do think that there might be some Democrats. Obviously, we saw three Democrats vote for Gorsuch. I understand that the dynamics are a little different right now. But again, if these guys are interested in self-preservation and winning reelection, you actually might be able to get a couple votes to come -- to come Trump's way. SMITH: All right. So, Juan, you said this is all about politics. Look forward, past next week, what are the implications of this decision on the 2018 midterm elections? WILLIAMS: Well, it is all about a base. You know, can you energize one base or another? RYUN: That's right. WILLIAMS: And Ned said -- Ned said, the evangelicals turned late for Trump. I think they turned for Trump and they have never looked back despite Stormy Daniels and all the rest, Sandra. And going towards the midterms, if it's done before November, the question is, does that SAP energy from the Trump base? Or if it's done after November, does it fire up the anti-Trump base? Because it's -- this election is a referendum this midterm, a referendum on Donald Trump. SMITH: All right, final word to you Ned? RYUN: No, I agree. I mean, I think this is a very interesting situation the Juan's laid out. Again, the timing of it all, I do think it'll be done before. October before the Supreme Court comes back into session. I do think, you can fire up the base and I think it can give the vision for the future. If Republicans keep the Senate, I am convinced that Trump's going to get at least one if not two more nominations and you want to have a few more votes in the Senate. So, I think regardless the Republican base is going to get fired up for the midterms in November. SMITH: All right, well, you guys are fired up. Thanks to both of you for joining us on this lovely hot and Monday evening in New York City, that's for sure. Thanks for sure. WILLIAMS: Happy Fourth of July there. SMITH: You too, to both of you. Well, still ahead, why the stunning victory of a Democratic socialist, tapped to run for Congress could be just the beginning of a socialist surge across America? Plus, brand new court documents reveal, what some are calling a stunning lack of effort by the FBI to find any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in that e-mail probe. Kristian Saucier, a former Navy sailor imprisoned for his handling of classified information. So, the double standard is ridiculous. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTIAN SAUCIER, FORMER NAVY SAILOR: You know, these people aren't above the law. But apparently, they are. And I'm going to fight that until -- and you know, as long as there's a breath in me, I'm going to fight that. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: Breaking tonight, shocking new detail surfacing about the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe and just how little the FBI actually worked to dig up all the dirt it could on Hillary and her top aides. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with more on the newly unsealed documents. Trace? TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi Sandra, these federal court documents show that in 2015 FBI agents did, in fact, present a federal judge with an e-mail from July 2009 when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The e- mail had been forwarded to the personal Gmail account of then Clinton advisor Jake Sullivan. And not only did it contain top-secret information, it reportedly involves sensitive satellite images pertaining to the launch of ballistic missiles by North Korea. Based on that, a judge gave the FBI broad authority to search every e-mail in Sullivan's account going back years. The documents also show the FBI used broad subpoenas to investigate Hillary Clinton's personal assistant Huma Abedin, her lawyer and top advisor Cheryl Mills and to gain greater access to Clinton's personal e-mail server. But the documents also confirmed three things Republicans have been complaining about for years. First, the FBI did not use grand jury subpoenas to interview witnesses including State Department employees, those who set up Clinton's private e-mail server and those who had knowledge of the e-mails so in other words all of the 72 witnesses testified voluntarily and none of them was under oath or had their testimony recorded. The FBI also did not obtain search warrants for the laptops used by Clinton's attorneys Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. Instead, the e- mails on those laptops were secured through consent agreements. Even lead FBI agent Peter Strzok who the I.G. did conclude was biased was pushing to use more aggressive investigative measures against both Mills and Samuelson. And finally the court documents show the FBI did not try to obtain the personal phones and devices of Clinton's top aides who sometimes also use private e-mail for State Department work and use private devices to communicate with Clinton while she was the Secretary of State even though Republicans have serious issues with things the FBI did not do in regards to the Clinton e-mail investigation. The I.G. says those are judgment calls that are within the discretion of FBI agents to make. Sandra? SMITH: Trace Gallagher, thank you. My next guest is a former Navy sailor who served a year in prison for taking classified photos of his ship. He says that while he was under investigation by the FBI agents raided his house at gunpoint, tailed him and interrogate his entire family including his grandmother. He says his treatment is a clear indication of the FBI's double standard when it comes to Hillary Clinton. Former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier who was pardoned by President Trump earlier this year joins us now. Kristian, thank you for coming on the program tonight. SAUCIER: Thanks for having me on, Sandra. SMITH: Well, our audience just heard that entire story and what we learned from those unsealed documents, what did you think when you first got a look at those? SAUCIER: Well, I mean, I think it's you know, any of us that have been watching this case as its unfolding now we see that in fact, the fix was in. You know, they were making sure that no matter what happened Hillary Clinton wasn't going to get prosecuted and nobody around her was because they would have folded on her and it's shameful. SMITH: We've been following your story for quite some time. I know I spoken multiple times to you on this program and I haven't talked to you since the release of that I.G. report which confirms as Trace just laid out for us the findings of these documents that they did not use grand jury subpoenas to demand testimony from top Hillary Clinton aides. They did not obtain search warrants to gain access to the laptops Clinton's lawyers used to review her e-mails. They did not seek personal phones and similar devices used by her top aides. Very stark contrast to the treatment that you and your family received. SAUCIER: Oh it's apples and oranges, you know. You know, the treatment that I received, it was obviously. They were going after me and you know never once have I said what I did what I did wasn't wrong. I've accepted responsibility and I think it's shameful that Hillary Clinton and her aides just won't accept responsibility. I pled guilty. I didn't go to trial. You look at even reality winner. You know, she made a mistake, pled guilty. Why are you know, her and I being held to this different standard than James Comey who leaked information to the press to benefit himself you know, and Hillary Clinton who mishandled classified information at the highest level. Where I mishandled low-level classified information and they threatened me and intimidated me for four years and harassed my family and finally put me away in prison for a year. You know, I just want the rest of them to be held to the same standard. Nowhere in that justice code have I found you know, addendum that says well if your name is Hillary Clinton or James Comey this law doesn't apply to you, so why isn't it? I think all American people should be asking that question. SMITH: The word intent comes up on multiple occasions both with your situation and the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. How is that word treated and used differently in both cases do you see? SAUCIER: Well, there is no requirement for intent under that statute. You know, simply mishandling classified information even if it's a mistake, if you knew better you are violating that law. And Hillary Clinton knew better. All of her aides knew better. All these people that they gave immunity to knew better. So I guess the question stands why did nobody get prosecuted? You know, why are they tossing out immunity deals like it's Christmas and nobody's being held to account? How can we expect, the average American citizen to follow the law if the people that are supposed to be upholding the law aren't following it themselves? You know, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, all these people are violating our trust and government institutions and you know, nothing is being done to them. Nobody's holding them to account. They're not holding themselves responsible. It's shameful. SMITH: Lastly, how was your lawsuit, Kristian. How are things going with that? SAUCIER: Well, it's been a difficult uphill battle. You know, my lawyer, they came after him and they took his license to practice law so now I'm going to have to represent myself in court so I've had to redo the paperwork but I will be submitting it very soon and you're going to see plenty of defendants on there that are well-known names because all these people need to be held accountable. This lawsuit is not about anything other than pointing out the double standard of justice and the fact that these people apparently are above the law but they shouldn't be. And you know, if I have to fight it in court, that's what I'm going to do. Kristian Saucier, thank you for coming on and telling your story. SAUCIER: Thank you, Sandra. Thank you for having me on. SMITH: All right. Well, still to come, police arrest a man who threatened to chop up Senator Rand Paul and his family with an ax. And still, Maxine Waters calling for attacks on Trump supporters plus this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: Democratic socialism is about -- really the value for me is that I believe that in a modern moral and wealthy society no person in America should be too poor to live. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Next, Jonah Goldberg is here to explain why a policy once considered outrageous might actually be a reality. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: The definition of Democratic socialism to me, again, is the fact that in a modern moral and wealthy society, no American should be too poor to live and to me that means every working-class American in this country should have access to dignified health care. It means you should be able to send your kids to college and trade school if they so choose. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: That vision of Democratic socialism heralded by Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, who stunned the political world last week and put a giant spotlight on socialism with her defeat of the number four Democrat in the house during her primary in New York's 14th district. And she is not alone in her ideas as young progressives are increasingly seen embracing the platform. The New York Times hailing in a new op-ed, quote, \"The millennial socialists are coming.\" Jonah Goldberg is senior editor for National Review and a Fox News contributor and author of \"Suicide of the West, How the Rebirth of Tribalism, Populism Nationalism and Identity Politics is Destroying American Democracy.\" Jonah, good evening to you. JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, NATIONAL REVIEW: Hey, it's great to be here. SMITH: Why-- (CROSSTALK) GOLDBERG: I guess for the paperback I can add socialism to the subtitle. SMITH: There you go. So why is it that the millennial generation is embracing socialism? GOLDBERG: Well, I mean, this has been a trend in the polls for a while now and some of it has to do with the sort of -- the Cold War is so far behind us in the rearview mirror that socialism has lost its connotation or association with the rivers of blood that were spilled in its name for most of the 20th century. That's part of it. Part of it as Bernie Sanders had a really successful run sort of browsing the base of the Democratic Party talking about socialism. The problem is, is the way Bernie Sanders defined socialism and the way, you know, Ocasio- Cortez defined socialism is it's basically I'm in favor of all nice things and I don't think that we should -- economic shouldn't be about trade-offs. It should be about cost. It should be about what Margaret Thatcher said when she said, you know, the problem with socialism is eventually run out of other people's money and the particular problem with her socialism here is that she is also basically an open borders socialist. And he problem is you can't have, when you welcome socialism or just a really aggressive welfare state, you can't have a view that everybody is welcome here no matter what. Anybody who gets here has the rights and privileges to get all of this money and all these goodies and still have any chance of giving out anything like these goodies. (Inaudible) have pointed out a long time ago that you need to have some borders even if you're going to -- if you wanted to make socialism work. SMITH: And Michelle Goldberg's piece from the New York Times, the millennial socialists are coming, she writes one recent survey shows that 61 percent of Democrats between 18 and 34 view socialism positively. \"They have no memory of the widespread failure of communism, but the failures of capitalism are all around them.\" Jonah? GOLDBERG: You know, it looks about that maybe it's because I just wrote a book about this, but the failures of capitalism are not all around them. Maybe the failures of local machine politicians are all around them. Maybe the failures of sort of an atrophied political system are all around them, but the simple fact is that almost most Americans -- certainly huge chunks of most Americans are in the global 1 percent. We live right now in the greatest period of poverty alleviation in all of human history all around the world and it's not because of socialism and is not because of the U.N. It's because of these ideas about liberal Democratic capital. And part of the problem is that we live in this culture where we don't teach people to be grateful for the incredible bounty that capitalism provides. Instead, we teach people to be resentful and entitled, which is the opposite of gratitude. We tell them that the system owes them things, that they have positive liberties and the government has to give them all sorts of things simply because we are entitled to them. We are not entitled to these things. SMITH: Jonah, so based on the outcome of that race in which a 28-year-old Democrat socialist won, what role do you think socialism is going to play in the 2018 midterm elections? GOLDBERG: Well, you could argue that this is a great gift to the Republicans and to Donald Trump because the way the Republican Party works right now, and Donald Trump is very good about this, is he points out to the most extreme, the most ridiculous, Maxine Waters comes to mind examples and says that the entire party, that's the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi and a lot of the Democratic leadership don't seem well-equipped to author a robust argument against socialism because they don't want to alienate millennials. They are sort of caught in this bind. I don't think that this one district in New York is scalable in terms of running on Democratic socialism or socialism in most of these other districts around the country. The problem is you can say she wants to get rid of ICE, she's for socialism, this is what the Democrats want. The senior leadership of the Democratic Party isn't explaining very well that they are really opposed to this, so do you really want to vote for these people? It's probably a pretty compelling political message. SMITH: We will look for the edit to the paperback edition of the book, Jonah Goldberg. GOLDBERG: Thanks. SMITH: Good to have you on the program tonight. Thank you. Well, coming up, Maxine Waters not backing down on her calls to harass Trump administration officials despite backlash of those within her own party. Wait until you hear what she is saying now. Plus, a bombshell new allegation about what the Obama administration gave to Iran in addition to the $400 million in cash to make that nuclear deal in 2015. Y.J. Fischer personally helped implement the Iran deal. She is here with her reaction next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We've just learned about $400 million ransom paid. Now Obama said it has nothing to do with it, it's another lie. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: The settlement could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran. So there was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Well, that was President Obama back in 2016 admitting his administration secretly paid Iran $400 million in cash. That coincidentally occurred on the same day Iran released for American hostages. Now the chairman of Iran's parliament claims the Obama administration also granted 2500 U.S. citizenships to families and friends of the Iranian government. Joining me now is Y.J. Fischer, former assistant coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation, who personally negotiated the Iran deal. She joins us now. Y.J. you helped with this deal in place. What can you tell us about this claim being made? Y.J. FISCHER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT DIPLOMAT: Well, it's good to be here. So the first thing to say is it's false. The claim is totally false. And if you are wondering why we are seeing a story like this come out of Iran, it's because it's a sign that the daggers are out for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. When President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal he really weakened Rouhani and he ensure that Rouhani would never be able to deliver economically for the people of Iran. This story that we are seeing today is designed to drive home with the disgruntled population in Iran just how elitist and out of touch Rouhani is. And I would just say that when President Trump pulled out of the deal and he weakened Rouhani, I think for some in the Trump administration, that was the goal. They actually thought that this would be good and help to bring about the kind of regime change that they want to see in Iran. And I really-- (CROSSTALK) SMITH: What concessions did President Obama make? FISCHER: Very few. I mean, one of the things that's not appreciated is just how hard a bargain the Obama administration drove and they got a great deal. And we see that -- I know that might sound hollow to -- I know that might sound strange to a lot of your viewers, but we are seeing that as President Trump moves forward with North Korea, we are seeing just how hard these kinds of deals are. I mean, you see the swamp-- (CROSSTALK) SMITH: And I know. I know in your piece you feel that eventually the Trump administration based on their experience with North Korea will come around to what the Obama administration did with Iran. You know, the days leading up to Trump's withdraw this Iran deal, You wrote about this in the Los Angeles Times. Trump is going easy on Iran. You said he's actually going easy on Iran by focusing so intently on the nuclear deal that he has lost sight of a larger strategy that would effectively contain Iran in the region. What was your point? What are you trying to say there? FISCHER: Actually President Trump just drove this home the other month when he said now we look at Iran and they're not a treat anymore. Look at Syria, look at Yemen, we don't have to worry about Iran. I'm still worried about Iran in the region and I l'd imagine most of your viewers are as well. We need a strong effort to push back on Iran's activities across the Middle East and we don't see Trump doing that. He's been single-mindedly focused on tearing up the Iran nuclear deal than he-- (CROSSTALK) SMITH: So I know you are saying this claim is false. I want to be clear about where this claim is coming from. The chairman of Iran's parliamentary nuclear committee and he is also a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee. And I know you tried to answer this question before about why these reports are out there, but why would he make this claim? FISCHER: Well, he's a hard-liner and the hardliners really see this as this moment -- this is their moment to take over the presidency. Rouhani is weaker than he's ever been before. There are protests in the streets and they want regime change in Iran as well and they want to replace Rouhani with someone even more hard-line. SMITH: As far as a response to this, one State Department spokesperson who I know you know who was also involved in this deal, Marie Harf, she said this sounds like totally made up B.S. But asked about the claim the State Department says we are not going to comment on every statement by Iranian officials. The Department of Homeland Security declining to comment, a representative from Obama homeland security, Jeh Johnson, could not be reached for comment. So we are getting your reaction because you were intimately involved in that deal and good to have you on the program tonight. FISCHER: Well, thank you very much. SMITH: Thank you. Next, Maxine Waters not backing down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: I know that there are those who are talking about censuring me, talk about kicking me out of Congress, talking about shooting me. All I have to say is this. If you shoot me, you better shoot straight. There's nothing like a wounded animal. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Bill Bennett is here next on the impact of this lack of civility on our society as a whole. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Were you surprised to have the leadership of your own party come out of this and essentially called you un-American? WATERS: Well, you know, I was surprised that Chuck Schumer, you know, reached into the House to do that. I've not quite seen that done before, but, you know, one of the things I recognized being an elected official is in the final analysis, you know, leadership like Chuck Schumer's will do anything that they think is necessary to protect their leadership. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: California Democrat Maxine Waters now taking aim at some within her own party who say she has gone too far with her fiery rhetoric calling for the harassment of Trump administration officials and their supporters. Now Washington Post blogger and MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin is one of many echoing her sentiment there to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER RUBIN, CONTRIBUTOR, MSNBC: We are not going to let these people go through life unscathed. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has no right to live a life of no fuss, no muss after lying to the press and for inciting against the press. These people should be made uncomfortable and I think that's a life sentence frankly. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMITH: Bill Bennett is host of the Bill Bennett podcast and a Fox News contributor. And Bill, you and I and the audience just listen to that together and we know that there have been a feud over civility in politics, but has it come to this? BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it's pretty bad. A little unhinged. I wrote some years ago in the Wall Street Journal that we are in danger of losing our guardrails and I think the guardrails are very close to coming off. It's overheated, it's mostly overheated on the left and I think -- I'm afraid to say this, but I have to say it, it's going to get hotter before it gets cooler with the Supreme Court nomination coming up. The left believes in some way that it owns the court and this is somehow an act of theft for conservatives to think they can get a majority for what looks like a 30-year majority. SMITH: I heard Brit Hume in the last hour describing it as a bloodbath that we will see as we approach the named person by the president, the nominee. But as far as civility coming back to politics, are you optimistic that we can come back to that, or are we witnessing a new normal in politics? BENNETT: I don't think it's a new normal. We've had this before. Think back exactly 50 years ago, 1968. I called it in my book and it's horrible. It's the horrible year, the year of the horribles. Martin Luther King was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There were riots in the streets. Hundreds of people were killed in those rights. The campuses were blowing up and we survived it and overcome it -- overcame it. Things settled in. But I think this will be an intense period. The good news is that the American people don't like this and they would prefer things to settle down. They are turned off by it, they are bothered by it. I would make a suggestion. And I think I don't think I'm the only one. The president can take the lead here. Now Donald Trump is going to be Donald Trump. He's a tough guy, he's a direct guy, he's a straightforward guy, but I have detected in his tweets and his interviews, you know, somewhat less hot tempered and incendiary. He can, I think, get great political advantage by being the guy who is in business as opposed to the monkey business or the funny business that's going on with all these political extremists. SMITH: You also have-- (CROSSTALK) BENNETT: Or political extremism. SMITH: You also have, as we talk about the Supreme Court and filling that vacancy, you have a message to the president about his pick. You say pick a woman. Why are you pushing for this? BENNETT: Yes. No, look, I'm not in favor of, you know, selection by gender, but all things considered, he should pick the most qualified person, but I review this list and I know this list and I know some of these people. They are extremely well-qualified and if it comes down to it, and Amy Barrett or Allison Eid in one or two of the guys, Kavanaugh or one of the others, I would go with a woman. For a couple of reasons. I think it would be good to have a female conservative on the court. If you've got female liberals, three of them, on the court and it's easy to parody, isn't it, if you have another white male conservative and you say well, they are the white males and we are the liberal females. Put a conservative female on there. I think that mixes it up and I think it's a good idea. And by the way, the qualification for some of these women are extraordinary and every bit as good as the male. SMITH: Interesting stuff. And lastly, I've got to ask you about this in the context of the civility feud in politics at the moment. Senator Rand Paul, sitting U.S. senator says his family was threatened in and he has issued a statement saying that capitol police have issued an arrest warrant. This man have threatened to kill me and chop up my family with an ax. He said it's just horrendous that we have to deal with things like this. It is horrible for all of us to look at that as being the current state of U.S. policies. BENNETT: Yes. I know it's particularly bad in his case. Remember he was tackled by his next-door neighbor, one rib shattered. They shot at him in that baseball game and now he gets this threat. Look, you've got to have unanimously on one thing, leadership in the party has to say there's no more of this, we cannot have this, we cannot stand for this. We will break this and that has to stop. And again, I think it's a great opportunity for the president, let Trump be Trump, but let Trump bring the degrees, bring it down by a couple of degrees. I think -- I think he is doing this because I think the office is in some way tempering him, not changing him, not changing the core convictions, but I think the burdens of the job are making him a more serious person and I think that's to his advantage. Let these people scream, he go about the business of improving the economy, altering foreign relations and the like. There's opportunity here in this crisis as the Greeks would say. SMITH: It's an interesting message, and especially just now, a few days out, one week from when the president says he will be announcing his Supreme Court pick. It will be quite a week. Bill Bennett, thank you. Good to see you. BENNETT: You bet. Thank you. SMITH: More of the story next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SMITH: That's our story. Thank you so much for joining us. What did you think of the show tonight? Send me your thoughts, @SandraSmithFox. And I will see you tomorrow morning live in America's newsroom from 9 a.m. to noon.

            "article_content": "Republican Senate hopeful Bob Hugin is calling for change in the Garden State and closing in on Democrat incumbent Sen. Bob Menendez. President Trump endorsed New Jersey GOP Senate candidate Bob Hugin Tuesday, in an 11th-hour effort to drive Republican voters to the polls in key states. \u201cBob Hugin, successful all of his life, would be a Great Senator from New Jersey. He has my complete and total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Bob,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon. The president, who has made a slew of endorsements in gubernatorial, congressional and Senate races, had yet to endorse the Republican candidate from New Jersey, who is in an uphill fight against\u00a0incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. It's not clear whether Hugin even welcomes the presidential support. The wealthy pharmaceutical executive\u00a0has sought to distance himself from Trump throughout his campaign.\u00a0In a recent interview, he would not say whether he wants Trump's backing. The political makeup of the state likely contributes to Hugin's stance. New Jersey has not elected a Republican to the Senate in 46 years; Hugin has vowed to \u201cdeliver for the people of New Jersey,\u201d calling himself a \u201cJersey guy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m somebody they can trust,\u201d Hugin told Fox News last month. \u201cThey are tired of the partisanship that\u2019s gone on, and New Jersey has been the center of that partisanship. Senator Menendez has been one of the partisan Democrats in the Senate. It\u2019s time for a change.\u201d Hugin\u2019s campaign outspent Menendez 3-1, with the majority of the funds going toward brutal anti-Menendez TV ads, reviving salacious allegations that the Democratic senator had sex with underage prostitutes during past trips to the Dominican Republic. Menendez has long denied the allegations as a smear since they first surfaced on a news site in 2012. Trump has crisscrossed the country in the weeks leading up to Election Day, hosting \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies to campaign for Republicans in an effort to maintain the majority in the House and Senate, and pick up or hold some governor\u2019s mansions along the way. Trump finished with a spree of three rallies on Monday. On Tuesday, he plans to watch returns at the White House. \u201cAfter 11 rallies in 8 states and weeks of campaigning for Republican candidates, the President will spend today making phone calls, monitoring Congressional, Senate and Gubernatorial races across the country and meeting with his political team for real-time updates,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. \u201cLater this evening, the President and First Lady have invited family and friends to join them in the residence as they watch election returns.\u201d Trump has held 26 rallies since October, embracing Democrats' attempts to make the election a referendum on his agenda. The president has urged supporters to \u201cpretend\u201d he was on the ballot. Also Tuesday, the president tweeted a link to polling locations, sponsored by the Republican National Committee.

They are, in large part, still getting things wrong, not only by failing to understand a new group of voters who put President Donald Trump in the White House but also by ignoring why they voted the way they did. When explaining the Trump voter, the media usually offers portraits of isolated, uneducated, working-class rubes who are driven by anger, race and nationalism. To the experts and those who didn\u2019t support Trump, it\u2019s hard for them to see it any other way. And while the media obsesses over the future demise of the president, they aren\u2019t pausing to consider the strength and durability of the coalition that swept him into office.\u00a0They aren\u2019t asking why people in the Rust Belt counties who voted for former President Barack Obama twice suddenly switched to Trump.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Breaking tonight, reports that the committee vote for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh could happen this Friday following the hearing, Thursday, for Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Ford. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley tweeting just a couple of moments ago, \"If we're ready to vote, we will vote. If we aren't ready, we won't vote.\" He is on the fence but they're trying to move this forward, that's pretty clear tonight. All of this comes on the heels of Kavanaugh's decision to speak out here last night. The heat has only turned up on this nomination after he and his wife broke their silence and responded to the graphic accusations. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It was one roommate, I think, his name is Roche, who said -- you know, that he could see this kind of thing happening. And that you drank a lot in high school, drank a lot in college. And although, he hadn't seen or heard this incident himself that it added up to him that, that it made sense that you treated women that way. BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I've always treated women with dignity and respect. He does not corroborate the incident at all. The incident did not happen. MACCALLUM: You remember him, he was your roommate? KAVANAUGH: I do remember him. MACCALLUM: So, why do you think he would say that? KAVANAUGH: What I know, I'm not going to speculate about motives. I know I never did that. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, the president today at the U.N. was asked about how Kavanaugh did in our interview. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, did you see Judge Kavanaugh's interview last night? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I saw Judge Kavanaugh last night. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, could you give us some thoughts, sir? TRUMP: I think he's a -- just a wonderful human being. This isn't his footing, he's never been here before. He's never had any charges like this. I mean, charges come up from 36 years ago that a totally unsubstantiated. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Senator Lindsey Graham, joins us tonight on the GOP plan to power through. And Brit Hume is here with his reaction to Kavanaugh, the circus surrounding it and the coverage. But first, chief national correspondent Ed Henry with the latest. Hi, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Great to see you, Martha. There's a lot breaking just in the last few moments. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein telling us that she cannot guarantee that Dr. Ford will even be at Thursday's hearing to testify. Saying, she has quote no way of knowing for sure in the last few moments as well, an attorney for the second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, just revealed she is not going to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. There was an idea that she might. And as you noted, Republicans are announcing that they may vote in the committee, on the Judiciary Committee as early as Friday. A suggestion that they are moving forward with this process and that they are feeling confident that maybe they will have the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the High Court. Ford's legal team, the reason why they may not show up on Thursday. They are saying, they do not think she will get a quote, fair and respectful treatment because of Republican Mitch McConnell saying in his speech yesterday that her allegation is part of a \"smear campaign.\" Democrat Chuck Schumer, today demanded McConnell apologized for in Schumer's words politicizing the Supreme Court nomination process. Something that others believe has already been politicized. Now, a sticking point for the legal team was revealed in a letter to the Judiciary Committee. Where they object to Republicans hiring a special lawyer for Thursday's hearing writing this is inconsistent with \"Dr. Blasey Ford's repeated request through counsel that Senators conduct the questioning. This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. Republicans say they want an experienced prosecutor who shows sensitivity to a potential victim of sexual misconduct in a matter like this. And they suspect the Democrats want the appearance of having the 11 Republican men on the committee pepper Dr. Ford with a whole series of questions and potentially look like they are bullying her just six weeks before the midterms. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. ORRIN HATCH, R-UTAH, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We have an outside person coming in and I think that's an appropriate way to do it. So that you don't -- you know, the witness should not be uncomfortable. SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILL., SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Who is going to speak for all of the 11 Republican Senators? We don't have the name, do we? SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Very interesting that our Republican colleagues who want to rush this through are afraid to question Dr. Ford themselves. (END VIDEOTAPE) HENRY: Also new tonight, Senate Judiciary staffers conducted a phone interview with Kavanaugh today, where he denied an allegation from that second woman I mentioned, who charged to The New Yorker that he exposed himself to her at Yale. The New York Times has said, it investigated that charge by the second accused of Deborah Ramirez, but could not corroborate it after interviewing several dozen people in the past week. Her lawyer says tonight, the committee has refused to meet scheduled appointments to hear her story. And that they think a better venue is to try and get the FBI to look at her accusation. That is unlikely to happen. A key Republican swing vote Lisa Murkowski, said earlier she was open to Ramirez getting a chance to testify but interesting that she added she does not want to see \"further delay\". And Republican Richard Burr said immediately following Thursday's hearing, the Judiciary panel should vote on the nomination. So the key there is while Democrats have been hoping to get more witnesses and delay this drag this out longer, you are seeing tonight, Republicans closing ranks and saying no we need to move forward as early as Friday with a committee vote. Then, we're hearing about the procedural vote, maybe Saturday and as early as Tuesday. A week from tonight, we may see a Senate floor vote on Kavanaugh up or down. MACCALLUM: Ed, thank you very much. Joining me now, Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analysts. Brit, your thoughts first on this discussion, the back and forth that you heard from the Senators about the decision to put an attorney in there to do the questioning. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, there's considerable precedent for doing that. The issue though is that they haven't done that in this hearing. I mean, investigating committees often do that and they'll have a special counsel or a committee counsel who will lead the questioning. So, there's plenty of precedent for it. This is obviously all about the politics of appearances. This has really nothing to do with the substance of the questioning. The Senators, I'm sure all believe that their great question is although many may not be. But, this is not -- they want to have a woman questioning a woman. And the Democrats on the other side don't want to see that. They want to see a bunch of white guys questioning this -- and playing victim. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: (INAUDIBLE), but it tricks me that what everyone thinks back to in this arena is Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas. And all of the -- you know, there didn't get high marks for the way that they did the questioning. And some of them have since said that it didn't go well. So, it kind of -- I understand what the Democratic Senators are saying that they think it strikes them as odd that they're going to have someone else be their voice in that room. HUME: Well, it is. Yes, it's unusual in terms of the way these hearings have been conducted so far. But there's you know, there's ample precedent for it in the past, but it's -- this is really not about fact-finding at this point. This is about the appearances of -- that's really as always about. Now, the woman interrogator, I don't know who she is. She may be very good and she may be very, very strong on both sides. And strong toward this woman accuser in a way that wouldn't look so good if a man we're doing it, that's really the key. MACCALLUM: So, what about Murkowski? As you pointed out, you know, this is really all about a couple of votes. HUME: Right. MACCALLUM: It's all about how a couple of people believe this process plays out. HUME: That's exactly where you keep hearing, critics of the Republicans saying the leadership or Republicans as a whole need to do this. It isn't about Republicans as it holds about a tiny handful of them, Lisa Murkowski being one of them. She sounds like she's ready to go that, that what she wanted to do is to see this woman have a chance to be heard, and then, not unless she delivers some staggeringly persuasive testimony that Kavanaugh cannot adequately rebut. And I think that -- you know, she's looks like she's going to go. Now, the question were not sure about Jeff Flake. Susan Collins is still out there. So, there's -- you know, there's still some votes out there. But if they can afford the Republicans can lose exactly one vote and get this nomination bill. One. MACCALLUM: You also have talked about the background of all of this onslaught against Judge Kavanaugh. And I asked him last night whether he thought this went back to Roe v. Wade. And let's play this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Do you have thoughts is this about Roe v. Wade? Is this about people who initially right off the bat? Said they wanted to see you never take the spot on the Supreme Court. Where is this all coming from? KAVANAUGH: I just want a fair process where I can be heard. MACCALLUM: You don't have any thoughts on what's -- where this is coming from? KAVANAUGH: I just want a fair process where I can be heard, defend my integrity. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: He didn't want to go there. HUME: No. But it's absolutely the right question, Martha. Ask yourself this question. If somewhere along the way through a law review article, or something he said in a speech. This judge had signaled that he was a supporter of Roe versus Wade. Do we think any of this would be happening? I guarantee it would not. And this is the root of this. His Roe versus Wade, a decision reached sort of almost out of nowhere that has been widely criticized even by many who like the result as a piece of sloppy, inventive legal reasoning. And we have been living with the consequences of it for 45 years. It took this issue, this highly controversial and sensitive issue out of the political process and made it a constitutional right. And we have been fighting over it ever since, it failed utterly to resolve the issue and this, this episode with all of Sturm und Drang and drama and pain is a further consequence of that one decision. MACCALLUM: And that's further emphasized by the fact that it's Murkowski and Collins that we're talking about. HUME: Exactly right. MACCALLUM: Because them, that is a very big issue in their home states of Alaska and Maine. I just want to -- we apparently just got a report that they will not delay the hearing. We don't know whether or not they're going to be a request to delay the hearing, but there's been some back-and- forth between the attorney (INAUDIBLE). HUME: Oh, we have Dianne Feinstein was saying is what -- is Ed pointed out earlier that she couldn't guarantee that she's been the sponsor of this witness. She couldn't guarantee she would show up and there all these complaints about the hearing that she wants to further delay, I think the committee Republicans have had it. They're going to -- they're going to hold this hearing or not. If she doesn't show up, there'll be no hearing, and they'll probably be a vote soon after. MACCALLUM: That word came from Grassley, of course, he was the chairman of the committee. Just in terms of the broader impact of this, we're going to show in a little while the protests that are happening at Yale University against Judge Kavanaugh. Ted Cruz and his wife tried to go out for dinner last night. HUME: Right. MACCALLUM: And this is how it went. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMERICAN CROWD: We believe survivors. We believe survivors. We believe survivors! (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It's unbelievable. I mean, you know, there's -- obviously sitting down for a nice dinner -- you know, they're dressed up, they go out, and these people swarm around them chanting, \"We believe survivors.\" HUME: Right. What's -- well, think about that. That kind of stuff may play well with a relatively small cadre of hardcore activists. I guarantee you, Martha. And I'm -- you know, I'm not around Washington, for now, seven or eight months of the year. That out in the rest of this country, that stuff looks terrible. And it -- and it hurts the cause to the point we're Beto O'Rourke, who's running against Ted Cruz for his seat in Texas felt compelled to come out and denounce this as improper, inappropriate. This is not what Americans writ large are interested in seeing. And it's -- and it setback whatever cause these people are trying to promote. MACCALLUM: Brit, thank you. HUME: You bet, Martha. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being here tonight. Coming up next, President Trump goes after Iran while their delegation glares back at him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We asked all nations to isolate Iran's regime as long as its aggression continues. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, will that work? Former U.K. Brexit leader, Nigel Farage, joins me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: President Trump and Iranian President Rouhani exchanging a war of words today on the world stage. The President singling out the rogue regime in his address to the General Assembly calling on world leaders to help him to isolate Iran. Watch this. TRUMP: Iran's leaders sow chaos, death, and destruction. They do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead Iran's leaders plundered the nation's resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. The United States has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda. We asked all nations to isolate Iran regime as long as its aggression continues and we asked all nations to support Iran's people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So President Rouhani did not waste time responding to that. He accuses President Trump of a Nazi disposition. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): It is unfortunate that we are witnessing rulers in the world who think they can secure their interests better or at least in the short term right public sentiment and gain popular support through the fomenting of extremist nationalism and racism and through xenophobic tendencies resembling a Nazi disposition. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Joining me now Nigel Farage former U.K. Independence Party leader and a Fox News Contributor. Nigel, good evening. Good to see you tonight. NIGEL FARAGE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good evening. MACCALLUM: What did you make of President Trump's remarks about Iran and Rouhani's response. FARAGE: Well firstly, Rouhani's response. I mean it's a bit rich for the world's first Islamic extremist regime that's now been in place for 40 years to accuse others of racism, extremism, and Nazism which frankly in many ways is all that they've encompassed over these decades. I mean this is I think without doubt the most dangerous unpleasant regime in the world. And Trump -- and clearly John Bolton being there now is a very important influence but Trump is calling on Iran. He's saying, look you guys are sponsoring terrorism, you're spreading it you know, across your borders. The deal that Obama struck with you did not work far from taming you, it made you worse. And I have to say, it's very interesting but of all that was said today at the U.N. by Trump, Iran is the most interesting thing because today of all days the European Union's Foreign Minister Mrs Mogherini who by the way is unelected but never mind, and she said today the E.U. is facilitating easier trade with Iran. So you have Trump on collision course with the European Union over whether Iran are the good guys or the bad guys. MACCALLUM: And you know, clearly this is all over the Iran deal and Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran deal and the E.U.'s pushback to that. President Trump clearly called for the allies to rally together. Is there anything that will change that in terms of the perspective from the U.K. or the rest of Europe? FARAGE: Well, as far as the E.U. is concern, no, they are committed to the Obama idea that we should treat around as our friends and that we should embrace them economically. The Trump-Bolton idea is these guys were given a chance with the Iran Nuclear Deal, they abused it. They became even more terroristic. They spread their bad message all over that region. So no, those new positions are uncompromising. From a British point of view, it's very interesting. Brexit which will make us independent ultimately the U.K. would have to decide are we with America or with the E.U. MACCALLUM: That's going to be a big moment in our relationship for sure. FARAGE: A big moment. MACCALLUM: Bret Baier sat down earlier this evening at the U.N. with the president of South Korea President Moon and he said something very interesting about the future of the nuclear program in North Korea. Let's play that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOON JAE-IN, PRESIDENT SOUTH KOREA (through translator): Chairman Kim actually wants within -- to achieve the complete denuclearization of North Korea with President Trump within his first term in office. So in order to make progress, he wants to have the second U.S. North Korea summit as soon as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Very strong claim. He says that Kim wants to have a denuclearization of North Korea within the first term of President Trump. Do you believe that? FARAGE: Whether I believe it or not, the most important thing is world leaders who are set enemies sitting down talking together is a good thing. Winston Churchill used to say draw-draw is better than World War and I would welcome a second meeting between Trump of the North Koreans. I tell you what, no bad can come of it. MACCALLUM: You know, obviously the world body, the U.N. is a controversial place. The President said something today that got a chuckle from the crowd. And I want to get your reaction to this. Let's play that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country, America's so true. I didn't expect that reaction but that's OK. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What do you think of that moment, Nigel? FARAGE: Well, look, that was Donald Trump being Donald Trump. You know, Donald Trump will never ever undersell his achievements. MACCALLUM: No. FARAGE: He did it -- he did it in front of a very, very skeptical U.N. audience. They laughed. Whether it was with him or against him, it doesn't matter and it was the lightest moment of that speech because he went on from there to attack much what the U.N. stands for. And for me, I've got to tell you, Martha. I mean, I've spent 25 years fighting for national sovereignty against global bureaucracy and to me that speech today was an absolute joy. And in decades to come when people ask what was Trump's philosophy, what did he stand for? Do you know what? All of it you heard today in that speech. MACCALLUM: Fascinating. Nigel, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight. FARAGE: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So who can forget this moment when Senator Cory Booker said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Now, the New Jersey senator says that that had nothing to do with any presidential ambitions that he might have. Really? Chris Stirewalt has his own theory on all this. Plus this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Visual proof. So take it from me, Bigfoot, Erik Paulsen really exists. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOOKER: This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: We played it twice because it's so much fun. Cory Booker's Spartacus moment on Capitol Hill earlier this month had a lot of people speculating that he is preparing a presidential bid but the New Jersey senator insists that he is not thinking about 2020. His sights are set on the midterm elections and that is exactly six weeks away but curtailing New York Times \"my priority is flipping Congress seats at home so that we're spent that -- so we are spending a lot of time raising money for folks which is something that's really needed.\" Really? Joining me now Chris Stirewalt, Fox News Politics Editor and Author of the new book Every Man A King: A Short Colorful History of American Populace. I highly recommend it. It is a great book. Chris, good to have you here this evening. CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR: So Cory Booker is not running for president apparently. STIREWALT: Well, you know, if you want to get extra help from Cory Booker or Kamala Harris or Bernie Sanders or any of the Democrats who probably are going to run in 2020 maybe be from Iowa. Maybe that would be extra helpful. Maybe it would be from New Hampshire, maybe it would be from an electorally important state. This is a charade and both parties do it every four years. MACCALLUM: Sure, absolutely. STIREWALT: This is this charade you go through. Because if you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar, if you get caught going for the presidential before the midterms are done, you look like a heel. You look like you're selfish. So you're like oh, I would never do anything like that. It's so farfetched. MACCALLUM: It's sort of an unwritten rule even in you know, the work that we do. People are allowed to say to you I am definitely not running, and then they're allowed to say six months later I have decided -- I've changed mind. STIREWALT: Does this dress make my butt look big? MACCALLUM: All right, moving right along. Let's take a look at Florida because there's a new Quinnipiac poll that you say is very interesting. Florida is a state that Donald Trump won by I believe one percent. STIREWALT: It was close, 116,000 votes. MACCALLUM: So what do you think of this? STIREWALT: This is a huge shift and it's a shift that we also saw reflected in an NBC News Marist Poll that was also out today. But the Quinnipiac poll is -- I prefer -- that's one of my faves. MACCALLUM: Why do you like it? STIREWALT: They do -- they have good methodology and they also share their crosstab so we can see how did -- how many Republicans, how are the Republicans voting, what are the independents say, and how, when -- MACCALLUM: The (INAUDIBLE) voters. STIREWALT: And it's -- and they weren't a likely voter poll. And this is -- this tells me -- and also it tells me about the persistent lead that the Democratic gubernatorial candidate has in Florida, Andrew Gillum. The Democrats in Florida -- that something switch down there. Some switch, flipped in Florida. I don't know whether it has to do with Kavanaugh, I don't know if it has to do with something else, whether it's state issues about -- they've had this red tide -- MACCALLUM: The red tide. STIREWALT: -- and all these stuff. MACCALLUM: Rick Scott got shouted out of a restaurant himself or some public place recently over that issue. STIREWALT: So something happened in Florida over the last couple few weeks that has changed the climate they're in a pretty dramatic way and it's reflected in several polls. MACCALLUM: Very interesting. All right, Arizona is another one that is going to be very closely watched. Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSalley, this one is it's pretty tight. STIREWALT: You know I love this race. This is like my theory. On election night, when you say we're going to talk about Arizona, you're going to say let's go to Chris because I will say, this has been my favorite all along. You have two moderate female members of Congress running against each other in a state that is politically changing in a very close race. MACCALLUM: For the seat of Jeff Flake. STIREWALT: Yes. For the seat of Jeff Flake in a very, very close race. This one is going to be contested brutally and intensely every step of the way. It's going to tell us a lot about the climate, it's going to tell us a lot about the electorate and they are two -- they are two good campaigners that are running to good campaigns. I love to see it. MACCALLUM: So here is a very interesting ad. People get creative, right. This guy is creative with-- (CROSSTALK) STIREWALT: I love to say I'm with you. MACCALLUM: And I know you really like this one so let's play it. We get at Chris's reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I started to wonder, did Paulson really do it? I mean where is the proof, some blurry photo taken from an hours away? (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I love that it's universally understood that if you walk that way-- STIREWALT: Right. MACCALLUM: -- everyone goes back to the big foot in the woods picture. STIREWALT: Which is, I get this taken from when I walk down over the train station. MACCALLUM: When you said as you do the briefcase thing. STIREWALT: So Erik Paulson has a reputation, they are trying to stick Erik Paulson, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota and the argument being, he's never in the district, he's always at home. But using humor is a good idea. There is a famous Mitch McConnell ad from long, long ago where they are leading a pack of bloodhounds through the woods to try to find the missing congressman. They are going to find the missing congressman. Using humor is a good idea, a connection with voters, and they are going to remember this in the district long after they have forgotten attack at 1,137. MACCALLUM: And people always think, ha-ha, funny, when they think Mitch McConnell. STIREWALT: Here is the turtle, here is the turtle, that's all I can tell you. MACCALLUM: Chris, thank you. STIREWALT: You bet. MACCALLUM: Thanks for being up here tonight. Good to see you. So coming up, more than two dozen professors at one school canceled classes in order to let their students protest Brett Kavanaugh. So, what does this say about Brett Kavanaugh situation? About college campuses? When we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So in a sign of the times on college campuses, more than 30 professors at Yale Law School today canceled their classes yesterday so that the students could protest Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The question is, would they do the same if his supporters wanted to protest en masse, would their classes have also been canceled? The debate comes as we see him how much the higher education can shape opinions. In a recent Fox News poll, those with a college degree lean towards believing the accuser Christine Ford, while a .14 percent margin while those without a college degree seem to side with Kavanaugh by a 17- point margin. My next guest understands all of this. He argues that a lack of intellectual diversity is leaving students unprepared for the real world. Here and now is Greg Lukianoff, a speech lawyer, co-author of a New York Times bestseller, \"The Coddling of the American Minds: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting up a Generation of Failures.\" And there it is. So my first question for you, is, you know, first of all, these are law students that are protesting. And they have not yet heard the hearing. GREG LUKIANOFF, AUTHOR, THE CODDLING OF THE AMERICAN MINDS: Right. MACCALLUM: So they haven't heard both sides yet, so I'm wondering if that and of itself is a little bit of a problem? LUKIANOFF: Well, it's one thing as we talk about the book. Polarization is one of the threads and everybody has got their war hats on and universities which could be kind of increasing understanding between the two different sides, seems to actually be making it more intense. MACCALLUM: So, are they -- I love this word, catastrophizing. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: Like everything is suddenly catastrophe. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: That we need to protest, right? LUKIANOFF: Well, we've seen this real sharp rise in anxiety and depression on campus and our answer to it is saying, we are teaching the generation the habit to be anxious, depress and polarize people so we really shouldn't be that surprise if they are anxious, depressed, and polarized. MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, we live in a world in a country that has, you know, a very strong economy. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: So many advantages, probably the safest, one of the safest countries that you could live in the world. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: And yet they are terrified, they're scared, they anxious, they're depressed. What explains that? LUKIANOFF: You know, a lot of it I got to say it's parenting. It's the people from my generation. MACCALLUM: It's my fault. LUKIANOFF: They were pretty (Inaudible). Yes. It's like, you know, we're raising our kids as if it's much more dangerous than it's ever been before, when in fact it's actually safer than it's ever been before. And part of our job, you know, with this book is try to tell people that you can calm down a little bit. MACCALLUM: How do you advise parents -- it's probably too late for my kids. But I mean, how do you get them to, you know, lower the anxiety level. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: And to understand that, you know, a lot of bumps come along the road, and you have to kind of expect them and accept them as part of the process. LUKIANOFF: Well, helicopter parenting has to go for one thing. Free play, one of the most simple things in the world, letting your kids go run around and solve some problems by themselves without your -- without parents having to get involve. And we really take that play part really seriously. Because what we're afraid of is we have a generation that's always looking to authority and power to solve our (Inaudible) and that's not even good for democracy. MACCALLUM: So in terms of, you know, how you -- you talk about coddling the American mind, so that coddling is sort of built in to the university system, isn't it? LUKIANOFF: Yes. I mean, one thing that all universities need to do, and people are lamenting, we have to give up on the university who don't believe in free speech anymore but how many universities even bother explaining freedom of speech or (Inaudible) freedom and orientation? MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, I've always felt that you shouldn't be able to graduate from college unless you have a course that teaches you liberalism and conservatism and allows debate to happen between people who feels strongly on both sides. Because I think a lot of kids graduate from college and they don't even really understand the tenets of both -- of both sides. LUKIANOFF: Yes. I think that if I could wave a magic wand, and having people do political debates where they have to take the opposite side from what they actually believe would help a lot with the proper understanding-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: You are going to have to retrain parents, though, right? LUKIANOFF: Yes. That's right. We are trying. MACCALLUM: I mean, retraining parents is a big -- is a big part of this. LUKIANOFF: We are trying. Lenore Skenazy we talk a lot to her and she is a friend, this free range mom who wants us to sort of ease up on her kids and retrain parents so they are not so paranoid and polarized. MACCALLUM: But they arrest free range moms now. (CROSSTALK) LUKIANOFF: That's the scary stuff of all. MACCALLUM: Yes. LUKIANOFF: We talk about this in the book. MACCALLUM: The kid walks to the school and the parents get called down to the police station. LUKIANOFF: Yes. We say this absolutely. Step one, stop arresting people for letting their kids walk to school. MACCALLUM: That's incredible. LUKIANOFF: Yes. MACCALLUM: That's ridiculous. Greg, thank you. LUKIANOFF: Thanks so much, Martha. MACCALLUM: Thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight. LUKIANOFF: Thanks. MACCALLUM: So coming up next, from America's dad. This is an unreal story, right. Look at this, this is Bill Cosby in handcuffs being marched out of the courthouse. I never thought I would see that when I was watching the Cosby show as a kid, but that's what we saw today. So here's the question about whether or not he will, how long will he be there, three to 10 years is what we're hearing. That story is up next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN STEELE, MONTGOMERY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Finally, Bill Cosby has been unmasked and we have seen the real man as he is headed off to prison. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: What a story this is. America's dad as he was once known is spending his first night behind bars as a, quote, \"sexually violent predator.\" Late this afternoon, a federal judge sentenced Bill Cosby up to 10 years in prison for drugging and assaulting a woman over a decade ago. Prosecutors say the 81-year-old has finally been unmasked as the criminal that he is. Trace Gallagher live in our west coast newsroom with the details. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The district attorney in this case said that Bill Cosby was hiding behind his TV character Cliff Huxtable. He went on to say that was a fictional character but now the true Cosby has been unmasked as a violent sexual predator who will spend at least the next three years behind bars. When Judge Steven O'Neill read the sentence, he said, quoting Mr. Cosby, this has all circled back to you. The day has come, the time has come.\" Our producer in the courtroom said both Cosby and his accuser showed little to no emotion. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LISSA KAPLAN, FOX NEWS PRODUCER: I could see his back, he didn't react, he kind of just sat there. Andrea same thing, didn't react. They both were very calm. Andrea, at one point though, after the sentence was read looked to be like hunched over and kind of just looking down contemplating what had happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Of course Andrea, being Andrea Constand, the woman who was drugged and sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby. She didn't speak after the hearing but her five-page victim impact statement submitted to the court was powerful reading in part, quoting, \"Bill Cosby took my beautiful young healthy spirit and crushed it. He robbed me of my health and vitality, my open nature and my trust in myself and others.\" The D.A. Kevin Steele praised Constand as a woman of strength and determination. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEELE: She has been solid and steadfast, put herself out like this for years in front of a worldwide. It's extremely difficult for anyone. She's been a rock. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Dozens of other women also came forward claiming Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted them but the statute of limitations on those cases had expired. As Bill Cosby was led out of the courtroom in cuffs and placed in the back of an SUV, his spokesperson said Cosby had been persecuted. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW WYATT, BILL COSBY'S SPOKESPERSON: They prosecuted Jesus and look what happened. Not saying Mr. Cosby is Jesus but we know this country has done for black men for centuries. So Mr. Cosby is doing fine. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Yet, the 81-year-old Cosby who is legally blind has now been booked into the Montgomery County Jail where he will be processed and sent to state prison. It remains unclear if he'll be placed into the general population, his attorneys are appealing the conviction. Martha? MACCALLUM: Trace, thank you very much. So, coming up here tonight, new details that have just come in. We've all been wondering what the format is going to be on Thursday morning, we now know. We will tell you that in a moment. Senator Lindsey Graham on the committee with the new information, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Do you believe there should be an FBI investigation into these allegations and that a pause should happen and, you know, sort it all out? If there is nothing to worry about and nothing to hide, why not have that process. KAVANAUGH: I want an opportunity a fair process. America is about fairness and I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity and clear my name as quickly as I can in whatever form the Senate deems appropriate. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That was in reaction to the question about whether or not they believe an FBI investigation should take place. And to this, Judge Brett Kavanaugh speaking out exclusively to THE STORY as he called for fairness ahead of Thursday's hearing. We are getting some details now for the very first time tonight about the format and what all of this is actually going to look like at the Senate judiciary committee. Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein will deliver opening statement. Dr. Christine Ford will deliver her opening statement with no time limit, where she will tell her story. There will then be one round of questions, five minutes each for each senator and Judge Kavanaugh will then get the exact same opportunity. Here now, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who sits on that committee. Senator Graham, good to have you here. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Do you believe that this is going to go forward? What are the indications from her attorneys is this going to happen? GRAHAM: If it doesn't happen I would be surprised because they've been asking to be heard. They are going to be hurt if they want to. They are going to pick our lawyer and they're not going to decide who goes first. You know, Senator Grassley has spent over backwards to be fair. Not one once of fairness has come from our Democratic colleagues about an FBI investigation. If you really wanted one, why didn't you tell us in July when you first got this accusation? What's the FBI going to investigate? You can't tell -- you can't tell the FBI the month it happened, you can't tell the FBI where it happened. What are they supposed to do? Go talk to your buddy mayor (Ph) in 1982? I have never -- Judge Kavanaugh says he wants a fair process, you come to the wrong town at the wrong time. MACCALLUM: What do you say to those who criticize you for that attitude about it who say you know, you are not open to listening to what she has to say? GRAHAM: I would say this. If you really believe this was a serious accusation, why didn't you bring it forward in July? Dr. Ford is being abused as much as anybody else. She said she didn't want to come forward, somebody on the other side leak her name, not us. She's been a victim of this as much as Kavanaugh has. And here's what I'm telling your audience. This is an accusation that's 35 years old. You can't tell me where it happened or when it happened and everybody named in terms of having been there say it didn't happen. So what am I supposed to do? MACCALLUM: One of the questions is about the burden. Who bears the burden is. GRAHAM: Right. MACCALLUM: And Senator Chris Coons said something quite remarkable about this. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS, D-DEL.: It is Judge Kavanaugh who is seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, and do I think now bears the burden of disproving these allegations, rather than Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Is that how it works? GRAHAM: They must have missed something in law school. So here's what Chris is saying. And I like Chris. Judge Kavanaugh you have to prove to me that you were not at a party 35 years ago and you didn't sexually assault somebody at that party, but I can't tell you where it was and when it was. And here's what Kavanaugh said. I've never sexually assaulted anybody anywhere at any time, but under this construct he will have to prove 35 years ago he wasn't at a party and they won't tell him when it was and where it was, and how are you supposed o do that? MACCALLUM: Good question. It's interesting, Joe Biden in 1991 said this about the presumption of innocence. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Judge, with me from the beginning, and at this moment until the end, the presumption is with you. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: It's remarkable. GRAHAM: Well, we miss Joe Biden. Here's the presumption. Anything Trump, fair game, no rules when it comes to Trump or his nominees. They knew about this in July, they sit on it. We have an allegation that's collapsing. I've never been more upset than I am now. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan. I didn't do this to them. Judge Kavanaugh doesn't deserve this. Ms. Ford doesn't deserve what happened to her. We're going to play this out. And I can tell everybody who is listening. That everything about Judge Kavanaugh screams this is not true. He is not Bill Cosby. He's not Weinstein. He's lived a good life. This is an allegation 35 years old that's unverified and I'm not going to ruin his life based on that. Show me something credible that yet to do it. MACCALLUM: With regard to the FBI investigation, do we have time to play this one other sound bite here? All right. Let's play Joe Biden also in 1991 talking about the rule of an FBI investigation. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BIDEN: FBI does not explicitly in this or any other case reach a conclusion. Period. So when people waive an FBI report before you, understand, they do not, they do not, they do not reach conclusions. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That's incredible. Everyone -- everyone on one side of the aisle on the Hill is screaming for an FBI investigation and, Joe Biden who is pretty much the standard bearer of the Democratic Party says quite clearly there, that is simply not what they do. GRAHAM: The other side had this in July, they went seven weeks without bringing it up and they drop it a week or three or four days before we vote. The FBI has told me, we don't know how to help you. We don't know where to go, we don't know what town to go, we don't know what month to look at, we're not even sure about the year. So this is just an excuse to destroy this man's life. This is not about fairness, this is about destroying Brett Kavanaugh to make sure Trump doesn't get a second pick. It's about no more, no less, and in the process they are destroying Ms. Ford, too in my view. Something may have happened to her. I don't know her. I'm respectful of people who've gone through bad experiences but I have to use some common sense here and I've been a lawyer all my life. And you could not get a warrant based on this allegation. You can't tell me when it happened or where it happened and everybody says it doesn't happen. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Now you have the format you each are going to get five minutes. How is this going to reach with this other attorney involved and why? GRAHAM: We're going to basically give her our time. It's pretty hard to interview somebody effectively in five minutes and stop so we are going to have a professional litigator who is trained to do this. MACCALLUM: Who is this person? GRAHAM: I'll let the committee tell you about it. It will be a trained professional. We're not trying to make politics out of this, we are trying to make sure that 11 politicians are not in the limelight here. MACCALLUM: So none of you will question at all? GRAHAM: If I have a question I'm sure I will ask it. But I want to turn it over to the person who has more experience than I do. I'm trying to tell people that this bothers me. I voted for their nominees, I never would thought have to do this to Sotomayor and Kagan. These allegations are collapsing and the second allegation couldn't even make it in The New York Times. And only God knows what Avenatti is going to say. Everything in this man's life screams that he's been respectful to women. When he's been in charge of women in their careers, they have nothing but great things to say. MACCALLUM: Let me ask you this. Do you think that we will see a repeat from Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, the senators who try to stop the proceedings. Are they going to say Thursday morning, no way. We want an FBI investigation. We are not going to let this move forward? GRAHAM: Come Thursday morning, Ms. Ford, Dr. Ford, will have a chance to come and tell the committee in her own words what happened. Kavanaugh will have a chance to respond and we've been ask questions. We are not going to move it, we're not going to delay it, just like in arsonist complaining about a fire. These are the people who put in this box. MACCALLUM: And the vote will be on Friday. GRAHAM: And this vote will be Friday, and unless something new comes out to give veracity to a 35-year-old claim that I don't have today, I'm moving forward to. MACCALLUM: Al right. Thank you very much, Senator Lindsey Graham. GRAHAM: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Good to have you with us tonight. That is our story on this Tuesday evening. Live from the rooftop here on Washington, D.C., we will see you back in New York tomorrow night at 7 o'clock. Tucker Carlson is coming up next with his show straight ahead.

Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are broadcasting tonight from London ahead of the president's first official visit here in England. There is so much happening right here in Europe and at home. Without a doubt, this is one of the busiest news cycles in years. We have a lot to cover tonight, we have a huge show. Newt Gingrich, Steve Bannon, right here in London, and much more. But first, earlier today, President Trump -- he attended the annual NATO summit where he had some very tough talk for European leaders, the ones who rely on your hard-earned taxpayer dollars to pay their national defense. Now, coming up tonight, we'll do something the media won't do. We will break down all of these numbers and explain why under President Trump, America will no longer serve as the world's piggy bank. And also today, the president singled out the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for what is her country's obscene dependence on Russian energy, and for the billions and billions of dollars flowing from Germany right into Vladimir Putin's pockets. And meanwhile, the mainstream media right here at home in America once again spinning out of control. For months, they were just hysterical over the fake news narrative that Trump is Vladimir Putin's puppet. Well, guess what? Tonight, they are freaking out over Donald Trump's tough rhetoric against Russia. Wait a minute, I thought Putin had all these horrible things on President Trump and he was compromised. We're going to reveal the blatant double standard. And we have important new developments tonight, shocking actually, surrounding Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and all their friends in the deep state. Sit tight, it is time for tonight's important breaking news, London edition, opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. For decades, the United States has been footing the bill for the safety and the security of the European continent and all while many of our allies across the Atlantic failed to live up to their commitments. Now, today in Brussels, President Trump made it perfectly clear that the U.S. taxpayer is not and no longer going to be Europe's ATM machine. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they are delinquent, as far as I'm concerned because the United States has had to pay for them. So if you go back 10 or 20 years, you'll just add it all up. It's massive amounts of money. Germany is just paying a little bit over 1 percent, whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2 percent of a much larger GDP. So, I think that's inappropriate also. You know, we're protecting Germany, we're protecting France, we're protecting everybody, and yet we're paying a lot of money to protect. Now, this has been going on for decades. This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it, because I don't think they understood, or they just didn't want to get involved. But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country. It's very unfair to our taxpayers. I think that these countries have to step it up, not over a ten-year period. They have to step it up immediately. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, the president, he's absolutely right. And even the secretary general of NATO is backing up President Trump. Let's take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: We are going to discuss many important issues at the summit. Among them is defense spending. And we all agree that they have to do more. I agree with you that they have to make sure our allies are investing more. The good news is that the allies have started to invest more in defense. After years of cutting defense budgets, they've started to add billions to defense budgets. And last year was the biggest increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada in a generation. TRUMP: Why was that last year? STOLTENBERG: It's also because of your leadership and because your clear message. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Numbers don't lie. So let's do something the mainstream media would never do. We're going to break down those numbers. Now, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO, it was first utilized as a unified military deterrent to the looming Soviet threat and to provide intercontinental stability throughout Western Europe and North America. It was formed after two world wars devastated the European continent. It took the lives of hundreds of thousands of American heroes. Now, NATO has a massive budget, around $1 trillion. Now, this year, the United States contributed over $700 billion to that budget. All right, let's compare that to the rest of our allies. The next highest contribution, well, that would come from the United Kingdom. They only contribute $61.5 billion. Germany, a mere $51 billion. Canada comes in frankly at an embarrassingly low $21 billion. And the country where NATO is headquartered, Belgium, they contribute only $5 billion. In fact, the United States, you the American taxpayer, you're on the hook for 70 percent of NATO's expenses. Now, that's right. You -- we pay 70 cents of every dollar that NATO spends. And while all NATO allies agreed to contribute, at least 2 percent of the country's overall GDP to the NATO budget, the U.S. is only -- get this -- only one of four nations to actually follow through on that agreement. And that's standard. The United States actually contributes -- well, almost double, 3.5 percent of our massive GDP to NATO's budget. And meanwhile, it's a much different story among our allies. Take a look at your screen. Economic powerhouse Germany, they only contribute 1.24 percent, not 2 percent. And three Western European countries, well, they contribute less than even 1 percent. So, that's right, one country, our country, we're proud of, the United States of America is now bearing the financial burden of NATO and the protection of Europe and North America while 27 other countries sadly are laughing all the way to the bank. So, tonight under the president's leadership, America is putting them on notice and will no longer be the world's piggy bank and our allies must pay their fair share. Now, of course, this includes the de facto leader of the E.U., Germany, while one of Europe's wealthiest nations, fails to properly fund NATO -- get this and the president pointed this out today -- they're spending billions of dollars in Russia in order to support massive energy trade deals. In other words, Germany, they're not going to adequately fund the protection of their own country but they are more than happy to prop up one of NATO's so-called biggest threats, the one they keep telling us about, the bad actor with Putin in the bad country of Russia. And earlier today, the president called out the German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her country's blatant double standard. It's about time. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think it's very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia where you are supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. I think that's very inappropriate and the former chancellor of Germany is the head of the pipeline company that's supplying the gas. Ultimately, Germany will have almost 70 percent of their country controlled by Russia with natural gas. So, you tell me, is that appropriate? I mean, I've been complaining about this from the time I got here. It should have never been allowed to have happened, but Germany is totally controlled by Russia, because they were getting 60 percent to 70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline. And you tell me if that's appropriate, because I think it's not. And I think it's a very bad thing for NATO and I don't think it should have happened. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, Merkel responded with what was a vague, indirect, frankly pathetic statement, lamenting the country's history under Soviet control. But now, how can someone possibly make the case that Donald Trump is compromised by Russia or Vladimir Putin? He actually is urging Merkel to get their energy from us, the United States of America. And, by the way, end their independence on Russia. Now, this is a move that would literally cripple Russia's fragile economy. And, by the way, if Russia's economy falters, Vladimir Putin is finished. So, so much for all the media conspiracies, almost two years now, all the lies saying Donald Trump is compromised by Vladimir Putin. Now imagine how many, just for a second, high-paying career jobs could be created in the United States of America if we would get those billions and billions of dollars and we were importing our natural gas to Germany, of which by the way we have an abundance of, more than we can use in hundreds of years. And as you might imagine, President Trump's -- his tough talk in Brussels was met with absolute, predictable hysteria from the mainstream media and, of course, their best friends in the Democratic Party. Now, after spending 18 months warning us all, the sky is falling, because of the fake, phony narrative, the witch hunts that Donald Trump was somehow Vladimir Putin's puppet. The left is now in a total freak out mode that Donald Trump today used a lot of anti-Russia rhetoric and demanding that countries pay their fair share. And by the way, that's supposed to lead us now to catastrophe. You can't win with these people. In other words, a typical Trump hating day in the media with their Democratic allies and as always, we've got all the tape to prove it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a ludicrous demand that he is making here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The E.U. was meant to get around and away from that toxic nationalism, right? But who's bringing it back? Donald Trump. America first is toxic nationalism. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is unprecedented language. It is a real threat to the alliance. It's a threat to the democratic liberal postwar world order that Harry Truman himself signed in to -- into being with the NATO declaration 70 years ago. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Frankly, it's just infuriating to watch this happen. You cannot imagine any American president all the way back 75 years deciding to become the critic in chief of NATO. I mean, it's Orwellian. It's infuriating to see this happen. It's diplomatic malpractice. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And there's a lot more. All right. So, think of it this way, you have the Democratic leaders of the party, they have no vision for the country. You got Nancy Pelosi, Chuckie Schumer. Their agenda for 2018 is very, very simple. Oh, they want their crumbs back, they want to impeach Trump but they don't say it, they want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare and they don't want Judge Kavanaugh on the bench or any Trump choice. Anyway, they released a statement -- a joint statement bashing Trump that says, President Trump's brazen insults and denigration of America's most steadfast ally, Germany is an embarrassment. His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the president is more loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin than to our allies. Actually just the opposite is true. So, OK, what do Pelosi and Schumer, why are they afraid of Putin? Why do they want to make Russia rich again? Why? So the American taxpayers, all of you, are footing the bill for over 70 percent of NATO? Liberals, by the way, they are so generous with your money. And, by the way, why don't they encourage Germany to buy our natural gas, like the president is? It's important to remember, this is all coming from America's so-called elites, the very same people who think they know best. The same people who think giving billions of dollars to Iran and the mullahs in Iran, that was a wonderful idea, it's going to bring us peace in our time. The same people who thought bribing North Korea as Bill Clinton tried in the 1990s would prevent them from building nuclear weapons. Didn't work out that way. The same people who actually cringe at the thought of America again leading on the world stage and the same people who sadly but routinely look down on you, us, we, the American people. Remember, you are the irredeemable deplorables. You're the ones that cling to your God, your guns, your bible, your religion. Yes, those same people. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not. So, it's not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to their guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables, right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Same playbook, we'll see it all throughout this election year. Judge Kavanaugh and his family will experience. Nothing changes. They don't have any vision to make the country better. Now, in 2016, Peter Strzok texted that he could actually smell Trump voters in a rural Virginia Walmart. He can smell us. I like Walmart. And just yesterday, you have MSNBC conspiracy anchor, thrill up his leg, Chris Matthews, comparing Trump supporters, believe it or not, taking it a step further, untamed dogs. You don't believe me? Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC ANCHOR: He's taking the Republican Party, a grassroots party that spent 60, 70 years leading the war and the Cold War, hating the Russians for their aggressiveness in the world, taking over countries on the border and being tyrannical, the way they are now, and he has those people cheering against Western Europe, which is liberal and democratic, and free market, and attacking them while saying how Trump -- agreeing with Trump saying he's doing his best. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's remarkable to think that one of them -- MATTHEWS: He's dog training these people. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Oh, that's what they really think of us. Now, these same elites in the media, they are celebrating the widespread anti-Trump protest that are going to be taking place this week throughout Europe, one of the reasons we're here. And as we discussed last night, they are all forgetting, you know, history does repeat itself. Remember Ronald Reagan, President Reagan, faced the same backlash, same demonstrations before his policy of strength, trust but verify, the evil empire, tear down this wall, which spurred some of the most historic diplomatic achievements in world history. President Trump could now be poised to follow in those footsteps. We could all hope. And we'll have more on the president's trip throughout Europe throughout the show but we do have other important breaking news on the domestic front. Trump-hating former FBI lawyer Lisa Page today did not comply with her subpoena and flat out refused to testify before a closed-door session of Congress. She sounds a little like Hillary. And earlier today, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, he voiced this very important concern. Let's take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: It does appear that Lisa Page apparently has something to hide. She has been in complete defiance of cooperation with the House Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for seven months now, dating back to the first letter we wrote to the Department of Justice in December of last year asking for appearance. There have been two subsequent letters and two subpoenas issued for her appearance and she has defied all of that. Now, when she says that she has not had ample time to prepare, that is belied by -- (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And the president also reacted today. He tweeted out, quote: Ex- FBI lawyer Lisa Page today defied the House of Representatives and issued subpoena to testify before Congress. Wow. But does anyone really surprise together with her lover, FBI agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the rigged witch hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever. Yes, the media ignores that. Now, the window is fast closing for Lisa Page. She must either comply with the subpoena, by the way, if this happened to us, we'd be in big trouble, or she will face serious legal consequences, including a contempt of Congress citation. And meanwhile her corrupt FBI boyfriend Peter Strzok, well, he's still set to testify in public tomorrow. Get ready, this hearing is going to be explosive. We will full analysis and reaction to Peter Strzok's time in the hot seat tomorrow if he shows up. Catherine Herridge will also join us live with the report, on the very latest on all this tonight. But, first, joining us by phone, he is the author of \"The New York Times\" bestseller, \"Trump's America: The Truth About Our Nation's Great Comeback\", broken into two parts, one about the success the media never talks about and the other, the -- well, roadblocks and difficulties and challenges the president will face, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. I just laid out all the numbers, Mr. Speaker, 70 percent -- we paid 3.5 percent of our massive GDP. Germany, what, 1.4 percent, and they are giving billions of dollars in contracts to Vladimir Putin, 70 percent of the lifeblood of their economy, their energy is coming from Russia and I'm sitting here thinking, isn't it part of NATO to prevent against any type of a Russian military challenge they might face? Why wouldn't they give the business to us? NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Let me say first of all, because I can't -- I was so struck, when you played the section from Hillary, it just reminded me. Can you imagine if she had been president and we would have had to listen to that for the last two years? I mean, that's a level of pain I can't quite imagine. So, I just wanted to say. I couldn't just stop thinking about that when you played her quote. And, of course, the president has put his finger on one of the great false hypocrisies of Europeans. The Europeans love to lecture us while they make money. The German economy is the strongest economy in Europe. It is an enormous machine of export. They love deals. The reason they were for the Iranian deals is they want to sell things to Iran. They lecture us about not being tough with Putin, while as the president correctly points out, they're spending billions every year buying natural gas from Russia. I mean, the level of hypocrisy is just breathtaking. And I think the president deserves a lot of credit, this may have been one of the most honest days of public dialogue about the future of U.S. and Europe that I have ever seen, and at every stage, he was prepared. And by the way, people should remember as you watch him, he's not reading off of some staff-driven memo, he is talking off the cuff because he actually knows all of this stuff. He has learned and he has thought about it and I thought he was very impressive today. And, of course, the Europeans naturally are kind of irritated because they've had a great ride now for three or four decades. And we're now -- again, it's kind of like having a brother-in-law you loaned your car to for free for 25 years and now, you want the car back, and they're going, but I like the car. And the Europeans are being asked to grow up and to do their fair share. As I mentioned to you earlier on your radio show, there's amazing ad that was in the \"London Times\" by nine senior British generals and admirals that said, Trump is exactly right about NATO and they list eight major reforms of the British military. It's the most amazing thing I have seen in a long time and it's a sign that he is striking a nerve with people who care about national security and people who care about safety. HANNITY: You know, I love how generous the left are with American taxpayers' money. America -- obviously, the president doesn't mind paying his fair share, nor do I think any American minds paying our fair share, but we are paying 70 percent plus of the bill. And what I don't know is why would Germany allow itself, if you're going to make billions of dollars in energy deals with Vladimir Putin, why would you create this vulnerability considering everybody views him as a hostile actor and need to protect ourselves against him, and NATO is spending a billion dollars a year, most of which we're paying, why wouldn't they partner with America considering our vast natural gas resources? The jobs that could be created for Americans? GINGRICH: Well, don't underestimate the degree of resentment. I always remind people when we are celebrating D-Day in the landing of Normandy, that there are a fair number of Germans who aren't quite as excited by it. There's a long tradition of the Germans and the Russians working together between wars and I think that there is a comfort zone. And remember that a substantial part of Germany was in the Soviet empire and consists of people who are used to dealing with the Russians. HANNITY: Imagine Donald Trump if he could persuade Germany to do this, it would literally shutdown Russia's economy. If I'm Vladimir Putin, I would be very nervous. All right. Mr. Speaker, thank you. All right. When we come back, as we continue from London, right here in our London studio, Steve Bannon will join us straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As I mentioned earlier in my opening monologue, as we continue from London tonight, the media cannot stand it, that President Trump actually stood up for America today on the world stage. Just to remind you. Let's take a quick look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK, fine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I don't want to make light of this, but this kind of diplomacy looks like hulk smash. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Called Germany a captive of Russia is the most inflammatory language I could imagine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the latest example of how the Trump doctrine drives a wedge in the world order by upending Democratic-led institutions in place since after World War II. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he went there determined to poke his allies and to demand not only more spending but to insult Germany. MATTHEWS: What's going on here? Is there any possible reason to believe it's good for the world? (END VIDEO CLIPS) HANNITY: All right. Joining us now here in London, with reaction, former White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon. How are you, my friend? Good to see you. STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me here. Live in London. HANNNITY: Live in London, yes, sir. What is it, 2:30 in the morning? Something like that? All right. Let's go -- today was historic. BANNON: Yes. HANNITY: It was the right thing to do, pitch perfect. And I don't think anybody ever laid out those numbers. BANNON: Sean, look at the meltdown on the mainstream media in the permanent political class of both parties, the Never Trumpers, the national security apparatus right and also the left. You know, they have said for years how disruptive Trump is. Here's what he did. Think about the speech he made in Warsaw last August. He said our number one priority is defense of Western Civilization and he actually talked at that time about what a problem Russian natural gas was going to be. I mean, for any other president that was so provocative, he goes to NATO today and he has a partners' discussion to say, look, this alliance, I'm trying to make it stronger. I want allies. I don't want a protectorate. The problem is, is what NATO has turned into is a protectorate. You can see it in those numbers. HANNITY: It's astonishing. BANNON: And by the way, it's not just -- the American people should understand, it's not just that Germany is only paying 1.2 percent of their GDP, when they are positive in their budget, they've got plenty of cash. It's only 1.2 percent. But if you look at what they are spending it on, it's not on equipment. It's not on readiness. It's not interoperability for NATO. There's a report out the other day, 128 I think German combat aircraft, only seven -- only seven are prepared to be fully operational right now. What President Trump said today is that, hey, the key to the Trump doctrine, no more managed decline. The elites in the world managed process to unacceptable outcomes to citizens. And he's saying, hey, we're not doing that anymore. I'm going to have a partners' discussion. You need to pay the 2 percent. In fact, he said, instead of waiting until 2024, if you look at the threats are today, you need to step -- I mean, pay today. By the way, if you don't pay it, you should be in arrears. And they -- and all the guys -- HANNITY: I agree with that. BANNON: -- said, Trump is not engaged. Trump is an isolationist. This is the most -- this is -- what he's talking about. This is total engagement, and, treating people like adults. Everybody comes over NATO before, or Europe, and have all these highfalutin talk. HANNITY: But they only like apology tours, Steve. They only like a weak America. They only like billions sent to Iran. BANNON: But even people on the Republican side who have come over here and just had platitudes. HANNITY: Right. BANNON: Trump is a practical, pragmatic businessman. And he's saying, if we're going to make this alliance work, people have to step up, OK, and participate, fully participate as far as the 2 percent go and it can't be ten years, it's got to be today. I think -- and this is one of the things that Trump -- President Trump, remember, $30 billion increase when we first got there, just for readiness. And today after these things in the morning, they had the readiness briefings. I believe President Trump came out and said, hey, I think you ought think about 4 percent. He is into the details of what it takes to make this alliance work. But you look on to the mainstream media and it's in full meltdown. This is the first time anybody has had a partners' discussion. HANNITY: Poland is doing the opposite of Germany. They refuse to be dependent on Russian energy sources. When you talk about Germany, literally, Putin is a hostile regime, Russia is a hostile regime, or Putin a hostile actor. And you're going to put 70 percent of the lifeblood of your economy in his hands and give them billions of dollars. And NATO in part is designed to protect against any hostile regime like Russia. It just defies all common sense and logic especially knowing the depth of American resources with energy. BANNON: That's what he said today. He said, how can you be so lax in supporting NATO, the defense alliance and what we're here today is talk about that, when you are putting really the control of your entire country, because if you fully do this natural gas we will be at 70 percent. And look back, what is it, 2009 - 2009 when Russia put the pressure on the Ukraine about natural gas. People have seen before Russia do. Like I said, he talked about it in Warsaw last year, he brought it up today and nobody has really gotten in the Russian spaces like this. I mean, he called out Germany but he also called out Russia. So I don't know what-- HANNITY: You are seeing today how nervous. You did not like what you heard, he's basically saying, don't do this. That kills the Russian economy. BANNON: I think if you put in instead they are going, hey, this guy is the leader of the west he's laying out methodically what it takes for the defense of the west that they have to have an alliance that works. They have to have an alliance that works militarily. They can't be any more games. You know, President Trump has a great saying, no more games. And today he said no more games. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to pay for it. And by the way, you can't -- if you are beholden to Russia, you are strategically going to put the entire alliance in jeopardy. HANNITY: OK. Let me switch to the 2018 election. I make the point that the Democrat is no vision to make -- to look out for the working men or we say the forgotten men and women of this country. Is it their agenda. They want to impeach Trump and are telling Maxine Waters and others don't say it. They want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare, they don't want Judge Kavanaugh on the bench, and they want their crumbs back, they want the tax cut back. I can't think of one positive thing they are offering. But historically midterms are difficult for the party in power in the White House. BANNON: It's difficult in party in power but this is going to be a referendum on President Trump. I keep saying this is the first reelect and it should be. They are running away from saying impeachment now because they understand impeachment galvanizes the deplorables, it galvanizes the base. President Trump is going to be unbalanced. HANNITY: Just calling on deplorables. BANNON: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Bannon, you're irredeemable deplorable. BANNON: I wear this badge of honor. HANNITY: I do, too. BANNON: September 9th is a high holy day in our movement. Because no, you saw on that clip-- HANNITY: Horrible. BANNON: -- what she really thinks of working people. They detest you. They detest your values, they detest what you stand for and that's what Trump speaks to the American people. President Trump, this is his reelect, OK? You are going to get the up or down vote. You are going to get the whole package what he's done on national security. HANNITY: What about weak Republicans, what about rhinos? You are going to- - (CROSSTALK) BANNON: Rhinos suck it up. Just like 2016, when President Trump said talk about the judges, right? If you are an establishment Republican, OK, and you see what President Trump represents with taxes, where the economy is going, right, with national security, all the leadership he's shown. And he is reforming the federal judiciary. That's one of the reasons they are having a meltdown right now because the left understands that Donald Trump is an historic president and he is going to be in their lives for 30 or 40 years. HANNITY: By the way, transformation. BANNON: Transformation but and one of the true historic presidents, maybe four or five in American history, he is going to be in the lives of the progressive left for 30 or 40 years. The way he is redoing the federal judiciary in a very methodical process, right, to go to people who have a lot of written opinions, to go to the originalist for the Constitution, it's going to have dramatic impact. I think that's why you're seeing the meltdown. HANNITY: So Kavanaugh is an originalist? BANNON: I think Kavanaugh is a tremendous pick. I trust the process. I think he's a tremendous pick. HANNITY: Great to see you. BANNON: Good to see you. HANNITY: All right. As we continue from London, we have breaking news. Catherine Herridge joins us with new developments on anti-Trump FBI officials Strzok and Page. And then Sara Carter, Gregg Jarret as we continue almost 2.40 a.m. in London. We'll see. We'll continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: As we continue where we are reporting live from London and it's going to be a very big day on Capitol Hill tomorrow as FBI agent Peter Strzok will testify publicly before the House oversight and judiciary committees about his anti-Trump bias. And also tonight, new developments concerning his former mistress, Lisa Page and how she today defied a congressional subpoena. Joining us now with much more is from Washington Fox News chief intelligence correspondent, our friend Catherine Herridge. Catherine, a lot of breaking news on this tonight. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Sean. And good evening. Two congressional panels sent this letter laying out three options. FBI lawyer Lisa Page can show up tomorrow at a public hearing with her former lover and colleague agent Peter Strzok, give a close to a deposition or face more legal trouble. The committees are warning tonight they could initiate contempt proceedings as early as Friday morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOODLATTE: She has been incomplete defiance of cooperation with the House judiciary committee, and the oversight and government formed committee for seven months. I think it's very important for her to understand that and she should comply with that and she should comply with it now before she's held in contempt of Congress which could happen as soon as Friday. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: So a time to go on Twitter President Trump emphasized Page has defied a House subpoena by not showing up today on Capitol Hill. Quote, \"Wow, but is anybody really surprised?\" This afternoon, Page its legal team released a new photo of their client and said the FBI shares some of the blame accusing the bureau of failing to provide timely access to Page's notes and records. Her lawyer telling Fox News there is no basis for claims that Lisa has anything to hide or is unwilling to testify. Then accusing the House panels of bullying tactics. The committee chairman counter they had to call in federal officers because Page and her team played games. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOODLATTE: In addition, our attorneys have had communication with her attorney for nearly a month now about this appearance, and her attorney agreed to accept service of the subpoena and then turned around and immediately tried to reject it so that's why we sent the marshals to her house to serve the subpoena. They had to go back three times before they were finally able to reach her. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: The situation tonight remains highly fluid. A legal source close to FBI agent Peter Strzok tells Fox News that he still plans to appear tomorrow on Capitol Hill and his team wants the transcript from his closed- door deposition two weeks ago made public as well, Sean. HANNITY: All right. Catherine Herridge in Washington. Here with reaction the author, it's less than two weeks away, there is a definitive book on this whole scheme, \"The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and yes, Frame Donald Trump.\" Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, also here on set with us in London, Fox News contributor investigative reporter Sara Carter. This is interesting because she, there appears with Peter Strzok or appears Friday or will be held in contempt. SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. And it's very revealing all the information that we've received today about Lisa Page, right, the fact that the marshals had to go to her house, the fact that they-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Three times. CARTER: Three times. Three times that she was trying to evade the marshals, apparently, and finally then they got her and now she is just refusing. You know, there's a different set of rules apparently for Lisa Page and Peter Strzok and-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Hillary Clinton. CARTER: -- Hillary Clinton, and for all of these players that were involved in this. A different set of rules that we would not be allowed to get away with. I think what's really fascinating here is they could push for contempt. But remember, even with they called her, I mean, they -- he was in contempt but nothing ever really happened. The American people were frustrated, Sean, they want to see some action. So she either comes tomorrow which I think is the best option and testifies with Peter Strzok, or Friday, and behind closed door. HANNITY: Let's talk -- let's go to the point, Gregg, that Sara is making here. I would soon know or defy a congressional subpoena, it wouldn't work out well for me, it wouldn't work out well for anybody watching this program. I -- it wouldn't work out well if subpoenaed e-mails were deleted and bleach bit and devices beaten up with hammers and SIM cards removed. Why, how are they getting away with it and Congress, what are they going to do? They will have no power if they don't enforce this contempt. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: If you and I did this we would be doing push-ups in the hose gallop (Ph) because there would have been a bench warrant for our arrest. And only thereafter where there be a show causes hearing. But this is Washington, D.C. and Congress has no power to enforce a contempt citation or subpoena, they have to go to a federal judge, and in D.C. they are all liberal judges. So, you know, it's a different set of operating procedures there. But she is claiming she needs to review documents but that's not a valid excuse for defying a subpoena. I use to issue subpoenas all the time before witnesses had a chance to look at documents, because I wanted them to tell the truth and not be influenced by documents and conform the testimony. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: How does this end? JARRETT: And then I wanted to use those documents to impeach their credibility when they lied to. So she's reversed the entire process. How does it end? She gets away with it. History shows this, congressional contempt citations go nowhere as they are colder. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: The American people can't -- we don't have a country. We don't have rules. JARRETT: Right. HANNITY: We don't have the equal application. We don't have a Constitution if we have two sets, two justice systems here. CARTER: That's right. And this is what the American people are saying over and over, Sean. This is why people don't believe in Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation anymore. This is the reason we're hearing more voices speaking out and the tide is shifting, but something needs to be done. Either the Department of Justice it needs to be restructured, something needs to happen. They need to actually implement and enforce the law. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Where is the attorney general? Where is the attorney general? CARTER: Where are the prosecutors that the attorney general put in charge? HANNITY: Where are they? CARTER: Where is the president? (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Paul Manafort spending 23 hours over 2005 tax case in isolation. CARTER: That's right. But the president has the power, Sean. HANNITY: It's unbelievable. CARTER: The president can declassify or get these documents. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: This is the key and you agree with that? Do you agree with that, Gregg? The president has the power to declassify and demand all of this. Correct? JARRETT: He can and he can order the Department of Justice and the FBI to comply with lawful subpoenas. failure to do so is grounds for termination, you're fired. HANNITY: All right, guys. Gregg's book in less than two weeks. Hannity.com, Amazon.com. Sara, thank you for joining us. When we come back, the most outrageous conspiracy theory, that crazy NBC has now peddled about Donald Trump and Russia. Sebastian Gorka and Daniel Hoffman, that's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. The destroy-Trump left wing media is no longer in content which was attacking the president, now they are stooping to really insane conspiracy theories. What do I mean? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does Russia has some kind of leverage over Donald Trump? The new cover story from New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait argues, we have not allowed ourselves to consider the full range of possibilities. Chait lays out what could be considered the worst-case scenario for Trump- Russia collusion. That Donald Trump has been a Russian intelligence asset since 1987. JONATHAN CHAIT, WRITER, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: Nineteen eighty seven is when he went to Moscow and he is vetted by the Russians, and tours Moscow, and then he comes back then he start talking about running for president for the first time. And then he starts talking for the first time about how our allies are a bunch of freeloaders and we should kick them to the curb. So it really dovetails with Russian foreign policy then and now. Now again, that's probably a coincidence but it might -- it might not be. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: OK, a Russian asset. OK. Now these bizarre conspiracy theories, that even extends to Trump's Supreme Court nomination. Again back to yes, NBC News, Tom Brokaw. Your proud reporter had to delete this tweet claiming the president and Justice Kennedy had conspired to select Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Joining us the now the author of book, \"Why We Fight\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Gorka, and Fox News contributor, Daniel Hoffman. Dr. Gorka, it's really simple. OK. He was an asset since 1987, and now we figure it out. But today he basically was telling Germany don't rely on Russia, which if they didn't would tank Putin's economy in a year. SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: Sean, I can play their game, too. So all the people that you showed all the staff members at the New York Post, the Washington -- New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC. I don't have any evidence but I think that lizard men from another dimension. It might be true, I don't have any evidence. This is journalism today. They are like cornered rabid rats. They have been selling us lies for so many years that now they can't go any further except to double down. Because if they did anything else-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Double down on-- GORKA: -- they would have to admit to us. But they have to admit to us that they had been lying. So they just invent new stuff. HANNITY: Daniel Hoffman, this is your business, this is what you have done including Russia as working, as a CIA operative. I don't even know what to say about this, it's basically everything they say, you just can't trust any of it anymore. Dr. Gorka is right. It's all lies. It's all agenda driven. DANIEL HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Sean, this started with John Brennan who did a great disservice to the national debate on national security by openly speculating without evidence that Vladimir Putin could blackmail the president. Now Brennan later retracted his speculation but the damage was done. And Brennan should have known really that he speculates in his known peril. And if he had something to say he could have gone to the special counsel. But he really framed the debate, and that's what greatest -- of greatest concern to me, was just his absolutely unprofessional and very partisan behavior. HANNITY: It's even actually worse than not. GORKA: Sean? HANNITY: I mean, and I'm not even joking. I mean, Tom Brokaw spent his life, and I don't think he agrees with Sean Hannity but people like Tim Russert, this is not NBS News anymore, Dr. Gorka. This is a whole new entity-- GORKA: No. HANNITY: -- which is basically innuendo, conspiracy theories, outright lies, fake news and an agenda to destroy the president and delegitimize him and it's been going on for two years. Three years, actually. GORKA: Let's do what they do. So let's take Daniel's really important point. So, John Brennan isn't Joe Sixpack. He is the former director of the CIA. And he leaves government service and still has his clearances, I don't know why he hasn't been stripped of his clearance goes on-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: By the way, wasn't he -- doesn't he vote -- he was a communist, wasn't he? GORKA: He voted for Gus Hall in 1976, the communist party candidate for president, and then was hired by the CIA. Incredible. HANNITY: What a great country. GORKA: Now he goes -- he goes -- he gets picked up as a contributor on left-wing media, he spins what Daniel said about the president being vulnerable, and then he's basically doing Putin's work for him. Let me play the game they do, Sean. Is John Brennan getting paid by Putin to spin this? I don't have any evidence, Sean, but it could be. That's how reprehensible-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: It could -- anything could be. GORKA: Right. But it's reprehensible. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And Daniel Hoffman, it's the president -- what the president was saying to Germany is don't rely on Putin and be so dependent on him considering we're spending all this money to possibly deal with a hostile Russia. And if, in fact, Germany listens, their economy is done because that is their economy. So the president doesn't seem to be too bold into Vladimir Putin tonight. HOFFMAN: Yes. My late father used to tell me to be faithful to the facts, they won't steer you wrong. And I think it's important for viewers just to parse out those facts you're talking about, Sean. That's what matters. HANNITY: All right guys, unbelievable times we are living in, fake news at its worst. All right. When we come back, Rush Limbaugh, amazing strong words for a liberal elites attacking the president for holding our NATO allies accountable to pay their fair share. We pay 70 plus cents of every dollar. That's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Rush Limbaugh had some strong and powerful words for the so- called foreign policy experts, you know, liberal pundits who want the U.S. to apologize for everything after they attacked President Trump for his tough and fair rhetoric at the NATO summit. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST: There are these people who think they are they gifted special elites, the experts in diplomacy, who really believe that Donald Trump is going to turn the world against the United States. These people are predominantly liberal and therefore they are laden with guilt. The United States is the problem. We must act like we are the problem. We must acknowledge where the problem. We must let our, quote, \"friends and enemies\" know, yes, we understand that we don't have any moral authority here to determine right and wrong and so we must pay for this access or pay for that. And Trump has had it. He's not doing this anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And then drop off 150 billion in cash and other currencies in cargo planes to mullahs in Iran. All right. Thanks for that comment, Rush right on the money. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. We are in London. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

            "article_content": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz Party won a supermajority in elections in April. (AP) Hungary\u2019s populist government is brimming with confidence after a comfortable election win in April, and is pushing ahead with tough policies on immigration and combating the influence of left-wing Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. President Trump spoke with Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week, congratulating him on the formation of the new government. According to a readout from the White House, the two \u201cagreed on the need for strong national borders\u201d and pledged to keep relations between the two countries strong. While Orban\u2019s Fidesz Party had been expected to win the election, analysts had cautioned that the party\u2019s decision to campaign almost exclusively on the issue of mass migration could hurt its standing as voters\u2019 focus was elsewhere. Allegations of corruption and authoritarianism from human rights groups also risked damaging Fidesz\u2019s standing in the polls. But Fidesz\u2019 focus paid off, and the party emerged with a strong majority in the Hungarian parliament. Now, the populist government is cracking down not only on immigration but also the influence of Soros, whom Orban has accused of leading a \u201cmercenary army\u201d via his non-governmental groups. \u201cGeorge Soros had a clear target, to beat this government, to fire this government but that was not very successful, let\u2019s put it this way,\u201d Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Fox News in a recent interview in New York. On Wednesday, the Hungarian Parliament passed the \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill, including a measure making it illegal for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to organize illegal immigration into the country. Such organization can range from financial support to the distribution and preparation of information and pamphlets. SOROS GROUP PULLS OUT OF HUNGARY AS ORBAN GOVERNMENT FLOATS 'STOP SOROS' PACKAGE The law would punish individuals engaging in such activities with up to 12 months in jail. The government has also floated a 25 percent tax for any foreign funding for NGOs helping migrants. \u201cThis strengthened protection is needed because the mass immigration afflicting Europe is continuous, while the Soros network and the pro-immigration policy of Brussels are creating the threat of attempts to also swamp our country with migrants,\u201d Orban\u2019s office said in a statement. While the legislation targets any non-governmental organization, Szijjarto made it clear who the government was targeting: \u201cSoros is the number one organizer of such activities.\u201d Soros is in the crosshairs of the Hungarian government. (AP) The government\u2019s anti-Soros activities and rhetoric have not gone unnoticed. Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation has moved its Budapest offices to Berlin after what it described as a \u201crepressive political and legal environment.\u201d \u201cThe government of Hungary has denigrated and misrepresented our work and repressed civil society for the sake of political gain, using tactics unprecedented in the history of the European Union,\u201d Patrick Gaspard, president of the Open Society Foundations and a former Obama White House political affairs director, said in a statement last month. \u201cThe so-called Stop Soros package of laws is only the latest in a series of such attempts. It has become impossible to protect the security of our operations and our staff in Hungary from arbitrary government interference.\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Europe Director told The New York Times that the new law marked \u201ca new low point in an intensifying crackdown on civil society and it is something we will resist every step of the way.\u201d Hungary has long been a pariah in the eyes of the European Union and United Nations, and was one of the few governments to initially push back against the opening of Europe\u2019s borders during the 2015 migration crisis. But it has also drawn close to the Trump administration and has welcomed some comparisons to the Trump movement -- noting that it has built a fence on the border and deployed troops to secure it. Szijjarto recently met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, the first such meeting in six years, where the State Department said they discussed increased U.S. investment in Hungary, as well as a defense cooperation agreement. The Hungarian government is likely to be buoyed also by Trump\u2019s criticism of more liberal immigration policies in Europe, particularly in Germany. \u201cBig mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday. Speaking to Fox News, Szijjarto echoed a similar sentiment and said that shutting down mass migration was not just about economics, but also about security and culture. \"We don't want a post-national and post-Christian European Union. We want a Christian European Union based on strong member states,\" he said. Orban\u2019s dominance in Hungary comes as populist and nationalist parties have picked up significant wins throughout the continent. Italy recently installed a populist government which has taken a tough line on immigration, while in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is scrambling to keep her fragile coalition together amid feuds over migration policy.",

            "article_content": "President Trump says Saudi Arabia has been maybe the biggest investor in the U.S. Trump also says he loves the U.S. and it has taken second fiddle. At his campaign rally in Houston this week President Trump declared that he is a nationalist, and you would think he\u2019d called Democrats \u201cdeplorables,\u201d or something. As soon as I heard the forbidden word, I knew the liberal media would call 911. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have more pride than to allow Trump to pull their chains so easily, but like conditioned hound dogs, they started barking their indignant condemnations. \u201cIt is a favorite of the \u2018alt-right\u2019 and is loaded with nativist and racial undertones,\u201d groused CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. Lemon\u2019s rabid colleague, Jim Acosta, directly confronted the president, saying, \u201cThere is a concern that you are sending coded language, or a dog whistle to some Americans out there, that what you really mean is you\u2019re a white nationalist.\u201d Not to be outdone, MSNBC Host Nicolle Wallace said President Trump\u2019s self-reference as a nationalist was not a \u201csilent\u201d dog whistle because he was being outspoken about being a nationalist and even doubling down on it. \u201cDo you think he knows some of the great nationalists of all-time included Hitler?\u201d she asked her guests. \u201cDo you think he has any idea the history of World War II or Nazism that it came from a call for nationalism?\u201d Likewise, MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell said that Trump \u201cknows that in America the word \u2018nationalist\u2019 usually follows the word what? White nationalist.\u2019 \u2026 When Donald Trump uses that word, he wants you to hear it as racist\u2026 That is Donald Trump\u2019s way of saying: \u2018I am a white nationalist.\u2019\u201d Why don\u2019t Lemon, Acosta, Wallace, O\u2019Donnell, and the rest of the Trump-hating cabal quit hiding behind the pretext that \u201cother people\u201d are drawing these despicable inferences? They\u2019re the ones spreading this inflammatory bile. They don\u2019t even talk to people on the street like reporters of old. They just wallow alone in their own toxic echo chamber. Trump denied the charges, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that theory about being a nationalist. \u2026 and I am a nationalist. It\u2019s a word that hasn\u2019t been used too much. I\u00a0think it should be brought back.\u201d Knowing exactly how the media would react to Trump\u2019s utterance, I considered what he meant and shared my opinion on Twitter: \u201cMy honest take: Trump believes in a strong, exceptional America. He\u2019s not a political scientist. He doesn\u2019t speak in code. When he says, \u2018I\u2019m a nationalist,\u2019 he\u2019s not winking at Neo-Nazis. He\u2019s saying, \u2018I\u2019m a patriot and you PC people can\u2019t make me quit using the word, \u2018nationalist.\u2019\u201d For two years leftists have demonized Trump as a dark-hearted, alt-right, white supremacist hell-bent on returning America to the days of Jim Crow. They paint Trump\u2019s unapologetic, America-first patriotism, especially his hardline stance on illegal immigration, as a thinly disguised racist manifesto. Nonsense. Yes, Trump may occasionally bait malcontent journalists, but he\u2019s usually straightforward to a fault. He was simply conveying that he\u2019s a super-patriot who is determined to restore America\u2019s strength and prosperity. The smear that Trump is sending racist code to his base only makes sense if his supporters themselves are racists. Why else would they respond to such an abominable message? But make no mistake \u2013 the liberal media and other Trump haters want the rest of America to believe that Trump-supporting conservatives are racists who long for a white America. We don\u2019t think in such sick terms. These malicious attacks on Trump must be seen for what they are: an indictment of his millions of supporters. The left has long tarred Republicans as racists but now that Trump is at the helm of the party, they are more brazen about it. Trump supporters are not racists, but they are proud of their country and are sick of politicians, universities, and Hollywood denigrating and apologizing for it, undermining its sovereignty and rule of law, and promoting policies that weaken it. Additionally, it\u2019s inconceivable that Trump would deliberately open himself up to yet another bogus charge of racism and alienate minority voters at the very time he\u2019s trying to woo them through his policies and messaging. The virtue-signaling liberal press don\u2019t get it. Trump supporters don\u2019t need to be prodded to vote. They\u2019re already plenty energized by the positive direction in which America is moving under Trump\u2019s leadership and their certainty that the Kavanaugh-slandering, open borders Democrats would slam it into reverse if they are restored to power.",

            "article_content": "CNN reporter chose to debate President Trump about the migrant caravan at the news conference. Howard Kurtz provides insight on 'Special Report.' There was no talk of a thumpin\u2019 or a shellacking, as when George W. Bush or Barack Obama lost Congress. No, Donald Trump says an election in which his party lost the House was actually a good night. It was \u201csuch a very Big Win,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cand all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!\u201d And: \u201cTo any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!\u201d It\u2019s not fake when news organizations offer a different election analysis. But the press corps didn\u2019t help itself Wednesday with behavior that sometimes bordered on obnoxious. There are a number of things that the president can say about the midterms. He helped the Republicans increase their margin in the Senate, and undoubtedly helped individual Senate and gubernatorial candidates. By nationalizing the election, he might have blunted what could have been a Democratic wave \u2014 say, winning 40-plus seats instead of at least 27 \u2014 in the House. At a combative news conference Wednesday, Trump said that what happened at the polls Tuesday was \u201cvery close to a complete victory\u201d \u2014 despite counter-campaigning by Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. By ending one-party government in Washington, I think it\u2019s fair to say that voters wanted to put a check and balance on the Trump presidency, but not deliver a repudiation. At the same time, the outcome might have been different were the Republicans not blessed with such a favorable Senate map. There was some obvious partisanship in the media coverage. The lead story in National Review was \u201cRepublicans Hold the Senate,\u201d though that rather predictable outcome is less important than Dems flipping the House. (A later update made the site\u2019s lead \u201cSplit Decision.\u201d) The Huffington Post posted this: \u201cU.S. Election Rules Doomed Democrats\u2019 Chances of Taking the Senate.\u201d It seems that \u201cthe disproportionate representation of small states is part of the body\u2019s original design. But that advantage, which benefits white voters, has become more lopsided than the framers of the Constitution likely ever imagined.\u201d So they\u2019re back to saying states like North Dakota and Montana shouldn\u2019t have two senators. I\u2019ll leave it to readers to decide whether the New York Times' lead news story was tilted in a certain direction: The outcome was a \u201cforceful rebuke\u201d of Trump, and voters in urban and suburban districts \u201chave recoiled from the president\u2019s demagoguery on race. ... \u201cWhat was effectively a referendum on Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary conduct and hard-right nationalism may make some of the party\u2019s lawmakers uneasy about linking themselves to a president who ended the campaign showering audiences with a blizzard of mistruths, conspiracy theories and invective about immigrants.\u201d By contrast, Dan Balz, the Washington Post\u2019s dean of political reporters, found there was a red wall: \u201cAll year long, Democrats talked optimistically about a blue wave that they believed was building around the country, one powerful enough to flip control of the House and even, against the odds, put the Senate in play as well. But a somewhat different reality began to set in early in the evening as the familiar contours of red and blue America powerfully reasserted themselves.\u201d Those who say nothing really changes now for the president are just engaging in spin. But what happens next is a more complicated question than it might seem. Trump, a former Democrat, could of course choose to find some common ground with Nancy Pelosi, who may want to demonstrate that her party can help govern rather than just attack the president. In fact, he gave the once-and-future-speaker a shout-out: \u201cI give her a great deal of credit for what she\u2019s done and what she\u2019s accomplished.\u201d Trump said he\u2019ll now have \u201ca much easier path\u201d than if the GOP had held the House by a couple of seats, because Democrats will come to him with plans \u201cand we\u2019ll negotiate it. ... It really could be a beautiful, bipartisan type of situation,\u201d and \u201cmuch less gridlock.\u201d Perhaps. We\u2019ll have to see what happens, as POTUS likes to say. And if there\u2019s a total impasse, Trump said, \u201cgovernment comes to a halt and I would blame them.\u201d Nor was it a good sign when Trump tweeted that if the Democrats \u201cthink they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigate us,\u201d then \u201cwe will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!\u201d Finally, Trump\u2019s complaints about the media came into sharp relief when he called on his nemesis, Jim Acosta. CNN\u2019s White House correspondent debated the president about the caravan \u2014 \u201cIt was not an invasion\u201d \u2014 and questioned whether Trump was demonizing immigrants. After a couple of exchanges, Acosta tried to ask another question.\u00a0Trump said he was moving on, and the reporter actually refused to give up the microphone when an aide tried to take it. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, put down the mic,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person, you shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN. You\u2019re a very rude person, the way you treat\u00a0Sarah Huckabee\u00a0is horrible.\u201d When Trump called on NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander, who defended Acosta -- \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of yours, either,\u201d the president said \u2014 Acosta yelled a question about pipe bombs. \u201cWhen you report fake news,\u201d Trump said, \u201cyou are the enemy of the people.\u201d Acosta seems to resort to grandstanding and interruption in most of his interactions with Trump.\u00a0And the White House late yesterday temporarily suspended his credentials, claiming he had been \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" This was the aide asked to take his mike, and there was only incidental physical contact. The administration would have had a stronger case saying Acosta wasn't following the rules. By yanking his hard pass, the Trump team shifted the spotlight back to its treatment of the press and turned Acosta into a journalistic martyr.",

            "article_content": "'We cannot allow the world's leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet's most dangerous weapons,' President Trump says at the United Nations General Assembly. President Trump put Iran on notice Tuesday at the U.N., and illustrated his vision for a world marked by sovereign nation states peacefully pursuing their own national interests. In this his second speech at the U.N., Trump continued to put his approach in stark relief to that of his Democratic predecessor,\u00a0 Barack Obama, who often waxed poetic about \u201ca rules-based international order\u201d \u2013 a phrase of globaloney that simply doesn\u2019t reflect the real world. The globalists who comprise most of the U.N. audience laughed when Trump listed solid domestic economic accomplishments that have global implications, especially rapid economic growth, full employment for minorities and women, and record-high stocks.\u00a0 But grateful Americans and those around the world who wish their leaders would follow Trump\u2019s example aren\u2019t laughing. Trump also showed how the United States is pursuing a foreign policy that is not interventionist, but actively pursues critical national interests just as other sovereign nations do. For example, Trump continued to evolve our policy toward the expansionist Islamist theocracy that runs Iran from the disaster he inherited. These basic concepts of sovereignty and eschewing interventionism are the fundamental pillars of a Trump doctrine.  What progressives have dismissed as nationalism and populism is actually a return to the sovereignty of the democratic nation state. Trump lamented Iran\u2019s sweetheart nuclear deal from Obama and European governments that opened spigots of money while allowing Tehran to keep the key components necessary for a nuclear weapons program. Obama also sent the Iranians a plane-load full of cash in the middle of the night; Trump referred to this \u201cwindfall for Iran\u2019s leaders,\u201d which they used to spread \u201cmayhem and slaughter\u201d around the region. Trump has methodically replaced this policy with one of toughness, which nonetheless leaves the door open to negotiations. Trump affirmed in New York that oil sanctions would take effect on Iran in early November. (While unmentioned, the Trump administration is also debating whether to force the SWIFT system, which facilitates international financial transactions, to cut off Iran.) All of America\u2019s Middle East allies support us in this effort. But unpopular leaders currently running the governments of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have not only opposed the tougher measures against Iran, but worked actively to undermine the sanctions. Trump made clear that the United States would stick to its guns and sanction companies doing business with Iran\u2019s government.\u00a0 That vow plus his explanation of Iran\u2019s nefarious attempts to spread violent jihad around the Middle East should convince erstwhile European governments to back down. Trump also reiterated that America is through playing the sucker on trade. The U.S. trade-in-goods deficit with China had spiraled to $376 billion in the year he took office, and the European Union\u2019s had reached $147 billion the previous year. Since then, Trump has reached landmark agreements with Mexico and South Korea on trade, with more agreements expected in the coming months. Contrary to self-proclaimed \u201cfree traders\u201d who moan that Trump is turning to protectionism (from a free trade ideal that has never actually existed), Trump made clear at the UN that the United States merely seeks \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d trade arrangements \u2013 namely equivalent tariffs and the absence of other barriers to fair trade. But the most fundamental takeaway from the speech is Trump\u2019s focus on sovereignty, not only for America but for other countries. He began his speech saying that the United States seeks independence and cooperation, rather than global governance and domination. The president promised to continue his efforts to return to a traditional American foreign policy that will \u201cnot tell you how to live or worship.\u201d He specifically rejected the \u201cideology of globalism,\u201d embraced patriotism, and lamented uncontrolled immigration. Even when it comes to Iran, he called not for regime change but a change in conduct. He also pointed out some of the many shortcomings of the United Nations, observing that he pulled the U.S. out of the Orwellian-named Human Rights Council and continues to ignore the International Criminal Court \u2013 also known as the World Court \u2013 which is more interested in prosecuting Americans than thugs. These basic concepts of sovereignty and eschewing interventionism are the fundamental pillars of a Trump doctrine. What progressives have dismissed as nationalism and populism -- not only with Trump\u2019s election and administration, but also with the vote in Britain to leave the globalist European Union and the election of new right-leaning leaders in many European nations -- is actually a return to the sovereignty of the democratic nation state. As with other nations, we will decide our laws. We will decide whom to allow to immigrate. We will decide what culture we want.\u00a0 And we will decide our destiny. Trump has given more form to this fundamental patriotic impulse that is swelling in America and elsewhere in the world.",

            "article_content": "GENEVA \u2013 Threatened U.S. funding cuts wouldn't be \"fatal\" for his office, the United Nations' human rights chief said Wednesday, but he added that he hoped other countries won't follow suit. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein insisted \"the office will continue to survive\" even if the U.S. carries out the promise made by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton in an interview with The Associated Press last week. Zeid told reporters Wednesday that \"clearly what one doesn't want to see is a whole series of withdrawals and withdrawal of funding.\" Bolton's pledge that the U.S. will cut funding to the rights office and the U.N.'s top human rights body was the latest Trump administration salvo against U.N. institutions. The U.S. is the U.N.'s largest single donor, providing about 22 percent of its budget, and the rights office gets much of its funding through the general U.N. budget. But Bolton's warning about the budgetary axe didn't deter the rights chief, who gained praise from many human rights advocates for being outspoken and unafraid to challenge governments, from reiterating his concerns about President Donald Trump's rhetoric. Zeid, who is a Jordanian prince, repeated his previous concerns about Trump's \"very worrisome\" attacks on journalists. He added that \"the conduct of the president should be under very careful scrutiny by the international community, by this office\" during the upcoming mid-term election cycle in the United States. The comments came at a wide-ranging news conference before the expiry of Zeid's four-year term at the end of this month. He will be replaced as U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights by former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. He also expressed concerns about rising far-right nationalism in Europe, and noted recent reports by U.N. investigators that condemned abuses in places like Yemen, Myanmar and Nicaragua. He said he would urge his successor to be outspoken when she sees rights abuses around the world. He also reviewed his tenure, pointing to new U.N. human rights monitoring offices set up in that time in countries including Honduras and South Korea, a post to monitor possible abuses in the North.",

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Media Buzz,\" October 28, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: On \"Media Buzz\" this Sunday, President Trump and the media escalate their warfare over who is to blame for the mailing of pipe bombs to CNN and leading Democrats even after an unhinged suspect is arrested.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN HOST: He blamed the victim tonight. For him to sit there and blame us -- we are the victims here.\u00a0\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: And only us.\u00a0\nLEMON: It's disgusting.\u00a0\nCUOMO: They just sent a bomb to CNN and the president doesn't say a word about that and then tells us we are to blame.\u00a0\nMARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL: The idea that Donald Trump is responsible for these attacks is patently absurd, any more so, by the way, than the idea that Hillary Clinton was responsible for the shooting of Steve Scalise.\u00a0\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, HOST, MSNBC: We don't know who sent the packages, but I do know in my heart that President Trump bears a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the media would be targeted.\u00a0\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: The president shows instead to blame one of the intended targets, a target that he himself views and has called publicly an enemy of the people.\u00a0\nSEAN HANNITY, TALK SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: We are on day four of what is the media's shameful attempt to connect President Trump, Fox News, talk radio, even me to these horrible actions of a madman.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: And that debate extends to yesterday's flutter at a synagogue in Pittsburgh that claimed 11 lives with \"The Washington Post\" saying Trump is being accused of fostering the toxic environment for such political violence. Is there a journalistic reflex to blame the president?\u00a0\nConstant coverage of the caravan as the press accuses President Trump of using the migrants as a way of stirring up his base over illegal immigration and journalists say lying in the process.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nLAWRENCE O'DONNELL, HOST, MSNBC: Of course the Democrats had nothing to do with creating a movement of people in central America so that Donald Trump could use that movement to people as a campaign device to lie about so that he can create more fear and loathing in his desperately fearful supporters.\u00a0\nGREG GUTFELD, HOST, FOX NEWS: It was the media and the advocacy groups who seized on the spectacle to begin with, to create an ugly political issue. And then they go, but look what Trump is doing. They are a bunch of hypocrites.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Were the fact checkers challenging the president once again? Former communications chief Anthony Scaramucci said yeah, he lies, but his supporters don't care. Is that true? \"The Mooch\" will be here.\u00a0\nPlus, NBC has dumped Megyn Kelly from \"The Today Show\" after a fierce backlash to her comments about dressing up in blackface.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMEGYN KELLY, JOURNALIST AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm Megyn Kelly, and I want to begin with two words. I'm sorry.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Why was that apology not enough to save her morning show job? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"\u00a0\nPresident Trump's initial response to the first wave of pipe bomb attacks against former presidents and a former news outlet was to asked both sides to tone it down.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and often times false attacks and stories. Have to do it.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: But CNN president Jeff Zucker chastised Trump and Sarah Sanders in saying there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media.\u00a0\nThat prompted the president, by the way, to ratchet up his rhetoric on Twitter. \"A very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news.\" And then his rallies as well.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Emily Jashinsky, culture editor at \"The Federalist\"; Sara Fischer, media reporter for \"Axios\"; and Adrienne Elrod, Democratic strategist and former Hillary Clinton campaign aide.\u00a0\nEmily, what do you think of journalists and pundits blaming President Trump because of his rhetoric for what was an unknown perpetrator sending pipe bombs to CNN and Barack Obama and the Clintons and Joe Biden and other leading Democrats?\u00a0\nEMILY JASHINSKY, CULTURE EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: I think it's unfortunate and it takes responsibility away from the where it belongs, with the sick and twisted individuals who are committing these heinous crimes whether it's yesterday, whether it was earlier this week with these pipe bombs to blame anybody but the people responsible for this.\u00a0\nI find it disgraceful and unfortunate. Of course, my prayers are with the victims of all of these crimes right now. But I just -- it was tough to watch some of the media coverage this week as well.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Adrienne, and we see this on the synagogue shooting as well. We'll talk about it in a moment. No matter how much you may -- people may dislike President Trump's rhetoric, fake news, enemy of the American people against the press, I've been critical of that, is the finger pointing unfair when the suspect who was arrested Friday has a long history of crimes and terror threats that way predate Donald Trump being in politics?\u00a0\nADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AIDE: The media coverage, the media blaming is not unfair because while I'm not going to sit here and blame Donald Trump for any this, I will say that the divisive and hateful rhetoric that he has as president of the United States, he did this when he was a candidate.\u00a0\nFrankly it helped get him elected. He is still doing it now as president. That is a big problem here. And what he could have done this week --\u00a0\nKURTZ: It's a big problem. It's fine to say that, when you say here, are you tying that to people using bombs and rifles to kill -- trying to kill other folks?\u00a0\nELROD: I am saying that there is a divisiveness in this country that the president of the United States has created and he goes to his rallies, he criticizes the media. We've had media who of course had to have secret service protection. He is not doing anything to try to bring this country together.\u00a0\nHe could have used this moment and yet he said couple of things earlier this week to try to, you know, say we need to unify, we need to come together, and then he attacked CNN. Let's also not forget, Howie, that he tweeted a video last year of him in a wrestling outfit tackling a CNN reporter.\u00a0\nKURTZ: All right. Let me get to Sara. By the way, even after the suspect was arrested, Steve Schmidt, Republican strategist and MSNBC contributor, said, Trump created an atmosphere where a sick person, a criminal, somebody like this terrorist would actualize Trump's clear intent. So before, it was like, well, don't blame Trump because he might be a lunatic. Now, it's like, yeah, he's a lunatic but he loves Trump, so we can still blame Trump.\u00a0\nSARA FISCHER, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: I think that Donald Trump's rhetoric fans the flames for an already existing problem. And so as Adrienne said, there are things that he can be doing to create more unity so that you're not having people that are acting out and blaming, you know, pundits or targeting pundits. But Donald Trump is not doing that.\u00a0\nHe might say it's time to call for unity, but then he goes out in his rallies and he endorses people who are beating up on journalists. He still continues to attack CNN. And so I think you're in a little bit of a chicken in the egg situation. Once Donald Trump starts, then the media fights back, and it's not a very presidential thing to start.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah. There was, by the way, some divisiveness in this country before Donald Trump was elected. Let's turn the camera around because here you have Donald Trump saying the media should be more civil, and I'm seeing very less self-reflection on that. Isn't it true that cable news and the web reward divisive rhetoric and play up inflammatory soundbites?\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: This is what's been difficult for me to watch as a conservative, someone who has monitored just terrible media coverage for years and it's part of the reason that I came to the city to do what I do because I grew up so frustrated by this. It's a hard -- I hesitate to talk about it now, because obviously CNN was the victim this week. They had a device sent to their headquarters, whatever.\u00a0\nBut when you see at rallies people chanting \"CNN sucks,\" I would never do it personally, but CNN makes no effort to understand why people feel that way. They do the opposite, right?\u00a0\nThe act like they're the victims, that they've done nothing wrong to deserve this, and they have played -- I mean the chyrons that CNN ran on their lower thirds this week, some of them are ridiculous, and that's what get people so upset.\u00a0\nAnd so there is no room for violence. There is no room to be sending devices to CNN. It has to stop. I hate it, but there is a need for self- reflection.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I want to get to the chyrons. I'll come to you, Sara, so, first of all, CNN's New York bureau was evacuated along with the rest of Time Warner Center, and the anchors had to go out on the street and report, Jim Sciutto, Poppy Harlow. So, this was personal for CNN. I understand some of the emotional reaction we are seeing.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, here is John King, CNN anchor, saying on the air that he doesn't blame President Trump for the pipe bomb attacks, and look at this on-screen headline. CNN: Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber. Sara?\u00a0\nFISCHER: This happens all the time. If you are a web producer and you're changing the headline on the web article, that doesn't reflect the article. The same thing happens in TV. It doesn't make it OK.\u00a0\nKURTZ: CNN made an editorial decision to put that on the screen.\u00a0\nFISCHER: They absolutely did make an editorial decision, but it wasn't necessarily John King's decision and that's --\u00a0\nKURTZ: You know, I'm not blaming John King, I'm looking at the network.\u00a0\nFISCHER: Right. Well, the network is going -- quite honestly, the network is going to blow this up. And they are going to be a little bit hyperbolic to be completely fair because quite frankly they feel personally attacked and because also they feel as though inciting that sort of really, you know, it's like that move is going to resonate with their audience.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Adrienne, I have a presidential tweet for you on this very subject put up on the screen. \"Funny how lowly-rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them, they go go wild and scream, it's just not presidential.\"\nELROD: Look, again, I agree with everything that we all said here. This has been an ongoing issue with President Trump and CNN. Obviously, Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, had every right to say what he said because CNN is taking this very personally.\u00a0\nBut Donald Trump has a big issue here. Anytime there is an article or any sort of media that he doesn't like that criticizes him, he calls if fake news, when really it's oftentimes covering things that he said, whether he was misspeaking, was lying about something, didn't get facts straight, and he has really caused a lot of distance the very beginning of -- when he started running for president.\u00a0\nSo, this is an ongoing issue. I wish that we could set -- take this moment and use it as a reset so that the media and the president could start from ground zero --\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah.\u00a0\nELROD: -- and we could do a reset.\u00a0\nKURTZ: If anything, there has been an escalation. By the way, this suspect in the mail bombs, spewed a lot threats and hate on Twitter, and Twitter did nothing. Twitter needs to step up on this.\u00a0\nSo, there was also a presidential tweet -- I'm not going to read the whole thing, but basically he was complaining about all the coverage that the mail bomber was getting, saying this was slowing the momentum of the Republicans to the midterms, news not talking politics. President took some heat for that.\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: Yeah, I think it sort of reveal the mindset that I wish the president of the United States didn't have. If something happens, you shouldn't automatically be jumping to the political implications of it and how it can be used politically. I didn't like that at all. I mean, this was such a tough week. There are so many things in so many different directions that were disappointing to see. That tweet was one of them.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Adrienne, you know, a lot of the critiques I find in the president are about his style. So for example, he didn't mention CNN by name in terms -- he didn't mention Barack Obama. He didn't mention the Clintons. He didn't call any of them.\u00a0\nELROD: Right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And I think there was a lot of criticism in the press, things a traditional president would do, but as we know, Donald Trump is not a traditional president.\u00a0\nELROD: Correct, but still, even he is not a traditional president, there are things that he can still and should do as president of the United States. He should put all his animus aside that he has for Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and the Obamas and CNN and get on the phone to call these people and say let's use this as a moment to come together, and I'm sorry that you went through this. He didn't do it.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Yeah.\u00a0\nELROD: Even if he's not traditional, he still should have done that.\u00a0\nKURTZ: He could have said, look, I've been highly critical of CNN and I stand by that criticism, but it is greatly unfortunate that this pipe bombs were sent and, you know, people felt threatened. You think about people losing their lives, whether it is somebody in the mail room or one of the anchors.\u00a0\n\"The New York Times\" had a wrap-up the other about a conspiracy theory that went out there before the arrest. This was some left-wing scam, these were harmless bombs sent by Democratic operatives to generate sympathy, and talking about how it spread from fringe conservative websites, people like Ann Coulter, the mainstream media.\u00a0\nLou Dobbs had a tweet that he posted then deleted, talking about fake bombs. Are some at the media too quick to give this conspiracy theories oxygen? Obviously we know now it's not true because the person was arrested.\u00a0\nFISCHER: I think a lot in the media are really too quick to give them oxygen. Part of the problem again, as you mentioned, the social media. You see these conspiracy theories and hash tags go viral instantly overnight. And so they look as a sense of false authority, like they are getting tons of pick up when in reality it is just standing the flames it's not.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. So then television producers see this and say, oh, it has a thousand re-tweets or million likes or whatever. I guess it's news. We are not endorsing it but then you are kind of spreading it. I think we need to be a lot more cautious about that. Let me get a break here.\u00a0\nAhead, Anthony Scaramucci on his former boss's continuing war and the media and vice versa. But when we come back, the horrifying shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Some in the press actually trying to tie this one to the president as well.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: After a gunman who openly despise Jews opened fire yesterday in a Pittsburgh synagogue killing 11 eleven people and wounding six others, President Trump denounced what he called an evil act produced by the poison of hatred against the Jewish people who he said have been persecuted for centuries.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: This was an anti-Semitic attack at its worst. The scourge of anti- Semitism cannot be ignored, cannot be tolerated, and it cannot be allowed to continue.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: And today \"The Washington Post\" from page -- above the fold headline pointing to this and other recent attacks states critics as saying the president and the GOP have gone beyond partisan political convent and to outright demagoguery against racial minorities, foreigners and prominent Jewish political figures.\u00a0\nEmily, I am not saying the press shouldn't hold the president accountable for his rhetoric which sometimes gets hot which sometimes is offensive to many people.\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: Right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: But critics, the critics and couple of liberals say he's fomenting right-wing extremism like it didn't exist before.\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: Yeah, \"The Washington Post\" story was very disappointing because anti-Semitism is something that festers at the fringes of both parties. It completely exists on both sides.\u00a0\nAnd to say that because -- to tie it somehow to -- again, we had this conversation in the last bloc as though the person that is responsible for this is not responsible on their own as though anybody else has any responsibility for what happened in that synagogue yesterday. It is just disappointing. It is really disappointing and wrong.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And Adrienne, my heart absolutely breaks for this tight-knit Jewish community in Pittsburgh where this hateful shooting took place in a place of worship. The shooter had a history of anti-Semitic social postings.\u00a0\nBut as far as President Trump, there were many mass shootings when Barack Obama was president including the tragedy of the nine African-Americans killed in the South Carolina church. So from the press perspective, it is not like this violence began with the Trump administration.\u00a0\nELROD: Correct. This has been going on for a long time now. Mass shootings unfortunately have been going on for a long time. But there is still an underlying threat to the pipe bombs, to the shooting that happened yesterday, and that is hate.\u00a0\nThe president of the United States regardless of political party has the responsibility to do everything that he or she can bring this country together. And the media is not seeing that from President Trump even though I will give him credit for his words yesterday, which were unifying. But we need to see more of that.\u00a0\nAnd I think that the press does have a point when they say, if the president was doing more to unite this country, you know, we might have -- we might see less of this.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Just briefly, Emily, it's not one side. And doesn't the press also have the responsibility to be more careful and what's reported and in inflammatory language and attacks?\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: I believe that's true. I will say that in this context, I don't -- obviously both sides have responsibility, but in this context, I don't want to say that either of those things -- I don't want to say the press caused it, I don't want to say the --\u00a0\nKURTZ: No. I'm talking about mutual responsibility.\u00a0\nJASHINSKY: Yes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: President also getting some flack for saying, well, better if there were armed guards at the synagogue. I don't know if there can be armed guards at every place of worship in America. \"Slate\" had a headline, Sara, the president's dehumanizing language has made political violence and hate crimes like this, the synagogue shooting more likely.\u00a0\nJulia Ioffe, GQ writer who lost a previous job for tweeting a so-called joke about president and incest, posted this yesterday, \"word to my fellow Americans Jews: This president makes this possible. Here. Where you live.\u00a0\nFISCHER: Going too far. Absolutely going too far. The president's rhetoric, again, it doesn't help, but the president's rhetoric is not what caused this particular --\u00a0\nKURTZ: She was talking about moving the embassy to Jerusalem which by the way was the official policy of many congresses but just never got enacted. Yes, so when journalists do that, it's your fault, it's your fault, it's your fault, and that undermines credibility. The president had nothing to do with what happened in Pittsburgh.\u00a0\nFISCHER: Going back to what Emily was saying before about CNN, I mean, the media has to understand what Trump supporters feel when it comes to the media taking one side, and it's tweets like that, by the way, which make them feel that way.\u00a0\nI did account earlier this year, I found that 12 journalists, 12 had lost their jobs this year due to political tweets that were taking one side or another. A lot of them had to do with, by the way, the media going overboard about their criticism of Trump that were unwarranted. Think about Dave Weigel and the tweets from \"The Washington Post\" about crowd sizes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Jemele Hill of ESPN --\u00a0\nFISCHER: That's right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: -- calling him a white supremacist.\u00a0\nFISCHER: Yes. Journalists have to take accountability for being fair even in an environment where it can be difficult.\u00a0\nKURTZ: You know, there is a long history here and a blame game depending on who the target is. So, we talked about the shooting at the Republican baseball practice last year in Virginia and Steve Scalise almost killed. And the guy there hated Republicans. Left-wing rhetoric can't be blame for that. Some tried to do that.\u00a0\nHe liked \"Rachel Maddow Show.\" She absolutely nothing to do with it. This guy watch Fox News. Male bomber had nothing to do with it. This goes back to, you know, Sarah Palin being blamed even recently by \"The New York Times\" for the shooting Gabby Giffords because she put out a political map. When Timothy McVeigh blew up the Oklahoma City federal building. Bill Clinton went after Rush Limbaugh over fostering climate of hate.\u00a0\nThis has to stop. These are not the people responsible. We should hold them accountable when they go too far in their rhetoric, including the president and others and including the media as well. Great to see you all this Sunday, Adrienne Elrod, Sara Fischer, Emily Jashinsky.\u00a0\nAhead, President Trump accuses the Saudis of a terrible cover-up in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Isn't that what the president has been saying all along? Up next, President Trump makes the Central American caravan a major midterm issue with plenty of help from the media.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: It's known simply as the caravan, the thousands of migrants who have made their way from Honduras to Mexico, and President Trump has turned it into a daily television story. What's driving the coverage as Trump knew it would is the pundit challenging his motives and making the migrants a major midterm issue.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nNIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: One of the things you do see him doing is sort of ginning up the culture war, kind of ginning up this idea that there is this horrible brown people, you know, coming to America, possibly Middle Easterners, even though there is no evidence of it.\u00a0\nLAURA INGRAHAM, TALK SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS: Rather than doing actual reporting and digging into this, it is easier to take up the mantra of the left, embed yourself with the migrants, actually, act like you're a migrant, emotionally manipulate the audience and then dismissed Trump as just a heartless fearmonger.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: The media also turned the caravan into a debate on the president's veracity and he gave them the ammunition.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Do you have evidence that there are terrorists in this caravan?\u00a0\nTRUMP: You know what you should do, Jon, go into the middle of the caravan, take your cameras and search. You're going to find MS-13, you're going to find Middle Eastern, you're going to find everything.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: But the White House offered zero evidence as the president had to admit.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nTRUMP: They could very well be.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): But there's no proof.\u00a0\nTRUMP: There's no proof of anything. There's no proof of anything, but they could very well be.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: While Trump weighs an emergency plan to close the border to the migrants, that was leaked to \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" He stoked the debate with a term that sparked anger on the left.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nTRUMP: And I say really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK?\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\nTRUMP: I'm a nationalist.\u00a0\nJIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist.\u00a0\nLEMON: Nationalist. Use that word. We are going to talk about that word tonight. It is a favorite of the alt-right and is loaded with nativist and racial undertones.\u00a0\nTUCKER CARLSON, CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FOX NEWS: Hitler was a nationalist. Of course so were Mahatma Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln and every other leader of every other nation state throughout history until about 20 minutes ago, but whatever.\u00a0\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Huge difference between nationalists and white nationalists. Now, the press was right to call Trump on his unproven charges but round up helped him turn the caravan into a major controversy by taking the president's bait.\u00a0\nAhead on \"Media Buzz,\" why did NBC move so quickly to dump Megyn Kelly after an on-air blunder? But first, Anthony Scaramucci says Trump supporters will never abandon him, even if they think he's lying. \"The Mooch\" is here live.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ, ANCHOR: Some presidential confidants praise him no matter what, but our next guest has sometimes been critical of the president including on this program. Joining us from Los Angeles is Anthony Scaramucci. The former White House communications director and author of the new book, Trump: The Blue-Collar President. Now, you've told me that you don't like President Trump's constant criticism to the press, you've told him as well, what do you make of liberal critics in the media, pundits, some anchors who say that Donald Trump's hot rhetoric and enemy of the American people brought sides against the press, have helped foster a climate that helped produce the pipe bomb attacks.\u00a0\nANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: OK, I think that's obviously unfair. I mean, you can't link a madman or people who have mental illness, and say well, it's because of the presidency. So you can't hold him accountable for those people. But if you are asking me could the president deescalate a little bit and have his approval ratings go up, and be seen a little bit differently, Howie, I absolutely believe that. I think he has got a 5- to 7-point head wind from some of the rhetoric.\u00a0\nAnd so, he may say well, that's what got me to the presidency. But I think now is a moment for him where he could go to another level. And there is no reason he couldn't be in the mid-50s getting with what I see going on in the economy...\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: And how happy people are with, you know, jobs and wage growth et cetera. So you can't hold him accountable for those people. That's ridiculous.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Some people in the press -- some people in the press also tying it to the horrible synagogue attack in Pittsburgh yesterday that killed 11 people. So if you think he can help himself politically by toning down the bellicosity and just for example, you know, he never made any public mention that CNN and Barack Obama, and the Clintons and so forth were targets for these pipe bombs, why doesn't he do that, because he believes it helps him politically not to?\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: Well, you know, I don't even think he's that contemplated with that. I think he's biologically designed where when people are smack talking against him, he'll smack talk back two, three or four times. And so, he doesn't like the fact that he has been treated unfairly.\u00a0\nThe Harvard study says 92 percent of the press treats him negatively. And so when they are coming at him, he'll come at them four or five times. But if he slowed it down one notch, and just dialed in some level of you know a smoother edge if you will, it's not saying he doesn't have to be adversarial. This whole whirl-like thing is just hurting him.\u00a0\nSo, to me, calling President Obama, as an example, about a sign of graciousness, that would help him with that 5 to 7 percent of the people that really like him, but they are a little bit concerned about the sharpness of the tone and they're concerned about the angry rhetoric.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Let me ask you about the president's veracity, a major topic of the media. Let me just briefly play a clip from MSNBC's daytime news anchor Stephanie Ruhle.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nStephanie Ruhle, MSNBC ANCHOR: Every day the president of the United States lies. And every day the media fact-checks him. And if we would like that to stop, he should stop lying.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: So that's the daily drum beat, Trump lies, he exaggerates, he creates his own facts. And you've said sure he lies, you've told him not to lie, but journalists and other opponents make a mistake in thinking this is the way to beat him on that question. Explain.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: Yeah, well, I mean, number one, I think you know it's a little bit of puffery. It's all about that exaggeration. It's like what my grandfather would say, why let truth get in the way of a very good story. The president has an entertainment streak to his personality, particularly at these rallies.\u00a0\nAnd so, he does play to the crowd. And I think that these hall monitors, and the media that are quote, unquote, fact-checking him and have all of these anger are making a very big mistake. It's OK to say hey, he said this, but here's the facts. But to get all upset like that, I think it's not helping them.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: If anything, it has galvanized the president's base.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Well, sometimes...\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: They don't like when I say -- don't cut me off.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I'm not going to cut you off, I will give you a chance to answer. And sometimes, I think he just gets things wrong. In other times, perhaps he doesn't want to know what the reality is, but think about what you are saying. You are his friend, his former aide, you wrote a book praising him as a blue-collar president, so you're clearly routing for him. And you're acknowledging a pretty steady stream of lies by the president of the United States, you said he can lie -- he can tell 10,000 lies as far as you are concerned. And yet, you're saying it doesn't matter. So are you giving him a giant pass?\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: Well, I don't think so. I didn't say it didn't matter. I think it's fine for the media to hold him accountable. I'm saying something differently. I'm saying...\u00a0\nKURTZ: You're saying his supporters don't care. You're saying his supporters do not care.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: I'm saying that his supporters have felt a vacuum. I write in my book, Howie, that the middle class and lower middle class for whatever reason have never felt an advocate in the Oval Office at least for 30 or 40 years. Some of my Democratic friends will be mad at me for saying that. But just think about what happened, he hijacked the base of the Democratic Party and moved it over to the ledger of the Republicans. And so, how did he do that? He did that because these people want jobs, they want higher wages, and they want better things for their children.\u00a0\nAnd so, the Democrats focused on a lot of the social issues and the appropriateness of being politically correct, and some of the environmental issues, and I'm not even taking issue with any of that. But I'm just explaining that it left a wide-open berth for somebody like President Trump to step in there.\u00a0\nSo he may say some mistruths, he may say some things that you don't like. But guess what, those people are galvanized around him, they like him, and he's going to win re-elections. You would be so much better off as a Democrat, if you say wow, you know, he did steal our people. Let's change our product line and speak to those people about policies that can work for them rather than fact-checking the president of the United States.\u00a0\nKURTZ: You told CNN -- you told CNN that Trump is not a nationalist. But then, he says he is -- that creates some controversy, because he wants you, the network, the media, to be upset about it. So, is some of what he does in this realm simply aimed at sticking it to the press or generating a big press reaction, which then amplifies his message?\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: So the fact that people don't understand what you just said is an absolute fact. I find it ironic. It's almost laughable. So he's clearly not a nationalist. He can go out tomorrow night, and speak somewhere, you know, pick a location on a campaign trail, call himself a nationalist. But the Orwellian definition, the Barbara Tuchman definition, the 200 years of understanding the spectrum and the rise of nationalism, he's a peace keeper. He's not a nationalist.\u00a0\nAnd so, he can keep saying it. And if he wants, it will rile up the media. The media will focus on that. And then again, they're missing the point on the deliverables to blue-collar people, blue-collar families and the middle class.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Last question because I have got half a minute left. In your book...\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: It's a sleight of hand, Howie.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Sorry to break in. In your book, on your 11 days as communications director, you now say, you told Meet The Press that John Kelly, chief of staff, has hissy fits and he's hurting the president. Given that Kelly was the guy who kind of helped usher you out of the White House, is this a little personal on your part?\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: Yeah. I mean, listen, if you want to think it's personal, that's fine. I have been fired before. John wasn't the first person to fire me. I've also had to fire people. So it's not personal. I am just being observational of what I see going on. And if you think I'm the only person that is a current or former White House staff member that thinks that way, that's fine, too. But I know that's not the case.\u00a0\nBut that's another reason why I couldn't really survive in Washington. Because, you know, I like speaking very plainly, telling people the truth. So if you think it's personal, I will let people that are viewing your show evaluate that. But for me, it really wasn't personal. I don't like the way I was fired. I think it's ridiculous to fire a guy like me like that, given the amount of money I raised, the media advocacy, and support of the president. You didn't have to do it that way.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Got it.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: I think it's ridiculous. That's a poor reflection on him.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I like people who speak plainly. That's why I like having you on. Good luck with the book, Anthony Scaramucci. Thanks for joining us.\u00a0\nSCARAMUCCI: Thanks, Howie.\u00a0\nKURTZ: After the break, the Saudis changed their story on the Khashoggi murder again. Guess what, it was premeditated. How do you cover such mendacious lies?\u00a0\nAnd later, why Megyn Kelly's apology for her blackface comments isn't enough for NBC.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: This week's pipe bomb attacks follow a media uproar over the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi. And after weeks of shifting cover stories, Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor now says yes, evidence suggests the killing of the Washington Post contributor was premeditated. And President Trump stands as he bombs as well.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nTRUMP: It was carried out poorly and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups. It's very simple, bad deal should have never been thought of. Somebody really messed up. And they have the worst cover-up ever.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Joining us is Fox News correspondent, Gillian Turner. And Gillian, when the cover of the Khashoggi murder was at its peak, some people, especially on the right, said the media were overplaying this because it was a columnist, one of their own. Maybe it's a way to criticize the president. Now that CNN is the pipe bomb target, you are not hearing that as much, perhaps because the targets also included Obama, the Clintons, Biden, Eric Holder, and so forth.\u00a0\nGILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think what the media was reacting to was the fact that the president did not come straight out and blamed, condemned the Saudis and the royal family. The media is very prickly about this. It's not just when it comes to Saudi Arabia. It's not just when it comes to President Trump when they feel he's hedging, he's not being forceful enough in condemning America's enemies. They get mad.\u00a0\nAnd that's what, you know, we saw that with Kim Jong-un, with Vladimir Putin, now, it's the crown prince.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Well, should the media is entirely prickly because the Saudis were telling a ludicrous story. I mean, last week on this program, we had Bret Baier with the foreign minister who was peddling the fistfight story. It was just a fistfight that interrupted inside a consulate in Turkey. Now, we have the president coming around. Initially, he seemed inclined to sort of defer to the Saudi explanations. Now, he says it is the worst cover-up ever. So were the media right to keep pushing on this?\u00a0\nTURNER: I think so. You know, he came - the president came out on the right side, eventually. I guess he was waiting for whatever his own reasons were. It was very well said, it was the worst cover-up job in the history of maybe all time. So it is obvious to everybody.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. Initially, they said he went out alive.\u00a0\nTURNER: Right.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Then it was a fistfight. And then, finally now, premeditated, which was obvious all along.\u00a0\nTURNER: And you know, as a member of the media and as a member of the American public, what the Saudis were peddling here was offensive for the first two weeks.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. Now, the crown prince said it was a heinous crime and so forth. How do reporters cover a regime, that in this case at least, blatantly lied again and again. It's now evident. This is not an opinion. It's fact.\u00a0\nTURNER: It is fact. I will say though that it's also something that foreign governments do. They lie to the United States. It's not something new.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Maybe this was such a high profile case, or that the media made it such a high profile case with Khashoggi.\u00a0\nTURNER: And the media doesn't have the make the same considerations that the government does, right? I mean, they have a different rule. They don't necessarily have to worry about American national security interests the way that President Trump does.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Well, balancing act with trade and military with the Saudis.\u00a0\nTURNER: Exactly.\u00a0\nKURTZ: They can just sort of be morally outraged, especially if a journalist happens to be involved. Now, we are seeing some of the same finger pointing going on with the yesterday's mass shooting in a synagogue in Pittsburgh. I mentioned earlier some headlines suggesting President Trump and his tone is perhaps to blame. It brings this up, which is what's your reaction as a reporter when people said nobody cared about this Khashoggi killing except for journalists and how come you journalists didn't care about the deaths in Benghazi, which I take exception to?\u00a0\nTURNER: I do, too. I got a lot of comments when I was reporting on the Khashoggi murder from folks in social media saying exactly that, saying how can you care about one person from Saudi Arabia when we have a caravan careening towards the U.S. border, when we had Americans murdered in Benghazi. It's spurious line of reasoning.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Everybody cared of the fact four American lives were lost in Benghazi. Then it became a two-year investigation with a lot of political overtone. And so...\u00a0\nTURNER: That was part of the -- I don't know where the line of thinking originated, I don't know if it was a government sort of line that's being pushed or whether people came up with that on their own. You know, this is just one person. They are not an American, he has ties to Hezbollah.\u00a0\nKURTZ: That's a bad guy anyway, they claim, yeah.\u00a0\nTURNER: You know, I don't know where it came from, but it was completely ineffective.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I think the one that we can conclude is that in the current climate even murder, even violence can and is being politicized. And that's sad to me at least. Gillian Turner, great to see you.\u00a0\nTURNER: Thanks.\u00a0\nKURTZ: I know you got a busy day today.\u00a0\nStill to come, NBC spent $69 million to lure Megyn Kelly from Fox. Why is the brass now so quick to dump her?\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Megyn Kelly was talking about Halloween of all things on her NBC morning show when she made a big blunder.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nMEGYN KELLY, NBC HOST: Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts in blackface Halloween or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween, like when I was a kid, that was OK, as long as you're dressing as a character.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: The former Fox News host also apologized to her colleagues in a letter. But that didn't stop the criticism within NBC or the coverage on the network.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nAL ROKER, TODAY CO-ANCHOR: Well, the fact is, while she apologized to the staff, she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country, because this is a history, going back to the 1830s.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: Her comments came during a panel discussion on her program this morning, quickly sparking a backlash over remarks many viewed as racially tone deaf.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKELLY: I'm Megyn Kelly and I want to begin with two words, I'm sorry. I learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country, it is not OK for that to be part of any costume, Halloween or otherwise.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nKURTZ: NBC has now confirmed reports by me and other journalists that it's ending her role anchoring the third hour of the Today Show. Joining me now from New York, Marisa Guthrie, television editor for the Hollywood Reporter. So how big a mistake were these blackface comments considering that Megyn Kelly made a full apology on the air?\u00a0\nMARISA GUTHRIE, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER TV EDITOR: Well, they were the last nail on the coffin. She had been talking to Andy Lack, the NBC news chairman, before she made the comments about winding down her 9:00 a.m. show. It wasn't necessarily working. She had lost nearly a half million viewers compared to the show she replaced, which was a lot cheaper to put on.\u00a0\nAnd so, she had angered NBC news management by aggressively reporting on Matt Lauer by reporting on the accusations against Tom Brokaw, and then, by suggesting that NBC should hire an outside investigator for the Ronan Farrow, Harvey Weinstein reporting. All of these things that made NBC news management very angry, so the blackface...\u00a0\nKURTZ: Well, hold on. So she made them angry by being aggressive and reporting when it came to NBC people. Look, there was a lot of resentment against Megyn and NBC. She also felt that she wasn't being supported. There were a lot of leaks that seem to come from NBC against her...\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Yes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: In places like New York Post...\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Yes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: So, when you have say final nail in the coffin, it almost sounds like NBC seized upon this admitted mistake as a way to orchestrate her rapid exit.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Look, I think that if she had not done all of those other proceeding things, and her ratings were great, and management liked her, they would have supported her. But they signaled pretty right away with that report on NBC Nightly News the night -- the day she made the comments, that was nearly 5 minutes, the report, which was an eternity for a 22- minute broadcast.\u00a0\nSo they signaled right away that the gloves were off, that they were not supporting her, that she had no support internally.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right, a long report. I give NBC for covering it, but the way in which it was covered suggested that there was maybe a bit of a grudge. And then, there were these leak reports that Andy Lack, as you say, the NBC News chairman, had privately condemned the reports, the staff members.\u00a0\nSo it seemed like you know this all happened so quickly...\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Yes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: That Megyn Kelly had almost no chance to fight back. And you know, I also give her credit for the apology. I mean, it wasn't like she went out and said everybody should go on blackface. She just put it, it was a serious mistake. But as you say, was the resentment also tied to the fact she was making so much money, the $69 million contract, and that she came from Fox?\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: I think that she -- her persona, and her on-air style, a prosecutorial interviewer, somebody who challenge orthodoxies, like she brought to NBC. That's who she was when they hired her.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. That was NBC was getting.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Exactly, exactly. And this has been a, you know, narrative in all of this coverage that she may have convinced herself that she could do this morning thing. She may have convinced NBC executives, but they should -- they should have used a little more introspective and knew what they were getting.\u00a0\nAnd so, you put her in that and the demographics of morning TV and daytime TV have changed. So you know her style worked very well at Fox News. You know, she was a tough interviewer. She was a really strong interviewer. And so that didn't fit with daytime TV. She was bringing all that to the 9:00 a.m. hour of Today.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: And it was causing all sorts of problems.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Well, I understand the debate. It wasn't a great fit in all of that. But at the same time, it seems the way -- the way in which she was pushed out over this, a way that made her seem guilty despite the apology was just brutal -- was just brutal.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: But they let her go on and apologize.\u00a0\nKURTZ: Right. And that was her last day.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: Yes.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And then, suddenly, she's gone. All right. We got to go. Marisa Guthrie, thanks very much for sharing your insights.\u00a0\nGUTHRIE: No problem.\u00a0\nKURTZ: And that's it for this edition of \"Media Buzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" July 17, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right that's all the time we have left for this evening. We'll always be fair and balanced, we're not to destroy Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Why didn't you come to Helsinki? Me and Tucker flew to Helsinki, you didn't fly to Helsinki. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I could have been your interpreter. I'm not special, you boys are the special ones. HANNITY: Special ones? All you got to say is I want to go to Helsinki and we would have brought you. INGRAHAM: You're the special ones. Well I could have given the Russian translation for you, I could have gotten you better service to the Russian translation. But Hannity I got to say your show was great and the point that Trump made yesterday when he said, he was clearly annoyed that the Mueller investigation has hamstrung the relationship with Russia. It has. HANNITY: Bingo. INGRAHAM: It has and we've been saying that from the beginning. It's been killing our attempt to rebuild our relationship. HANNITY: You know Laura, there's one point in it. When the president said to me that up to five hours ago it was atrocious. The way he was explaining it was it sort of let the air out of the room because they're reading everything that's being said about them now. Do I think they're bad actors? Of course. Is he a bad actor? Yes, they're a hostile regime and they've done it before but it happened on Obama's watch. INGRAHAM: Yeah and President Xi has just our best interests at heart. We roll out the red carpet for at every administration so come on. Every time they say Russia, I say China. Hannity fantastic reporting from Helsinki, really enjoyed it and great show tonight. HANNITY: Right, yeah. Have a great show tonight. INGRAHAM: All right good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is 'The Ingraham Angle.' We have a pretty stellar show if I do say so myself tonight. Barack Obama is trying to turn President Trump's summit controversy into, of course, his own personal gain and perhaps electoral gain for the Democrats, that's the focus of tonight's Angle coming up in just a bit. Plus Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may not be a Democrat savior but a razor line wedge in her own party, unbelievable story, we're going to explain. And you will not believe who's suing the victims of that Las Vegas massacre at the Mandalay Bay, a survivor joins us details. But first, firestorm around the president's meeting with Vladimir Putin. Today the president moved to clarify his comments that cast doubt on the Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the president's support of U.S. intelligence services. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have never been in a worse relationship with Russia than we are as of a few days ago and I think that's gotten substantially better. I think it has gotten the possibility of getting much better. I accept our intelligent community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. It could be other people also, there's a lot of people out there. It should have been obvious, I thought it would have been obvious, but I'd like to clarify just in case it wasn't. In the key sentence in my remarks, I said the word would instead of wouldn't. The sentence should have been, \"I don't see any reason why I wouldn't, or why it wouldn't be Russia.\" President Obama along with Brennan and Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now are probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks. They knew about Russia's attempt to interfere in the election in September and they totally buried it. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Bingo. That last point, of course, is lost in the media's frothing hysterical coverage of the controversy these past two days, I've never seen anything like it. But can President Trump successfully quell the rage from his critics? Some on the right, one of the neo-Conservative never Trumpers and on the left. Joining us now with reaction Matthew Rajensky he is a Russian expert, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan institute. Don Bramer former Intel officer along with Dr. Walid Phares, a Fox News foreign affairs analyst, great to have you all on. Don I have never witnessed a purposeful meltdown on the left and some on the right, after this summit in Helsinki. The president comes out to clarify his remarks today and it wasn't good enough. It wasn't good enough for the media, it wasn't good enough for Democrats and as we'll get to in a few moments in my Angle, it wasn't good enough for President Obama, well he spoke before the clarification. Your reaction. DON BRAMER, FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Well is it ever going to be good enough? As the president said, he could part the Red Sea and it would never be good enough. You know, it was a gaff, he messed up, who hasn't made a gaff on the global stave? I mean President Bush he got sick in Tokyo. And we forget President Obama, he bowed before the Saudi King so it was a missput. INGRAHAM: Oh JFK cruise ship as our friend Craig Shirley pointed out last night. Walid the idea that the president of the United States is like working as a secret mole for Russia on the world stage in Helsinki and it really trying to conspire with Putin to undermine Americans interests as he's hitting the Nord Stream Two pipeline, as he kicked out 60 diplomats, as he continues sanctions, as he sent lethal weapons to the Ukraine. His actions against Russia have been tougher than Obama's across the board and yet all of this is lost on the Trump hating media and also of course the Democrats. I've never seen anything like this, honestly. DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS ANALYST: Laura the problem is that we have a president that needs to handle his mission. Any president of international security, that's what the summit was supposed to address. Ukraine, the Baltics, Syria, many issues in Africa in addition to the nuclear issue which is extremely important. And on the other hand, we have our American politics being displayed in Helsinki, that's shouldn't have been the case. The debate about our U.S. politics should have been in Washington, not addressed there. But my concern now is that many of the countries with whom we are going to be partnering or containing are looking at us as undecided. If they cannot decide with Russia and the other powers as to how to solve this crisis, we're going to lose. INGRAHAM: Matthew, your reaction. MATTHEW ROJANSKY, DIRECTOR OF WILSON CENTER KENNAN INSTITUTE: Yeah my sense is that the Russians from the very beginning, obviously they're muffed around in American politics but they're goal here was to weaken the United States and when you look at a president who faces almost certain opposition from Congress on anything he tries to do in his view to advance the American national interest vis-.-vis Russia, he's not going to able to get it done in Washington because he's going to be blocked by congress. That's mission accomplished for the Russians if they're goal was to tie the hands of the president of the United States. Now I think this is going to back fire on Russia because in the long term because the United States is the leading world power and to get the status and the recognition that they need, they need to be able to cut deals with the United States. So they have in effect hamstrung, yes, the president but also their ability to cut the deals that they need to cut whether it's on what Walid very correctly says, Ukraine, Syria or nuclear. INGRAHAM: That's a good point. I want to share with all of you this series of hysterical reactions on the part of the usual suspects claiming that now we're at a quote, \"national security crisis\" because of what happened in Helsinki, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARK WARNER, D\u2014VIRGINIA: The fact that the president in his very weak performance couthoused to Putin and accepts his version of the facts, I frankly think that's a national security risk. CARL BERNSTEIN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: We now have a real national security emergency in this country. MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: This is a national security crisis and the president of the United States flew all the way to Finland, met with Vladimir Putin and basically capitulated. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: What substantive issue Don did the president capitulate on? We stopping sanctions? No longer arming the Ukrainians? Are we doing any other things with bringing back diplomats that we've expelled? What did he do? BRAMER: No and not one thing did Putin walk away with. He walked away with a few good minutes of press that he can go home and build his propaganda machine. You're absolutely right, those 60 diplomats, they're still gone. That Washington consulate still closed. We've increased lethality with the second brigade in Germany, we've put 30 millimeter weapons right on the front lines to go against his machines. So what did he get? He got a few good minutes on press. INGRAHAM: Walid. PHARES: I think that the national security threat that we're going to be facing are really what's happening now in Syria. The Iranians are taking the borders all the way to Israel. Iraq tonight is fallen apart to all these demonstrations. Iran is moving across-- INGRAHAM: They talked about that, they addressed the issue of Iran behind closed doors. PHARES: We need to make a distinction, Laura. Let the two presidents and all other leaders address national security or the international security issues and then at home we have a-- INGRAHAM: The left doesn't care Walid. You're acting like this, I'm sorry but the left does not frankly care about that. It's get Trump, kick him out of office and impeach him, whatever you can do. That's what they're focused on and you're making this really good cerebral argument about geopolitics. What's going on and what you're hearing from these senators is outrageously irresponsible, there are serious issues at hand and to claim that the president is the poodle of Putin because a few verbal missteps is. As if Obama didn't make missteps, how about his disappearing red line which we are going to get to in a moment. That was a substantive misstep. Matthew your reaction to that, it's a national security crisis that we spoke with Vladimir Putin after Obama spent eight years trying to do a reset that never happened. RAJENSKY: I think that the starting point for this debate is really partisan politics in the United States and the genius of Russia's meddling, whatever it is exactly that they targeted our weakest point. They knew that this was stirring up a hornet's nest and it puts the United States in a position where instead of driving bargains on, for example Syria, we've got to Iran out of southern Syria. Russia is very interested in seeing Assad regain control so if Russia just gets the part it wants, we don't get Iran out of southern Syria, we can't advance the security of the state if Israel in that region then we lose. And again a president who has got his hands tied in foreign policy and who's got the Hill out to get him is going to have a very hard time doing that, that's a win for Russia. INGRAHAM: Yeah. And by the way, despite the president's verbal snafus missteps, the last 24 hours have seen these dangerous hysterics over Russia and astounding hysterical illiteracy at the same time, here's just a sample, the Washington Post blared, ' It's not wrong to compare Trump's America to the Holocaust, here's why,' How about this from Politico, 'Putin's attack on the U.S. is our Pearl Harbor' and then this gem last night on MSNBC. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JILL WINE-BANKS, FORMER WATERGATE PROSECUTOR: I would say that his performance today will leave an infamy as much as the Pearl Harbor attack or Kristallnacht. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I keep saying I don't have words for this. Walid Kristallnacht or Pearl Harbor 2,900 Americans died at Pearl Harbor. I'm sure many Jewish Americans will have something to say about Kristallnacht. PHARES: Unfortunately when our domestic politics that deeply divided what we are going to have is in a much more dangerous situation. This whole file will end in a few months, let's say a year, but the results that we see on the ground internationally we're going to pay for that if we are not united against them. INGRAHAM: Don. BRAMER: Well look, I completely agree with Walid and we've got to move forward from this. You know as long as we stay divided then all of our adversaries continue to win-- INGRAHAM: But is the Intel community demoralized, crippled, upset about what Donald Trump did in Helsinki? I mean I know that's hard to say and generalize but that's what you hear from the left, \"He's destroying the morale of the intel community\" as if the intel community is perfect. We screwed up a lot along the way, for decades we've gotten things wrong, cataclysmic intel failures but a lot of successes too, I mean that's the way life is. BRAMER: The Cold War wouldn't have decreased had it not been for the intel community and professions we had. Sure mistakes are going to be made and you're going to have people that are netter at their job thank others in the intel community just as you have in any profession. But I think at the end of the day, most Intel professionals, they move forward they know their job, they do it right. Whatever happened in the world stage of politics, they put that behind them because they've seen this before. INGRAHAM: Yeah and it's the heads of the intel agencies and the things that people like Brennan are saying, traitorous, treasonous. When a former CIA chief is going to that level of rhetoric about the current president of the United States, no wonder President Trump thinks that when he was running for president, this guy was working to try to prevent him from being president. I mean we're going to treason? Honestly that and my old friend George Will had a very unfortunate column today. It was called I think, do we have full screen of it? I think we do. It's called, 'This sad, embarrassing wreck of a man.' It's always personal too, \"America's child president had a play date with KGB alumnus who surely enjoyed providing day care\" Blah blah blah, again very personal, Matthew close it out for us. RAJENSKY: Listen Laura, it I had the president's ear what I would tell him to do right now is he's got some really smart people advising him. Have his senior national security officials' work a good deal with Russia, whether it's on getting Iran out of Syria, whether it's getting a renewal of nuclear arms control which we have to do. Russia is the world's other major power, we have to do that. INGRAHAM: They're doing that I understand. RAJENSKY: Call everybody's bluff by bringing that deal back to Washington and saying to the senate, \"Look, are you going to rectify it or not?\" And then it's on everyone's record, did they support or did they not support a good deal for the United States of America? And they can't play politics with it or they can but they pay the price. INGRAHAM: Right and that's a substantive determination, everybody can put their cards on the table and I think they are working on that. PHARES: Strategic maturity, that's what we need. INGRAHAM: Exactly. Excellent panel guys, thanks so much. And with President Trump under attack from his critics, guess who's trying to capitalize on the moment? We'll tell you in a moment on the Angle.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Obama to the rescue, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Before President Trump could even clarify his statements in Helsinki, President Obama pounced. Speaking in Johannesburg, he hit the sitting president, populism and attempted to breathe life into his own sad legacy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look around, strong man politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, that those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Okay well the people and their will give democracy it's meaning. Don't you love how Obama attempts to write Trump off as some Putin-like dictator and for good measure, he tries to lend credence to the line that Trump, of course, is siding with the old KGB and Putin over all our intelligence agents and services. A point the president clarified and batted down today as we just played in the previous segment. And let's not pretend that America, by the way, hasn't had a history of making convenient alliances with unsavory strongmen. We do so when necessary to achieve greater objectives for our country. I'm thinking for instance Mubarak and Saddam Hussein, just to mention a few. And remember Obama himself abruptly cut short a big meeting with our key democratic ally India to attend a memorial service for King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a bit of a strongman don't you think? Maybe some strongmen are better than others, when Obama's involved with a strongman they're fine. The former president also makes the mistake of assuming that Trump and the millions of people who turned out to vote for him just came if of the ether, just dropped from the sky. Well Trump was elected in part because many were fed up with the weak man leadership of Barack Obama, the president who drew red lines in disappearing ink. Voters in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and beyond had had it with globalism, had it with open borders and had it with trade deals that gutted our manufacturing and gave an upper hand to China. Trump voters were also tired of endless wars and they still are. That's called common sense conservative populism. But of course many in the bipartisan establishment that Trump ran against will never admit the failures of globalization and instead like Obama, they choose to denigrate the sceptics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: In the west you've got far right parties that often times are based not just on protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: When in doubt, play the race card. Well this is pure identity politics, that's what Obama's really good at and on the global stage no less. All to help rescue Democrats in the midterms, and by the way could that be interpreted as criticizing America on the global stage in a foreign country? I think so. Whipping up racial divisions is a typical Democrat tactic and one we've already seen deployed by, for instance Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the new bright light of the Democrat Party, Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, Maxine Waters the list goes on and on. Obama there is Johannesburg just makes it sound slightly more erudite with all those poignant pauses. Then of course he couldn't resist the launching the internationalist tired old refrain against populism with a few lines that could have been written by George W. Bush himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: The fact countries which rely and rapid nationalism and xenophobia and doctrines of tribal, racial or religious superiority as their main organizing principles, the thing that holds people together, eventually those countries find themselves consumed by civil war or external war. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I hope he's not talking about our country. Well I could think of Japan for instance which has strong nationalistic streak, it prizes their culture and has a very strict immigration policy. Are they on the verge of civil war? I don't think so. Look Obama's star turn today was designed to seize on the opening that's the globalists feel that they have after Helsinki. But as usual they overreach and they have this really convenient case of amnesia regarding their own role in the rotten state of affairs with Russia. These are the facts though, Obama did not reset a relationship with Russia even though he bragged about it all the way through 2012. And Obama consistently underestimated the challenge posed by Putin's regime. And this is the assessment from the Brookings Institution, no fans of Trump. Writing 'at the end of Obama's two terms Putin had elevated Russia to a credible revisionist power on the international stage. Russia annexed Crimea and occupied much of Eastern Ukraine. By successfully propping up the degenerate Assad regime, the Kremlin gained veto on any possible political solution to Syria and got a meaningful foothold in the broader region. Fueling both anti-Americanism and illiberalism and most damning of all, it managed to meddle almost unopposed in U.S. politics, all on Obama's watch.' I just read that in the makeup room earlier. The bottom lines is this, the two biggest nuclear powers in the world should have an open and frank line of communication. That's better for America's security and guess what? It's better for global peace. It's what Liberals used to be for, more talk less war. Trump has a realistic and a pragmatic view of the post-Cold War era, the most serious threat to America militarily and economically is not Russia, by the way, with an economy basically the size of Italy's. In fact the biggest threat to America is China. Trump is the first president to make this plain and act accordingly. With tough talk and tougher actions, including terrorists that the globalists are all against. And the globalists are obsessed with Russia of course, they say precious little about China's incursions, China's cheating and China's threats. Why? Because they make gobs of money on arising China. Remember back in 2014 when the Chinese military hacked into the federal government's office of personnel management? China has home addresses, social security numbers and family information on 22 million current and former government employees, including mine. This was Barack Obama with President Xi after the news broke, looked very friendly. Did Obama confront Xi on the world stage then about that hack, huge intrusion? No he did not. And did the media make a big deal of that? No they did not. Did pundits on MSNBC and CNN claim that Obama was in Xi's back pocket for not calling him out? No they did not. But back to Russia. Trump said yesterday that both sides deserve blame for the state of the relationship. Now I might have not said that while standing next to Putin but in a 2016 BBC piece quoting Paul Pillar, a former CIA officer and foreign policy expert he said, 'The relationship went wrong when the west did treat Russia as a nation that had shaken of Soviet Communism. It should have been welcomed as such into a new community of nations. But instead it was regarded as the successor state to the USSR, inheriting its status as the principle focus of western distrust.' Now you can debate whether that was the right thing to do but we opted to expand NATO, he said, and failed in our attempts to turn Russia into an ally, albeit a cagey one. Now that got Russia's back up and it boosted Putin's popularity in his homeland. The truth is lots of people have said what Trump said yesterday, that we should have a better relationship with Russia where we can. Guess who said it? Clinton, George W. Bush and yes Barack Obama. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: America wants a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia. That's why I have called for a reset in relations between the United States and Russia. This must be more than a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House. It must be sustained effort among the American and Russian people to identify mutual interest and expand dialogue and cooperation that can pave the way to progress. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Sounds pretty good so why is that thought now suddenly so subversive? Oh because we have a Republican president in the White House. And by the way a Republican president who's backing up the conciliatory talk, building bridges, with tough sanctions as well. Well the Democrats have the midterms ahead of them they're coming. And Barack Obama and the Democrats clearly fear that Trump might succeed where they failed. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is Glenn Greenwald, co-founder of the Intercept and a deep sceptic of the Intel communities. Glenn the hair-on-fire commentary by the former Intel chiefs yesterday and today is quite something. I want to play for you something that John Brennan said this morning and get your reaction. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: It is a big question first of all for those who are on Mr. Trump's security team whether they can continue to serve in good conscience an individual who basically betrayed his nation. What Mr. Trump did yesterday was to betray the women and men of the FBI, CIA, NSA and others. And to betray the American public and that's I use the term that this was nothing short of treasonous because it is a betrayal of the nation. He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and it needs to stop. And Mr. Trump needs to understand that there are going to be consequences for him too. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Threatening the president there Glenn, your reaction. GLENN GREENWALD, FOUNDER OF 'THE INTERCEPT': So I have a lot criticisms of Trump. There were parts of Obama's speech as well that you referenced today that I thought were good in terms of criticizing global institutions. But the rhetoric that we just heard on the from the director who also was part of the CIA who also was part of the CIA under George Bush as well was incredibly not just unhinged but remarkably dangerous. We're not really at war with Russia which is the prerequisite for treason. And he actually said that Russia is our enemy which is something that the president that he served for right years vehemently rejected even after all the allegations of hacking. If you look at all the nuclear weapons on the planet that can extinguish the human species, 90 percent of them reside in the hands of two countries, the U.S. and Russia. And to create this climate where we declare Russia our enemy is remarkably reckless and dangerous and it's shocking to hear. INGRAHAM: Glenn isn't it the case that there are many on the right, the old neo-Conservatives who I mean there a lot of them who want to keep the Cold War mentality going, Russia's the big threat. We're going to go to war in Montenegro or we're going to go to war in Crimea. They don't like the idea that we have a Republican president reaching out to try to find some areas of common ground. They say they don't mind it but I the end I think they do mind it because it upsets their apple cart, their entire world view post-Cold War. GREENWALD: Look Dwight Eisenhower 60 years ago when he left the White House, no radical he, he was he five star general and the two term Republican president warned that there was this permanent military faction in Washington that would benefit financially ad in terms of power by having the U.S. on a permanent war footing. Something that our founding fathers never wanted. That was before Vietnam, before the Cold war really got underway in a hard core manner and obviously before the war on terror when it's grown and grown and grown ever still. So there's huge factions in Washington that are very vested in always having an enemy that Americans are scared of and right now what Democrats and Republicans, the leadership of each party as sort of a foreign policy lead are working in unison to do is to try and convince Americans to be sufficiently afraid of Vladimir Putin and Russia that they are willing to essentially acquiesce to everything. Interestingly, Obama resisted that bipartisan pressure for eight years. He was a believer that Russia was not a threat, that we ought to try to cooperate with them. It's the Democrats in the post-2016 era looking for an explanation of how Hillary Clinton lost who are trying to essentially find a foreign villain to escape accountability and blame for themselves. And it's a very reckless political game that they are playing. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: What's interesting is to hear that old Obama from 2009 about the need to reset, his comments to Romney, the cold war is over, that sounds like Trump. I mean, that is really what Donald Trump I think thinks. He doesn't think Putin is a close friend. He would like to get along better. He thinks maybe if they had a better personal relationships they could figure things out in Syria, or do better stuff for denuclearization. But the core of what he said there in 2009, I don't think there's much daylight between that core idea and what Trump is trying to do, and he is really, really frustrated that the Mueller investigation called all of his efforts into question. And that spilled over I think into Helsinki. GREENWALD: Yes. There is something that is a political fact that makes people on both sides of the spectrum very uncomfortable to talk about, which is that there is a decent chunk of the populace who voted in 2008 for Obama, and then voted in 2016 for Donald Trump. And the reason is that both of them positioned themselves as outsiders to the Washington establishment. They ran against the orthodoxies of both parties on the grounds that endless war and globalization were destroying the future of the American worker, were destroying the American dream. They promised to radically overhaul what happens in Washington. And it is true that even though Trump and Obama are posited as these polar opposites on a lot of issues, trade being one, but Russia being another, they actually sound a lot more like then it they do different. And it is true that Obama repeatedly refused to do things that Trump did, like sent lethal arms to Ukraine, like bomb forces in Assad, because Obama didn't want to promote tensions with Putin because he thought it would be better for both countries to get along, which is very similar to what Donald Trump is saying. INGRAHAM: You are just not going to hear that analysis anywhere else on television tonight. Glenn Greenwald, thank you so much. Great to see you tonight. And so I have a question. Why did President Trump use the language he did yesterday? Dinesh D'Souza, Byron York have some interesting theories, and all the craziness, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Now, why did the president to use the language he did yesterday that cast some doubt about Russia's election meddling and then kind of revising that today by saying he accepts the findings of the U.S. intelligence agencies? Joining us now with their own theories, Byron York, columnist at the \"Washington Examiner\" and Fox News contributor, the Dinesh D'Souza is the author and filmmaker of the new film, going to be out on August 3rd, everyone has to go see it, called \"The Death of a Nation.\" Great to see both of you. Byron, for people who somehow missed this huge uproar, let's play a part of what was said in Helsinki and then go right to what the president's clarification was today. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: People came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it is not Russia. I will say this. I don't see any reason why it would be. The sentence should have been \"I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.\" It's sort of double negative. So, you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Byron, everyone says he was in a great mood when he got on Air Force One, then he started watching the television coverage and he's like, what, what happened? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It wasn't good. First of all, the president has expressed doubt for a long time about the intelligence community. INGRAHAM: As many of us have, yes. YORK: A long time. And last year, remember he met Putin briefly at a summit in Asia and he came out and did exactly the same thing. Putin said -- he said Putin told me that we didn't interfere and I believe him. It was a huge uproar, and then the next day, Trump came out -- INGRAHAM: Let's play that so people know what you're talking about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That's interesting. Good catch on that. I forgot that he said that. YORK: That was the next day cleanup. Now he has done it again. He said today, I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. So this is something he has learned that he just can't say without causing a huge reaction. INGRAHAM: Is he trying to flatter Putin to get what we want strategically from Putin? Maybe he thinks he doesn't lose anything by saying he feels strongly that he didn't do it. YORK: There are theories about this. That could be one of them. He really wants better relations with Russia, two, he just doesn't believe it, or three, he has never really accepted there are kind of two parts to the Trump Russia investigation. One part is the what Russia did part, which is a legitimate investigation into what Russia actually did. But the other is the get Trump part, which is the part about using the findings to try to remove Donald Trump from office, and he feels like if he gives even an inch to these people, then they are going to take it and try to remove him from office. It is something along those lines. INGRAHAM: Dinesh, you've keyed in on that in examining the theory here. As we see the utter, complete case of the vapors on the part of John Brennan and so forth by calling him a traitor. It's reprehensible what they're doing. They want Trump out of office. Your reaction to these events? DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": I think on the face of it, it should not be surprising that the Russians tried to influence our elections. It is not surprising at all either that Trump would be skeptical of intelligence agencies that seem to of been institutionally mounted against him. So the left's apoplexy here I think has a deeper explanation, and the expedition is this. They are desperate for Trump to ratify the premise of the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation is given a boost if Trump himself, in a sense the very target of the investigation, were to basically say, yes, the Russians are the bad guys, because then Mueller can then push forward and simply try to close the loop by saying, and you are part of that group. So I think Trump's natural aversion to doing that is based upon the correct perception that the left's concern here is entirely domestic politics. They don't care about Russia, per se. These are people for whom election integrity have not exactly been a leading issue. But what they're looking for Trump to do, to force them to do, is ultimately to ratify Mueller's attempt to eject him from office. INGRAHAM: Interesting. I was reminded of Schumer's warning back in January of 2017, he warned Trump about taking on the intel agencies. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D\u2014N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Let me tell, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you. So even for a practical, supposedly a hardnosed businessman, he is being really dumb to do this. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He seems to be in many ways in saying that confirming Donald Trump's reason to be skeptical. I thought the intelligence agencies exist to protect us. Apparently, they are just to get back at us if we question them. He said that, not Trump. YORK: Absolutely. And there is another part of Trump's skepticism which is that he believes this is sort of a plot by Obama holdovers. This all happened during the Obama administration. He feels that there are certain elements in the intelligence community that are out to get him. We should say on the left, they believe the theories are much simpler, that Trump really did collude or that Vladimir Putin has something on him. INGRAHAM: Dinesh, before I let you go, Bill Kristol, George Will, all of these old Republicans, some of them neoconservatives, they are enjoying this moment, right, because they hated the fact that Trump proved them all wrong and won the election. D'SOUZA: I think it's funny. At the left has these people on a leash. It simply has to shout Russia and with Pavlovian response, all these guys will go into a patriotic flair. Here's the point. We know that Obama colluded with Russia when he basically told him, hey, when the American people are out of sight, I'm going to make a deal with Putin. We know Hillary colluded with Russia. She took money in exchange for the whole uranium ideal. The one person who has not colluded with Russia at least as far as we know is Trump. As so the fact that they intelligence agencies are mounting their investigation of Trump whereas they look the other way with the other two guys who we now who have proven to have had Russia ties, this is actually what makes the whole thing so comical. INGRAHAM: How much money did the Clinton Foundation get from Russian interests? YORK: I've forgotten. INGRAHAM: Millions. No problem. YORK: And Bill Clinton got huge money. INGRAHAM: It's only $500,000. Dinesh, you get that for a speech, right, $500,000, no problem. There's nothing out of the ordinary about that. All right, guys, thanks so much. And she is being hailed as the new face of the Democrats, but there are signs that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be ripping the party apart. Oh, goody. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: In a new article on of \"The Hill,\" several House Democrats are criticizing 28-year-old Democratic wunderkind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They are charging that she is attacking fellow Democrats from the left and wrongfully accusing a Democratic leader of mounting a third-party challenge against her. Congressman Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Congressman Lacy Clay calls her patty, it's a lack of maturity on her part. And liberal Congressman Alcee Hastings offered this warning, \"meteors fizz out.\" Joining me now for reaction is Chris Hahn, a former aide to Chuck Schumer, and Democratic pollster and strategist Mark Penn. Great to see both of you. Mark, this is kind of an interesting turn. Five seconds ago she was the future of the party. She was like a huge promotion, cover of magazines. And now it's look out. MARK PENN, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: She hasn't even been elected yet. She hasn't served in office. She hasn't actually done anything in politics. So I think there is of course a split here between the left and the center of the party. And there is going to be a big fight over that, and you can see that fight building now. INGRAHAM: Chris, there was a moment at this, I don't know where this was, but she was talking about the Palestinian question. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET HOOVER, PBS HOST: You use the term, the occupation of Palestine? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: I think what I meant is the settlements. HOOVER: Do you think you could expand on that? OCASIO-CORTEZ: I awm not the expert on geopolitics on this issue. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I'm sorry, Chris, God bless her, she's 28-years-old. She seems like a very interesting person. She's interesting. You know, she's like a nice person. She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Go ahead, you can react to this. CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO CHUCK SCHUMER: Her campaign was about local issues, and they are asking her about global politics, and she's can have to get up to speed on that. And you are right, she's 28. She's got no experience on the national stage. But I see these articles on, who is sniping at her. I think they are a little jealous. She's a rising star, her name is everywhere, people want to get to know her. And of course she's going to make a few people mad. She's an insurgent. That's what happens when there's an insurgency. And people still have a little bit of hard feelings after the primary. But you know what, incumbents need to work their districts or they are going to face the same fate. That's what happens in America. We have elections for a reason, and people have to pay attention to the issues that matter to their constituents. Her issues were health care, child care, and affordability of schools and other things. INGRAHAM: All free. Chris, no one is going to have to pay for it, money is going to fall from the sky, it's going to be like lollipops in every Bush, pick them off and lick them. HAHN: Again, again. INGRAHAM: It's all going to be perfect. I'm sorry, you're right, you're right. The incumbents have to work hard. I agree with you on that. Mark -- HAHN: And one other point, one other point, Laura. Whether or not the party is going to accept her depends on how big their majority is come January. If it's a one-vote, they're going to accept her with open arms. If it's 40 votes, she's going to have to get along INGRAHAM: That's true, and she has to learn a little bit. Mark? PENN: Oh, no, you see, first of all, if it's a very tight Congress, it's the moderates who are going to hold the power, because it's the moderates who really will be able to bring across Republicans, get a majority. It won't be the left. And, also, it's also not a question of stopping bills the way that it was. It's really quite a different power dynamic. So I think this is all overblown. She really doesn't command anything other than media attention, and in fact the right likes to hype her to say that she is the representative of the Democratic Party because she's a socialist. And trust me, 86 percent of Democrats reject socialism. So right now she won an election with 25,000 votes -- INGRAHAM: But we have a poll, this YouGov poll that came out, that 57 percent of Democrats want candidates to be more like Bernie Sanders, 16 percent said less, 27 percent not sure. Bernie Sanders and she are kind of joined at the hip on a lot of these issues. So the left is the future of the party. You are kind of like the old dinosaur, not to be, too personal here, Mark, but you are like this reasonable, moderate, third way kind of Democrat. She is on those posters looking like Eva Peron. Come on, that's exciting. PENN: These moderates have a way of coming back because every time the Democrats wind up in the wilderness, it's the moderates who bring the Democrats -- INGRAHAM: It's not that she makes people mad, Chris. It's that she has some warped views on economics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OCASIO-CORTEZ: I do think that right now we have this no holds barred, wild west hyper capitalism. What that means is profit at any cost. Capitalism is not always existed in the world, and it will not always exist in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Chris, apparently she wants another system other than capitalism. OK, but explain how that's worked and where that has worked. Tell me, where. HAHN: I didn't hear her say she wanted something other than capitalism. I heard her say she might want reasonable bank reform, like Dodd-Frank, things like that which I think most Americans after 2008 wanted. So look, she's 28, she's 28, she has never had this kind of experience before, and she's going to learn. She seems very smart, she seems to have very good political chops, Laura. I think we can both agree on that. INGRAHAM: I think she's an attractive candidate, I think she's young, she's hungry, and she wants to make a difference. And I think that's a good thing. I don't agree with her on pretty much anything, but if you're a Democrat or kind of a liberal living in a loft in Williamsburg, you're like wow, this is cool. Let's hang out at the coffee shop and talk about socialism. She calls herself a socialist. HAHN: I think she's an exciting candidate, she's got a lot of big ideas, and I think she's going to learn in a Congress that we have an incremental system of government and I think she'll work within that system. And I think she will be good at it. INGRAHAM: Mark? PENN: She's out of the main stream as a socialist. Democrats, as I said, the recent Harvard-CAPS poll, very few Democrats believe in socialism over capitalism. So don't kid yourself. Democrats haven't moved as far left as the activists who are running these campaigns would make you believe. INGRAHAM: Chris, Joe Lieberman has an op-ed coming up tomorrow apparently that says that Democrats should vote for Joe Crowley, vote in Joe Crowley, because she's a threat to the party. So, Lieberman, an old Democrat, vote for Joe Crowley for working families. The old guard is stepping in saying, who, slow down. Don't try this at home. HAHN: He's another one of those guys who got out of touch with his state and was voted out of office or lost a primary in his state. Joe Crowley is not running. INGRAHAM: Oh, my God Joe Lieberman is more in touch with Connecticut than the governor, Malloy, or whatever his name was. HAHN: Now he is. He's been home now. PENN: So that's not happening. Let her be in Congress. INGRAHAM: All right, guys, and by the way, the victims of last year's Las Vegas massacre are facing an unconscionable new indignity. We are going to tell you about it, and an attorney for the victims will react. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: More than 1,000 victims of last year's Las Vegas massacre are now facing a new injustice they probably never thought possible. They are actually being sued. The lawsuit is being brought by, of all places, the MGM Resort which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel from where Stephen Paddock committed the mass shooting. Joining us to explain how this is even possible is Brian Claypool, survivor of the Las Vegas shooting and an attorney representing a number of the victims of the massacre. Brian, this is so wild on so many levels. We've already gone through, frankly, the lack of security, lack of responsiveness, officers standing out in the hallway, they should've gone in when Paddock was up to his evil act. But now they are being sued? What is the legal theory? I'd sanction the lawyers filing this suit, by the way. What is the legal theory? BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Thanks for having me back, Laura. How deep in the swamp does MGM want to jump? How far in the gutter to they want to go? And how low do they want to kick victims like myself and other survivors? So what they are trying to do is use what's called the safety act, there was a law put in place by our federal government, 2002, that basically said if companies hire out a security company that's rubber-stamped by the Department of Homeland Security, that basically, what MGM is saying they are immune from any liability that results if there is a terroristic act. The problem with that theory is, number one, remember our old friend Sheriff Lombardo? He's come out and proclaimed a million times on TV that this was not a terroristic act. That is their first hurdle. They has to prove this was terrorism. They said it wasn't terrorism. The second hurdle they have that nobody's talking about is even if a judge somehow says this was terrorism and this safety act applies, they have to prove that the security system they had in place was effective and had social utility. Gee whiz, guess what, 58 people died and hundreds were injured, so it wasn't real effective. INGRAHAM: I still don't think we know very much about this attack, this mass killing. We've seen videos released sporadically, Brian. Why did it take so long to release the hallway video? That hallway video that came out a couple weeks ago, that just is wild to me. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but if I were, that would make me think, that's odd. Why didn't we see the check-in video earlier? Why didn't we see anyone coming and going into his room earlier? What took so long? CLAYPOOL: It's pretty simple. They don't want you to know. They don't want your viewers to know. They don't want the world to know how hapless their security was leading up to that shooting. So what did they do? Instead of spending money on shoring up their security and making sure this doesn't happen again, they spend millions of dollars hiring out thousand dollar an hour lawyers to file frivolous lawsuits to get out of the case on a legal basis so that the whole community and a set of jurors will never hear the evidence that we all want to hear to make positive change. INGRAHAM: Will the judge in pretrial motions allow for discovery on whether or not this was a terrorist act? He's going to have to, right? These judges are always really lenient on discovery. CLAYPOOL: That's a great question. But here is my theory. I think MGM filed the wrong kind of lawsuit. They should not have filed -- they filed what is called a declaratory relief action. What that is, Laura, is -- INGRAHAM: You just lost the entire audience. I'm just kidding. Brian, we are out of time, but I will have you back on radio. Unbelievable story. And we will be right back (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Oh, don't cry, but that's all the time we have tonight. So tell us your thoughts on the show @IngrahamAngle, tune into radio tomorrow morning. I always love to read your tweets. Not the mean ones. But sometimes they are really funny. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team are up next with a fantastic show examining all the histrionics over the last 48 hours. Shannon, take it away.

            "article_content": "Recapping the best things said on camera this week. President Trump touched down in France on Friday and immediately took a shot at President Emmanuel Macron for his recent call for a \"European army,\" calling the idea \"very insulting\" and renewing pressure on the country to contribute more to NATO. \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted.\u00a0\"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\" Trump was reacting to remarks Macron made earlier this week when he said Europe was \u201cthe main victim\u201d of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. \u201cWe will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army,\u201d Macron said, according to The Wall Street Journal. He also grouped in the U.S. with the countries from which France needed protecting. \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\u201d he said on French radio. Trump is in France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, where he will join fellow world leaders and have a one-on-one meeting with Macron -- who is facing political turmoil at home and as a result may take a tougher stance toward the president than previous meetings. Macron met with Trump on American soil in April, in a meeting filled with public hand-holding, smiles and affection. Macron, who called Trump \u201ccher Donald\u201d (\u201cDear Donald\u201d) engaged in an awkward fist-bump with, before being the recipient of a kiss from, the U.S. president. \u201cWe have to make him perfect,\u201d Trump said later, after brushing \"dandruff\" off the dashing centrist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe is perfect.\u201d TRUMP, MACRON SHARE ANOTHER AWKWARD HANDSHAKE But there were signs even in April that things were not perfect between the two. Trump is the de facto leader of Western nationalism, while Macron has cast himself as the leading international proponent of European globalism. In an address to Congress, he called for the preservation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate deal -- from which the U.S. withdrew at Trump's direction. At the United Nations in September, the Frenchman took a swipe at Trump\u2019s brand of nationalism, criticizing\u00a0a unilateralist approach that entails \"a certain lawlessness where everyone pursues their own interests.\" \u201cI will never stop upholding the principle of sovereignty even in the face of a certain nationalism, which we\u2019re seeing today, brandishing sovereignty as a way of attacking others,\" he said just hours after Trump addressed the General Assembly. The spat over the European army indicates that relations could be deteriorating further. MACRON POPULARITY PLUMMETS AT HOME AS HE PUSHES GLOBALISM ON WORLD STAGE Trump has often\u00a0complained\u00a0about the burden placed on the U.S. from NATO obligations, noting that the U.S. has an enormous military budget, part of which is spent covering protecting allies abroad -- including in Europe.\u00a0In July, he complained, \"We're protecting Germany, we're protecting France. We're protecting everybody. And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.\" NATO itself does not have a defense budget, but members commit to spending a minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product to defense spending -- although a number of countries do not meet this commitment. For 2018, the U.S. is spending\u00a03.5 percent of its GDP on defense spending. Meanwhile France\u00a0is spending\u00a01.81 percent, and only a handful of NATO countries are meeting that 2 percent commitment. According to NATO figures, total defense spending of all NATO members in 2017 was $917\u00a0billion, and the U.S. spent about $618\u00a0billion, meaning the U.S. spent\u00a0approximately 70 percent of all\u00a0NATO members. However, that figure was for all U.S. defense spending, not contributions to NATO. The U.S. also pays for approximately\u00a022 percent of NATO's common funding. But Trump's unhappiness with the comments are likely in part because Macron lumped in the U.S. with traditional European foes in his justification. Former U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told Fox Business\u2019 Stuart Varney\u00a0earlier Friday that the army was a sign of Macron was a \u201cEurofanatic.\u201d \u201cFor Macron to do it just a few days before President Trump goes to commemorate the centenary of the end of the Great War, the First World War, I think was absolutely crass in the extreme,\u201d Farage, a Fox News contributor, said. \u201cMaybe you can see now why his poll ratings are collapsing in France.\u201d The idea of some sort of European army has been mulled on the continent for decades in various forms. However, it is unlikely to see support from a number of countries. Italy is currently going through a nationalist and Eurosceptic resurgence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing pressure from nationalists in her country, while Britain is leaving the European Union. But while Macron's\u00a0idea may be somewhat extreme and premature, it may also reflect\u00a0the political difficulties he faces at home. His approval ratings have dived as low as 29 percent as he faces accusations of being out of touch, and struggles to deal with domestic economic problems and the repercussions of the 2015 migration crisis. A number of politically awkward viral moments -- including him recently lecturing an out-of-work gardener to look harder for a job -- have not helped. But Macron has brushed off concerns about lagging poll numbers. In a recent interview with Bloomberg News, he noted that unlike Trump he does not yet have to worry about poll numbers. \"I have a big advantage, I don\u2019t have any midterms elections. So I am not driven by polls,\" Macron said. \u201cI have to reform the country in depth. We will keep exactly the same pace.\u201d Despite the possible tensions between the two, Trump appeared confident of the trip. \u201cIt should be beautiful,\u201d he told reporters before departing Friday.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the lack of unity between the mainstream media and President Trump after a week of violence and hatred. After a week of sheer hate and violence, many people, including me, had hoped that there might be a brief period of healing, a toning down, a pulling back, an effort by all sides to rise above our political differences and find common ground as Americans. It's not happening. In fact, things are getting worse. And all sides are to blame. So many people are so addicted to divisive and inflammatory politics that virtually nothing \u2014 not the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats and CNN, not the mass slaughter of Jews praying in a synagogue \u2014 causes more than a momentary pause. Many in the media are still engaged in raw, blame-game journalism and commentary. The Washington Post above-the-fold headline the morning after the synagogue attack set precisely the wrong tone: \"Critics Say Trump Has Fostered the Toxic Environment for the Political Environment He Denounces.\" The critics quoted were liberals, and the overall piece blamed Republicans as well. That, in turn, prompted Sarah Huckabee Sanders to post this response: \"Is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President @realDonaldTrump?\" Soon after the 11 Jews were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue, GQ writer Julia Ioffe tweeted: \"And a word to my fellow American Jews: This president makes this possible. Here. Where you live.\" Ioffe, who cited the move of the embassy to Jerusalem, turned that into an op-ed and \"Morning Joe\" appearance. (In fairness, she was the target of online abuse and death threats after writing a critical piece on Melania Trump.) Ioffe also told CNN that Trump had radicalized more people than ISIS, but apologized later in the show, saying she had gotten too emotional. The president was eloquent at a rally speech the night of the Saturday shootings, denouncing the evil and poison of anti-Semitism and noting that Jews have faced centuries of persecution. But after calling on both political players and media members to tone things down, he reverted to his usual form yesterday on Twitter: \"There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!\" For Trump to go back to the enemy-of-the-American-people rhetoric is not just wrong, painting journalists as practically traitors, but at odds with his own appeals to lower the temperature. This became a flashpoint at yesterday's press briefing, where CNN's White House correspondent Jim Acosta got into it with Sanders: \"I mean, if the president is going to say the 'fake news media are the enemy of the people,' and if you're going to stand there and continue to say that there are some journalists, some news outlets in this country that meet that characterization, shouldn't you have the guts, Sarah, to state which outlets, which journalists are the enemy of the people?\" The press secretary replied: \"I think it's irresponsible of a news organization like yours to blame responsibility of a pipe bomb that was not sent by the president \u2014 not just blame the president, but blame members of his administration for those heinous acts. I think that is outrageous and I think it\u2019s irresponsible.\" This goes beyond the rhetorical warfare between the White House and the press. With Trump scheduled to visit Pittsburgh today, a group of Jewish leaders there, under the rubric Bend the Arc, put out an open letter: \"President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism.\" The letter accused Trump of having \"targeted\" the Jewish community, of undermining the safety of several minority groups, and says that the synagogue shooting is \"not the first act of terror you incited.\" That you incited. With all due respect to those who are grieving, this is just political point-scoring. You don't have to point to Trump's strong relations with Israel to say it is an absurd overreach to argue that the president inspired a lunatic with a lifelong history of hating Jews. The rabbi of the Tree of Life temple says he welcomes Trump's visit. I know we're in the home stretch of a divisive midterm election, and the default setting for pols and pundits, left and right, is to stay on the offensive. But when it comes to the terror that has lately plagued America, that is just pouring salt in some very large wounds.",

SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Oh he's more horrible than yesterday and the day before. They've overreached. All right, we'll always be balanced, we're not to destroy Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled, it's time. Ingraham, take over. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You know what they need Hannity? They need an ism song like racism, sexism, xenophobiaism. HANNITY: That's the whole playbook. Every election is the same. INGRAHAM: Well but guess what Hannity the Bush's use those same things too protectionist, isolationist and they use that to describe a lot of Trump's polices too. So the establishment is striking back. They're gleeful about these polls. HANNITY: They're so desperate. Give me one policy and this is not a trick question, one thing that they are offering the American people to make the country better, safer more prosperous, one thing? INGRAHAM: The left is doing nothing. All they have is the resistance and you documented it clearly tonight. Sean you have no jetlag, I don't know how you do it. HANNITY: No, I feel good.

You're not going to want to miss one minute. President Trump fires back against his critics about his Russia meeting. We're going to analyze all aspects of the media meltdown straight ahead. Also special counsel Bob Mueller is making some curious immunity requests. Is this just a propaganda ploy? We'll break it down. Raymond Arroyo is here tonight with our weekly Seen and Unseen segment where a political comic is in big time hot water and a former president is attacking his own sex. Plus the Democrats true plan for the border. Their votes today tell a very sad tale, details ahead. But first, the Anatomy of a Freak Out, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Ever since the president misspoke on Monday in Helsinki, the media have spun around like whirly dervishes, they're giddy with excitement. Excitement of course that's masked in feral outrage. Never has so much been made of so little. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Dan Coats came to me and some other and they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now those words set off a chain reaction of condemnation without context. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president at a summit in front of the Russian leader. Chilling that I've ever seen. JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR: You should call this the surrender summit. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh so catchy. Former CIA director John Brennan tweeted, 'Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors. It was nothing short of treasonous.' (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOLFE BLITZER, CNN NEWS ANCHOR: John Brennan says treasonous. Are we taking at least from your perspective? I assume from your perspective impeachment? CHUCK HAGEL, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Well I'll let that stand as it is is to the responsibilities of the congress of the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Don't you miss Chuck Hagel? By Monday afternoon there were preposterous calls for the CIA and National Intelligence directors to resign in protest. Not against the president's actions or substantive policies toward Russia, but resign over his comments at the press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Should the director of national intelligence Dan Coats resign in protest? NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBS HOST: How does Gina Haspel stay on the job? How does Dan Coats stay on the job? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: By Tuesday morning, the media freak out was evolving into totally unchartered territory. It was like the Bermuda triangle. People who peddle Trump hatred for a living, they make a good living out of it, they try to outdo each other jocking for the pole position in their denunciations and descriptions. It was, what's the word? Extraordinary. (BEGIN VIDO CLIP) JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: We all know that Vladimir Putin is holding something over Trump, we do not know it is but we know it must be something extraordinary. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say actually the definition it meets is the first word of the impeachment article in the constitution which is treason, bribery and high crimes of misdemeanours. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We don't know whether what we're seeing is dementia, psychopathy, compromise but what we're seeing is extraordinary. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Do they all get together and pick, \"This is the multisyllabic word we're going to use today, extraordinary\" You know what's extraordinary? The high judging responses to what was essentially an error of communication. The president reiterated his support of his Intel community and he tried to clarify his comments on Tuesday. We then there was this from a cabinet meeting today which began with an unfortunate mini adlib. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is Russia still targeting the U.S. Mr President? TRUMP: Thank you very much. There has been no president even as tough as I have been on Russia. I think President Putin knows that better than anybody, certainly a lot better than the media. He understands it and he's not happy about it and he should be happy about it because there has never been a president as tough on Russia as I have been. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK when he said no, that no you can hardly hear? That only threw kerosene on the media fires which in turn lit up today's press briefing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have any subscribers the president has not been very critical to Putin? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I only criticize Putin by name. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he was recited on Monday though, why wasn't he critical of Vladimir Putin's actions? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why should this president have any credibility to Americans in what he said? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Don't you just love the media figures talking about someone else's credibility at the point? The president's off hand remarks were, let's face it, some self inflicted wounds. But the rabid media, Democrats, the media cons, the never Trumpers, they hope to turn that little nick into a mortal blow and now they're just making no sense at all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D\u2014CONN.: We are in a 9/11 national emergency because our country is under attack. Issue a subpoena not only for the translator and the notes but also for the national security team. AB STODDARD, THE HILL: If they don't drag the translator in, they have to find out the answer from the secretary of state. But they have to find the answers out for not only Ambassador McCall but what else was discussed in that meeting? MICHAEL BARNICLE, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: We rewrite the constitution and have another president take over right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Oh my God, people actually get paid to say things like that, it is stunning. OK we're going to get onto rewriting the constitution part. Mounting an overthrow of a duly elected president, you kind of hear the rumblings of that there. The left has no record to run on. Certainly not in the midterms, what have they accomplished? Zero. They can't go to the voters and say, \"This is our prescription for making your lives better. We're going to bring you to four percent economic growth. This is wat we're going to do hold China accountable on trade. This is what we're going to do to have a stronger border\" They want to abolish I.C.E for goodness sake. So what they do is they seek to create another narrative that the president is somehow like secretly working behind closed doors to advance Russia's agenda and that he's at odds with his own intelligence chiefs. This is patently absurd and I think they know it is. Now granted the president has occasionally been inartful in the way he's explained his position. Sometimes his frustration with the Mueller investigation has gotten the better of him. But when you cut through all the theatrical displays of outrage? Trump in many ways is saying what he's always said, even if no one wants to hear him out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CILZZA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'll go along with Russia. It could have been China, it could have been a lot of different groups. I think it well, could have been Russia. But I think it could, well in the next screen you already know what it's going to have said, have be other countries. Donald Trump in his heart of hearts is not convinced that Russia meddled in the election. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Take a breath Chris that's not what he said historically or this week. The president is saying that Russia is responsible for meddling and that they are not alone. Now, I'm the first to call the president out when he hasn't unprecise in his language, and he hasn't. Communications are vital on a matter that's as important as this, especially with this Mueller cloud that continues to hang over his head. But saying that Russia is not the only foreign power seeking to temper with our election, cause havoc in our society is neither treasonous or nor erroneous, in fact it is correct. Just listen to the director of national security Dan Coats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN COATS, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY: Everyday foreign actors, the worst offenders being Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Every day they are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against targets in the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now you hear that? Russia is one of any foreign actors trying to disrupt things in the United States across the board, every day, incoming form these other countries. That does not rule out the presence of other foreign actors. But perhaps the most egregious and revealing all the lunatic get him in the rubber room reactions regarding Trump Russia once again comes from the former CIA chief John Brennan. The man, I'm sorry to say, I know it sounds uncharitable, is a complete embarrassment, spewing outrageous falsehoods while offering reckless advice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARNICLE: Wouldn't it be a tendency for intelligence gatherers briefers now to withhold some vital intelligence to the president? JOHN BRENNAN FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: There very well might be. There might be out of concern. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He went on to expand on that but yeah, out of concern that the White House president would run to Sergei Lavrov or Putin himself? Think about that. This is the guy who headed up the CIA, by the way same one I believe who signed off on the unmasking without a warrant. He's essentially urging current Intel officers who are giving basically tacit approval, to their concealing key national security information from the country's current commander in chief, shame on you sir. That is tantamount to a slow rolling coup. So we've gone from charges of treason within minutes, frankly, of what President Trump said in Helsinki, to calls for resignations to now former Intel chiefs encouraging traitorous acts against the current duly elected president of the United States. It is stunning. The next time you pundits and hosts want to see a disgraceful and extraordinary and treasonous moment, just pull up some of your TV appearances on the DVR and hit play. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is Dan Bongino a former secret service agent and host of the Dan Bongino podcast and Juan Williams, co-host of FNC's 'The Five,' great to have both of you on. Juan, look, the president I think had a couple of rough communication days but I say actions speak louder than words. And the media reaction, it reminds me of the roadrunner in Wily Coyote. Trump is the road and everybody they think, \"OK I got the TNT now and we're going to get him\" and then Trump just speeds away but your reaction. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well I think the big hole in the Ingraham Angle tonight is the Republican response Laura, that you know, your fellow Republicans, people who are strong Trump supporters. Here I'm thinking of New Gingrich, I'm thinking of people in the Congress who have been slow to offer any objection to President Trump have come out and said that what he did not objectionable and not of service to the United States and they're pundits are right. INGRAHAM: No, whoa whoa whoa, they didn't Juan, they did not say treasonous. Newt Gingrich tweeted out as did I that the president needed to clarify his remarks. I said it on Monday night with Matt Schlapp but that's fair criticism, it's not saying that you shouldn't brief him on matters of intelligence or imply that somehow he's back channeling information to the former Soviet Union. That is so irresponsible for them to say that. WILLIAMS: I didn't say treasonous. That's it, yes. No I think that they're asking legitimate questions about his actions. You say actions count more than words so we look at his actions and you look at the entirety of that presentation, not only the press conference but the earlier two hour meeting, we still don't know the details. The Russians say it was a great meeting. They apparently think there are military agreements that our own military doesn't know about. Laura that introduces questions as to, is this president working as an American to protect us the American people or doing something different? INGRAHAM: So you're basically agreeing with John Brennan then? WILLIAMS: No Brennan said don't tell him. He's our president and I respect that but I'm saying he has opened that door. Nobody else opened the door, he opened the door to these kinds of questions and these rebukes. INGRAHAM: Dan Bongino the idea that because Russia goes home, Lavrov and Putin go home and they make their progandistic push to their people? Big deal. I mean I keep saying this, I loved there in 1983, the propaganda flows freely in Russia. I don't take Putin at his word on pretty much anything, but the fact that he's saying, \"Well this this was a good meeting\" Big deal, who cares? That doesn't hurt us if he says that. DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT: Yeah and this is what they always do Laura. What bothers me about and Juan's comments particularly is you know Juan's talking about actions but Juan you're ignoring. And Juan, listen, you don't have to agree with these actions and neither does Laura. There a lot of Libertarians out there Laura who prefer a more interventionist approach. INGRAHAM: Well I do. BONGINO: What Juan's being a little, I think, naive about here is when you reasonably look at what Trump has done, he's not a politician OK. Forget the words for a minute, I'm not saying the words are irrelevant, I'm just saying when you look at what's actually happened, combating against the Nord Stream Two Pipeline which a Russian economic necessity. Laura personally sanctioning friends of Putin, Oleg Deripaska and Rusal. When you look at the attack on the mercenaries in Syria, the Russian mercenaries. Again, you don't have to agree with these actions, they are non-interventionists on both sides who don't even agree with them. But suggesting that he's a Russian pawn while his military wipes out Russian mercs, sanctions billionaires who are his buddies and then cuts off a potential economic lifeline Juan, is completely unreasonable. Where are you getting this from? WILLIAMS: But then, wait a minute, in that serious situation that you described the Russians were attacking us, that's why we responded. BONGINO: Right. WILLIAMS: And what about Iran? And Iran's continued support for terrorism and for Assad in Syria, contrary to American interests? BONGINO: Juan did you just say Iran? Did you object when we delivered pallets full of cash and please don't tell me it was their money because neither President Jimmy Carter no no, this is not a distraction WILLIAMS: Oh my gosh. Juan you're skipping the conversation. BONGINO: No I'm not. WILLIAMS: I think you disagree and I disagree with you about the Iranian nuclear deal but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about Iranian interference in Syria contrary to American interests, that's all I'm saying. BONGINO: Yeah, no I get it Juan and I understand that but Juan we have not been a friend to the Iranians either. I don't understand what Syria, I'm missing what the point is. We've wiped out Russian mercenaries and we're combating the Iranians in Syria, what the point? INGRAHAM: Guys, the actions versus verbal missteps or miscues or adlibs or aside, it's legitimate to criticize the communication, push after Helsinki, I'm fine with that. But jumping to these other conclusions I think it takes it to another level. The New York Times is just reporting that Trump was handed documents two weeks before the inauguration indicating that Putin personally ordered the hack into the United States. It just literally dropped into the New York Times, we'll have to unpack all of that. But Juan look, this is where we are, the president gave an interview tonight to CBS News to Jeff Glor where he talked about and tried to, again clarify this point about the intelligence chiefs and who's responsible, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY GLOR, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: You say you agree with U.S. intelligence that the Russians meddled in the election in 2016? TRUMP: Yeah and I've said that before and I've said that numerous times before and I would say that that is true, yeah. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Your reaction very quickly Juan. WILLIAMS: I think it's like a guy trying to clean up after the circus, it's futile. I mean Americans saw it wasn't just verbal missteps as you describe it. I think that the whole meeting with Putin and the fact that we still don't know is an indication that something is strange here and I think for all of us, for Dan for you for me, we've got wonder why is the president behaving in such a way as to introduce these questions? And as I said before to you Laura, it's not just Democrats, it's not just some crazed Liberal pundits, they're Republicans, your fellow Republicans that are raising these very legitimate questions based on his words and his actions. INGRAHAM: I think there a lot of Republicans who never really wanted Trump in the first place and a few others. But the majority of the Republicans who think this is the be all and end all story of the last five years are not people who generally agree with his more nationalist foreign policy or economic policy. But great conversations as always guys, thanks so much. Now, we've seen some rather interesting political alliances emerging these days with former president speaking out more than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If the U.S. takes the lead, others tend to follow. BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do you really want to say, \"We're going to make everybody have a military\" But we're not going to help anybody build their own future and lives. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESDIENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You've got far right parties that often times are based not just on platforms of protectionism and closed borders, but also on barely hidden racial nationalism. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK are we seeing a new kind political paradigm being created in the age of Trump? Joining us now to anaylze this and the breaking news out of the New York Times is Karl Rove, former senior advisor to President George W. Bush. Karl it's great to have you on the show tonight. I think it's the first time on the Ingraham Angle so thanks so much for coming on. KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO GEORGE W BUSH: Thanks for having me. INGRAHAM: What about that? You had just in the last couple of weeks, or last week, you had Obama, Clinton and George W. Bush all, not directly referencing the president, but clearly they are not so clearly veiled references to his governing and the substance of his policies. Your reaction to that. ROVE: Well look President Clinton and President Bush 43 were speaking at a seminar in Little Rock for the presidential scholars. A program that they and the President 41 Bush, 41 Library and the LBJ library have. I don't see that that was anything other than responding to questions and talking about their views, on for example leadership. President Bush made the point that world depends on American leadership, \"When America leads, the world tends to follow.\" President Obama's speech, I read it at night. It's a typical Obama performance, very long. There are parts of it that appear to be directed at President Trump but there's a bunch of it that I think, that's got to be put in the context of he's appearing in South Africa. He's been hosted by Nelson Mandela's widow. He's giving the Mandela Lecture and he is in the presence of the new president of South Africa who has come to office only after a huge conflict inside South Africa over a corrupt predecessor. Who was exactly what President Obama described in his speech as a strongman who demolished the institutions within South African and engaged in sort of crony capitalism and undermined a sense of democracy. Had an election but it was clearly phony and it was heralding, it's an unusual speech because at one point he talks about South Africa, the importance of markets. But there are points that clearly he was on a contrast to. INGRAHAM: Hold that thought you're going to stay with us, more on this breaking news out of the New York Times next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GLOR: But you haven't condemned Putin specifically. Do you hold him personally responsible? TRUMP: Well I would because he's in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country. So certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible, yes. GLOR: What you say to him? TRUMP: Very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling, we can't have any of that, I let him know that we can't have this, we're not going to have it and that's the way it's going to be. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now that was President Trump earlier tonight hours before this report broke from the New York Times essentially saying that the president was told that Putin did personally call for the hacking into our elections. Karl Rove is back with us. He's joined by Richard Goodstein a Democratic Strategist and Policy Expert. Sol Wisenberg is the former deputy independent counsel during White Water. Carl I had to rudely interrupt you before we broke for a commercial. What's your reaction to the New York Times report? It frankly doesn't really surprise me because Brennan was pretty much onto this Russia behind the meddling six months earlier from what I could tell so it doesn't really surprise me that the president would be briefed on this. ROVE: Yeah look, it doesn't surprise me either. But frankly remember early in the administration I think the president had a line that I wish he had used on Monday, which is he said early in his term that of course he would like to know if anyone had meddled in an election, because he would want to make sure that I was stopped. And I wish that the president had that tone on Monday. But this latest report doesn't surprise me. What did surprise was the ability of the Mueller investigation and government's cyber forensics to be able to identify 12 specific actors. Imagine those guys sitting in their office in the GRU and going online and seeing their names and asking the question, \"How could they tell it was us?\" INGRAHAM: Yeah and Sol I wanted to ask you specifically about that indictment that dropped last Friday. One indictment, 12 other officers, what of that? For me I thought, why name them? Why not keep that under seal and see if one of them actually comes to the United States? Apparently some of them maybe have been to the United States, what's the theory behind that? SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, WHITEWATER: Well I don't know what the theory is but if you don't put them under seal, you know you're never going to get them over here. INGRAHAM: Right, they're never coming. WISENBERG: They're GRU officers and I think it meant that these people will never appear in a United States court. The part of the indictment was to buy Mueller some time and say, \"Look, I'm really doing things and I'm doing important things\" But it's really a speaking indictment. I don't doubt that he'll be able to prove that it's just he'll never be called on to prove it. INGRAHAM: An indictment, for our viewers just to be clear again. An indictment are the charges. You did not see the evidence, obviously they wouldn't put it out, it's very sensitive, but they're the charges against these individuals. People forget that a lot of people are indicted and they're not guilty, I mean Liberals used to believe that. I'm not saying that they're not guilty but people have to remember that if we're going to blame Trump for not having smart verbiage, we have to smart with our verbiage too. WISENBERG: Laura in every criminal case, state or federal, the judge the jury the indictment is not proof, the indictment is not evidence and then I saw on the other networks constantly, \"Here we have the proof, here we have the evidence\" Now look, if Mueller didn't think he had it, he's perpetrated a massive fraud and I don't think he has but you know Andy McCarthy made the comment that basically now all the Russians are presumed innocent because this has been put into an indictment. But the real point is this is a speaking indictment meant to buy time for Bob Mueller. INGRAHAM: So no American's named in it, no American actions referenced, nevertheless it ate up some of the news cycle and the president apparently Richard, approved the timing, said it was okay to hand down the indictment. I guess they checked with the White House and he basically said it was okay which kind of kills the narrative that Trump was like worried about the indictments but your reaction Richard. RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Can I react to this New York Times story. What's newsworthy about it is one of two things. Either Trump has no faith whatsoever in the intelligence community because if he does, just today there's another New York Times story saying, \"Well I hope Putin's responsible in the sense that he's the head of the country just like people hold me responsible for what goes on here\" No, if you were told two weeks before the indictment that Putin personally and directly was sort of overseeing the subversion of the U.S. democracy. That's not, \"Oh well he runs the country\" No that's very specific and Trump still can't acknowledge that, that's troublesome. INGRAHAM: Well that's what he said tonight on CBS news, that's what Donald Trump said tonight that Putin is responsible, \"He's in charge of the country like I consider myself in charge of this country\" Oh because it's personal, yeah. GOODSTEIN: Because he's in charge of the country, it's like saying managers are responsible for the team. INGRAHAM: This is what Karl Rove, I think with your experience in the Bush administration, they're playing, I hate the multilevel chess reference, but he does have other concerns other than just what's happening in the Mueller investigation, what the New York Times is going to publish. He just had this meeting with Putin, now I imagine and he referenced this today Karl, they were talking about Israel, Iran, Syria, nuclear nonproliferation, getting back to some semblance of whatever a normal relationship with Russia is. That's does come into play and Obama referenced this Karl back in 2016, that insulting someone on the world stage, that's doesn't accomplish anything. And I don't recall George W. Bush insulting Putin whether in Crawford at the ranch or the Clintons when they when Hillary was meeting with Lavrov, you don't insult people even if you know they're trying to mess around with our systems. Which they always have been trying to mess around with our systems. ROVE: Well I agree with you I don't take homage and President Trump should not have been there for the purpose of slamming President Putin to his face. Nor am I worried about having a solitary meeting. President Bush, for example, met on a one-on-one -- literally drove the king of Saudi Arabia around his ranch in Crawford and discussed very important issues. I think that's overreach. I do think the president needed to project strength on Monday, and he didn't by his words. When he was asked that question, he could have answered her in a way that would have -- Putin would have known that he was upset about it and knew that the Russians were behind it. But it could have been straightforward and strong without being insulting. And the president didn't hit that note on Monday. He did better job in CBS tonight. Even that tone would've been fine on Monday. But there is no need for the president to go in and insult world leaders just for the sake of insulting world leaders, particularly if you are trying to find a way forward. There are important things that we need to do. We have got serious questions about the Russians and living up to their existing treaty agreements on the intermediate range missile treaty. We have a treaty with them, negotiated by President Bush, that comes up for renewal in 2021 on nuclear weapons. We have concerns about them in that regard. I hope the president brought up -- they are not helping us in North Korea. Lavrov, as you remember, shows up one week before the meeting in Singapore, he shows up in Pyongyang to basically tell the North Koreans we got your back against the Americans. INGRAHAM: Don't worry, in Russian, it's going to be OK. But I think the president should give an address to the nation about this, and Sol, Richard, Karl, where he talks about our relationship with Russia, basically what they discussed at this meeting, and what could be improved, no Mueller reference, no Peter Strzok reference, none of that, but give an address to the nation. Fantastic panel, guys. Thank you so much. I know it was short tonight with all this breaking news. By the way, Sacha Baron Cohen could be in legal hot water. Oh, goody, speaking of legal problems. And will a movie about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg do her legacy any justice? Raymond Arroyo brings that all to us in \"Seen and Unseen.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's time now for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose what's behind the big cultural stories of the day. He calls himself a comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen, and he's pranked everyone from Sarah Palin to Ted Koppel. But could his stunts now land him in legal trouble? For more we are joined by FOX News contributor, \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the \"Will Wilder\" series Raymond Arroyo. Raymond, Cohen's new show \"Who is America?\" premiered this weekend, but the real question is I want to know who the heck is watching? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Not too many people. It premiered with only 327,000 total viewers. That's 0.1 in the demo. If you had those ratings you would probably go into retirement. INGRAHAM: At 3:00 a.m., I get those ratings. ARROYO: I don't think you get them at 3:00 a.m. I think you get more than that. But here is the point. Though Cohen was able to snooker people like Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, and others, there was a Riverside, California, gun shop owner whom when Cohen walked in, his name was Norris Sweden, the gun shop owner, he saw through Sacha's charade early on. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just kept looking at the guy and I was like, you're Borat. As soon as I said that, his eyes just looked at me, and he did a b-turn right out the door. Once I knew it was Borat, we already know his game and his -- so we knew he was here to make a mockery, and make a mockery of what, gun owners, the gun business, gun shops. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: He did make a mockery of gun owners and gun activists. He got some of them to read a script, teaching children how to use firearms. Again, it's to embarrass people who own guns, who like guns. And Cohen, by the way, was dressed as a Hungarian immigrant there with a beard. He looked like a runaway from \"Duck Dynasty.\" INGRAHAM: That's what I was just going to say, he looked like \"Duck Dynasty.\" They make one of the good old boys, that the good old boys are dumb, and that good old boy saw right through that lame costume. And little fraidy cat, instead of standing there trying to do some original stand up, he should have turned it into a joke. But instead he ran out. What a little wuss. ARROYO: He's stolen valor. In fact, there were some billboards around L.A. about this. The problem with the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, something applies to Cohen, because he impersonated a war veteran, it doesn't apply. It's about wearing the medal, a false medal. That's what's illegal. INGRAHAM: I think he is impersonating a comedian myself. But there is a new Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic. ARROYO: You already have your tickets? INGRAHAM: I'm ready, ready, ready. It's called \"On the Basis of Sex.\" Is that the joke? ARROYO: No, that's not it. INGRAHAM: It's coming under fire for potential inaccuracies. What are they? ARROYO: First of all, portraying Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an actress named Felicity Jones. I'll put up a picture of them side by side. So you can compare. You think this evokes Ruth Bader Ginsburg? I'll leave it to the audience. (LAUGHTER) ARROYO: The bigger problem -- it's the doily -- INGRAHAM: They are both beautiful in their own way. ARROYO: If Felicity Jones had the doily, it would be better. INGRAHAM: Ruth Bader Ginsburg is one of the nicest people. I spent New Year's Eve with her in 1986. ARROYO: This isn't walk down memory lane. I've got to get to a segment here. INGRAHAM: OK. ARROYO: OK, here's what happened. They played a trailer of this movie, they've released it, and legal scholars are going crazy. Watch. INGRAHAM: OK. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think you can change the country, you should look to her generation. They are taking to the streets. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Protests are important. But changing the culture means nothing if the law doesn't change. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What did you see your name was? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The word \"woman\" does not appear even once in the U.S. Constitution. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nor does the word \"freedom,\" your honor. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: So the word \"freedom\" doesn't appear in the Constitution? INGRAHAM: First Amendment, isn't it? ARROYO: Yes, it's the First Amendment. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: This screenwriter, who is also Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nephew, surprise, surprise, he says what she is pointing to is the Constitution as it was originally adopted before the Bill of Rights, and that that is why she says \"freedom\" doesn't appear in the original. INGRAHAM: This is like wouldn't or would. They're making fun of Trump. ARROYO: All I can say is, when they cast my life story, I want someone as pretty as Felicity Jones to play -- INGRAHAM: Speaking of -- you are going to get to this next part. ARROYO: I'll do this. Speaking of gender politics and equality, Barack Obama in Johannesburg spoke out against his own sex today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Men have been getting on my nerves lately. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: I just -- every day, I read the newspaper and I just think, brothers, what's wrong with you guys? What's wrong with us? We are violent, we are bullying. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Violent and bullying. The idea -- INGRAHAM: Men are, like, this target -- ARROYO: This is toxic masculinity, the term that is so popular now. And the notion is that masculinity, robust masculinity, leads to bullying or assaults upon women. You know what leads to assaults upon women? Men who are not taught to be gentlemen. That is the problem. And all of these studies now coming out about the gender inequality in certain industries like film -- they did a study, film review critics, OK, 68 percent mail as opposed to 32 percent female. INGRAHAM: Who cares? ARROYO: They say this is why female flicks that have all-female cast members -- INGRAHAM: \"Beaches,\" like \"Beaches\"? ARROYO: No, not that. \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Oceans 8,\" all the female reboots, they flop because they get bad reviews from all the men. INGRAHAM: They are bad movies. ARROYO: I looked at publishing, an industry I know a lot about. And 78 percent of the people in publishing are women. INGRAHAM: And then they have to equalize it. More men have to be hired. ARROYO: I've worked with a lot of these women. You know why they are there? Not because they are women. Because they are good. INGRAHAM: They're good. ARROYO: They are people that should be in these positions. We should not be worrying about gender equity. Some people are better in some professions than others. Leave it alone. INGRAHAM: I think I'm going to get one of those doilies around me -- every night. ARROYO: That would be very attractive. INGRAHAM: I never liked the doilies. Sandra Day O'Connor started it and it keeps going. ARROYO: I always want to grab a vase. INGRAHAM: It reminds me of that thing my grandmother always had on the back of the couch. Those were never cleaned. (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: Democrats are shamelessly exposing their new immigration and border security agenda, Raymond. We're going to tell everyone what is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Today, the House passed a resolution to support the mission of the officers of ICE by a vote of 244-35. If that number seems a little low to you, it's because only 18 Democrats supported the measure, 133 of those brave ones voted \"present.\" Profiles in courage. The vote is hardly surprising once you listen to the rhetoric of the new generation of Democratic leaders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEITH ELLISON, D\u2014MINN.: Corporations, certain people who get certain rights, can go back and forth across the border seeking out the lowest wages, but people, regular people, cannot go back and forth across the border seeking out the highest wages. So what it creates is an imbalance. It creates an injustice. ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D, NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: We have to occupy all of it. We need to occupy every airport, we need to occupy every border, we need to occupy every ICE office until those kids are back with their parents, period. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Alexandria loves the word \"occupy\" and occupation when she's talking about the Palestinians and Israelis, occupations. Now it's occupy everything. To discuss the Democrats' real immigration agenda, what this vote tells us, is Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, and co-host of \"The Five,\" back by popular demand, Juan Williams rejoins us. Juan, thanks so much for coming back. We had a guest who unfortunately was pulled over by the police on the way to the studio. That is live TV at its finest. That is a kind of stuff that usually happens to me. Rachel, look, the Democrats, I think they have been boxed in a little bit by the Republicans, quite smartly. But there is a contingent that believes that it's time to go much bolder on the issue of amnesty and immigration and make it easier for people to apply for asylum. Once you cross the border with a family unit, a judge says you can't be deport people right away. So do the Democrats really lose anything with this vote? RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know. But you talked about being boxed in. I'll tell you, they are being boxed in by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Republicans often say that a socialist is an honest Democrat. And she is young, she is bold, and she is politically naive enough to have told the truth. And for a while I think her ideas, abolishing ICE, open borders, socialism, she's openly socialist, all this stuff the Democrats are really excited because her election was so shocking. And they pulled their masks off for a minute. And Mark Pocan who represents Madison, Wisconsin, came up with a bill to abolish ICE, and everyone was really excited. And then they polled it and they realized that the American people weren't really with them, so they pulled the punch. So Republicans put this bill forward, they all still want to speak to that base that gets everyone excited, the party of Bernie, the party of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and so they voted \"present\" instead of for the bill, which is what they really believe, because they really believe in the same things that Alexandria does. INGRAHAM: Juan, is that the case? You only had 18 Democrats vote to support Immigration Customs Enforcement. You know this just as I do, they do so much great work on sex trafficking, human trafficking, they assist in the breaking up of these cartel, narcotics operations. But only 18 Democrats? WILLIAMS: Remember, we've only had ICE I think since after 9/11, so about 15 years of ICE. And in the view of people on the left, Laura, ICE is implicated in the separation of children from parents, and not only that, raiding communities, business, making people extremely nervous about their status here, and breaking up families. INGRAHAM: Then reform it, then reform ICE. Don't abolish ICE. WILLIAMS: But the political maneuver here was that the Democrats, and this is the box you were talking about -- the Democrats initially said let's vote to abolish ICE. Then the Republicans pulled the bill and came back with his later effort, which is let's vote in support of ICE. So both sides are playing big politics here. INGRAHAM: Let's listen -- hold on one second, Rachel. I want you guys to react to what some of the Democrats today were saying about this ICE issue, immigration enforcement in general. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm voting present on this resolution because it is a sham and a distraction. It's shameless and it's inappropriate. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What we have today is a shameless, spineless group of Republican congressional enablers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You take your marching orders from Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson quicker than the president takes his marching orders from the Kremlin. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: You are powerful, Laura Ingraham. (LAUGHTER) CAMPOS-DUFFY: I have to jump in there, Laura. INGRAHAM: I don't think I've even talked about this vote. I don't think I've ever talked about this vote on the show. I've talked about ICE in general but not about the vote. We've been covering other issues. But Rachel, go ahead. I just have to jump in because there's all this talk about Russian influence going on. But if you really think about it, the real takeover of the Marxists, the socialists, the old Soviet Union, is on the Democratic Party and on American universities. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a product of a Marxist, socialist, anti-American ideology that is permeating, and has for several decades now, permeated American higher education and out going into high schools and lower. So that is a real concern I have with Russian influence. It's on the Democrat Party and on our education system. INGRAHAM: Juan, final word from you. Ocasio-Cortez did denounce capitalism, she uses the lingo of the far left and Marxists, the kind of stuff you hear at Thursday night seminars at a university. WILLIAMS: I think people -- CAMPOS-DUFFY: She is the future of your party. WILLIAMS: I think people on the right are beating her up, but she's 28 years old. I don't think she's very politically sophisticated. But guess what. When it comes to things like health care, education, when it comes to making sure that people have a living wage, most Americans say yes to these things. INGRAHAM: She wants it all to be free. WILLIAMS: People don't want families to be separated by ICE. CAMPOS-DUFFY: Most Americans believe in the rule of law and if you want to reform ICE, you vote for it. You don't occupy, you don't resist. INGRAHAM: I'm giving two thumbs up to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She needs to just keep going, keep evolving, keep changing. CAMPOS-DUFFY: She's a true scholar. INGRAHAM: Exactly. Facebook finally apologizing to Diamond and Silk but the social media giant is facing more questions over censorship. Herman Cain will explain. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Earlier this year, pro-Trump social media stars Diamond and Silk publicly accused Facebook of censoring their content. They came on the show to tell the story. Some didn't believe them. But just yesterday on Capitol Hill a Facebook exec issued a public apology to the dynamic duo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MONIKA BICKERT, FACEBOOK GLOBAL POLICY MANAGEMENT HEAD: I do want to acknowledge a videobloggers known as Diamond and Silk. We badly mishandled our communications with them, and since then we have worked hard to improve our relationship. We appreciate the perspective that they add to our platform. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was good. Joining me now to discuss that and other charges of censorship against Facebook is former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, a Fox News contributor. Herman, I think you were on that week when this Diamond and Silk issue rose to prominence, and they were being dismissed by the left, like, oh, please. People were saying they were exaggerating to get publicity. And actually that was a nice moment from Facebook. They said we didn't handle this right. They should get some apologies from other people I think. HERMAN CAIN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Laura, they admitted, Facebook did, that they didn't handle it right. And then they went back and said that they corrected it. I talked with Diamond and Silk personally last week and they are still getting the runaround. You see, the people that are appearing before Congress are professional spinsters. That's what is happening. They will say one thing, but what is actually happening does not match. And I know from personal experience that a lot of the censoring is happening. My website, other people that I have talked to, their websites are basically experiencing it. And because of this algorithm that mysteriously they have developed that nobody knows what it is, it is doing that censoring and they are in denial that they are in fact trying to censor conservative content. INGRAHAM: Darrell Issa raised this issue about the social media giants and what the implications could be of the size and scope and how big they are. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DARRELL ISSA, R\u2014CALIF.: Aren't you absorbing the responsibility, and can't and shouldn't we hold you responsible at least to the level of care that newspapers, ever so poorly, are held to? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Herman, here's the problem is that we have companies now that have earnings that are a multiple of many sizable countries. They have an enormous amount of power. And when you're talking about an information flow, Facebook is neither -- it shouldn't be a censor, shouldn't be blocking certain views. And they also can control everything on their platform. Now they have just come out with something, we were reading about it tonight, Facebook to remove misinformation that leads to violence. I hope that is never going to be used to target conservative speech, or liberal speech for that matter. But once you start getting into that realm of I'm going to determine content, then I think that you are opening the door to real problems. CAIN: If it was about -- INGRAHAM: ISIS or something. CAIN: Yes, associated with ISIS or violence, that is one thing. But otherwise, it is like asking a fox to guard a hen house. That is almost laughable. All of the people within Facebook and all of these other big organizations that have the social media platforms, they simply have a culture of not wanting to basically pass on conservative content. I don't believe that we will ever be able to accept their judgment in terms of what they consider to be hate speech, negative speech, et cetera. I happen to believe that in individuals are going to have to take charge of what they do with that information. The fox guarding the hen house is not going to work. And I don't care what they say to Congress, I don't believe that it is the true story as to what really happening. Censoring is in fact happening. I know it for a fact, and a lot of other people that I have talked to also know it for a fact. INGRAHAM: Herman, it's so funny, everyone is bean counting on gender or race or ethnicity or religion. It would be nice to know how many conservatives work at Facebook. It would be nice to have some balance there across the ideological spectrum. Maybe it would get them more fairness. We really appreciate it. Thanks so much, Herman. When we return, we'll remember a true hero. Come back for that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Before we go, we want to take a moment to honor Secret Service agent Noel Remagen. The 42-year-old died tragically after suffering a stroke during President Trump's trip to the U.K. His body was returned to the United States today and his casket met by loved ones and colleagues along with the president and the first lady. Secret Service agents have one of the most restful and oftentimes thankless jobs out there. They quietly, heroically put themselves in harm's way to protect our nation's leaders. A GoFundMe page for Agent Remagen's family has been created and has already raised more than $150,000. He has two small children. We encourage everyone to check it out. And may special agent Noel Remagen rest in peace. Shannon Bream is up next with another fantastic show. Another slow news night, Shannon. I know you will have just a little bit to talk about. But take it away. Can't wait to watch. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: We do. And thank you for honoring that hero, a true hero, Laura. Thank you very much. INGRAHAM: Thanks, Shannon.

            "article_content": "Republican Senator John McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, in 2017. In a statement, the McCain family says the senator has chosen to discontinue medical treatment. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, the self-styled \"maverick\" of the Senate who has served three decades in Congress, will discontinue medical treatment for brain cancer, his family said in a statement Friday. The Vietnam War veteran, who survived five years as a prisoner of war and went on to become his party's presidential nominee in 2008, was diagnosed last July with a brain tumor following a procedure earlier in the year to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He has not voted since last December. In Friday's statement, his family revealed how the disease has worsened: \u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.\" They said, \"With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\" Reaction poured in after the family's announcement. \"The entire McCain clan is doing exactly what the McCains have done through generations \u2014 rise to the meet the challenge,\" said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend. \"John McCain is an American hero, always putting country before self. From Vietnam to the halls of the U.S. Senate, the spirit of service and civility that has guided Senator McCain's life stands as a model for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation,\" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tweeted: \"Very sad to hear this morning\u2019s update from the family of our dear friend @SenJohnMcCain. We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague. John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour.\" The Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix last summer said that the original blood clot was associated with a primary brain tumor, known as a glioblastoma. McCain, 81, has served in the U.S. Senate for more than two decades and ran for president twice. He lost the GOP nomination to George W. Bush in 2000 and was the Republican nominee in 2008 before losing to Barack Obama in the general election. McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years. Injuries from being tortured left him unable to lift his arms above his head. Last December, McCain returned to the Senate for the first time since his brain cancer diagnosis. He delivered powerful remarks on the Senate floor addressing the need for bipartisanship amid gridlock in the chamber. \u201cMake no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege\u2014for the honor\u2014of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love,\u201d McCain said, acknowledging senators he\u2019s \u201cknown and admired.\u201d \u201cBut they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively.\u201d McCain has criticized the Senate\u2019s deliberations in the last year, calling them \u201cmore partisan, more tribal\u201d than any time he remembered. McCain blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the lack of cooperation. Earlier this year, McCain penned a memoir titled \u201cThe Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations,\u201d written by himself, and Mark Salter, who had collaborated with McCain on all seven of his other books. \"I don't know how much longer I'll be here. Maybe I'll have another five years. Maybe, with the advances in oncology, they'll find new treatments for my cancer that will extend my life. Maybe I'll be gone before you read this. My predicament is, well, rather unpredictable,\" he wrote. \"But I'm prepared for either contingency, or at least I'm getting prepared. I have some things I'd like to take care of first, some work that needs finishing, and some people I need to see. And I want to talk to my fellow Americans a little more if I may.\" McCain, who has repeatedly been at odds with President Trump and criticized his rhetoric and leadership, said this year that he doesn\u2019t want the president to attend his funeral, and prefers that Vice President Pence be there instead. Last week, Trump signed a $716 billion defense policy bill, titled \u201cJohn S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019,\u201d though did not mention the senator. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Dr. Zuhdi Jasser of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' to discuss threats from radical hate groups that are still threaten the United States. This is a rush transcript from \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" June 17, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello America. I'm Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" Zuhdi Jasser, pleasure to see. ZUDHI JASSER, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ISLAMIC FORUM FOR DEMOCRACY: It's great to be back you great to with you, Mark. LEVIN: Zuhdi Jasser, you're a medical doctor. JASSER: Yes, sir. LEVIN: Practice in the private sector. You founded and are President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy and co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement. You're a first generation American Muslim. Your parents fled the oppressive Baath regime of Syria in the mid-1960s for American Freedom. You're a patriot. You earned your medical degree on a US Navy scholarship at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1992. You served 11 years as a medical officer in the United States Navy. And you're the author of \"A Battle for the Soul of Islam: An American Muslim Patriot's Fight To Save His Faith.\" Now the reason I wanted to have you tonight is not only because you're a superb expert on this whole issue, not just of Islam and geopolitics and so forth, because it's very quiet right now. And when it's very quiet, I get very nervous. JASSER: Yes. LEVIN: Particularly when it comes to our enemies and while we're focused rightly so on North Korea and some of the other challenges that we have in this country, Al-Qaeda is not quiet, ISIS isn't quiet, Hamas isn't quiet, Hezbollah isn't quiet, the Muslim brotherhood is not quiet. They're all operating, they're all plotting their next attack on our allies and next attack on this country. What happens is people say, \"Well, why weren't we talking about this? Why weren't we thinking about this? Why weren't we ready?\" I want to talk about it, but let's start at the beginning. Sharia law. What is Sharia law? JASSER: Mark, it's great to be with you, and you know the Sharia is Islamic law, Islamic jurisprudence, one of the reasons my parents escaped Syria and came here was they viewed the American experiment, the American laboratory about the ability for individuals to define their faith, define which of the laws in their faith they'll accept or reject as being the type of society, the type of nation they wanted to belong to. So, they rejected their Syrian nationalism which has failed and has now - continues to prove to be one of the worst tyrannies in the world, to come to embrace an Islam that was their own making, their own practice. So Sharia is the Islamic jurisprudence that is the laws that have evolved from 7th Century Islam. So, I would be deceptive or lying to you if I said Sharia was compatible with American law. My Sharia is the Islam of American patriots that I know that are Muslims that reject political Islam is, but the Sharia of Saudi Arabia, of the Pakistani Islamic law, of Egyptian law, of the Muslim brotherhood, of Hamas, those Sharia theocracies are incompatible with American law. So ultimately, now, as we are finishing up the holiest month of Ramadan, we just finished, it it's our holiday this weekend. My personal Sharia tells me how to pray, how to fast, how to follow my personal pietistic laws, but then there is Sharia that gets involved in criminal law, that gets involved in prohibiting siege. LEVIN:And governance. JASSER: And governance and punishments and the inequality of men and women. The torture of dissidents and all these other things that are done under the name of Sharia in Iran, in Saudi Arabia and other theocracies or quasi theocracies. So, as Americans trying to get their head around what is Sharia, I would tell you look at our own history. America was founded on a rejection of theocracy. Islam is in that time in its history right now. We're basically in the 16th, 17th Century of what Christendom was in at that time. And right now, as it is quiet, as you said, the Muslim world is not quiet, the Iranian people are revolting in the streets in the thousands against their theocracy. My family in Damascus and Aleppo are dodging chemical weapons and helicopter gunships and a genocide from the Syrians from Hezbollah, from Iran, from Russia. The Muslim Brotherhood is growing. ISIS may have been decimated in Syria, but Jihadism, global Salafi Jihadism, which is this ideology of anti- westernism, of theocracy, is growing faster than it ever has. LEVIN: Do you think the American media, the American media chases shiny objects, pretty much. Do you think the American media is substantive enough to understand that these threats remain out there because they do a very poor job of covering them? JASSER:I think the honest portions of the American media, whether it be conservatives like yourself or others that are willing to talk to Muslims with a tough love, I think, are addressing the issue. I think we've seen like our organization and our Muslim Reform Movement leaders have shifting the needle, where after 9/11, no one would talk about Islamism and Islamists and now, we are starting to see a conversation where we recognize that it's not just terrorism. I mean, I am a doctor, as you said, and I treat disease, I don't treat symptoms, and the disease of what we're facing is not just terrorism. That's a symptom. That's a whack-a-mole program. The disease is political Islam - Sharia states. The concept that our identity as Muslims is wedded to a national identity of Islamic governance. There may be many Muslims in America that are here that reject sort of secular society. So the American media, and I think especially on the left now, if you get away from their 95% Trump derangement syndrome where they are focused too much on completely ignoring the global issues that are continuing to evolve. The rest, because of the influence of foreign governments, Islamic states and their funding of think tanks, especially on the left, the Clinton Foundation and their money from Qatar and the Saudis and others and we see also this problem on the right, we are unable to have an honest conversation about the influence of Islamics' movements and Sharia-type movements in our country and the influence on changing the narratives. And until we look at that problem and fix it, we're never going to treat the disease. LEVIN: That's a problem I want to get to in just a second. You talked about the founding of American. John Locke, the enlightenment, religions most have gone through this reformation period, so there isn't this, a conflict between the enlightenment and people of faith and religion. You're saying not so with a lot of the Muslim world. In the United States, we have this First Amendment. It's really quite brilliant. The free exercise of religion, but no establishment of religion. And it was based on like much of the Constitution, Judeo-Christian concepts, but not just that. Aristotle. Cicero - Cicero wasn't a Christian, per se, I mean, it was the Romans who killed Christ. And yet, so basically our First Amendment says, \"Look, if you're not out to destroy the Constitution. If you're not ideologically driven to eviscerate the society, then have at it. You could be an atheist, you can be a Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Christian - whatever you want. Isn't that the genius of the First Amendment? JASSER: Absolutely, and I have to tell you, this is why America and American-Muslims especially have the responsibility by being blessed. If I had grown up in Syria or Saudi Arabia, I would not be the man who sits before you today respecting and learning from authors like yourself and having the opportunity to be on \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" and talk about freedom, right? I would be a different consciousness because I would be fighting for my freedom in Syria, I probably wouldn't be alive today or if I lived in Saudi Arabia, I would have been influenced by more anti-western conspiracy theories, et cetera. So, America needs to get out, especially the left, needs to get out of its ethnocentrism and obsession with what's happening in Washington and Hollywood and start look at the world and saying, \"You know what? A quarter of the world's population is Muslim. It's a 1400- plus year-old religion that now is going through a time in history which it's beginning to move against dictatorships and against theocracy. We can take sides in that or we can continue to work with just the strong horse and pretend that somehow through a bigotry of low expectations that Arabs and Persians and Muslims in general want to be run by dictators and theocrats and that could not be further from the truth. Every human being wants to be free, and people say, \"Well, Islam needs a Martin Luther.\" You hit the nail on the head. It's too early for a Martin Luther here. We need John Locke, James Madison. We need Jeffersonian religious freedom papers to begin to start to teach our youth. I mean, one of the things I teach my three young children is the only thing I would ever want to die for, and this is the reason I joined the Navy, is America and our Constitution. I was taught by my parents that while we love and pray to God and we read our scripture in the Arabic Koran, I never want to die for that because God doesn't need me to die for him. And my scripture is between me and God. I don't need the state to have that as a Constitution. What the state needs to do is protect my individual rights to speak, to practice or reject any parts of the faith that the men in beards and long robes want to ram down my throat. So, that's the beauty of the American experiment. We have a responsibility in this country, living in blessed freedom to give back to the world and start to put forth a form of Islam and that is what our Muslim Reform Movement is about is, it is using the free market of ideas that exist here to begin to have critical thinking and pushing back against - right now there's only four schools of Sharia in Islam, of Sunni Islam and only a couple in Shia Islam. Back at the beginning of Islam, there were thousands of schools of thought. How do people expect Islam to do away with ISIS and its Muslim brotherhoods if there is no critical thinking and in the laboratory where we can do it, the left wants us with the red green axis of the left and the Islamist to not have critical thinking and say anyone that looks critically Islam is a bigot, is an Islamophobe in this victim grievance narrative that dominates who I am as a Muslim, when, in fact, we need tough love to say, \"You know what, if you know Muslims that are your neighbors and your friends, ask them what they think about theocracy and what they are doing to change the consciousness for their children and what their legacy will be?\" LEVIN: Why do you think that reporters, so-called journalists, many of whom are the left, why do you think they don't want to have that conversation? JASSER: Because every minority group to them is a tool for pushing forth a collectivist movement. Whatever it is they exploit it. The Muslim minority which is barely 1% in America, they don't look at it as a quarter of the world's population where you have 56 countries that are Muslim majorities where we would have an influence on that. They would say, \"Well, you know what, we can check the box that we protect Muslim minority rights. We will call it a Muslim ban,\" even though it is not. We will talk about and use folks like Keith Ellison. You remember the Pelosi incident where she's whispering behind the microphone, \"Tell them you're Muslim. Tell them you're Muslim.\" That's all that matters to them. It's an identity politics. They exploit identity politics in order to use us as a hammer against the right, so that they can obsess into saying they are the answer to bigotry and et cetera on the right, which could not be further from the truth. It is part of the left's demagoguery where they actually in a bigoted sense use race, they racialize Islam - Islam is an idea, it is not a race, but yet, they racialize it. So they prevent critical thinking within communities, individual thought as they've done with the African-American community, the Hispanic community, and they have no interest in looking globally at how Muslim women are treated in Iran, how they're treated in Afghanistan, in Saudi Arabia because feminism to them is really also a tool for how to get to the right, rather than actually being about principles. LEVIN:Could it also be that there are organizations that push the narrative that the left wants pushed? Organizations like CAIR as an example. Organizations like CAIR that are domestic organizations with a foreign influence that really are the counter to your organization and this reformation that you're talking about, take a much more fundamentalist approach to Sharia law, and they are seen in the media and they are seen in government all the time. I want your opinion on this, in one moment. Ladies and gentlemen, you can join us almost every week night on LevinTV at crtv.com, at crtv.com. I hope you'll join us. We'll be right back. Zuhdi Jasser, I want to get to this group CAIR in a moment. But thinking about what you said, if the American media is so objectionable to a discussion about Islam, how do we expect the foreign media, much of which is state controlled in these other countries, to even consider discussing reformation and Islam and so forth? JASSER: They become basically tools of foreign media, because let me give you an example. When President Trump decided to withdraw from the Iran deal, CNN backed - hour after hour started to show demonstrations in Iran and how this was making unrest. They were basically showing exactly what Iranian-state media wanted them to show which is the staged rallies that were happening, the burning of the flag and other things which is what our enemies want, so at the end of the day, our media, when it doesn't have a compass about constitutional principles and about universal human rights, now all of a sudden we're hearing about all that with North Korea when, in fact, when Obama was selling the farm to Iran and handing them billions to do genocide in Syria and propagate terrorism around the world, nobody talked about human rights. But now, all of a sudden they're doing it because to them, the axis of their ideas is all about how to get the right and how to demonize everyone who is against their party, when in fact, it's not about principles. So, I hope ultimately as we've proven in the last election, the American people are not stupid. They understand what the realities are, who to trust and who not to, and the left is going to continue to wither on the vine of false narratives because a candidate who is elected by fighting the establishment, which is, I know what we're going to talk about with CAIR, the establishment in the Muslim community is evil, it is theocratic and are not friends of America. LEVIN: Let's go there. This organization, CAIR, was established in a meeting in Philadelphia, wasn't it? Give us a little bit of history, because CAIR shows up everywhere. In the Obama administration it showed up at the Department of Justice, it showed up at the White House, it showed up at the Defense Department. It's frequently referred to as the leading Muslim civil rights group in America. That's self-proclaimed and regurgitated by the media. They show up constantly on MSNBC and CNN and so forth. What do we know about CAIR. JASSER: You know, they are C-A-I-R, I prefer to call them pejoratively the Council on American-Islamist Radicalization because that is really what they do, is they are an offshoot, you know, basically the Islamic organizations in America started in the late '60s with the Muslim-Syrian Association fed by Saudi funding and also by Muslim Brotherhood immigration into the United States. And that evolved into some major organizations, like the Islamic Society of North America, the Council on American Islamic Relations, your alphabet soup of basically Muslim Brotherhood legacy groups and in '91, this is part of the FBI Holy Land Foundation Trial in 2007, documents that were shown to be real documents from '91, they had an authoritative memorandum that said that they had certain organizations that are part of the evangelical movement of the Islamist movement to try to shape western opinion, shape western policy so that it favors Islamist interests and CAIR is one of the groups. CAIR actually evolved from a group called the Islamic Association for Palestine. They found that the Palestinians weren't enough for constituencies so they broadened it to hijack the Islamic community as part of the Palestinian movement and some of my friends call them sort of the Hamas on K Street. LEVIN: Hamas on K Street because they have ties to Hamas, don't they? JASSER: They do. Their founders have been linked to them, and at the end of the day, don't take my word for it, see how much they say against Hamas, when Hamas launches missiles into schools, when America starts saying we are going to stop funding to Hamas, which we should never have been doing to start with, which is helping what appears to be social and medical programs that end up actually getting money into Hamas's coffers, they start protesting. At the end of the day, CAIR reveals its stripes by who it supports and anti-Semitism, it's promotion of the BDS. I mean, just a few weeks ago, the Argentineans had to pull out of a soccer match in Jerusalem because the BDS movement ended up terrorizing them. LEVIN: What is the BDS Movement? JASSER:BDS is the Boycott Divest Movement that basically is trying to globally oppress the free markets of Israel by telling companies to divest from investment in Israel. And it basically reveals that they're trying to use all of the economic power of Islamic regimes from Turkey to Saudi Arabia to the Palestinians and others to try to put pressure on Israel, and I think Americans, this is another thing we're missing, is that it is a front for anti-Semitism and Islamic movements that we need to stand by our ally, Israel and push back against. LEVIN: This anti-semitism you bring up, it's spreading in America, isn't it? On college campuses, universities, and do you think these organizations, these Islamic organizations or Palestinian organizations, do you think they're promoting this sort of an attitude? JASSER: They are, because they come across as being the only voice of Muslims, but I will tell you that's changing. I mean, from when you and I started talking after 9/11, today I just spoke at Duke a couple of months ago, and for days the students association were protesting me coming in. I was being brought in by a number of the freedom based associations, college Republicans and others, and they simply pushed back and said, \"Oh, because the title of my talk was American-Muslim identity, patriots or insurgents?\" They said, \"Oh, that's demonization, there's no binary,\" and the Muslim students protested. They had a sit-in, et cetera. But then, after I gave my speech about how much I love my faith and how much it is patriotic to push back against Islamists, the coverage from the student newspaper was actually pretty positive, even though it was horrifically negative before I got in there. So, all I can tell you is that when we're given a platform, they can't, at the end of the day, honestly call me an Islamophobe after they listen to what I say and the narrative of what I really believe in as a god-fearing, patriotic, American-Muslim who feels that our community has globally been hijacked by these political Islamist movements. And the universities, I think is ground zero of the speech debate. As so many have seen, the Islamists and the left suppress free speech and create this climate where we can't even have an ability to disagree with one another because they call you a hater, a bigot, et cetera, and they shut down any type of critical thinking. LEVIN: Why do you think the left, the Marxist left, the progressive left, the Islamist movement as such as it is, why do you think they are so frequently on the same side of policy and political issues? JASSER: Because, A, they're collectivists, they are both collectivists, and, B, it's the shortcut of suppressing ideas that would defeat them. We've done debates against the imams where I've done Lincoln Douglas-type debates at various universities. I did a debate against the Muslim Public Affairs Consul last January about the necessity of the Muslim Reform Movement. And almost every Muslim that saw the debate said, \"You know what? Now I understand what you believe in. And I said, \"Well, yes, they're trying to present me without paying any attention to our message.\" So, at the end of the day, the left, the Islamists are collectivists. This is why they work well with dictatorships, with socialists and others, it's all about collectivizing control of thought and preventing freedom, individual thought and what really conservatism is all about. LEVIN:So much for freedom of the press. We have the press in this country, 90% of this, I think is of a group think type, which you're talking about here, and they claim that they are defending the first amendment and freedom of the press, when, in fact, as you've also pointed out, they squelch and they suppress opinions that they personally do not agree with. We'll be right back. LAUREN GREEN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Lauren Green. A holiday ceasefire in Afghanistan shattered by two suicide bombings over the weekend. The bombings happening in the city of Jalalabad. Nineteen people were killed in today's attack, 36 were killed on Saturday. Both attacks were against gatherings of Taliban fighters. ISIS claiming responsibility for Saturday's attack. ISIS considers both the Afghan government and the Taliban to be its enemies and it was not part of the holiday ceasefire. Brooks Koepka has won the 2018 US Open, his second US Open victory in a row. Koepka is the first golfer in 29 years to successfully defend the US Open title and only the seventh person to ever accomplish the feat. He edged out England's, Tommy Fleetwood by a single stroke. Koepka now moves up to the career best fourth place in the worldwide rankings. I'm Lauren Green, now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" LEVIN: Zuhdi Jasser, President of the United States nominates Pompeo to be Secretary of State. He soon thereafter appoints John Bolton to be his national security adviser. He appoints his Bolton's chief of staff, a fellow by the name of Fred Fleitz who used to work at the CIA and so forth, and a variety of Muslim organizations including CAIR attacks every one of the appointments. In fact, they demand that flights be removed. They worked over Congress on Pompeo. They have a special distain for Bolton. What's that all about? JASSER:I have to tell you, I was seeing patients in my office and somebody was watching C-SPAN and saw Senator Murphy start to talk about how upset he was that Pompeo was nominated. Murphy from the floor of the Senate said, \"There are organizations as bigoted as the American Islamic Forum for Democracy...\" LEVIN: Your group? JASSER: My group and my patients were like, \"What are they talking about?\" And the Senator clearly just read off a sheet that the Council on American- Islamic Relations and other lobbyists in his office gave him to read, and that seemed then his testimony was then you could find it on Iranian Press TV, on Al Jazeera. LEVIN: So the Senator from Connecticut, his comments on the Senate floor were spread throughout these fascistic regimes? JASSER: Exactly. Why? Because he's criticizing our Secretary of State appointee. A Secretary of State by the way, who when he was Congressman Pompeo did, I think one of the most pro-Muslim things, which was in his district protesting Hamas fire-breathing imam and say that that mosque in his district should push back and not allow that anti-Semitic hate, anti- American stuff come from a religious facility in their district. And I wrote and support, worked closely with Congressman Pompeo's office to craft that pro-Muslim belief that we have diversity. LEVIN: Is that why he was targeted? JASSER: Exactly. I think he's targeted because he's a threat to the establishment in the Islamic community. Not a threat to Muslims. I think he's a benefit, a blessing to Muslims who are believers in liberty and life and freedom. But he is a threat to the Islamist establishment, and I think, what's amazing to me is how dishonest folks like Senator Murphy are. We ask him. We demanded an apology, he slandered and libeled us from the floor of the Senate. I am a patriotic, god-fearing Muslim who loves my faith. We are not bigoted or anti-Islam. He's doing the bidding of the Iranian Khomeinist, by saying that, but at the end of the day, Mark, it is about diversity. How can a left, a Senator like Murphy who believes in diversity then say that an American -Islamic forum for democracy or Asra Nomani, who was a \"Wall Street Journal\" - used to be and now is a freelance reporter is one of the co-founders of our Muslim Reform Movement; Raheel Raza, Maajid Nawaz - all these leaders in our reform movement, most of whom are actually left of center. I'm right of center. We're a diverse organization, but how can he say that we are not Muslims or somehow, we don't represent Muslim ideas. They ignore it and if they really believe in diversity, to them diversity is all about racial diversity, ethnic diversity. They don't care about ideological diversity, which is what the left is about, it is about ideological oppression. If they cared about ideological diversity, they'd welcome our voices, pro- feminism, pro-freedom into their understanding of Islam. LEVIN: So when the Senator smears you and he's protected under the Constitution, they all are, the speech and debate clause, do you think what he said about you and your organization was bigoted? JASSER:I do. It is a bigotry of low expectations, where to them, the only people that should speak for Islam are the mullahs in robes or the king of Saudi Arabia or the Khomeiniists in Iran or the CAIRs that have their buildings owned by foreign countries or the Muslim (inaudible)... (CROSSTALK) LEVIN: Do you see the Democratic Party more and more moving in that direction? JASSER: I do. I see them looking at political expediency rather than principles of our Founding Fathers and what this country is about, and really, actually, I am not trying to change their ideas, if they truly believed in diversity, they would be asking, you know, they look at people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is a victim of female genital mutilation who has spoken out for women's rights, and they called her a bigot. The scam that is the SPLC targets Muslims... LEVIN: Southern Poverty Law Center. JASSER: Yes, the Southern Poverty Law Center supposedly speaks out against bigotry, when in fact, Maajid Nawaz who is part of reform movement had to sue them and then all of a sudden, they are anti-jihad bigotry paper disappears from their website because their lawyers probably told them, \"You know what? You are targeting Muslims in that and sort of exposing the fact that it's a scam. It's not about bigotry, it's simply a tool.\" LEVIN: Are most of your battles with the institutional left, the media left, the left in the Democratic Party. Most of your battles in this is Islam Reform Movement with the left? JASSER: It is. The vast majority of them. And I think we need to lob it over them. I think we, sometimes give the CAIRs of the world and the Islamists and the left a little too much credibility and too much attention. We can lob it over them because the Muslims in the streets of Iran are thanking President Trump for withdrawing from the Iran deal. The dissidents and the prisons of the Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Syria and Turkey are applauding the fact that now there's a president and a leadership in America who's ignoring the identity politics and they realize that Islam is not a race, it's a diverse ideology that needs to begin to have other dissident voices heard. LEVIN: It is very interesting you should say this because about a month ago I was in Israel when they moved the embassy to Jerusalem, and the Israelis love President Trump, and there were posters all over the country for President Trump, and when I returned to the United States, none of that was presented in the American media. None of it. Instead, the Israelis and the IDF were being accused of murdering Palestinians on the Gaza strip because Hamas, which as you pointed out controls the Gaza strip, and was rushing the fence with 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people and they are very braze, you know, for them it's women and children first and so the Israelis were trying to defend their border, but the American media headed completely the opposite way. It is very interesting to me who they point out as the heroes. Barack Bbama, the great Barack Obama, sat on his hand for ten days when the people of Iran were rising up. The great Barack Obama with his red line while the Syrians were being killed with chemical weapons, all kinds of weapons, all kinds of destruction and so forth and so on. We'll be right back. (BREAK) LEVIN: Welcome back. Zuhdi Jasser, the Iran deal, such as - we still don't know everything that was in this Iran deal with all these secret side deals, but we know what the Iran deal did is take all the sanctions that the Bush administration had placed on Iran, which were crushing its economy, destroying its currency, pretty much on the brink. You have the people of Iran rise up for over a week, and then we get to a point where President Obama and John Kerry negotiate this deal with the Europeans and the Iranians and the Russians; $150 billion flows into this country, not to mention $1.7 billion in ransom money, and the controls of what Iran is going to do are either nebulous or really nonexistent and Iran is guaranteed to have nukes in a decade. The President is universally criticized in Europe, almost universally criticized by the American media. What do you make of this? JASSER: I don't get it, and I can tell you having spoken to hundreds of Syrian-Americans and many of whom are Democrats who voted for Obama would never do so again. They were so upset how at the altar of the Iran deal, we handed over everything, we abandoned our allies from the 20th Century which are the Sunni governments of Saudi Arabia, of Egypt, et cetera. We then also handed them money that we lied to the Iranian people where Obama in videos was telling the Iranian people that this money will help their economy, and this year, in January 1st, when the revolution started again, this green revolution, this time, it's not just in Tehran, the revolution was happening in front of the theocratic teaching centers in Qom and other cities of Iran where the clerics are taught. That's what's amazing about the latest revolution in 2018. That started way before we pulled out. So, the Iranian people in that revolution were holding signs saying that, \"Stop sending money to Syria to kill Syrians, we need it here in this country.\" So, we handed them money to spend more on short and mid-range missiles to fund Hezbollah, to spread global terror. We abandoned many operations globally to try to get to Hezbollah at the altar of the nuclear deal. We then allowed companies to come into Tehran to open up shop like Boeing and other European companies which never works to bring down a regime, actually helps to strengthen them and as the sanctions ended, the Khameneists were becoming even more belligerent. So, at the end of the day, we got nothing in return, not even an assurance of their nuclear disarmamentation. At the end of the day, we were more insecure and now, within months of us pulling out of the deal, the Iranian people are starting to see their economy weaken, which is actually helping them destabilize their government and they actually see a light at the end of the tunnel, they're extremely thankful. The people of Iran who we would share our values with are thankful of what President Trump, John Bolton and others have done now, and I think there is no - I don't know what planet the left is living on in thinking that somehow that was wise. I think we're proving now that the best anti- nuclear program would be to destabilize that regime and hopefully have a revolution to bring forth more democracy. LEVIN: This Civil War, it's more than a Civil War. These battles in Syria taking place, Israeli exposed Turkey, hasn't it, and Erdogan who has become a fascist. Still an American ally, apparently. JASSER: He's always been, Erdogan, when he even was running back in early 2000 said democracy is a train. You use it until you get to where you want to go and then you get off. He is a cultish leader of a neo-caliphate that he wants to establish hegemony on, America should really look at suspending them from NATO. He is using language against the European nations where if Austria decides to shuts down a few mosques, he basically starts using war language against them. If the Danish decides to outlaw the Burqa, he then is starting to belligerently talk against them, so this is a country that we supposedly have a treaty with, in NATO and yet, he is using language - hegemonic language about Islamic supremacy, while our families in Syria, if we want to blame other than blaming the Assad regime, Iran and Russia, any country that radicalized the Syrian revolution was Qatar and Turkey especially. LEVIN: And very briefly, he's cozying up with Russia, getting weapons from Russia, wasn't he? JASSER: Yes, his latest shipment, the missiles are from Russia because he said, \"Well, the Europeans and the west are becoming antagonistic, so I am going to Russia.\" This, guy, the NATO Treaty means nothing to him. So, if you want to contain him, Americans need to wake up that while we're obsessed with whatever the media in Washington and New York are obsessed with... LEVIN: Stormy Daniels, oh my gosh. JASSER: It is horrifically negligent for us to ignore what's happening in Turkey with Erdogan while the biggest mosque opened in America today in the last few years, now the largest mosque is in Maryland, which is a Diyanet outpost of the Turkish government. LEVIN: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will watch us also on LevinTV, LevinTV. You can catch us on crtv.com, give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV. Sign up with our wonderful conservative community over there. We'll be right back. The President has been trashed early on, when he wanted to put in place immigration rules that limited at least for a period of time, individuals coming to this country, refugees, from certain countries, and even Federal judges, many of whom were appointed by Barack Obama accused him essentially of being anti-Muslim. Do you see it that way? JASSER:Absolutely not. I mean, to hold a President not accountable to words he may have said in his campaign. I might have disagreed with his word choice, of how he expressed things. Bottom line is his policy today, it is absurd to say, I mean, I am the fruit of Muslim immigrants that came here to practice their faith, so I believe that at the core of Americanism is a pro-immigration sense, but it is un-American to say that we should have lotteries or that we should have chain migration. I don't understand that. Americans who want to be, you know, people who want to be Americans should be welcome based on ideology. Communists, Islamists, collectivists who don't believe in our American Constitutional law, should not be allowed in. So, an Islamist ban is very appropriate and the previous administration, not only Obama but the Bush administration also have never really articulated how we vet refugees. LEVIN: Is an Islamist ban a Muslim ban? JASSER: No. While all Islamists are Muslim, certainly not all Muslims are Islamists. And if anyone should be able to get this is, Mark, it's Americans, we were founded by Christians who did not want to be theocrats or Christianists, so Islamists are certainly a large plurality among the Muslim population, but they are certainly not a majority. And if they're Islamists, then let them go to Saudi Arabia, let them go to other countries. They don't need to come to America and destabilize who we are as a country, because we're just going to welcome people willy-nilly regardless of their ideology. LEVIN: And those six countries, they don't even come close to making up the majority of Muslims in the world. The largest Muslim countries weren't even included? JASSER: Yes, 56 countries have Muslim majorities. To say that that's a Muslim ban is just absurd and it is insulting to Muslims. It's insulting to the Muslims in prisons in those countries. Many of the folks who get out are actually sent by their regimes to infiltrate as the Turks do and their policies, if you will. So, I think there's nothing more pro-Muslim than saying. \"You know what? If you believe in the western narrative of freedom and liberty, welcome to the west. If you don't believe in our way of secular liberal democracy, then you're not welcome here.\" LEVIN: And by the way, that's the way it used to be across the board. We'll be right back. My final question to you, Zuhdi Jasser, what can be done with the left's ideological hold on the narrative about Islam? JASSER: I think look at how President Trump came to where he is today. He's a disruptor who fought against the establishment. Now, he is taking the offense and destroying ISIS and back against the Khomeinist and others, so I would ask the American people and President Trump to take the offense, to embrace disruption, embrace some chaos in the Middle East as bad as that might sound, revolutions are good, not the ones with Islamists winning, but the ones with those who share our values. The President talked about a commission on radical Islam in his campaign, it's time to convene that. It's time to no longer just have Iftar dinners that bring in ambassadors or that bring in Islamists which thankfully, he did not do this year, but bring in almost a freedom-form into the White House of Muslim dissidents, of our Muslim Reform Movement to say, \"These are the Muslim side who we want to take.\" There is nothing more pro- diversity, pro-American than embracing Muslims that reject theocracy, and we are going to let them stand on their shoulders as Americans and show that we are pro-Muslim, but anti- Islamist. LEVIN: So, embrace the Freedom Fighters as we always have and those who fought communism and fascism and so forth, and do the same with Muslims. Thank you very much. Very, very important. JASSER: Thank you. LEVIN: See you next time on \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Trey Gowdy weighs in on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Story,\" September 6, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL HOST: Some tough question from Senator Cruz, there. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this 'Special Report.' Fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha McCallum, who's back in New York, starts right now. Hi, Martha. (CROSSTALK) MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Back in New York. It'd be -- it'd be terrible to lose the spot for the Supreme Court justice on a basketball question. So, I don't think you will. Thanks, Bret. Good to see you tonight. So, breaking this evening, now dozens of top administration officials rushing to add their names to the list insisting that, \"It is not me.\" Each one of these folks, they are not the author they say of the skating insider New York Times op-ed supposedly written by an anonymous member of the Trump administration. The denials have been coming at a furious clip all afternoon. Now, late into the night as Trump loyalist line up to say, \"It wasn't me.\" It wasn't me, either. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum back here in New York tonight. The White House in full counterattack mode calling the author of that piece a gutless loser as many of the media rushed to describe the mood inside the White House says they know it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HALLIE JACKSON, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, NBC: The president's mood is volcanic to use their description of the words, he is exploding at this furious. CHRIS CUOMO, ANCHOR, CNN: We got a real witch hunt going this time, and it's happening in the West Wing. JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, MORNING JOE, MSNBC: What do you think about that letter? MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST, MORNING JOE, MSNBC: Incredible. Incredible move by the New York Times, incredible letter, and not the way the White House is supposed to work, not normal. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So, there you have it. White House director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp, to respond to all of that in just a moment. But first, Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry, live with us here on 'The Story' in the leap with the late-breaking details. Hi, Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, great to see you, Martha. This is really on fire, right now. President Trump, fighting fire with fire. Charging this was a gutless editorial that amounts to an act of treason. And he got air cover today ranging from First Lady Melania Trump to most of his cabinet. As Liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren, tonight went on the attack. Saying, it is time for senior White House officials to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from office if they are really working covertly to prevent him from doing damage. Warren lashing out declaring to CNN what kind of a crisis do we have if senior officials believe that the president can't do his job and then refuse to follow the rules that have been laid down in the Constitution. Top officials, of course, are dismissing that attack as key people close to the president circle the wagons. The first lady, declaring the press should stop abusing the use of anonymous sources and slamming that anonymous official in the New York Times. Mrs. Trump, saying, \"To the writer of the op-ed, you are not protecting this country, you are sabotaging it with your cowardly actions.\" There was a flurry of speculation that perhaps Vice President Mike Pence was a suspect because the op-ed used the word \"lodestar,\" a rarely used word that was utilized by the V.P. when he talked about creating the Space Force. Though, it's possible the real writer used that word to try and pin this on Pence, unfairly. His aides today made clear he has the guts to attach his name to any op-ed, he writes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think, it's a disgrace. The anonymous editorial published in The New York Times represents a new low in American journalism. And I think, the New York Times should be ashamed. And I think, whoever wrote this anonymous editorial should also be ashamed as well. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. McGahn, did you write that op-ed? DON MCGAHN, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: No. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: White House Counsel Don McGahn, there. The hunt for the mole led to that bizarre display of top officials having to not -- deny, it's them. McGahn, already under the microscope for his 30 hours of cooperation with the special counsel, telling reporters there on Capitol Hill it's not him, as he tried to Shepherd the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the High Court. There are now literally dozens of top officials. Look at all of them, who have come forward with formal statements declaring they are not anonymous. With Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, saying speculation that he or his top deputy penned the op-ed is patently false. An aide to the Treasury Secretary saying, it's laughable to suggest he did it. Of course, all of those denials keep the story alive a bit more as does the fact that Senator Rand Paul tonight is saying lie-detector tests should be administered to smoke out the leak. And by the way, the president has a political rally tonight, Montana, Martha. Pretty good chance he mentions this. MACCALLUM: We have a pretty good odds on that. Ed, thank you. Good to see you. HENRY: Good to see you. MACCALLUM: So, joining me now exclusively, Mercedes Schlapp White House director of strategic communications. Mercedes, good evening. Good to have you with us tonight. MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Thank you for having me, Martha. So, you just saw that huge panel with all of the faces of all of those people who have put out statements saying that \"It wasn't me.\" We haven't seen an official formal statement from you. Do you want to go on the record tonight to say that it wasn't you? SCHLAPP: Look, it wasn't me. And you know, the people that know exactly who it is, is obviously the New York Times. I mean, this is just a disappointing and shocking that an anonymous source would go out there and pretend to say that he's the savior of this administration. This is obviously someone who doesn't know the president well. I mean, at the end of the day, those of us who get to see the president inaction making very important decisions, bringing in his advisers, focusing on a variety of issues, and at the same time, pushing forward an incredibly successful agenda. I have to tell you, it just shows that this individual is coward and focused on his own in self-interest and his ego. And quite frankly, he needs to resign. MACCALLUM: There, you know, the responses are that the president was volcanic over this, is one of the words that was used. You're inside the White House, tell me what the -- what is the feeling about all this in there? And is everybody sort of looking over their shoulder and trying to figure out, is it you, is it that person? Who is it? SCHLAPP: Absolutely not. The president has had a series of meetings today. Obviously, yesterday he met with the GOP leadership to talk about the Appropriations Bill. We're focused on policy, we're focused on his agenda. We saw this week the manufacturing productivity index come out. It's the best we've seen in 14 years manufacturing construction jobs are at an all-time high. I mean we are focused on this booming economy. We are focused on the wins for the American people. It is why he's being so -- you know, it's why he is successful. It's why he keeps focusing on what matters most which is ensuring that we have a strong economy that our nation is protected. That's what matters to the American people. MACCALLUM: Understood. SCHLAPP: And so, when you have -- you know, I have to tell you, Martha, I've worked for two presidents. It is an honor to serve President Trump. And for me, it is incredibly hurt -- hurtful and disappointing that you have these individuals who are literally wasting taxpayer dollars by pretending again to be the ones to solve this problem here, and where there is no problem. And so, it's so clear to me that if he has does not want to support this president, he needs to resign. It is the right thing to do. He needs to stop hiding behind the New York Times. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Let me ask you -- let me ask you this. You know, we heard this reports all the time. And in fact, we know we've heard them almost since the beginning of the administration that there are different factions within the White House. And that there are dozens of people who are working there, who like being towards the power center, but who -- you know, essentially are working against the President's agenda. You know, what do you say to that? SCHLAPP: I can tell you here at the White House and under the leadership of General Kelly, and obviously I was brought in under General Kelly's leadership. It -- you know, there are processes in place. We are moving forward on the policies that matter. We're a team. We're ensuring that the president gets the information that he needs to make incredibly important decisions. And then, when you look at our list of accomplishments, whether it's increasing our military spending, protecting our veterans, making sure that we're protecting Social Security. Focusing on an economy that we have not seen in a very long time. Historic numbers in terms of unemployment. I can go on and on, on the list of what we're doing. And it's frustrating to find -- yes. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Understood. And I -- and I can imagine that it would be incredibly difficult and frustrating. But I asked you, I can imagine that, that would be even more difficult if there were people who were -- you know, working against that agenda within the White House. Can you say unequivocally? SCHLAPP: Well, and again, the New York -- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: That people who worked -- Now, I know last night Kellyanne was asked whether or not she thought of someone in the White House, because a senior administration official is a pretty -- you know, you could drive a truck through that title and\u2026 SCHLAPP: It's a very broad term. MACCALLUM: So, are you confident that it is not someone who works in the White House or even in the old executive office building? SCHLAPP: Look, again, call the New York Times opinion editor and ask them. They know who this person is, this person should stop being a coward and come out. And let us know who they are because, at the end of the day, they've made it very broad very mysterious. A senior administration official, it can be a lot of people. MACCALLUM: Yes. SCHLAPP: But at the end of the day, those of us who get to be with the President of United States who see him in action as -- he was leading these meetings, who is pushing forward significant and important policy that impact all of our lives, and doing a very successful job. Obviously, this is wanting to be a distraction from this anonymous source. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: Understood, and he has -- obviously, it's understandably frustrating for him and nobody -- everybody wants a team that's all on the same page. So, you know, obviously, somebody is not on the page whether they're in the building or not. I thought it was very interesting -- SCHLAPP: Yes. But we stand together -- teams stands together at the White House. MACCALLUM: I understand, I understood. You know, when you look at this -- you know, the Woodward book, and you look at all this stuff, there obviously there are forces out there that are trying to undermine what you guys are doing. There's no doubt about that. And I thought it was interesting John Kasich came out today. And he's someone who -- you know if you ask people. Do you think anybody -- you know, in the party would ever run against the president, his name often comes up? And here's what he said when he was asked about this. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOHN KASICH, R\u2014OHIO: It's just chaos all the time. I mean, and it seems like he's the -- you know, the commander of the chaos. It's like there's a tornado every day. Now, that's fine if that's the way he wants to run it but what I can tell you is when you have all that chaos, how do you get in -- how do you solve the biggest problems? (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: Do you think there's any chance that John Kasich is testing the water and trying to figure out whether or not there's any softness, any opening for him to potentially run against the president? SCHLAPP: Look, if he wants to go see chaos, he can come to the Schlapp house with the five girls. This idea that there's chaos here in the White House is just absolutely inaccurate. We are -- again, very focused on the process that we're looking at in terms of our policies. We're focused on the agenda that's incredibly important for the American people. Whatever Kasich decides, let him decide. Obviously, he's lost the first round, we know that the president, President Trump in his campaign was incredibly successful. He beat out those candidates, and he is winning. And it's amazing when you're talking about two Supreme Court nominees, when you're talking about the fact that we are working through in building our economy and giving Americans an opportunity to be lifted up and just job creation in America significant, significant accomplishments on our list. So, for Kasich, whatever his agenda might be. Obviously, he's never been a friend of the president. But here's the deal, they're all as a Democrats, and as we know, they fear the fact that President Trump is winning. And that is why they will do what they can to stop him. But we are focused. The president is focused. He will keep fighting for the American people and that's why they believe in what he's doing, and they believe that what he's doing is the right thing to ensure that we protect our country here and making sure that we stay strong abroad. MACCALLUM: All right. Mercedes, thanks for taking the questions tonight. We appreciate you being here. Have a good night. Mercedes Schlapp from the White House this evening. SCHLAPP: Thank you. MACCALLUM: So, when we come back, Congressman Trey Gowdy will be with us to weigh in. And let us talk about chaos. And also a bit of chaos coming on at these confirmation hearings unfolding on The Hill. And does he have a theory perhaps on who the senior White House official might be? Not White House, administration official might be, when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D\u2014CONNECTICUT: I'm going to take that as a no, which you are giving under oath and we can put aside the humor for the moment. BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE: Right. I'm not trying to be humorous, I'm trying to be accurate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So there's a live look at Capitol Hill right now where it is still going on. It is an absolute marathon of questioning for Brett Kavanaugh who wants to be the next Supreme Court Justice. Aside from a few short breaks, he's basically been in the chair since 9:30 this morning when all of this started off with yet another bang. Democratic senator Cory Booker believed to be a front-runner potentially to challenge President Trump in 2020 releasing what he termed were confidential documents to the public. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER, D\u2014N.J.: I'm going to release the email about racial profiling and I understand that that -- the penalty comes with potential outs ting from the Senate. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R\u2014TEXAS: No senator deserves to sit on this committee or serve in the Senate in my view if they decide to be a law unto themselves. BOOKER: Then bring the charges. This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So just in case you don't know what he's referring to. This is the moment from the classic movie with Kirk Douglas. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm Spartacus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm Spartacus. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So that's what it is. So there's one problem here. According to a lawyer in charge of those documents, the lawyer in charge of them, they were already made public. In a statement to Fox News, Bill Burck says we were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics, as he puts it, this morning because he had already -- we had already told him he could use those documents publicly. Congressman Trey Gowdy, no stranger to wild hearings on the Hill joins us now. Congressman, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for joining us. REP. TREY GOWDY, R\u2014S.C.: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. MACCALLUM: Obviously, this is going on, on the Senate side but I'm curious about your thoughts about what Senator Booker did today and whether or not there was any reason for the drama surrounding it. GOWDY: Only 20-20 presidential politics, Martha. They missed a wonderful opportunity -- the Senate did to have a robust interesting hearing about judicial philosophy and whether you're a strict constructionist or whether you're a minimalist. I mean, these are legitimate questions and reasonable minds can differ. What I've watched over the last couple of days was a bunch of people who want to be the nominee in 2020 and it's sad. I grew up watching confirmation hearings. I'm a little bit of a nerd. I think they're -- it's incredible to watch smart people question other smart people about important matters. So you're seeing 20-20 presidential politics but you're also seeing at its core this division upon about what the role of the court is. Is it a super-legislature by which you can obtain the -- your objective if you can't get it at the ballot box or do you want people to simply interpret the law. MACCALLUM: I mean, that that is ultimately the question in terms of how a justice would rule, what goes into those decisions, and how -- what their process is, and how closely adhered they are to the Constitution. But it didn't prevent people from trying obviously to try to read some tea leaves, to try to look at some of the e-mails and statements that he has made in the past, Brett Kavanaugh, that might shed some light on how he might rule in the future. Here's Kamala Harris asking an interesting you know, question which doesn't really have a whole lot to do with you know, basic Constitutional questions but she wanted to know if he had ever communicated with one of the attorneys who at one point was involved in the Mueller probe. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D\u2014CALIF.: Have you discussed Mueller or his investigation with anyone at Kasowitz Benson and Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's personal lawyer? Be sure about your answer, sir. Yes or no. KAVANAUGH: I need to know -- I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm. HARRIS: I don't think you need to. I think you need to know who you talked with. Who'd you talk to? (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: She went on to say something like I think you may be thinking of someone and pressing him further on that. What did you make of that exchange? Is it -- is it useful? GOWDY: When I'm sitting here thinking is every time we asked a question about Mueller, we're accused of undermining the Mueller probe so she's asking, of course, you know. But is it useful? It depends on what the factual predicate is. If she has evidence that Brett Kavanaugh has already made up his mind about some essential role, some essential issue that's going to come before the court, then she needs to lay out that factual predicate and get him to respond to it. But do you know anyone who works at the following D.C. law firm is an absurd, ridiculous question that you would only ask if you wanted to appeal to the base and position yourself as a front-runner ahead of Cory, and Elizabeth Warren, and everyone else for the pole position in 2020. Then it's a really good question. MACCALLUM: In your mind, did anybody -- you know, we're there any moments where you thought, I don't think that was a great answer on his part? GOWDY: I didn't watch -- the House didn't work too hard today but we did work today so I didn't get to watch as much of it today. I watched all of the opening statements. I thought Ben Sasse did a phenomenal job of framing the issue of how you view the court. I did watch -- I've known Cory since I've since I got to Washington. That's not the Cory Booker that I know that I watched on television. And the shame of it all to me is that is what ambition and presidential politics can do to otherwise reasonable people. That was the shame of it to me. That is not the Cory Booker that I discussed criminal justice reform with. That is someone trying to position himself as the frontrunner so he can take on Donald Trump. And I think, Martha, people are sick of four year-long presidential election cycles. I mean, they were positioning themselves from the moment he finished his inaugural address and I think people were sick of that. MACCALLUM: All right, I want to play -- just to get to one other topic because The Daily Beast tonight is just putting out a news story which suggests that there are other people in the larger Trump administration who were cheering on and fist-bumping each other at the release of this anonymous editorial that came out last night and that there are you know, folks who are sort of lying in wait to make sort of the same kind of statements out there. What do you think about that? GOWDY: Well, why do we have the right to cross-examine witnesses? Why do we have the right to confront our accusers? Why do we make children testify in a courtroom feet away from the people that they allege abuse them? That's how much we value the power to cross-examine and confront people who make accusations. You can't do that with an anonymous source. So if you really think this president is unfit, if you really are contemplating the 25th Amendment, then resign your job or go public. If you think the fate of our republic hangs in the balance of what you're going to tell the New York Times editorial board, then show your face and deal with the consequences of it. But this anonymity and fist-bumping behind closed doors, how does that help us? If you have information and evidence, bring it forward, let people cross-examine, and test and probe the efficacy and accuracy of your information. But to hide behind anonymity, it doesn't happen in any courtroom. I'm not saying that journalists shouldn't rely on anonymous sources. You're welcome to do that. But when you're calling in the into question the fitness of the leader of the free world, it is not too much to ask that you step forward. MACCALLUM: Trey Gowdy, thank you very much, Congressman. GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. MACCALLUM: Always good to see you. GOWDY: You too. MACCALLUM: Thanks for coming tonight. GOWDY: Thank you. MACCALLUM: You bet. So while everybody is focused on this drama in Washington, President Trump may have scored a big win in North Korea by reopening the issue of nuclear weapons which appear now to be back on the table in a pretty positive way in terms of their elimination. Bill Bennett is here with that news out of the White House tonight when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The record is quite remarkable that President Trump has faithfully followed the agenda he campaigned on in 2016. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: An article was just printed, just came out a few minutes ago. Trump breaks the record for budget gridlock, wins, scores big win. So in 20 years, it hasn't been like it is now. That's just really positive stuff. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: So as President Trump pointing out that his administration he believes has won big on the economy and on foreign policy issues that often get overshadowed by a lot of the discussion especially of during the few rough days that the White House has been enduring. So for more on this, we turn to Trace Gallagher for a look at some of the undercurrent stuff that's been going on while a lot of us have been focused on some of the -- some of the buzzier stuff. Trace, what's going on? TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Well, Martha let's begin with foreign policy. Despite the Department of Justice today filing a criminal complaint against the North Korean hacker believed to be behind the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, and despite the U.S. Treasury Department's slapping that hacker in his North Korean company with sanctions, U.S. North Korea diplomacy appears to be moving forward. Kim Jong Un told a South Korean envoy that he continues to trust President Trump and continues to work toward fulfilling the promise he made to President Trump. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUNG EUI-YONG, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SOUTH KOREA (through translator): Chairman Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his commitment for complete denuclearization of Korean Peninsula and expressed his willingness for close cooperation not only with South Korea but also with the United States in that regard. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: In response, the President tweeted \"Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together.\" The North is holding another summit with South Korean later this month. Meantime, the president also appears to be winning the so-called trade war with China. A business professor and vice president of King's College in Manhattan wrote an op-ed for Newsweek saying that China was supposed to have the political strength and economic have to win a trade war with the U.S. but quoting here, with China's economy now evidencing strain under U.S. tariffs and the U.S. economy booming, its Chinese leader Xi who finds himself in a surprisingly weak position. The op-ed ends by saying the president's willingness to challenge the status quo on trade leaves him in a strong position to strike a much fair deal. And experts said the trade war with China would lead to job cuts because of uncertainty among employers except jobless claims are now at the lowest level since 1969 and the labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. Finally many on Capitol Hill are giving the president and his team credit for breaking a 20-year budget gridlock. Instead of passing one big omnibus bill to cover the federal budget Trump and leaders of the House and Senate are passing bills to cover each individual department. Experts say it sounds wonky, but truly it's a big deal. Martha? MACCALLUM: Big deal. Right. Trace, thank you very much. So, here now with more to weigh in, our big perspective person, Bill Bennett, host of the Bill Bennett podcast. He served as education secretary under President Reagan and he's now a Fox News contributor. Bill, good evening. Good to see you. And this President Trump getting off of Air Force One, he has just landed in Billings, Montana on what looks like a lovely night. BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. MACCALLUM: They have a 9 p.m. rally in Billings, Montana tonight. When you listen to what Trace had to say there, Bill, those are a lot of significant advances. BENNETT: Yes, how about that? So we have this situation that's, I don't know whether it's laughable or appalling on this op-ed where this guy bravely says that he speaks up to the president trying to thwart the president. What exactly is he trying to thwart the president for doing? Getting rid of ISIS? Getting two excellent people on the Supreme Court? Lowering taxes? Stimulating an economy like we have never been seen before? Getting the Keystone pipeline moving again? Cracking down on MS-13 and sanctuary cities? I mean, John Kasich was in a clip earlier in your show, Martha, saying it's chaos, and he is the commander of chaos. If this is chaos, let there be chaos. Let's have some more chaos. I m mean, he is getting stuff done. MACCALLUM: You know, and it is, it's remarkable when you step outside of Washington as you do in North Carolina-- (CROSSTALK) BENNETT: Yes, that's right. MACCALLUM: -- and you sort of kind of get a feel for what is action in people's minds -- the cameras haven't found there. I was reminded of news item that happened, you know, last week that Mike Pompeo was supposed to participate in some of these meetings and the president pulled him back and said don't go. I'm not pleased with what the North Koreans are saying right now. BENNETT: Yes. MACCALLUM: And then lo and behold, you have this extraordinary successful meeting between the North and the South. And Kim Jong Un wants to make it very clear that he would like to have those discussion continue about denuclearization, Bill. BENNETT: Well, first North Korea and then North Carolina. North Korea, yes, North -- Mr. Kim, Kim Jong Un says he wants to deal with President Trump and he trusts him. This is something no other modern president or any president has achieved. And in North Carolina, a friend of ours lives in a small town in North Carolina who just said she and her husband just said, this is garbage. This is nonsense, this is crazy. Who would care about someone writing anonymously for the New York Times? So when you talk about the unhinged, I think that's a lot of the people who are taking this thing to the panic point. MACCALLUM: Yes. BENNETT: I saw another cable station, I won't say what it begins, or what it is, it begins with C and ends with N. That they said total chaos at the White House. Everything is driven, everything is falling apart. Well, if the record I cited just in part is what it means to fall apart, may we fall apart that way. The one thing this does do, though, doesn't it, Martha, it confirms what Donald Trump has been saying. That there is definitely a deep state. Definitely a lot to people out to put him down. And let's remember the serious constitutional issue here, he was elected. This anonymous guy and his other people were not elected. (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: He's not. That's very clear. BENNETT: And when you thwart him, you were thwarting the American people. You are thwarting the American people. MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. You know, I can't help but wonder if this person who wrote this is, you know, thinking about their next job and if it's so insular inside the beltway and you have all these headlines about constant chaos, which may or not end up to be true. BENNETT: Right. MACCALLUM: But, you know, they think everything is about to implode, and they worry about their next job they're trying to make sure that it's very clear that they weren't necessarily in with the agenda at the White House so that they can maybe pave the way for a future pretty short-term thinking. BENNETT: Yes. Yes. MACCALLUM: Bill, thank you. BENNETT: Yes. The Harvard Business School-- MACCALLUM: Yes, go ahead. BENNETT: The Harvard Business School they talk about destructive innovation. So, thank you. Thank you very much. MACCALLUM: You mean, that's an example. Bill, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. So should Americans stop taking credit for putting a man on the moon? A movie thinks it's a good idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A large step for mankind. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: That never gets old. Jonah Goldberg never gets old either. He is here to explain why patriotism and pride might not be such a bad thing, when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: So that is part of the trailer for a new film about man's first trip to the moon. Providing a sneak peek at a glaring omission that has surfaced, not on the surface of the moon. Something was missing, America's most iconic symbol, the American flag! And everyone remembers that incredible moment and the images that were sent back to Earth of the planting of the flag on the moon. My next guest argues that Americans have a right to be proud of Neil Armstrong's strides and says, quote, \"Pride and American accomplishment should not be a partisan affair.\" Here now Jonah Goldberg, National Review senior editor and Fox News contributor. Jonah, welcome. Good to have you with us tonight. JONAH GOLDBERG, COLUMNIST, NATIONAL REVIEW: Good to be here. MACCALLUM: You know, I mean, it's just like, it's really a head-scratcher to imagine why you would be able to stow a fuller story about what was going on inside Neil Armstrong's head, which is what the filmmaker he's very successfully, he did \"La La Land\" and now he's doing this with Ryan Gosling. He claims that, you know, somehow have would have detracted from me in some way. GOLDBERG: Yes. I mean, I think they're a bunch of different ways to interpret this. One, you now, it could be just simply China doesn't like a lot of pro-America stuff. And if you take the flag out, it might sell a few extra million dollars over there. But I think the real problem is that there is an unbelievable reluctance to just do the sort of basic old-fashioned pride in America accomplishment thing. I think the filmmakers are exactly right. Ryan Gosling is exactly right. This was viewed around the world as a human accomplishment. And that's something that Americans should take pride in. It was a global accomplishments. It was accomplishment for all of mankind. As it says on the plaque, you know, one giant step for -- one step for men when giant steps for mankind. But it was also deeply rooted in sort of the American, you know, miracle that we're all sort of proud of. And there was only one country in the world that could have done this. And the real point of the column was that, I think liberals are the ones who should have been much more outraged by all of this. I mean, how many every single Democratic present in my lifetime loves to do this, if we could put a man on the moon, we can have universal healthcare. We can do this, we can do that. Barack Obama did all the time, talking about Sputnik moments and all of that. MACCALLUM: That's right. GOLDBERG: Well, every Democrat -- every successful Democratic president in the 20th century was a dedicated nationalist to one extent or another. You know, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, Joe Biden, they all got into politics-- (CROSSTALK) MACCALLUM: But here's the-- GOLDBERG: -- largely because of JFK and he was a nationalist. MACCALLUM: Yes, understood. But here is sort of the elephant in the room, so to speak, right? That something about patriotism and flags, you know, seems to have some connection to Donald Trump, at least in Hollywood right now. That patriotism has become sort of a dirty word. I mean, you have talked about populism being a negative thing, you're talking about nationalism being a positive thing. But people, you know, the definition between nationalism and patriotism, I mean, you know, is this an anti-Trump move in this movie? Is that what it's really about? GOLDBERG: There might be some of that. But to be honest, the, you know, Hollywood has had the sort of cosmopolitan point of view for a very long time. You know, I remember one of the last \"Superman\" -- one of the preview \"Superman\" movies, you know, he sort of renounces he has American citizenship. He becomes a citizen of the world. I think that happened on Obama's watch. This is a constant strain, and my point is that, if liberals want to do ambitious things, most of which I disagree with, they are going to have to draw on something other than pride in being, you know, by Tatum (Ph) humanoids. You know, you can't just say human pride is going to do all these things, you have to take pride in being an American. I'm not a big fan of nationalism. I like patriotism. I think there is a difference. But I think the right is going too far with the nationalist. But one of the reasons they're doing it, is because the left is giving up any notions of patriotism whatsoever. MACCALLUM: As Marco Rubio said, this is total lunacy and a disservice and a time when our people need reminders of what we can achieve when we work together. He said the American people paid for the mission, the rockets were built by Americans with American technology and carrying American astronauts. It was not a U.N. mission to the moon. Jonah, thank you very much. GOLDBERG: Thank you. MACCALLUM: Good to see you tonight. GOLDBERG: Great to be here. Thank you. MACCALLUM: So still to come on 'The Story,' President Trump about to take the stage in Billings, Montana, as the crowd is filling up the arena there ahead of the critical November midterm. We're going to go there live next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: We are back with this Fox News alert braking moments ago. The president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has now made a definitive statement to the Associated Press, saying that President Trump will not answer questions from federal investigators in writing or in person on whether or not he tried to block the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, also known as obstruction of justice. Rudy Giuliani, his lawyer saying that anything related to obstruction of justice is, quote, \"no-go.\" Now we learned two days ago that Mueller's team would accept written answers on the subject of collusion, so this appears to be the next stage response from the Trump team. We'll keep you posted as we get more on that. Also, as you can see on the right-hand side of your screen tonight the president has arrived in Billings, Montana. We are told he will take the stage in about an hour from now. It is the second time in two months that he has rallied in the state in support of Republican Senate candidate, Matt Rosendale. And Dan Springer live in Billings tonight where we saw the president arrived moments ago, with the latest from the scene. Hi there, Dan. DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hey, Martha. The second trip to Montana in the last two months, but the third in the last two years. President Trump campaign here in Billings two years ago, so the people who supported him in Montana can't believe their good fortune they have so many trips from Trump. Two months ago he was out here campaigning for Matt Rosendale who was the auditor of the State of Montana who was running against Jon Tester. He came back two months later and this is going to be a big crowd. About 10,000 people fit in the stadium. They are expecting this to be completely filled. There is a very small number of protesters outside. All these people here are supporting Trump, we are seeing a lot of MAGA signs. We're seeing people chanting, USA! USA! It's going to be a big crowd and we're expecting Trump to be touting the economy, talking about the tax cuts, talking about deregulation. What's interesting is what we'll hear, if anything about the op-ed piece in the New York Times and whether we'll hear anything about the Bob Woodward book. I talk to some people who are in line beforehand, they say that they don't really care about these anonymous sources, they believe in Trump. They want Trump to be Trump and they don't really want a more civil Donald Trump either. Back to you. MACCALLUM: All right. Dan, thank you very much. So Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth is also in Montana tonight where he will interview President Trump ahead of tonight's rally. You can see the whole interview tomorrow morning starting at 6 a.m. on Fox and Friends. And he is one of the most outspoken survivors and heroes of the attack that took the lives of the four individuals that you see on our wall. But there is one story that Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto has never shared in public and he will do so tonight in his untold story. Next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MACCALLUM: The deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012 left four Americans dead and many Americans wondering why no backup ever arrived to help those on the ground in our diplomatic post. One of the most outspoken heroes and survivors of that night, Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto has talked about the stand-down order and the sacrifices that were made. Yet, some of the scars are deeper than we knew. He shares tonight his untold story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Somebody killed four Americans and wounded three others in an attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in Libya. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound and set fire to our building. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A day when Americans hope to pause and remember the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks, they were instead greeting with the faces of a new age of terrorists. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: I know it cut you to the core. And you say at one point you even were so low that you consider taking your own life? KRIS \"TANTO\" PARONTO, BENGHAZI SURVIVOR: You know, you go through demons and nobody needs to feel sorry for me about that, we all go through of those demons. But when you come back and then your life is completely changed from being very secretive and then having a very public life. And seeing that those people that you were sworn to protect our calling you liars. It's a bit of a shell shock. I have a lot more admiration for actors and high profile people, because people grabbing at you, I didn't want that. I didn't go on to the CIA to do this. I didn't go to the military to do this. And at that point in life, I was just trying to adjust to it. I didn't know how to adjust to it. And it was just sucking me dry. And I was like, I'm going to go home and suck start to, lack of better term, and I have since I'm in military talk in military tongue gets in to suck start a Glock, a pistol. I put it in my mouth basically. MACCALLUM: There was a moment that you run into an older lady in an airport-- PARONTO: Yes, yes, I remember that. MACCALLUM: -- who said that she believed you. And that she wanted you to keep going. PARONTO; And all she said as she goes, are you Tanto? You know, and I was very abrupt with her. Because I didn't want to talk to anybody. Like, more or less, what you want? I turned around and said yes, ma'am, I'm Kris, I'm Tanto. And she goes, I believe you. Don't stop talking. And that was early on. And I was like, well, maybe this is what I need to keep doing. So I kept pressing on. Having people there that said, you know what, we do listen to you, we do support you, we have your back. And that kind of person, an older lady, I know that she is a lot wiser that I can ever hope to be and saying you can do this, keep going. That gives you the strength to keep going. MACCALLUM: Sometimes people give you a message, their messenger for you-- PARONTO: It is. MACCALLUM: -- in one way or another. PARONTO: Yes, ma'am. MACCALLUM: I mean, obviously there is a real suicide problem in the military-- PARONTO: Yes, ma'am. MACCALLUM: -- and among our veterans which is so tragic. Can you tell me a little bit about how you felt then? Because you were able to pull yourself out but there are going to be people out there who might find some solace and understanding how low you felt at that point. PARONTO: You know, it's not a disorder, post-traumatic stress, I've been diagnosed, I have it. I was to play with it for many years. Men and women they find themselves traveling down that road and not able to pull themselves back up and that's when they end their lives. And there were just a time where I did. What I did is I went to the V.A. and people didn't know this, I will tell you right now. I went to the V.A. hospital in Omaha. I checked myself in, I gave my cell phone. I said here, take this. Check me in. I won't be in here until it's time for me to go. It helped me recalibrate myself, get me back online, realize that, you know, life is short and I can't do it all this all by myself. MACCALLUM: There is something you always do? What was that about? PARONTO: The jumbo. Actually. It was started in Tunisia. It means good morning actually. MACCALLUM: Yes. PARONTO: But how I developed that. I just kept throwing it out to everyone when I was in the area. It did help me idea if somebody would have freak me. That night, when I did it and that's not the movie, I did that. I was - - I couldn't think of anything else. I had no communication and it was what I knew to do. And I did it. Paolo did a great job playing me in the movie. I mean, just that what he did was exactly what I did. And it was, OK, this might hurt but I've to do something. And I was out of options. I remember that vividly, that smile that he gave me. And it was that genuine, hey, we're here. And I remember saying, they were with us on the radio to (Inaudible). I had a little bit of breakdown because of all the adrenaline. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are with us. They are with us. They are with us. (END VIDEO CLIP) MACCALLUM: What does it say on the bracelet? PARONTO: This is a KIA bracelets, a memory bracelet for Tyrone and Glenn. I wore it. I have worn it since I got it before we went to -- before I went back to (Inaudible) and after Libya. Actually I haven't taken it off. I don't remember taking it off. In fact, you can even see being out in the sun. Yes, it's to remember Tyrone and Glenn and to, you know, remember what I'm doing this for and to continue to press on. I mean, they gave their lives. Those guys are the heroes. I'm here, I'm no hero. They sacrificed everything. MACCALLUM: To them and to him for sharing his story with us. That is our story for this Thursday night. We'll see you back here tomorrow night at seven. Stay tuned. Tucker Carlson is coming up next in President Trump's rally in Montana still ahead tonight. Thanks for being with us.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Trump tests the turning radius on the ship of state -\u00a0I\u2019ll Tell You What: Pick of the litter - Wisconsin Dems sound the alarm - Trade war heating up - Imagine his inbox! TRUMP TESTS THE TURNING RADIUS ON THE SHIP OF STATEThe president offered some tough talk to a key international ally. And while the policy demands were not much of a departure from those of his predecessors, the scolding tone and emphasis on the failings of our foreign friends drew shocked responses. The president\u2019s political rivals said he had thrown an important ally \u201cunder the bus\u201d and undermined its fragile governing coalition. The president had made a \u201cdangerous demand\u201d in what amounted to a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of a stalwart supporter of U.S. policy in a crucial region. That\u2019s what some of\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s potential 2012 opponents had to say about Obama\u2019s May 2011 speech calling for Israel to return to its borders before 1967\u2019s Six-Day War. American presidents had previously suggested that a two-state solution for the decades-old conflict depended substantially on Israel surrendering these buffer zones as part of a peace deal. But Obama did so in a public fashion and in such a way that Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0said ceded Israel\u2019s negotiating power. Obama\u2019s conservative critics went bonkers and made Obama\u2019s obviously strained relationship with Netanyahu part of the GOP effort to oust the incumbent the next year. And in 2015 when Obama campaign operatives were part of the effort to unseat Netanyahu in Israeli elections, many Republicans said it was further evidence that America was abandoning its most important regional ally at a time of crisis. Then came the Iran nuclear deal and many Republicans shifted all the way to arguing that Obama was \u201chostile\u201d to the interests of Israel. Conspiracy theorists in the racist right-wing fever swamps suggested that Obama\u2019s secret Muslim faith and alleged Kenyan nativity were behind his undermining of Israel. But while Republicans, mainstream and fringy alike, were apoplectic \u2013 some even sincerely so \u2013 Obama\u2019s base was quite pleased. Liberal Democrats, including a substantial number of American Jews, believed that Netanyahu was a war-monger who was whipping up domestic fears for the purpose of gaining and maintaining power. And many Democrats believed that the lavish support Obama\u2019s predecessor,\u00a0George W. Bush, had provided to Israel was a root cause of anti-U.S. sentiment in the Muslim world. Why should American\u2019s subsidize Israel when Israel wouldn\u2019t help America by making reasonable concessions to American plans for regional realignment? Good for Obama, they said. When Obama smacked Netanyahu and made nice with Tehran, Republicans howled but Obama\u2019s base cheered. Down with neoconservative nation builders; up with letting the Middle East go its own way and \u201cnation building here at home.\u201d And it helped (or at least didn\u2019t hurt) Obama\u2019s chances in 2012. Republican claims of Obama\u2019s foreign policy fecklessness were at least offset by the enthusiasm of voters who were glad Obama was undoing the Bush doctrine. As we know, Obama\u2019s policy aims were dashed in 2016 when\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0won the presidency. Trump has gone on not just to undo Obama\u2019s tough approach to Israel and encouragement to Iran, but to go farther even than Bush ever had. Trump\u2019s own ambitious foreign policy agenda is his crackdown on traditional American allies in Western Europe. The alliance born of the suffering of two world wars and shaped by the Marshall Plan is to Trump as Israel was to Obama. We can still be friends, he says, but things are going to have to change. Meantime, Trump is looking to remake America\u2019s relationship with Russia, a global malefactor and nuclear power on a scale far beyond Iran\u2019s fervid fantasies. Bush and Obama both had aims to make a useful ally out of Russian strongman\u00a0Vladimir Putin, but by the end of 2016 strong majorities in both parties had concluded what the future junior senator from Utah said in 2012: that Putinist Russia was America\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe.\u201d After 18 months in office, though, Trump has never stinted in his admiration for Putin. And is now headed for a summit with the Russian ruler as European allies only too keenly aware of the dangers posed by Putin\u2019s aim for regional dominance are getting nervous. Trump met with the other leaders from the Western alliance today. He opened with a public scolding of Germany and closed with a demand that American counterparts not only immediately fulfil their unmet defense spending requirements but to double their commitments. Like Obama\u2019s upbraiding of Israel seven years ago, Trump isn\u2019t making suggestions that are so different from those of his predecessors. It\u2019s that he is doing so in a blunt, scolding and publicly embarrassing fashion. Trump, like Obama, means to shame an ally into supporting a broader U.S. policy shift. And, like Obama, a former member of Trump\u2019s political team\u00a0is perceived as working to undermine\u00a0a key U.S. ally. And the response from Democrats to Trump\u2019s\u00a0seagull style\u00a0in Brussels was not unlike what Republicans said about Obama\u2019s 1967 borders demand. Senate Minority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer\u00a0said that Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen insults and denigration of one of America\u2019s most steadfast allies, Germany, is an embarrassment. His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the president is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s plenty more where that came from, but that captures the broad sense of Democratic response. And, like those Republicans who believed Obama had a secret agenda in favor of Arabs and against Jews, some Democrats claim that Trump is undermining traditional American allies at the behest of his Kremlin puppet master. And since Putin did intervene in the 2016 U.S. election on Trump\u2019s behalf, the claims take on extra intensity even beyond the fever swamps. What those Democrats and the remaining number of Republicans who oppose Trump\u2019s big foreign policy gambit forget, however, is that Trump insulting Europeans while praising Putin has a constituency perhaps as big as the one Obama was satisfying in his own mission to remake global affairs. At the ceremony today in Brussels before the big dinner for the heads of state, organizers had an acrobat held aloft by a bunch of balloons perform for the dignitaries. Think \u201cUp\u201d meets Cirque du Soleil. It was delicate, odd and very avant-garde \u2013 all things that right-wing American populists are likely to loathe. If Trump had taken out a pea shooter and started popping the performer\u2019s balloons, there would have been plenty of his supporters who would have delighted in the deed. If Trumpism is an attack on the elites, globalists, bleeding hearts and cultural change, then Western Europe is its antithesis. Democratic leaders may not know it, but Trump\u2019s scolding of the same Continentals they revere sounds in the ears of his supporters much like Obama\u2019s upbraiding of Netanyahu. Good for him, they think. Now that fully\u00a0a quarter of Republicans\u00a0\u2013 and probably rising \u2013 holds a favorable view of Putin, there will be less consequence for Trump\u2019s outreach to Moscow. Putin\u2019s emphasis on power, nationalism, cultural traditionalism and machismo is a better fit for Trumpism than the effetes of the West and their balloon ballerinas. And as for Putin\u2019s human rights abuses, murders, international crimes, well\u2026 \u201cyou think our country is so innocent?\u201d Our own political instability is leading to increasingly wild swings in American foreign policy. But whatever these upheavals do to the globe and the hope for a continuation of the Pax Americana, never forget that they trace back to our own domestic politics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 THE RULEBOOK: POWER TO THE PEOPLE\u00a0\u201cThe difference between a federal and national government, as it relates to the OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, is supposed to consist in this, that in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing the Confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on the individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual capacities.\u201d \u2013\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 39 TIME OUT:\u00a0SPEAKING OF CIVILITY\u2026History:\u00a0\u201cIn a duel held in Weehawken, New Jersey, Vice President\u00a0Aaron Burr\u00a0fatally shoots his long-time political antagonist\u00a0Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton, a leading Federalist and the chief architect of America\u2019s political economy, died the following day. \u2026 Hamilton came to detest Burr, whom he regarded as a dangerous opportunist, and he often spoke ill of him. \u2026 Affairs of honor were commonplace in America at the time, and the complex rules governing them usually led to an honorable resolution before any actual firing of weapons. In fact, the outspoken Hamilton had been involved in several affairs of honor in his life, and he had resolved most of them peaceably. No such recourse was found with Burr, however, and on July 11, 1804, the enemies met at 7 a.m. at the dueling grounds near Weehawken, New Jersey. It was the same spot where Hamilton\u2019s son had died defending his father\u2019s honor in 1801. \u2026 Few affairs of honor actually resulted in deaths, and the nation was outraged by the killing of a man as eminent as Alexander Hamilton. Charged with murder in New York and New Jersey, Burr, still vice president, returned to Washington, D.C., where he finished his term immune from prosecution.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.

It\u2019s an unusual message for any candidate, but the liberal Democrat from Wisconsin is sounding the alarm after\u00a0Mitch McConnell\u00a0and\u00a0Chuck Schumer\u00a0effectively declared the first-term senator a favorite to keep her seat in November by leaving her off their lists of top-tier Senate races. After their pronouncements, major outside groups in both parties skipped Wisconsin in their initial $120 million of spending planned for this fall \u2014 triggering fears among state Democrats that the party will take victory for granted. But there\u2019s palpable concern here among Democrats \u2014 and Baldwin especially \u2014 that Wisconsin is ripe for a repeat of 2016, when\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0carried the state by less than a percentage point and GOP Sen.\u00a0Ron Johnson\u00a0surged to a surprise reelection behind a flood of late spending from conservative groups.\u201d GOP candidate Arrington back to campaign trail after car wreck -\u00a0Fox News:\u00a0\u201cRepublican congressional candidate\u00a0Katie Arrington\u00a0is ready again to hit the campaign trail after surviving a horrific head-on collision \u2013 and despite her serious injuries, says it would take \u2018a lot more than an automobile accident to break\u2019 her. \u2018I can\u2019t explain why I lived. If anyone does not believe in God, look at me,\u2019 Arrington told Fox News in a phone interview on Wednesday. \u2026\u00a0Arrington was sidelined by the accident just days after scoring an upset primary victory over Rep.\u00a0Mark Sanford\u00a0last month in South Carolina. But she's now out of the hospital, and plans to return to the trail next week with fundraisers and meetings with supporters. Arrington, who is now sporting a red, white and blue hard cast on her left leg, told Fox News that her campaign is \u2018back on the road.\u2019\u201d Republican officials finalizing Charlotte for 2020 Convention -\u00a0WSJ:\u00a0\u201cRepublican officials were finalizing details Tuesday on a deal to bring the party\u2019s 2020 convention to Charlotte, N.C., making a southern city in a battleground state the site for President Donald Trump\u2019s expected nomination for a second term, people familiar with the selection process said. Party officials are also discussing the selection of a convention chairman, with\u00a0David Bossie\u00a0and\u00a0Ronald Kaufman\u00a0among the top choices, according to people familiar with those talks. That decision rests with Republican National Committee Chairwoman\u00a0Ronna Romney McDaniel. Mr. Bossie was deputy campaign manager for Mr. Trump in 2016, and Mr. Kaufman is the party\u2019s national committeeman from Massachusetts. The two longtime Republican activists didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment on their potential selection.\u201d Pence heads to the Midwest to help House candidates -\u00a0Politico:\u00a0\u201cVice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0begins a campaign swing through the Midwest on Wednesday designed to fire up the base in three battleground House districts. But there\u2019s also a secondary mission: damage control. In the face of a trade war that intensified just four days ago, Pence is quietly setting up one-on-one meetings with major Midwestern donors where he is prepared to blunt concerns over an escalating situation that\u2019s beginning to wreak havoc on markets, farmers and employers across the region. \u2026 The vice-president\u2019s trip \u2014 announced Monday, just days after the United States leveled a 25 percent tariff on $34 billion of Chinese goods and China enacted equivalent retaliatory tariffs \u2014 will take him to Kansas City, Cedar Rapids and Chicago, where he\u2019ll meet privately with big donors and attend fundraisers for three embattled Republican House incumbents. Pence is also planning public events with America First Policies, a group that is advocating for the Trump tax cuts.\u201d W. Va.\u2019s Richard Ojeda continues to rise -\u00a0Roll Call:\u00a0\u201cRichard Ojeda\u00a0has become one of the stars of the 2018 midterms. First, the national media latched on to this Trump-voting Democrat, and now the national party is behind him too. A recent independent poll found him ahead here in southern West Virginia\u2019s coal-mining 3rd District that President Donald Trump carried by nearly 50 points in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. \u2026 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently added Ojeda to its Red to Blue program, which should boost his fundraising.

Carol Miller Likely Republican.\u201d TRADE WAR HEATING UP\u00a0Fox Business:\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. is pursuing a new set of tariffs that would hit $200 billion in Chinese goods, according to senior administration officials. In a list published late Tuesday, the U.S. Trade Representative said the 10% tariffs would target a variety of products imported from China, including clothing, baseball gloves, bicycles, refrigerators and seafood. The additional U.S. tariffs, which will go through a two-month approval process including a public hearing, come after China retaliated in a tit-for-tat trade skirmish last week. The U.S. imposed an initial round of 25% tariffs, applying to $34 billion in imports, as part of a $50 billion tariff plan. China responded with levies of its own, targeting $34 billion in U.S. products such as pork and whiskey. \u2018As a result of China\u2019s retaliation and failure to change its practices, the president has ordered USTR to begin the process of imposing tariffs of 10 percent on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports,\u2019 U.S. Trade Representative\u00a0Robert Lighthizer\u00a0said in a statement.\u201dBrady calls on Trump to meet with Xi over trade war - Bloomberg: \u201cRepresentative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who heads the powerful Ways and Means Committee, called on Trump to meet Chinese counterpart\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0and hash out an agreement to settle their trade differences. Brady warned that further escalation, such as the administration\u2019s latest move to levy tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, risked a multiyear fight that \u2018that engulfs more and more of the globe.\u2019 \u2018Despite the serious economic consequences of ever-increasing tariffs, today there are no serious trade discussions occurring between the U.S. and China, no plans for trade negotiations anytime soon, and seemingly little action toward a solution,\u2019 Brady said in a statement late Tuesday.\u201d PLAY-BY-PLAYKavanaugh meets with GOP leaders as swing-vote senators, under pressure\u00a0-\u00a0Fox NewsLisa Page\u00a0will not appear for Capitol Hill interview despite subpoena, attorney says\u00a0-\u00a0Fox News Deadlines pile up on administration for separated kids -\u00a0Bloomberg Senate Republicans are in no rush to replace Pruitt\u00a0-\u00a0Politico AUDIBLE: AARON BURR, SIR \u201cRichard took one step back, and said, \u2018Angus, I don't know if you want to quote \u2018Hamilton\u2019 to me since my great, great grandfather shot him.\u2019\u201d \u2013\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Angus King, I-Maine,\u00a0re-telling a story\u00a0in which he quoted \u201cHamilton\u201d the musical to Sen.\u00a0Richard Burr, R-N.C.

IMAGINE HIS INBOX!Telegraph:\u00a0\u201cA civil servant in the Spanish province of Valencia has been handed a nine-year ban from public posts after it emerged he had been absent from his \u20ac50,000-a-year job for more than a decade.

            "article_content": "Col. John Teichert, Commander, 412th Test Wing and Edwards Air Force Base. (Joint Base Andrews) Several months ago I was delivering a speech to a group of patriots in our nation\u2019s capital when I suddenly became ill and collapsed. The following day, as I was recovering in the cardiac wing of a nearby hospital, I received a visitor \u2013 Col. John Teichert, then the commander at Joint Base Andrews. I was a bit puzzled and surprised to see someone of Col. Teichert\u2019s stature standing in my hospital room \u2013 seeing how I did not know the man. It turned out a mutual friend, a pastor in California, had summoned the colonel to my bedside. And for a little while he prayed for me and shared his testimony along with several encouraging passages from the Bible. I was particularly moved by the colonel\u2019s kindness and his compassion \u2013 a brother in the Lord who took time out of his very busy schedule to pray at the bedside of a stranger. So you can imagine my surprise when I received a news release from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation calling for the arrest of now Brig. Gen. Teichert \u2013 the new wing commander at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is an organization that trolls military bases in search of any public display of the Christian faith. The group is typically triggered by Nativity scenes and Bibles placed on Missing Man tables. Foundation founder Mikey Weinstein was especially angered to learn that Teichert owns a website called \u201cPrayer at Lunchtime for the United States.\u201d The website encourages \u201cBible-believing Americans to take time to specifically pray for our nation at lunchtime every day.\u201d It also features a prayer list \u2013 including among others President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Congress and the military. Weinstein demanded that Defense Secretary James Mattis launch an immediate investigation \u2013 calling Teichert a \u201cfundamentalist Christian tyrant and religious extremist predator.\u201d The Military Religious Freedom Foundation claims to represent 41 people at Edwards Air Force Base who are allegedly offended by the general\u2019s personal website. \u201cBrigadier General Tiechert\u2019s disgraceful, illegal and brazen promotion of his personal flavor of his weaponized version of Christianity represents one of the worst and most egregious cases MRFF has ever encountered in its 13 years of First Amendment civil rights advocacy,\u201d Weinstein said in a prepared statement. Weinstein went on to allege the general\u2019s website violates the Uniform Code of Military Justice and demanded that Teichert be investigated, prosecuted, convicted and punished. \u201cGeneral Teichert should be doing time behind prison bars, not commanding a Wing wearing a General\u2019s stars,\u201d Weinstein said. The Pentagon has not responded to my inquiries about Weinstein\u2019s complaint, but the allegations are so outlandish they deserve no response. \u201cThe Air Force appears to be doing exactly what it should upon receiving a complaint from Mikey Weinstein: ignoring him,\u201d First Liberty Institute attorney Mike Berry told me. \u201cLike\u00a0so many complaints by the MRFF, this\u00a0complaint is vindictive, intolerant, and completely without merit.\u201d First Liberty Institute is one of the nation\u2019s most respected law firms handling religious liberty cases. It is not representing Teichert. \u201cBigoted demands that an officer be thrown in military prison because he prays for others should be rejected out of hand,\u201d First Liberty Institute\u2019s Berry said. During the Obama administration, Weinstein once bragged about having a hot line to the Pentagon. It\u2019s beyond time for the Trump administration to disconnect the number. It\u2019s time to put a stop to these vile and hateful attacks on Christian members of our military. Demanding that a general be imprisoned because he prays? Calling him an extremist predator? Outrageous! It seems to me the only fundamentalist, extremist predator in this case is the Military Religious Freedom Foundation.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senator John McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, in 2017. In a statement, the McCain family says the senator has chosen to discontinue medical treatment. The family of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says the senator is suspending treatment for his brain cancer. But it\u2019s notable the statement came from the family and not the senator. McCain last voted on the Senate floor on an interim government funding bill\u00a0on December 7\u00a0last year. He hasn\u2019t visited the Capitol since. That said, McCain has exercised significant influence from afar amid his convalescence. I have tracked McCain\u2019s statements for months. I would take notice if I hadn\u2019t seen a statement from McCain for a while. But then a statement would pop into the in-box. The statements didn\u2019t quote McCain\u2019s press team. They\u2019re directly from McCain himself, revealing engagement from afar. McCain\u2019s office pushed out statements of late on the Senate\u2019s passage of the defense authorization bill, named after the senator himself. On July 13, McCain weighed in on the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment is a result of the hard work of America\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence officials who dedicate their lives to bringing to justice those who wish to do us harm. These revelations add to a body of evidence confirming an extensive plot by Vladimir Putin\u2019s government to attack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissention among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy,\u201d said McCain. On July 12, McCain applauded the House\u2019s passage of a bill to implement a water settlement with Arizona\u2019s White Mountain Apache Tribe. \u201cThe federal government owes it to the White Mountain Apache Tribe to follow through on the commitment it made seven years ago to build the Miner Flat Dam,\u201d said McCain in a statement. \u201cThis legislation would resolve the tribe\u2019s claims to the Salt River in Arizona and pave the way for the completion of the Miner Flat Dam and Reservoir, which are key to protecting the Tribe\u2019s at-risk water supply.\u201d McCain joined Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on August 2 to write Romanian Prime Minister Dancila about the firing of the Chief Prosecutor of Romania\u2019s anti-corruption agency. \u201cWe urge the Romanian government not to retreat in the important fight against corruption,\u201d wrote the senators. On August 13, President Trump signed the John. S. McCain Defense Authorization Act into law. In a statement, the senator said he was \u201chumbled that my colleagues\u201d would name the annual defense bill after him. McCain also said the legislation would \u201chelp deliver our service members the resources they need to rise to the challenges of a dangerous world.\u201d And then nothing from McCain until today\u2019s statement from his family. Conversations about about McCain\u2019s future, health and even the process for a potential successor have been taboo around the Capitol for some time now. Senators who had even visited with McCain were circumspect in their remarks about their colleague. If anything was said, it was done in hushed tones and so far off the record. That\u2019s because everyone on Capitol Hill - ranging from senators to aides to reporters and Senate staff - suspected they\u2019d see a statement like this at some point from McCain\u2019s office. And as much as no one wanted to admit it, they knew it was just a matter of when. There was a point when some senators, perhaps wishfully, thought McCain may return to the Capitol and even vote. But that was never in the offing. In May, McCain published a statement announcing his opposition to the nomination of CIA Director Gina Haspel. A former prisoner of war, McCain often spoke about the government\u2019s use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d After all, no one would say that McCain was subjected to \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d in Vietnam. McCain was tortured. McCain harbored reservations about Haspel\u2019s role at the CIA when it came to prisoners of war or \u201cenemy combatants.\u201d \u201cI believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense,\u201d wrote McCain. \u201cHowever, Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture\u2019s immorality is disqualifying. I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.\u201d At no point did McCain suggest he would vote on Haspel nor declare he would \u201cvote no.\u201d The Arizona Republican simply stated what he thought his colleagues should do about Haspel. A similar scenario played out in July when President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Most senators put out boiler plate statements about \u201cmeeting the nominee\u201d or making up their mind after an in-person chat. McCain\u2019s statement didn\u2019t hint at any of that. \u201cI look forward to the Senate fulfilling this critical duty through a fair and thorough confirmation process,\u201d said McCain. What\u2019s also interesting is how much sway McCain continued to have on Capitol Hill in absentia. Reporters squawked when President Trump signed the defense bill and never mentioned McCain. Or, there were various occasions when the President appeared at a campaign rally and mocked the senator \u2013 also not invoking McCain. Still, McCain\u2019s absence cast a long shadow through the Senate corridors. Senators listened to him this spring when he expressed concerns about Haspel. \u201cHis opinion carries a lot of weight with a lot of people, me included,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in May. McCain\u2019s absence also amplified the narrow Senate Republican majority. With McCain, the GOP holds a tenuous 51-49 Senate advantage. The difference is but a single vote. This is why the Republican leadership sometimes sweated big votes. It magnified the votes of maverick Republicans who sometimes buck the party: Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rand Paul, R-Ky. No event augmented the Republican\u2019s narrow majority more than the abortive effort last summer to repeal and replace Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made a dramatic,\u00a0Saturday nightdecision to postpone consideration of the keystone GOP issue once it became apparent McCain couldn\u2019t make it to the Senate to vote. McConnell would need McCain\u2019s vote to to approve a motion to launch the debate. In addition, McCain\u2019s vote was critical to passing the legislation. McCain returned to Washington some days later and voted to initiate debate on the Republican repeal and replace gambit. And then, finding the bill not to his liking, McCain torched the GOP efforts. Even frank and reliable Republican sources are resistant to comment about what\u2019s next. But Arizona law works like this: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) would appoint another Republican until a special election is called in 2020. Arizona law requires the appointee \u201cbe of the same political party as the person vacating the office.\u201d Arizona voters re-elected McCain to the Senate in 2016. The winner of the 2020 special election would serve until 2022, the balance of McCain\u2019s unexpired term. Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

(AP) An organization run by left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer launched a new Facebook ad comparing President Trump to the most \u201cruthless\u201d and \u201csadistic\u201d dictators in history, including Iraq\u2019s former leader Saddam Hussein. \u201cNeed to Impeach,\u201d the organization run by Steyer which advocates for Trump's impeachment, posted the three-minute video ad on Facebook last week. The ad, first reported by The Daily Caller, features clips of some of the world\u2019s most notorious leaders, living and dead\u2014including Hussein, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez\u00a0and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. \u201cDictators have managed to come to power in every part of the world, and many of them rise out of Democracy,\u201d the narrator says, though North Korea, for instance, is not such an example. \u201cThey are malignant narcissists\u2014which means they\u2019re not just self-centered, but their behavior is most often anti-social, volatile, ruthless, paranoid, and most disturbingly, sadistic.\u201d The narrator is accompanied by moody music\u00a0and news clips of reporters covering the despots. \u201cThese leaders all share certain qualities and follow a certain pattern\u2014a \u00a0playbook\u2014which enables them to take over a democracy,\u201d the narrator says, explaining dictators \u201cfan the flames of nationalism,\u201d undermine the media, \u201cperpetuate a systemic misogyny to oppress women,\u201d and blame \u201cscapegoats\u201d for the country\u2019s problems.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on how liberal resentment toward the Trump administration is spreading to other institutions like the Senate and electoral college. Liberals who are unhappy with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh are starting to complain that the Senate itself is undemocratic. Liberals who are unhappy with Donald Trump as president are starting to complain that the way he was elected is undemocratic. While there's a fascinating political-science debate to be had on both points, it has the potential to smell like sour grapes from those on the losing side. I just don't think it's a winning argument to say that the problem is these institutions, and rules that have been in place for more than 225 years, rather than the failure to prevail in debates and win elections. The attack on the Senate stems from the 1787 compromise that is at the heart of the Constitution: House members are elected by population, which favors big states, and each state gets two Senate seats, which gives a disproportionate advantage to small states. Without that, the founders never could have rounded up enough votes. But now the formula is highly objectionable. NBC reporter Ken Dilanian tweeted, \"It may not happen in our lifetimes, but the idea that North Dakota and New York get the same representation in the Senate has to change.\" He cited a Washington Post piece complaining that senators representing less than half the country were about to confirm a Supreme Court nominee opposed by most Americans. While we're at it, why don't we just have all public issues settled by polls? It can seem unbalanced on its face for states with small populations (North Dakota has 755,000 people) to have equal weight in the Senate. But look at the flip side: California has 53 House seats, and North Dakota has one. And the fear in small states of being overrun is the same as in the late 18th century, when slavery divided North and South. These days, as The Federalist notes, the formulation doesn\u2019t always favor the GOP: \"If you weren't born yesterday, you might recall that as recently as 2011, the Democrats controlled the White House, 59 percent of the House, and a filibuster-proof\u00a060 percent\u00a0of the Senate. Under the same laws, the same Constitution, and with an almost identical electorate, the Democrats controlled the political branches of government with huge majorities. How did they lose it all? Because the people did not like what they did with that power once they had it ... \"The focus on small states as Republican strongholds does not survive even the gentlest scrutiny. The senators from the ten smallest states are nine Democrats, nine Republicans, and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. That\u2019s an 11-9 split in Democrats' favor.\" A similar argument surfaces with the renewed assault on the Electoral College. And it's not hard to figure out why: Both Trump and George W. Bush, the last two Republican presidents, lost the popular vote while winning the White House. Suddenly we have criticism like that of Damon Linker in The Week: \"The Electoral College is an abomination. It's long past time we abolished it. \"The Electoral College was a dumb idea when it was first proposed. Today, it's the Constitution's most egregious affront to elementary fairness. In a just and properly functioning political system, it would be eliminated without delay or regret.\" And Julia Ioffe, a GQ correspondent, tweeted: \"We are a country where two presidents who both lost the popular vote have now placed four justices on the Supreme Court. Democracy in action.\" That spurred Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist Democrat running for a House seat in New York, to declare: \"It is well past time we eliminate the Electoral College, a shadow of slavery\u2019s power on America today that undermines our nation as a democratic republic.\" I've never been a huge fan of the college. It's never worked the way Alexander Hamilton intended, with the electors a bunch of smart elitists who would make the final choice for president. But the system does accomplish two things. It prods the nominees to campaign in smaller states, rather than just running up the turnout in New York, California, Texas and other population centers. And it amplifies the winning candidate's margin and avoids the nightmare of a national recount in tight races. All that is debatable: If proponents can push a constitutional amendment through Congress and win over three-quarters of the states, be my guest. The Electoral College didn't stop Barack Obama or Bill Clinton from twice capturing the White House. Rather than railing at the Constitution, liberals would do better to figure out how to win again under the longstanding rules.\u200b",

Congress is heading toward a post-election showdown over President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, as GOP leaders signal they\u2019re willing to engage in hardball tactics that could spark a partial government shutdown and the president revs up midterm crowds for the wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and a top White House priority. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON \u2013 Congress is heading toward a postelection showdown over President Donald Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as GOP leaders signal they're willing to engage in hardball tactics that could spark a partial government shutdown and the president revs up midterm crowds for the wall, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign and a top White House priority. Trump is promising voters at rallies across the country that Republicans will bring tougher border security in campaign speeches that echo those that propelled him to office two years ago. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., promised a \"big fight\" over the border wall money and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not ruled out a mini-shutdown as GOP leaders look to help Trump \"get what he's looking for\" on the wall. \"Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country,\" Trump said without evidence Wednesday during a swing through Erie, Pa. \"Right after the election we're doing something very strong on the wall,\" Trump added Thursday in an interview on \"Fox & Friends.\" Republicans steered clear of shutdown politics ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm election. They know voters have soured on government dysfunction, hold low views of Congress and are unlikely to reward Republicans \u2014 as the party in control of Congress and the White House \u2014 if post offices, national parks and other services are shuttered. GOP leaders struck a deal with Democrats earlier this year to fund most of the government into next year. They presented their case to Trump in a White House meeting in September \u2014 complete with photos of the border wall under construction. Trump, who previously warned he would not sign another big budget bill into law without his border funds, quietly signed the legislation before the start of the new budget year Oct. 1. Left undone, however, is the portion of the government that funds the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the border, and a few other agencies. They're now running on stopgap funds set to expire Dec. 7. The deadline sets the stage for a new round of budget brawls. \"We intend on having a full-fledged discussion about how to complete this mission of securing our border and we will have a big fight about it,\" Ryan said in a speech at the National Press Club. Asked if he made a commitment to Trump for a shutdown over wall funds, Ryan said blame would fall to Democrats, who are in the minority in Congress and largely oppose increased funding for the wall. Trump promised during the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall \u2014 a claim Mexico rejects and Republicans routinely ignore. \"We have a commitment to go fight for securing the border and getting these policy objectives achieved,\" Ryan said. House Republicans approved $5 billion for Trump's wall, including physical barriers and technology along the U.S. southern border, in a key committee, although it comes without Democratic support. A bipartisan bill being considered in the Senate allocates $1.6 billion for the wall, far short of the $5 billion the White House is seeking as part of a $25 billion, five-year plan to complete the project. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., upped the stakes Friday by introducing legislation for the full $25 billion in border funds as he bids for Ryan's job as the speaker retires. McCarthy's toured the southern border this week to make the case for the wall as he seeks to shore up support from conservatives skeptical of his possible leadership promotion. McConnell predicted a \"lively\" lame-duck session and didn't close the door on the possibility of a mini-shutdown. \"We've got a lot of work left to do,\" he said in an AP Newsmakers interview. \"That episode, if it occurs, would be in that portion of the government that we haven't funded.\" Asked how much money Congress would try to secure for the border wall, McConnell said, \"We're going to try to help (Trump) get what he's looking for.\" The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said Senate Republicans are willing to fight for more than the $1.6 billion currently being considered, but stopped short of predicting how much money Congress would approve. \"I think it's going to be a big fight . always because of the different views,\" Shelby said. The midterm results will play a key role in how the fight over wall funding is resolved. If Republicans lose the House majority, as some analysts predict, they will lose leverage, although the GOP would still be able to force House passage of a wall-funding package in the lame-duck session. Prospects are murkier in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to break a filibuster. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said \"Democrats believe in strong border security,\" but would not commit to a specific spending figure. \"We're going to keep fighting for the strongest, toughest border security,\" he said. ___ Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/lisamascaro and https://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC",

President Donald Trump on Tuesday celebrated primary results, calling it a \u201cbig night\u201d as his favored Republican candidates carried the day, while a socialist dethroned a heavyweight Democrat. \u201cThe Democrats are in Turmoil!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cOpen Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!\u201d Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won the primary runoff in the race to take the place of retiring Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. He beat state Rep. Mike Kennedy, who put up a fight during the first round of the primary, blocking Romney\u2019s attempt to secure to the majority of the vote. Romney will now face Democrat Jenny Wilson, a city councilwoman. Trump, who had on-and-off relationship with Romney since the beginning his presidential campaign bid, celebrated Romney\u2019s victory, tweeting: \u201cBig and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.\u201d In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster was projected the winner of Tuesday\u2019s Republican gubernatorial runoff election. Trump was heavily invested in the race, offering full support and even campaigning on McMaster\u2019s behalf in recent days. Rep. Dan Donovan of New York, another Trump-backed candidate, also cruised to primary victory, defeating Michael Grimm, whose candidacy was seen as controversial over his conviction for tax fraud. On the Democrats\u2019 side, Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., was dethroned after suffering a shock defeat against 28-year-old political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowley, a 10-term Democratic lawmaker, whose name was floated as a potential future Speaker of the House, was bested by Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on the platform of abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), universal health care and assaults weapons. Left-wing groups also celebrated the political newcomer\u2019s shock win, seeing it as a slap in the face to the establishment that isn\u2019t progressive enough. Soon after the race was called, the New York City branch of the Democratic Socialists of America issued a tweet saying her victory showed \u201cthat working class people are hungry for a voice in politics.\" In a statement, Crowley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez on her victory and said he looked forward to supporting her against Republican Anthony Pappas in November. \"The Trump administration is a threat to everything we stand for here in Queens and the Bronx, and if we don't win back the House this November, we will lose the nation we love,\" Crowley said. \"This is why we must come together. We will only be able to stop Donald Trump and the Republican Congress by working together, as a united Democratic Party.\" Fox News\u2019 Gregg Re, Samuel Chamberlain, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Credit: REUTERS/Charles Platiau) Microsoft recently stopped an effort to hack three US candidates up for election this year. The attack relied on a spoofed Microsoft domain to target the candidates' campaign, company vice president Tom Burt said during a panel session at the Aspen Security Forum on Thursday. \"Earlier this year we did discover that a fake Microsoft domain had been established as the landing page for phishing attacks,\" he said. \"We saw metadata that suggested those phishing attacks were being directed at three candidates.\" Burt didn't go into details, but phishing attacks usually involve hackers sending an email to the recipients, with the goal of tricking them into visiting a webpage designed to secretly install malware or fool someone into giving up their passwords. Fortunately, in this case, Microsoft seized the domain before the attack could infect any computer. Although Burt declined to name the candidates targeted, he said: \"They were all people, because of their positions, might have been interesting targets from an espionage standpoint as well as an election disruption standpoint.\" Burt raised the issue when talking about Microsoft's efforts to stop Russian state-sponsored election meddling. During the 2016 presidential election, the company's security teams noticed what many believe to be a Russian hacking group target Democrats using spoofed Microsoft domain names, Burt said. Microsoft's reveal comes as US officials warn that Russian actors will try to interfere with the 2018 mid-term elections and the country's critical infrastructure. So far, Burt said Russian efforts to meddle with the 2018 mid-terms, haven't matched the level of activity the company saw during the 2016 election, which involved attacks on think tanks and academia and using social networking services to research potential targets. \"It doesn't mean weren't not going to see it,\" he added. \"There's a lot of time left until the election.\" This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.",

(AP Photo/Oliver de Ros) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet? Click here. Developing now, Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - TRUMP PROMISES TO STOP CARAVAN AT THE BORDER - In an interview aboard Air Force One on Monday, President Trump made clear there was no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to address the growing migrant caravan quickly making its way through hot and humid temperatures in Mexico to the U.S. border ... The president previously vowed to send the U.S. military, as opposed to the National Guard, to confront the group, which the United Nations now estimates is over 7,200 members strong. Trump told USA Today in an interview that \"people from the Middle East\u201d are among the thousands of migrants in the caravan, echoing remarks he made on Twitter Monday morning, when he complained there were MS-13 gang \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners mixed in.\" The president did not elaborate. Asked how many troops he was willing to send, Trump told the paper simply, \u201cas many as necessary.\" Speaking to reporters outside the White House earlier Monday, Trump slammed several Central American countries that he charged were \"doing nothing\" about the caravan and threatened to cut U.S. aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. FROM 'LYIN' TED' TO 'TEXAS TED': President Trump on Monday night voiced his support for one-time rival Sen. Ted Cruz in his re-election, calling the Texas Republican \"a really good friend of mine\" ... Speaking at a \"Make America Great Again\" rally at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, the president said while the pair's relationship has previously been rocky, he encouraged rallygoers to vote for the senator. \"Nobody has helped me more with your tax cuts, with your regulation, with all of the things that we're doing ... than Senator Ted Cruz,\" Trump said. Trump, meanwhile, called Cruz's opponent, Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke a \"stone cold phony\" who \"pretends to be a moderate, but he's actually a radical open-borders left-winger.\" \"The Democrats,\" Trump said, \"have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country.\" SOROS TARGETED? - An explosive device was found on Monday at the Westchester, N.Y., home of billionaire George Soros ... The Wall Street Journal, citing local law enforcement, reported that police received a phone call from the residence about a suspicious package. An employee that works at the home found the package in a mailbox and opened it, revealing what appeared to be an explosive device, according to the Bedford Police Department. The employee then placed the package in a wooded area until authorities arrived. Soros was not home at the time of the incident, according to the New York Times. The bomb squad deactivated the device, and the investigation has been turned over to the Joint Terrorism Task Force Division of the FBI. Soros, 88, has donated at least $18 million to his charity, the Open Society Foundations, which works to promote democracies in countries around the world, according to the organization\u2019s website. Known for his philanthropy and political influence, has focused his efforts as of late on the midterm elections in the U.S., and has funneled upwards of $15 million to Democrats as they push to regain control of Congress. FOR DEMS, MIDTERMS ARE A WAY TO REVIVE RUSSIA PROBE: Democrats are expected to re-open the investigation into alleged collusion between Russian officials and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign if they regain the House of Representatives majority in next month's midterm elections ... The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was the only House panel to investigate Russian meddling. This past April, the committee's Republicans said they found \u201cno evidence\u201d of collusion between the Russian government and Trump campaign. Democrats said Republicans ignored key facts and important witnesses. However, while some on the left wing have said they wanted to restart parts of the investigation if they win the House, others said there could be a political cost if they overreach. Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other lawmakers have said they're closely watching special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and the Senate's Russia probe to look for gaps that they could fill. WHERE IS JAYME CLOSS? - Two \"vehicles of interest\" were announced on Monday in the search for Jayme Closs, the Wisconsin teenager who went missing Oct. 15, the day her parents were found shot to death in their home ... \u00a0Surveillance footage helped the Barron County Sheriff's Office and the FBI determine the makes and models of two cars \"seen in the area\" of the Closs home at the time of the fatal shootings. Investigators believe a red or orange Dodge Challenger made between the years 2008 and 2014 might be linked to the incident. Another vehicle \u2014 either a Black Ford Edge, made between 2006 and 2010, or a Black Acura MDX made between 2004 to 2010 \u2014 is also of interest. Investigators believe 13-year-old Closs is still in danger. The search for Closs was to expand Tuesday with as many as 2,000 volunteers expected to comb the Barron, Wis. area.

While the conservative version was expected to fail, House leaders were hoping the separate compromise measure might have a chance. But tensions are running high over the debate on family separations at the border. President Trump's sudden executive action over the border crisis stemmed some of the urgency for Congress to act. But House GOP leaders still were pulling out the stops to bring reluctant Republicans on board in hopes of resolving broader immigration issues ahead of the November midterm election. That vote is now set for Friday. Passage of the bill was always a long shot, but failure may now come at a steeper price as Republicans -- and Trump -- have raised expectations that, as the party in control of Congress and the White House, they can fix the nation's long-standing immigration problems. \u2018This is a bill that has consensus. This is a bill that the president supports. It's a bill that could become law,\u2019 said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\u201d Ryan ruptures with Freedom Caucus -\u00a0WaPo:\u00a0\u201cA House immigration bill meticulously negotiated by Republicans appeared to be on the brink of failure ahead of a planned Thursday vote after House Speaker\u00a0Paul D. Ryan\u00a0(R-Wis.) and a top conservative leader engaged in an unusually heated floor confrontation Wednesday. Rep.\u00a0Mark Meadows\u00a0(R-N.C.) argued with Ryan in plain view of lawmakers, aides and reporters during a Wednesday afternoon vote \u2014 a dispute that Meadows later confirmed surrounded the immigration votes scheduled for Thursday. The typically mild-mannered Meadows could be seen repeating \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter\u2019 as Ryan spoke to him, and he walked away from Ryan at one point only to return and continue arguing. Speaking to reporters afterward, Meadows accused Ryan and other House leaders of a bait-and-switch \u2014 agreeing to a deal on what would be contained in the compromise legislation only to leave key provisions out of the final text.\u201d Trump continued to blame Democrats during cabinet meeting - CBS News: \u201cPresident Trump continued to blame Democrats for not wanting to solve the nation's outstanding immigration problems, in light of his executive order changing the policy on separating children from immigrant families who cross the southern border illegally. \u2026 He added that Democrats are responsible for a \u2018massive child-smuggling industry\u2019 and are not providing enough resources to combat the issue of housing migrant children. \u2026 Meanwhile, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney announced during the meeting that the administration would be spearheading a massive reorganization of the federal government. Mulvaney said the move fulfills the president's promise to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 in Washington. \u2018It's been almost 100 years since anybody has reorganized the government on this scale,\u2019 Mulvaney said.\u00a0 He used food metaphors to slam the \u2018byzantine\u2019 nature of the way the government currently regulates, calling the process \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018makes no sense.\u2019 Melania visits child detention center in Texas\u00a0-\u00a0Fox\u00a0News: \u201cFirst lady Melania Trump on Thursday visited a child detention center in Texas that houses minors who entered the country illegally -- in the wake of her husband\u2019s executive order that ended the practice of separating families. Mrs. Trump visited the Upbring New Hope Children\u2019s Center, after she was reported to have been a force in getting the president to act in the wake of a days-long controversy surrounding the effects of the Department of Justice\u2019s \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy. The first lady said earlier through her spokeswoman that she \u2018hates\u2019 to see families separated at the border. \u2018We all know they are here without their families and I want to thank you for your hard work, compassion and kindness you are giving them in these difficult times,\u2019 Mrs. Trump told a roundtable of workers at the Texas center.\u201d THE RULEBOOK: AND SEE HOW THAT TURNED OUT\u00a0\u201cThe Congress which conducted us through the Revolution was a less numerous body than their successors will be; they were not chosen by, nor responsible to, their fellow citizens at large; though appointed from year to year, and recallable at pleasure, they were generally continued for three years, and prior to the ratification of the federal articles, for a still longer term.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u00a0or\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 55 TIME OUT: BEYOND THE PAGE\u00a0Atlantic:\u00a0\u201cWhy do some books make us want to know an author personally, identifying so thoroughly with the public work that we try to lay claim to the private self?

As the majority of states gear up for 2018 general-election battles, the RNC yet again showed strong fundraising totals, hauling in another $14 million in May for a total of $187.7 million for the cycle, according to new Federal Election Commission records filed Wednesday night. The RNC had $47.4 million in cash on hand, records show. The Democratic National Committee raised $5.6 million in May for a total of $97.8 million for the cycle.

It took eight days for the winner to be declared by Secretary of State\u00a0Matt Dunlap\u2019s office after the voting method approved by Maine voters in 2016 was used in a statewide election for the first time in U.S. history in four different races. While Republicans picked businessman Shawn Moody\u00a0for governor in a landslide on Election Day, Democrats had to wait for Mills of Farmington to be declared the winner over Cote of Sanford, lobbyist Betsy Sweet\u00a0of Hallowell, former House Speaker\u00a0Mark Eves\u00a0of North Berwick and three others.\u201d Dems divided over who should face Walker -\u00a0Marquette University:\u00a0\u201cA new Marquette Law School Poll finds one in three Wisconsin voters remains undecided on August primary candidates in each party.

The procedural vote to tee up President Donald Trump\u2019s $15 billion cutbacks package for floor consideration failed 48-50 Wednesday afternoon. Sen.\u00a0Susan Collins\u00a0(R-Maine), who opposed the procedural vote, had made clear for weeks that she had objections to the package. But the surprise GOP defection came from Sen.\u00a0Richard Burr\u00a0(R-N.C.), who had been fighting behind the scenes on the land and water conservation cuts in the rescissions package. Burr ultimately broke with the GOP because he wasn\u2019t guaranteed a vote on his amendment to protect that funding, according to a Senate GOP aide. Senate GOP leaders have until Friday to pass the so-called rescissions measure with a simple majority, before their special procedural powers expire and a 60-vote threshold sets in. So the failed vote could be the Senate\u2019s first and only shot at advancing the White House\u2019s much-heralded, deficit-reduction bill.\u201d THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: FIRST DUTIESThis week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0asks whether the FBI can be independent: \u201cOn the one hand, the FBI is an investigative entity only. It does not decide whom or what to charge; it merely reports its findings to federal prosecutors in conjunction with their presentation of evidence to grand juries. As such, the FBI is subject to the DOJ prosecutors for whom it works, and the DOJ, of course, works for the president. On the other hand, because both the DOJ and the FBI are guided by the ethical rules that govern lawyers and by the values of the rule of law implicit in American culture and recognized by the courts, the DOJ enjoys some independence from the president, and the FBI enjoys some independence from the DOJ. Principles such as equal protection under the law and due process of law protect life, liberty and property and trump instructions of the president to the DOJ and instructions of the DOJ to the FBI.\u201d More\u00a0here.

It started as a whisper, then it became louder until now Term Limits is \u2018screaming\u2019 to be \u2018forced\u2019 onto the agenda. Too often we have watched a \u2018Statesman\u2019, once elected, morph into just another self-serving politician.

There are certainly some things, like undoing the direct election of senators and restoring regular order in the House, that I think would be worth doing first, but I am sympathetic to the idea of limits, to say the least. I think it would also be helpful if we started judging people on their ideas and their records rather than arbitrarily abjuring those with experience.

But I am afraid that you may have been misinformed. The complaint of the current administration is that low-cost good from other countries where things are cheaper to make harms American manufacturing. We may be at full employment, but the current administration wants to reshape the kinds of jobs in which Americans work to return to a mid-20th\u00a0century manufacturing model. To serve that goal, they are going to make goods from other countries more expensive so American producers get an advantage. This will mean higher costs for consumers, but proponents say it is the price of planning an economy in the model they seek. The larger risk, though, is that other countries will do the same in retaliation and shut off markets for American goods, particularly agricultural products and high-end finished goods like aircraft. We don\u2019t know how the president\u2019s game of chicken is going to play out, but the point here isn\u2019t about helping Americans sell more overseas, it\u2019s about remaking the domestic economy.]\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love the quotes from Charles Krauthammer you are using.\u00a0 I\u2019ve missed his wisdom and wit since he became ill.\u00a0 His book is a jewel to read.\u201d \u2013\u00a0David Zlotnick, Santa Fe, N.M.[Ed. note: It truly, truly is.

            "article_content": "Tropical storm Michael may intensify into a hurricane by the time it makes landfall in Florida. In response to mother nature\u2019s October surprise, candidates in Florida\u2019s multiple contentious statewide elections have paused their campaigns due to the approaching hurricane \u2013 just weeks before the midterm elections. By Monday, Hurricane Michael was a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of about 75 mph.\u00a0Hurricane weather advisories have been issued from the Suwannee River to the Alabama-Florida border as the storm continues on its trek through the Gulf of Mexico. Gov. Rick Scott has issued a state of emergency for 26 counties to rush preparations in the Panhandle and Big Bend areas, freeing up resources and activating some 500 members of the Florida National Guard. \u201cThis storm will be life-threatening and extremely dangerous,\u201d Scott said Sunday, warning of the potentially perilous storm surges the storm could bring. A Republican, Scott is running for U.S. Senate after his reign as Florida\u2019s governor will come to an end due to term limits. He has reportedly suspended his campaign ahead of the storm. FLORIDA SENATE RACE BETWEEN SCOTT, NELSON EXPECTED TO BE COMPETITIVE, COSTLY Scott, who has made\u00a0handling of past storms a theme in one of his more recent campaign ads, is facing incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, in the November election. Nelson reportedly has plans to meet with emergency response officials before Michael hits. Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum said he\u2019s returning to his home city in the Panhandle to prepare for the storm. His campaign said events planned later this week in South Florida are canceled. \u201cEveryone please stay safe, stay informed and be prepared for these changing weather conditions,\u201d Gillum wrote on Twitter. FLORIDA GOVERNOR RACE HEATS UP WITH TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, FBI PROBE: A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES During a press briefing on the storm, Scott was asked about working with Gillum ahead of the storm. The governor said his \u201cjob is to work with everyone\u201d across his state, and he acknowledged that he\u2019s reached out to several mayors and sheriffs already. Gillum and Scott notoriously traded jabs regarding relief efforts after Hurricane Hermine hit Florida in 2016 over whether city officials were doing enough to get electricity restored in the heavily tree-lined city. Republicans have aired ads that fault Gillum, who has been Tallahassee\u2019s mayor since 2014, for the power outages after Hermine. While Gillum does not directly control the city-owned utility, he was forced to answer questions two years ago about why Tallahassee officials turned down help from at least one outside utility company at the time. His campaign has contended the ads paid for by the Florida Republican Party are false. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS GOP gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis praised Scott for his \u201ctremendous leadership\u201d ahead of the storm and said his family is \u201ckeeping those in its path in our thoughts and prayers.\u201d The former congressman also said he is \u201credirecting my Panhandle campaign staff and volunteers to help prepare their communities ahead of the storm.\u201d Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, who is up for re-election this year, blasted DeSantis on Twitter for not \u201csetting aside partisan differences regarding hurricanes and other emergencies\u201d ahead of Michael. He called on DeSantis to \u201cunite with the rest of Florida, take down his false attack ads, and help those facing down this coming storm.\u201d \u201cDuring Hurricane Season, Ron DeSantis instead chose the Donald Trump playbook, attacking his opponent with disregard for the truth, and weaponizing the struggle that everyday Floridians face when in the path of the storm,\u201d Crist, a former Republican governor of the state, said. \u201cWith Floridians now in the path of Tropical Storm Michael, it\u2019s time for all of us to come together, to support those who might be affected by the looming storm.\u201d Both the Florida gubernatorial and Senate races are ranked tossups by Fox News.

Troy Balderson ahead of a special House election next week, saying the Democratic opponent is controlled by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and favors open borders. Running against the Trump-backed candidate is Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor. Earlier Saturday, the president described O'Connor in a tweet as \u201ca puppet\u201d for Pelosi, \u201cweak on Crime, Borders & your 2nd Amendment,\u201d with a goal of raising taxes. Before welcoming Balderson onstage, Trump described him as \u201creally smart\u201d and \u201ca really hard worker\u201d who would \u201cfight for Ohio.\u201d Balderson promised to \u201cfight alongside\u201d the president on a variety of issues, and dubbed his opponent \u201cDishonest Danny O\u2019Connor.\u201d \u201cDishonest Danny O\u2019Connor wants to repeal those middle-class tax cuts.

Jordan, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, announced July 26 that he plans to mount an anti-establishment run for speaker, if Republicans keep control of the chamber. Echoing Balderson\u2019s comments, Trump told the crowd that a vote for O\u2019Connor \u201cis a vote for open borders, which equals massive crime.\u201d Before describing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cfantastic for this country,\u201d Trump said that abolishing the agency has become a goal for Democrats. \u201cA vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is a vote to let criminals and drugs pour into our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd to let MS-13 run wild in our communities.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 19, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: And welcome to \"Hannity\" on this busy, news breaking Friday night. We're on the road. We will be in Houston, Texas, Beaumont, Texas, tomorrow. We'll have more on that in a minute. As we speak tonight, a caravan of over 4,000 migrants from Central America, they are fast approaching America's southern border appeared all because the Democratic Party refuses to secure our borders, even after the president offered a great deal of what they wanted, a deal on Dreamers. Now, this is what the Democratic Party wants: open borders, eliminate ICE, and you, the American people, end up paying for the health care cost, educational cost, and criminal justice cost. We already paid billions and billions every single year. Now, just 18 short days, you, we, the people, you will have the power to once again shock the world. And at this hour, Nancy Pelosi, she is measuring the drapes, Chuck Schumer is dreaming of power, and the makeup of Congress, it weighs in the balance, and that includes the president's agenda. And as per usual, Democrats, they are using identity politics to gin up emotions, distract you, the voters, come of the successes in the last two years. So, coming up tonight, we're going to show you all the latest examples of far left's radical incivility, including one prominent Trump hater calling for a military coup. Not making that up. Plus, we have an important update on so many key races across America. So, sit tight, buckle up, it's time for our Friday night, breaking news, midterm edition of our opening monologue. (MUSIC) HANNITY: All right. It is time to wake up, America. We start tonight with a crisis at our southern border. Thousands of Central American migrants, as we speak, are marching, straight to our border. Now, tonight, according to reports, the U.S. and Mexico have reached an important agreement to intercept these migrants at Mexico's southern border with Central America. If any migrant evades this process, makes it into the United States, Mexico has allegedly agreed to allow those persons to be returned to Mexico. Now, still tonight, the president has promised to use the military if necessary, and has told Mexico and Central America, and these countries, that they will be a price to pay if the caravan makes its way to our border. And, of course, we are dealing with all of this tonight as a direct result of one thing. The Democratic Party, Democratic politicians, they have all been saying they want sanctuary cities. California, a singular state. They want open borders, politically, they think this benefits them. They have steadfastly refused to fully fund the border wall, and Democratic politicians all across the country defy the will of you, we the people, and they refuse to enforce our laws. This is a big issue as it relates to our midterm elections in just 18 days. Instead, what they have been doing is aiding and abetting criminal illegal immigrants, in some cases, with their sanctuary city policies, and sanctuary city states. And unless the laws are changed, which is Congress' job come on immigration, and we detain people and deport people, entering the country illegally, not respecting our laws or sovereignty, this will be a never ending problem for the country, which by the way, is what the Democrats want. They made political calculations. They think that gets them more voters. And in many ways, we're welcoming people to the country, either illegally, or legally. They don't make any distinction. They refused to even negotiate. The president offered a massive concession on what they say they care about the most, the so-called a Dreamers. But they could seem to care less about illegal immigration cost to every other American, we, the taxpayers, an estimated $134 billion last year in health care, criminal justice, educational system, and other costs. Now, this is just anarchy, lawlessness, sanctuary cities, sanctuary states, eliminate ICE, open borders, and a refusal to even hand over criminal aliens to the federal government as the law requires. So, tonight, 18 days before this important midterm election, now, you might want to ask yourself, which parties immigration policies do you support? Do you support the president's policies, the Republican policies, a big wall to secure our borders, also with a big door, that includes proper vetting of those that would be honored to get into this country? Or do you support the party of no due process, no presumption of innocence, the party of now anarchy, chaos, lawlessness, a party that is aiding and abetting illegal activity? And as we count on the days to November 6th, house races all across the country tonight, nobody can predict with certainty what will happen on Election Day in 18 days. They are very, very tight. In moments, we will preview some of the races that will decide the balance of power in the House of Representatives and the Senate. But let me be very clear, wherever you live, it doesn't matter. If you vote for a Democrat in any House district, you are really voting for Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Jerrold Nadler, and as speaker, she would control the gavel, the agenda. She will determine the fate of the Trump agenda. She will steer the Democrats' secret quest for impeachment of the president, but they're not telling anybody. Nancy Pelosi doesn't seem to care for the forgotten men and women of this country who are far better off two years ago since Donald Trump has been elected. And if you're a victim of her quest for power, so be it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., MINORITY LEADER: I think we owe the American people to be there for them -- for their financial security, respecting the dignity and words of every person in that country, and if there is some collateral damage, for some others who do not share our view, well, so be it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You vote for a Democrat, you are voting for that. The same woman, remember, dumped Obamacare on us, it got past the bill before you know what is in it, we are all paying more. So, without a doubt, she has a history of being radical and hyper-partisan. And we've got a tape to prove it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PELOSI: In terms of the bonus that corporate America receives versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic. If you breathe air, drink water, eat food, take medicine, or in any way interact with the court, this is a very bad decision. So what? They are going to say, you give them bump stock, it's going to be a slippery slope? I certainly hope so. I say to the candidates, do whatever you have to do, just win, baby. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Since Trump has been elected, we have 4 million new jobs, we have 8 million fewer people on food stamps and in poverty, 400,000 manufacturing jobs, jobs we were told were never coming back. But Nancy Pelosi, Democrats, they don't seem to care about the jobs, the economy, home security, homeland security, securing our borders. They have no plan at the ever mention. Instead, for them, it's about vanquishing their humiliating loss in 2016 and preserving their precious Obamacare. Not working for anybody. Abolishing ICE, open borders, they want the tax cuts back, they want the crumbs. Blocking originalist justices from the Supreme Court, getting rid of Donald Trump anyway they can -- impeach 45, impeach 45. But of course, don't tell the American people, trying to hide what they are seedy, self-serving gender is about. Don't talk about immigration, never. Don't talk about that. But as per usual, Democrats, they're not doing a very good job. Let's take a look -- these moments, well, the truth slips out. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: There is a difference with how our leadership talks about how we should handle all of this. They say, Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore. And when they say that, I say impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: They say no, I say impeachment, impeachment, impeachment. I guess that's the agenda that they are trying to hide it. That's manipulative. That's basically a way of lying to the American people, and it's so obvious. And, by the way, all too predictable, they do this every two years, every four years, they can never win if they told you the truth about where they stand. And, of course, the use of identity politics. You know, every Republican, and conservative, racist, sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, dirty air, water, kill children, kill grandma. I've you've heard me say it so many times, and it is happening before your very eyes. And now, the left is now taking it a step further, a dangerous step further and actually vilifying all political disagreements. And anyone who supports the president, watch out. That includes those so beloved Rosie O'Donnell, going on NBC News last night, calling for a military coup. I guess she is best friends with Alec Baldwin. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROSIE O'DONNELL, ACTRESS & ACTIVIST: We're going to right this ship. We are going to right the ship. There's no way that he is going to prevail because he is evil. He is dark. It's the opposite of what America stands for. When he was elected, what I wrote on Twitter was we should impose martial law until to make sure the restaurants were not involved in the final tallies of the vote. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And Bob Mueller has indicted 13 Russians for election meddling. O'DONNELL: And people like martial law? What is wrong with you, you are a lunatic. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If he wants to send the military to the border. So - - O'DONNELL: I want to send the military to the White House to get him. (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Anybody really surprised by all the incivility we've seen in the last number of weeks? This week alone, we reported on two separate instances of violent assault, two Republicans in Minnesota, two Republican candidates being punched, one a woman, another with serious head injuries. Then, Senator Susan Collins, her staff, repeatedly they have been threatened. In one scary situation, a package sent to Susan Collins' house purportedly containing the chemical ricin to reportedly poison her and her family. We are also learning that a Democratic operative arrested in Nevada for battery against the GOP campaign manager named Kristin Davison. Earlier today, she detailed the assault on \"Fox & Friends.\" Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLI) KRISTIN DAVISON, GOP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: He's very aggressive, shoving his phone in our face, faces, yelling, screaming, you know, chased us down the hallway, really bumping into, shoving staffers along the way. We entered a private room, shut the door. This gentleman pushed his way through the door. I got trapped, pinned the door on the wall, and this gentleman, kind of put my arm behind my back, and held onto it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: This is how bad they want power back. And what agenda are they offering the American people? This is all unacceptable behavior. Republicans have been stalked. They have been harassed. They have been run out of restaurants with their spouses and their children, chased down in airports, and much, much more. Senator Ted Cruz has been a frequent subject of his nonstop harassment, including just of this week, again. Remember, he was thrown out of a restaurant with his wife, Heidi. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think putting a sexual assaulter on the court is a good thing for women? SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: Thank you, sir. God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, you believe in men assaulting women? That's what your vote cost today, Senator. CRUZ: I believe in due process spirit UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You believe a due process? A lot of women were up there talking about their experience. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you believe in a man lying about his alcohol in front of the Senate in perjury? You believe in perjury? CRUZ: Thank you for expressing her First Amendment rights. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And in Houston, Texas, where I will be tomorrow, a Ted Cruz supporter was the target of another particularly unhinged altercation. Take a look at this one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have about a hundred of these, I am about to rip it more up. I will feel better about this. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I guess he is voting for the radical left-wingers so beloved by the media and Democratic elite, Beto. And speaking of which, in 18 days, Texas Voters, they're going to have a clear choice between Senator Cruz, a constitutionalist, a proven conservative, and Beto O'Rourke, what, a longtime left-wing candidate who once actually got a DUI, fled the scene of a car crash, lied about after crashing into another car while being intoxicated and wasted? They are actually in pushing for Trumps impeachment here texas; I hope you're paying very close attention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You said in July that you would come as a member of the House right now, vote to impeach. Have you changed your mind? REP. BETO O'ROURKE, D-TEXAS, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: I haven't. To answer your question, I do think there is enough there for impeachment. And if asked, I would vote on it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And don't forget, who is he obliged to listen to? Yes, millions and millions of out-of-state dollars pouring into Texas to help Beto O'Rourke. Texas, do you really want someone with the same exact views as Maxine Waters, impeach 45, leading your state? And meanwhile, a little farther west in Arizona, the race between war hero Martha McSally, was on with us earlier this week, and a bizarre, far left, radical activist named Kyrsten Sinema. Now, this week, we have shown you examples after examples of Sinema's disturbing past. In Arizona, Martha McSally, war hero, well, she is taking on Kyrsten Sinema, a woman with a very bizarre, disturbing past. Back in 2010, Sinema actually called in the state of Arizona. She wants their votes, the meth lab of democracy. She was also caught on tape multiple times calling Arizonans crazy. She wants her vote? Sinema even made fun of her state for being famous, but only enough, Lindsay Lohan kind of way. It gets even worse. In 2003, she suggested it is just fine, it is okay for Americans to go fight for the Taliban. She also promoted events at Arizona State University featuring a far left, radical lawyer who represented the blind sheikh. And, by the way, Sinema also organized an antiwar rally while Martha McSally was fighting for her country, with self-described, she invited witches to the rally. And this week, the RNC used Sinema's own words against her in this brand- new ad. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KYRSTEN SINEMA, D-ARIZ.: Democrats, greens, independents, anarchists, socialist, communist, whoever wants to come. You are welcome tomorrow. I know that in talking with groups that are coming, I said, think about how the police are going to react to what you wear and what you say. And whatever decision you make is your choice. (END AUDIO CLIP) HANNITY: Well, thankfully, McSally is currently surging in the polls, and for good reason. Meanwhile, in the great state of Tennessee, we have a shocking new poll showing Republican friend of the show, Marsha Blackburn, is actually down one point against Democratic challenger, former governor, Phil Bredesen. But remember, Bredesen was exposed this week as being a two-faced, lying, fraud phony liberal pretending to be a moderate. He was campaigning under the guise that he would support the Kavanaugh nomination, but his staff caught on camera by projectveritas.com, saying the exact opposite, say one thing to get elected, but really represent your special interest friends -- the New York Chuck Schumer way of voting in the Senate. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wasn't really, right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vote for Kavanaugh? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think so. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was so confused, because I just can't believe that he would actually vote yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wouldn't, but he said he would. I don't know if that makes it worse or better. No, it makes it better, but still -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But what's -- like I don't understand what's the game by saying yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Moderate Republicans. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: A vote for Bredesen would be a vote against due process, a vote against truth and honesty, a vote against presumption of innocence. Coming up, we're going to have a preview of three close Senate races with candidates from Michigan, Missouri, and Indiana tonight. And let's not forget about where I am. Now, we are in the state of Florida, two very important races. Governor Rick Scott currently busy here leading recovery efforts in the panhandle after Hurricane Michael. Time and time again, Governor Rick Scott has successfully guided Florida through all of these natural disasters, all while molding his state into one of the most competitive business climates in the country. He is running for Senate against a Chuck Schumer reliable vote by the name of Bill Nelson, who frankly, has been a in Washington wait too long. This is now the 76-year-old's 18th year on Capitol Hill. Time for Florida to send him home. And in the Florida race for governor, the choice is simple, obvious, and clear. You can vote for a Republican, Ron DeSantis, who is going to keep Florida on the cutting edge of innovation and economic success, a former Navy JAG officer and congressmen, or a socialist mayor, who by the way, is under investigation named Andrew Gillum, who wants to raise business taxes by 40 percent. Let me warn Florida, Gillum will be a disaster for the state of Florida. Forty percent, you will not have any business, and businesses will be fleeing Florida. So, let me be clear about your choices as it relates to this election. If you care about due process, if you care about the rule of law, Constitution, if you care about a booming economy, your paycheck, your safety, your security, and securing our borders, you better get your ass to the polls, there's a lot at stake in 18 days. And as Rush Limbaugh told us yesterday right here on this program, this is a fight for the foundations of our country and principles we hold near and dear. There is a lot at stake. Joining us now, Michigan Senate candidate John James, Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley, Indiana Senate candidate Mike Braun. Mike, we'll start with you and Indiana. You are facing the added burden of a libertarian that is drawing -- if they draw 2 percent of the vote, it is not against Joe Donnelly, it will be against you. So, I would say to the people of Indiana, any vote for this third party candidate is basically a vote for Donnelly. MIKE BRAUN, R-SENATE CANDIDATE FOR INDIANA: I think the way that is going to work as we get closer to election time, a lot of people are going to see that vote might not count. And I think it's so clear between me and the Senator Donnelly, he has been in line with Chuck Schumer from day one, he's got a record that is easy to talk about, all the things that you described in other races, hold true here. He takes his marching orders from Chuck, and really when you vote for someone like Donnelly, you are voting for Schumer. And the libertarian vote, I think, shares some of the principles of what we stand for, I think those will come home to roost because they want their vote to count. HANNITY: John James, watching you, the first time I interviewed you, you were way behind. But you have been able to close the race as people get to know you. I don't say this often because when I first interviewed you on my radio show, I even said to you, wow, this is the future of the Republican Party. Your background, your business, a state like Michigan that finally is beginning to see some economic revitalization under the policies of the president. And if you are there, how could you help him? JOHN JAMES, R-SENATE CANDIDATE FOR MICHIGAN: That's right, we can't let that slip. Not at all, not for a second. When you're w talking about the mob over the past few weeks, the past few years, it is absolutely essential that we wake up and recognize exactly what the Marxist progressives are trying to get us to do. Right now, conservative speech is considered violence. And liberal violence is considered speech. It is an attack on what we hold dear and fundamental. And that message is getting out. Understand that we're not fighting for left or right, we are fighting for red, white, and blue. And taking that message forward is something that is really meaningful here. We just had a rally, we had RSVPs for 6,000 people, 4,000 folks showed up, Donald Trump, Jr., Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, and 4,000 lovers of freedom in the state of Michigan right here who believe in taking our step forward, who believe in taking our nation forward. And I'm excited to bring my combat experience and my business experience to bear on the floor of the U.S. Senate. If you want to learn more, please go to JohnJamesforsenate.com. Debbie Stabenow is well-funded, and we close the polls from double digits to single digits. And just today, we reported that in one poll, we are tied, in another poll that I'm leading. But we need your help and we your support to protect our constitutional republic. HANNITY: Well, we can and think of what we could do to a once great city like Detroit and revitalize it with your background, your expertise and experience. Josh, let me bring you in, in Missouri. Your opponent, Claire McCaskill, she is one of the most reliable Schumer votes in Washington. She is caught on tape, and her staff, admitting they are purposefully lying to the people of Missouri. And now she somehow is mad that she is exposed. Oh, we need a special investigation. No, if you talk on camera, you are caught on camera saying things that directly conflict with what you tell the people in your state, she got exposed. That's her problem. That's not anybody else's problem. JOSH HAWLEY, R-SENATE CANDIDATE FOR MISSOURI: Yes, if I were here, I'd be concerned about the fact that she is caught saying one thing in public and another thing in private. I mean, she's caught talking about how she wants to take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens that we already know. And we just had a debate last night, Sean, she said that she is opposed to the wall, she has voting against border security. She is opposed to pro- Constitution judges, voted against Justice Kavanaugh, and as opposed to middle-class tax cuts. So, there is the choice right there. Somebody who is a party line liberal, or somebody who will vote with Missouri. HANNITY: Yes. Well, these are three important races. That is a very winnable seat. I wish you all the luck, all three of you. HAWLEY: Thank you. JAMES: Thanks. HANNITY: These three states, Michigan, Missouri, Indiana, all winnable. Thank you all for being with us. All right. When we come back, the media continues to normalize and make excuses for the liberal mob we keep showing you every night. Tammy Bruce, Joe Concha, they're next as we continue \"Hannity\" on the road. (COMMECIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK) HANNITY: All right. Instead of calling out the angry left-wing mob that continues to ambush Republican figures in public, well, some members of the left-wing destroyed Trump mainstream media, they continue to make excuses and normalize this behavior. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When he brought the mob word up again, I called them up. And, listen, like I don't want to be the word police, and that was not my intention. But I also believe calling out talking points. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are one-off instances, everyone. One-off instances of yelling at the wives or whatnot, those are one-off instances. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: \"One-off instances\". Instances, plural. Seriously? Now, this is the bizarre behavior they know normalizing and defending. Take a look. (BEGINV VIDEO CLIP) PROTESTERS: We believe survivors! PROTESTERS: We call on you to end family separation. We call on you to end family separation. And abolish ICE! Abolish ICE! (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. Joining us now with reaction. He's from \"The Hill,\" Joe Concha, Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce. Tammy, first of all, one-off instances, that would be plural. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it was. HANNITY: Just to help them out. It's not a one-off instance. What we have had as many riots and a couple of American cities. We have had now two Minnesota Republican politicians punched, one injured severely, the other a woman. We see Pam Bondi, Sarah Sanders, Secretary Nielsen, Ted Cruz and his wife, Mitch McConnell. And Maxine Waters -- create a crowd. They are not wanted, nowhere, no more. And follow them to gas stations, department stores. This is not one-off. That sounds like marching orders, and we are seeing the results of it. BRUCE: Yes, exactly. And this is now their problem. They in one hand want to deny what they created, like saying, don't believe your lying eyes, right? We see what this is. We are past the days of the '70s and '80s where we relying on one network to tell us what's happening. We have other options. We have Fox News, the internet, we have our own neighborhoods. We can see that this is a mob. That word is chosen for a reason. It's not a talking point. It's a fact. And this is what's separating the dynamic here. On one hand, they want to deny it. On the other hand, they want to excuse it and normalize it. You also should note of course the Susan Collins' letter to her home. That was said to be threat, you know, laced with ricin. Her husband noted, Sean that they actually have protests in front of their Bangor Maine home as well. So, this is not normal. There's a lot of young people who think that this is what happens with politics. It is not. This is not normal. It is, I believe, the ultimate meltdown of the left that where they cannot participate at all within a civil society and it is encouraged and endorsed by their very leadership. HANNITY: You know, Joe, first of all, the idea that somebody says one-off instances, then you've got fake news CNN, they're lecturing the media saying don't call it a mob. You can't use the mob word. Well, I'll let people view it themselves. They can decide. We see what's happening. JOE CONCHA, REPORTER, THE HILL: Yes, it's called nat sound up, Sean, or natural sound up. You show pictures like you did in that montage of people being attacked. You mention Ted Cruz or Kirstjen Nielsen in situations where they're in public places. Let people at home decide whether that's a mob or not. You don't start banning words when you start screaming about the First Amendment is being trampled on. And Symone Sanders, you played in there in that particular sound bite at the end. She should know better because we're only now, Sean, remember, 18 months removed from a Bernie Sanders supporter. And this has nothing good with Bernie Sanders, no blame on him whatsoever. But a deranged person who decide to take matters into his own hands and go to a softball field in Virginia and start shooting up Republican lawmakers that nearly got Steve Scalise, number two in Congress, killed. So that rhetoric certainly has consequences. And instead, we see not just Maxine Waters but Cory Booker or Eric Holder saying you have to get in people's faces or kick people. This is the type of rhetoric that if it was the tea party, for instance, or any conservative urging this sort of thing I have a feeling the media reaction would be decidedly different, Sean. BRUCE: Could I add something, Sean, in that. HANNITY: Yes. BRUCE: We spent the Kavanaugh hearing listening to the left say that all women matter and all women should be, you know, safe and we need to protect women. And yet this very tactic of theirs targets women. So, it's the same dynamic, these same people who have lied to the American people, obviously for an extended period of time, but certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings, as they became the mob in the Senate. Their own tactics now are targeting the wives of politicians, the women who support Donald Trump, female supporters of Donald Trump. So, they're turning the wheel. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Hey, Tammy, it's even worse than that. Thank you both. BRUCE: Thanks, Sean. HANNITY: A lot more coming up this busy news-breaking Friday night. Nellie Ohr, a Fusion GPS contractor, wife of demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr, well, she met with lawmakers behind closed door today. We'll get a report. Congressman Mark Meadows was in that meeting, he joins us next along with John Solomon, Sara Carter. A lot to get to. We're glad you're with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. So earlier today, Congress grilled Nellie Ohr. She is the Fusion GPS contractor who is working on the phony dossier, also married to the twice-demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Remember, Bruce Ohr became the conduit for Christopher Steele. And they wanted to funnel phony information to the special counsel Robert Mueller. And Nelly helped put together the anti-Trump dossier filled with Russian lies, propaganda, misinformation used in the campaign, used to secure FISA warrants. And Fox News has learned that Nellie Ohr, well, took the spousal privilege. House freedom caucus chairman Mark Meadows he was in that meeting. He joins us now, along with Fox News contributors Sara Carter, investigative reporter. Also, investigative reporter from The Hill, John Solomon. Thank you all for being with us. Well, spousal privilege. Well, at least she showed up because Glenn Simpson wouldn't showed up. Rod Rosenstein I hear he is now rescheduled for the 24th. Congressman, tell us what you can tell us as it relates to this. REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Well, obviously the details of that particular interview are not something that we're sharing publicly, but your lead-in is exactly right. We were trying to get to the connection between Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson, the one who hired Christopher Steele and others to do the dossier. And ultimately the go-between, which was in our opinion at times Nellie Ohr to Bruce Ohr at DOJ and then to the FBI. And so, a lot of the communication, she was actually a cooperative witness, but when it got down to the real details, she either didn't recall or they invoked a privilege that would say that the intimate conversations between a husband and wife could not be divulged and certainly claimed that privilege. So, I don't know that we've learned a whole lot. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: OK, the dossier she worked on that Clinton paid for that was used to, well, propagandize the American people with lies before the election and then used later as a weapon to try to bring the president down. And of course, that was all part of the media leak strategy, the insurance policy to get the special counsel appointed. Sara Carter, let me -- let me go to you. You look at they are being uncooperative, not allowing people like our friend Mark Meadows here to do his job, which is oversight. They keep refusing to turn over documents. They lie in the name of national security and they've been proven to lie. But when you get to the bottom of it all, it really a lot is coming down to Bruce and Nellie Ohr. She creates the dossier. He's spreading the narrative of the dossier. And we even have information proving that Christopher Steele is telling Bruce Ohr to get it to his friends over to the special counsel but none of it is verified. SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Sean. I mean, think about this. So, you have Nellie Ohr delivering information to her husband that he is holding onto. He is delivering that information to the FBI, apparently. And he's also being used as a backdoor to deliver information for Christopher Steele to the FBI after the FBI fires and basically dismisses Christopher Steele as a confidential informant when they were gathering information because he was leaking to the media. So how can Congress get to the bottom of any of this if Nellie Ohr is refusing to talk about the conversations she had with her husband. These are not private conversations between a husband and a wife. These are conversations between an employee of Fusion GPS and an official from the Department of Justice. And Congress should continue to demand answers from her just as they did from James Baker. And maybe the person to ask about a lot of these questions is going to be Rod Rosenstein next Wednesday. I mean, he ready has to answer these questions. He gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal but then refused to talk to Congressman Meadows and other lawmakers. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: That was amazing. CARTER: Yes. It's incredible. It's like well, I can talk to the media, but I don't want to talk to you. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: I'm going to go back to Mark on that. CARTER: Yes. HANNITY: And I'll let you weigh in on this, John Solomon, but also you had a big breaking story yesterday that there's -- you were able to discover all these junkets-- JOHN SOLOMON, VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL: Yes. HANNITY: -- the DOJ FBI guys were taking from special interests. And it seems one of the biggest beneficiaries, even during his time working for Mueller, if my timeline is correct, would be Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann. SOLOMON: Yes. HANNITY: Of course, he was the guy that overturn nine, zero in the Supreme Court lost tens of thousands of jobs at Enron Accounting, he put four innocent people in jail for a year, overturned by the 5th circuit. Really, he's taken junkets paid for by? SOLOMON: Yes, the ABA and many of these different interests that has cases pending before the Unite States government and the Justice Department. You had FBI agents that are going out to trip on Microsoft and Microsoft is fighting it out in the courts with the Justice Department. It was a pretty stark picture of a Justice Department that seems to be on the take with special interests. And nobody really knew about it. These reports were hidden. And I think it's an important thing. I was thinking as I was listening to Congressman Meadows and Sara talk about what we learned today and yesterday. If the Beatles were around today, I think they would have revamped their song and it would be, \"We've got a ticket to hide.\" Everything the FBI and the DOJ is doing is hiding from the American public the truth of what went on this Russia investigation. And somewhere that buck has to stop, and I think it stops next week with Rod Rosenstein. HANNITY: Well, let me go back to Mark Meadows and Rod Rosenstein. Why aren't you going to be in the room? And is he going to be under oath as per usual standard practice and that will it be recorded as per usual standard practice? MEADOWS: Well, I think that's part-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: And why aren't you there? I heard you might not be in the room. MEADOWS: Well, right now the deal that's being negotiated right now would exclude a number of us that have been there. So, here's the problem I have with that. One, that's not what our leadership committed to. Jim Jordan and I that they would do. But the bigger problem is why should Rod Rosenstein get a different standard than everybody else. He wants to go into a classified setting, he wants to go into a secret room so nobody can hear his testimony on a transcribed interview. I think that we need to continue to make sure that he comes. I think we ought to compel him to come. And if he won't come voluntarily, the way that every other witness has, you know, the time for a subpoena is now. CARTER: I couldn't agree more. HANNITY: We need to release the FISA, declassify those, unredacted. The gang of eight information, the 302's. I hope they're coming. The president said they will be. Do we all agree on that? MEADOWS: I agree. SOLOMON: I agree. CARTER: I agree, yes. HANNITY: John, all right. SOLOMON: Yes, I'm here. HANNITY: Thank you all. We're going to be watching that closely next week. All right. When we come back, Democrats continue to refuse to secure the border. We have 4,000 people, a caravan headed to our border. The president is having none of this. Geraldo Rivera, Dan Bongino, they're coming up next, straight head. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher. Saudi Arabia now admitting that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The kingdom claims he was killed in a fist fight in the consulate and says that 18 suspects were now in custody. This is a major about face for the Saudi kingdom which had previously rejected accusations that the journalist had been killed. President Trump says he finds the Saudi's explanation for Khashoggi's death to be credible and that he'll work with Congress to formulate an official U.S. response to the admission. Meantime, President Trump in Mesa, Arizona this evening. This is a live look. Hosting a make America great again rally at Mesa, Phoenix International Airport. Stay tuned to Fox News for highlights of the rally later tonight. And remember, when news breaks out, we'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Sean Hannity. HANNITY: So just this morning, Fox News Griff Jenkins he was embedded with border patrol agents and during Fox and Friends he captured dramatic footage of officers catching allege illegal immigrants crossing the Mexican border. Of course, we're watching very closely 4,000 migrants trying to make their way to our southern border. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Since I spoke to you last we've made more arrest. The infiltration across this border continues. We've gone deep into the brush, another group of individuals. Now you're looking at three guys that came deep into this brush that they had located and found these three individuals. One -- they're all in their 20's. One man is from Honduras. Two are from -- I'm sorry, one is from Guatemala, two are from El Salvador, I believe. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right. Here with reaction author of the bestseller \"The Geraldo Show,\" Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, and NRA TV contributor, former Secret Service agent and also a bestseller of himself, selling author himself, Dan Bongino is with us. Geraldo, the president has done everything he can do, I think. And you even agree. He said, we'll give you the DREAMers. Democrats never wanted a deal. We've got a caravan of 4,000 people. Geraldo, we assume Mexico will do their job, but they don't, then the president is going to be forced to put our military on the border. The answer is the wall. You said you would support it. Why won't -- why do the Democrats refuse to negotiate, and why are they hearing from John Podesta in a report, don't talk about immigration, it's a losing issue, so act like it doesn't exist? GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: I think Democrats are in a jam on immigration because Barack Obama's policy wasn't that different from Donald Trump's. Barack Obama was called the deporter-in-chief. He was just as harsh on those who are here without proper documentation as President Trump purportedly is. I think there's several things here, Sean, that have to be pointed out that is good news. And I appreciate Griff Jenkins' reporting from the southern border. But in Mexico's southern border, go 1100 miles to the south, because of Donald Trump's personal negotiations with Pena Nieto, the current president and Obrador, the incoming Mexican president, the Mexican government has now resolved to help us with this problem. They've moved two plane loads of federales to Mexico's southern border with Guatemala and the Mexicans now are stopping that caravan at their southern border. That's what you need. You need creative approaches. And you need the compromise, Sean, that you and I have hammered out. Let's build the wall. Elections have consequences. Donald Trump has been supported by enough of the voters in the states with the Electoral College votes that counts that he deserves to get his wall. On the other hand, for Democratic support, we should cut the DREAMers slack and give them a green card and a path to citizenship. HANNITY: He offered the deal. GRIVERA: Wall plus DREAMers that's a compromise that you and I can live with. HANNITY: All right. When you look at what the Democrats want, though, the Democratic calculation to me, Dan Bongino, is they think this is a generation or generations of votes for them. So, they won't even negotiate anything. Not good for our country, not good for the opioid crisis or human trafficking. But we literally have sanctuary cities, now sanctuary states, and zero cooperation. Why, why are they steadfastly against any protection of our borders? DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR, NRATV: Sean, you will get no compromise from the Democrats who have been entirely unreasonable and ridiculous on immigration for the last 20 years now. But you just summarized nicely the reason why. And I want everybody to hear this and understands this. This is not about compassion, it's not about immigrants, it's not taking care of immigrants for the Democrats. This is about voters and what they believe is demographic destiny. They believe that. I don't believe that. I don't believe Hispanic voters or immigrants vote like robots, like the Democrats want you to believe they do. These are people just like anyone else who vote on issues. To them it's about power and votes. And I can prove it to you, Sean. They have been offered deals in the past which delay paths to citizenship and voting rights and the Democrats don't even want to hear it. They have -- this has nothing to do with compassion. This is all about power to them. HANNITY: Geraldo? RIVERA: In terms of demographic reality, let me just say this. Ronald Reagan said of Latinos, they are Republicans even though they may not know it yet. They're very entrepreneurial. Look where Dan Bongino our friend and colleague is in South Florida right now and where you are right now. Look at what the Cuban-Americans have done. Entrepreneurs is creating businesses being Republican in many ways. You can -- George W. Bush, 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. It's bad for us to let the Democrats have their way. Let's reach out. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Lowest unemployment rate ever-- RIVERA: President Trump deserves a second look. And let me just say this. HANNITY: -- in 14 states. African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian- Americans. RIVERA: Governor Scott -- to Governor Scott, we give you thanks for your help in Puerto Rico during the hurricane. BONGINO: Sean, we have to treat Hispanic voters and immigrants like people. They don't like chaos. They like security too. The Democrats have grossly misinterpreted their position on this they're going to lose. HANNITY: All right. Thank you both for being with us. All right. When we come back, I am headed to Texas tomorrow. I'll be with Senator Ted Cruz, I'll be interviewing him in part of a town hall. And so, I'll tell you where I will be in the lone star state. Hint. Houston and Beaumont. We'll tell you as we continue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right. As we wrap things up tonight, tomorrow I will be in Texas to interview Senator Ted Cruz as he campaigns in Houston and Beaumont. I'm going to be in Houston in the morning, Beaumont in the afternoon. These are town halls. I'll be interviewing the senator. It will air Monday night right here on this show. As always, thank you for being with us. We'll be fair and balanced. We are not the destroy-Trump media. And when we get back Monday only 15 days until election day. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues.

            "article_content": "Freedom Watch: Judge Andrew Napolitano and Ed Rollins discuss whether Republicans running for midterm elections will distance themselves from President Trump or embrace his policies? Heading into the 2018 midterm elections we have seen President Trump give Republicans all they need to win. In two years \u2013 while fighting off the fake news, paid protesters, and a wild goose chase \u201cinvestigation\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump signed into law the largest tax cut in American history, orchestrated peace between North and South Korea, and border crossings are at a forty-year low. I could write several paragraphs on what we\u2019ve witnessed under the Trump administration that should help the GOP win in November. But what is also helpful is there are key senate races in states that Trump won with authority: Montana, West Virginia, Ohio, the list goes on for key races we will be seeing this cycle. But what the Republicans need to remember this year is one thing: traditional politics and strategies are totally meaningless in 2018. Republicans need to play to win like Trump did. Despite what traditional polling places and the media says, a majority of Americans support Donald Trump. A very silent majority. And the Hollywood and D.C. elites are scrambling to figure out who these people are and figure out how to get them in line. They are the coal miner from West Virginia who is fed up with career politicians who are bragging about their vision of shutting down every coal mine. They\u2019re the worker in the rust belt of Ohio who used to belong to a union and work in a steel mill before their factory got shut down and moved to China. They\u2019re the farmers in Montana who don\u2019t want their tax money to go to abortions on demand. This silent majority are the Americans who love God, their family, and our amazing country. They don\u2019t want their morals, their job, or their lifestyle threatened by the government or any candidates. This silent majority are the Americans who love God, their family, and our amazing country. They don\u2019t want their morals, their job, or their lifestyle threatened by the government or any candidates. There is more than just this silent majority today. Candace Owens has caused a tectonic shift in the political landscape. She has spent the last several months working seven-day weeks to wake up the black community \u2013 and it is working. On April 21, hip hop superstar and pop culture icon Kanye West tweeted \u201cI love the way Candace Owens thinks.\u201d Shortly afterwards, he tweeted himself wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. Most celebrities back down and apologize after showing their support for the president. Instead of doing that Kanye has doubled down with his support of Trump and has met with Owens, all while the far left and the Democratic party is losing its mind. Why? Because they depend on the black vote to win any elections. The second a black celebrity such as Chance the Rapper tweets \u201cBlack people don\u2019t need to be democrats\u201d that\u2019s a death spell for their hopes at elections. Thanks to Candace, Kanye, and the fact that black unemployment is at an all-time low under President Trump, in the past week alone Trump\u2019s approval rating among black men has doubled. Here is what Republican candidates need to remember during the 2018 midterm: Americans want jobs, and hard-working families that have been left helpless in the past decade due to awful trade agreements know that Donald Trump was right when he said we\u2019ve been losing to China. Americans want law and order followed in this country \u2013 they don\u2019t want gangs and drugs crossing over the southern border. They want a candidate who makes a campaign promise to keep it \u2013 we need a wall. Finally, Americans want a Congress that is going to do what its says it will do and that will work with and support the president. They are not, for example, content with a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of ObamaCare, whatever that even is. Republicans cannot afford to play to lose this election cycle. The future of this country depends on it. They need to take advantage of the achievements President Trump has handed them and take hold of the opportunity to win these key seats.",

            "article_content": "Data shows workers are feeling a bump in mining, logging and manufacturing. President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday authorizing sanctions against any country that interferes with U.S. elections, declaring election meddling efforts a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d The executive order, signed just two months ahead of the November's midterms elections, addresses not only interference with campaign and election infrastructure, but also propaganda efforts. The order, which is considered a national emergency due to sanctions authority requirements, instructs the Office of National Intelligence and the intelligence community to conduct regular assessments about potential foreign interference in elections. The process, according to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and White House national security adviser John Bolton, would take a total of 90 days. Following Election Day, the intelligence community would have 45 days to collect data and assess whether interference had occurred. At that point, the agencies would pass the findings to the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, where officials would have 45 days to make their assessment based on the intelligence information, and decide whether to pass sanctions on potential actors, countries, or institutions that participated in potential interference. After the reports are complete, the Treasury and State Departments would decide on the appropriate sanctions to impose on the potential actors or countries. The order, according to administration officials, is broad in terms of who and what can be sanctioned. \u201cWe felt it was important to demonstrate that the president was taking command of this issue,\u201d Bolton told reporters Wednesday. But Coats stressed that the order was not country specific, noting that there have been a number of occasions where threats to U.S. elections have come from \u201ca number of sources.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more than Russia here that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Coats said. \u201cWe have seen signs of not just Russia, but from China, and the capabilities potentially from Iran and even North Korea.\u201d Bolton and Coats said the 90 day process would be private, and that the public would be notified of decisions when sanctions are announced. \u201cWe have not seen the intensity of what happened in 2016, but it\u2019s only a keyboard click away,\u201d Coats said. \u201cSo we\u2019re taking nothing for granted\u2014we\u2019re putting a process in place, and significantly improved our ability to warn officials as to what we see and what steps we can take prior to the election, in addition to what we will be doing after.\u201d The executive order comes after the intelligence community and several congressional committees determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Fox News' Kristin Brown and Jennifer Bowman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks after Democrats gain control of the House of Representatives. After years in the political wilderness on Capitol Hill, Democrats will have the power to push their legislative agenda in Congress after winning the House majority Tuesday. But faced with a Republican-controlled Senate and White House, the\u00a0Democrats are in for a series of showdowns that could leave the party undertaking more modest legislative goals on issues from\u00a0prescription drug prices to infrastructure, while laying the\u00a0groundwork for a more ambitious national agenda ahead of the 2020\u00a0presidential race. Meanwhile, President Trump's wide-ranging wishlist, including his\u00a0recently announced plan for a 10-percent middle-class tax cut and\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's renewed call for an ObamaCare\u00a0repeal, now requires significant revisions. Compromise between\u00a0Democrats and Republicans will surely remain elusive as the midterm season is overtaken by presidential election politics, though analysts say both sides may be forced to strike some deals in pursuit of legislative wins. Democrats' first major initiative will likely be to enact rules\u00a0changes that govern the House, because those internal regulations do\u00a0not require Senate passage. In the wake of the dramatic arrest of Rep.\u00a0Chris Collins, R-N.Y., in August on insider trading charges related to\u00a0his role on the board of a prominent biotechnology company, ethics\u00a0reforms are set to be a marquee area of focus. DEMS RETAKE HOUSE, BUT GOP EXPANDS SENATE MAJORITY -- GIVING THEM CONTROL OVER JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel, signaled as much on Tuesday night, vowing that \"we will have a Congress that is open transparent and accountable to the American people.\" \u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d Pelosi declared. \"It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration. ... It's about ending wealthy special interests' free rein over Washington.\" She promised to\u00a0\"clean up corruption to make Washington work for all Americans.\" Pelosi similarly pledged to lead \"the most ethical Congress in history\" when\u00a0she first rose to the speakership in 2007 -- a boast that became a\u00a0liability when she placed then-Rep. William Jefferson on the Homeland\u00a0Security Committee, despite allegations he had stashed $90,000 in\u00a0bribe money in his freezer. (Jefferson was later convicted on bribery charges.) \"Members of Congress should not be sitting on boards of companies,\u00a0especially those whose are impacted by policies \u2014 policy decisions and\u00a0the government \u2014 so this is appalling, but it shows the brazenness of\u00a0it all,\" Pelosi said on MSNBC\u00a0earlier this year. More substantive legislative changes are also possible on a series of\u00a0high-profile policy items on which both parties have signaled they\u00a0could ultimately have some common ground. \"The only legislative initiative that appears to be at stake is tax\u00a0reform 2.0. Other than that, the same things\u00a0happen.\" In June, Trump supported a compromise immigration bill that would have\u00a0secured $25 billion for border wall construction while also providing\u00a0a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. But after the legislation hit a wall\u00a0of its own as moderate and conservative Republicans splintered, Trump\u00a0seemingly withdrew that support and said his party should try again if\u00a0a \"red wave\" materialized in November. DEMS TO FLEX MUSCLE, AS HOUSE AFFORD THEM POWER TO SUBPOENA TRUMP ADMIN Roosevelt University politics professor David Faris, who has said that\u00a0the GOP likely wouldn't have made much legislative progress even it\u00a0had retained control of the House, told Fox News that Trump might\u00a0revisit that short-lived compromise effort in the coming months. \"If Democrats are willing to fund the border wall in exchange for the\u00a0Dreamers -- I think that broad compromise has been there a long time,\"\u00a0Faris said. \"The real question is whether the president is willing to let go on restrictions on legal immigration. If he can let that go, I\u00a0think the compromise is there.\" Leaders from both parties have also publicly lamented soaring\u00a0prescription drug costs. Trump has hammered Pfizer and other\u00a0pharmaceutical giants on the issue, saying in July that they \"should\u00a0be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason\" and \"are\u00a0merely taking advantage of the poor.\" The president has framed drug prices as an affront to his \"America\u00a0First\" worldview, writing on Twitter that the companies are \"giving\u00a0bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere.\"\u00a0Soon after his election, he charged that drug companies were \"getting\u00a0away with murder.\" A 2015 Reuters study found that on average, prices for the world's\u00a0top-20 highest selling medicines are three times more expensive in the\u00a0U.S. than they are in Britain, owing to government pricing controls\u00a0there. On Tuesday, Pelosi promised to take action in brief remarks as early election returns poured in. \"Democrats will lower health care costs and prescription drug prices for seniors and families across America,\" she said. \"Instead Mitch McConnell and the Republicans have put Medicare and Medicaid on the chopping block, and will continue their cruel assault from the protections for people with preexisting conditions. But the issue of soaring drug prices may be trickier to resolve than it appears. Trump\u00a0already signed a bipartisan bill in October that guaranteed\u00a0pharmacists the right to tell consumers when paying cash would be\u00a0cheaper than using insurance for their prescriptions, over the\u00a0objection of insurance companies. And Democrats, although united in\u00a0their concern over soaring prices, are split on how to resolve the\u00a0underlying problem. Some Democrats want to allow the federal government to negotiate\u00a0Medicare drug prices, even though similar efforts in the past may have\u00a0made the problem worse. On Tuesday night, Pelosi hinted at taking \"very strong legislative action to negotiate down the price control of prescription drugs that is burdening seniors and families across America.\" \"I think it deserves some hearings, but it\u2019s not\u00a0as easy as it sounds. It\u2019s not a magic bullet.\" In 1990, Congress mandated that federal\u00a0Medicaid programs either receive a 15 percent discount on drugs off\u00a0their list prices, or the most competitive price offered to private\u00a0payers -- an initiative that ultimately led drug companies to\u00a0slash\u00a0private discounts to roughly 15 percent off list prices. But some in her party are skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s a great talking point,\u201d Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told Roll\u00a0Call, referring to the idea of having the federal government negotiate\u00a0with drug companies. \u201cI think it deserves some hearings, but it\u2019s not\u00a0as easy as it sounds. It\u2019s not a magic bullet.\u201d\nInfrastructure reform could also be an area of bipartisan consensus,\u00a0as Democrats have vowed to use the committee process to build\u00a0agreement on any proposal to improve the nation's roads, bridges,\u00a0sewer systems, and schools. On Tuesday, Pelosi specifically touted her plans to \"deliver a transformational investment in America's infrastructure,\" including broadband networks, housing, schools, and sewers. \"Infrastructure has never been partisan,\" she claimed. In October, Trump signed a bipartisan bill\u00a0to provide several billions of dollars to fund drinking-water\u00a0initiatives and Army Corps of Engineers projects, just one day after\u00a0he signed a similarly bipartisan bill to combat the opioid epidemic\u00a0and just two months after he signed a massive defense\u00a0spending bill\u00a0into law. \"If you want to know about bipartisan accomplishments, look no further\u00a0than this Congress,\" Stephanie Penn, press secretary for Senate\u00a0Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Fox News. \"Water\u00a0infrastructure, opioids, defense, etc. All passed with\u00a0overwhelming\u00a0bipartisan support.\" Trump's own infrastructure proposal, which called for a\u00a0$200 billion federal investment in the hopes of spurring $1.5 trillion\u00a0in additional funding from states and private investors, stalled in\u00a0Congress earlier this year. Democrats balked at further spending cuts\u00a0to pay for the measue, and instead suggested rolling back the GOP's\u00a0recent tax overhaul. Republicans, meanwhile, split on whether to fund\u00a0the plan with a gas tax or other mechanism. RED-STATE DEMS WHO OPPOSED KAVANAUGH DROP LIKE FLIES IN MIDTERMS Another potential showdown looms over Trump's recently renegotiated\u00a0trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, which is slated to replace the\u00a0North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new United\u00a0States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) secures greater U.S. access to\u00a0Canadian dairy markets and changes regulations to bring back more auto\u00a0manufacturing to the U.S. and is considered one of the White House's\u00a0crowning foreign policy achievements -- but it requires congressional\u00a0authorization. \"The bar for supporting a new NAFTA will be high,\u201d Rep. Richard Neal,\u00a0D-Mass., who is poised to become the chairman of the House Ways and\u00a0Means Committee, told Politico. And Trump himself has similarly\u00a0sounded a note of caution: \"Anything you submit to Congress is\u00a0trouble,\" he said. But other analysts have warned that Democrats, by fighting Trump on\u00a0trade, would risk drawing attention to his accomplishments -- and play\u00a0into his critiques that they are only interested in obstruction. One of the only major concessions by the U.S. in the USMCA is that it preserves a\u00a0tariff-dispute regulatory regime that Canada had insisted was a sine\u00a0qua non. \"Given the modest nature of the revisions he pursued with these trade\u00a0agreements, I don't see Democrats dying on that hill,\" Faris told Fox\u00a0News. \"I think the opinion within Congress is broadly supportive of\u00a0these agreements. ... You could argue that's an area where the president\u00a0has succeeded, and I don't think Democrats want to highlight that\u00a0success by trying to stop it.\" Still, Faris added, if Trump decides to escalate the ongoing trade\u00a0conflict with China, a congressional clash could be imminent. \"The collision course possible here is with China,\" Faris said. \"If we\u00a0get to the point where we're talking aboutmost-favored-nation status,\u00a0I could see a potentially significant battle with Congress over that.\"\u00a0(The U.S. has afforded China permanent normal trade relations since\u00a02000, an arrangement that afforded China the same trade advantages as\u00a0other countries with that designation.) While more partisan fireworks are likely in the next two years, Faris\u00a0said, the actual impact of divided government may not be as\u00a0significant as it might appear, owing to the lack of pending, articulated GOP\u00a0policy proposals that actually hang in the balance. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who previously directed the Congressional Budget\u00a0Office and now heads the conservative American Action Forum think\u00a0tank, agreed, telling Fox News that the Democratic takeover of the\u00a0House won't actually \"change much.\" \"The only legislative initiative that appears to be at stake is tax\u00a0reform 2.0,\" Holtz-Eaken said. \"Other than that, the same things\u00a0happen -- with [Democrats] doing a lot more oversight.\"",

            "article_content": "On 'Fox News Sunday,' the national security adviser reacts to apparent attack on President Maduro, questions surrounding a disconnect between the White House and President Trump on election interference. This is a rush transcript from \"Fox News Sunday,\" August 5, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace. The president and his administration send mixed signals on the election threat from Russia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRIS WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day. KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Our democracy itself is in the crosshairs. WALLACE: But while top national security officials condemn Russian modeling, the president defends his meeting with Vladimir Putin. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had a great meeting with Putin. We discussed everything. Now, we are being hindered by the Russian hoax. It's a hoax. WALLACE: We'll discuss the apparent disconnect with the president's national security adviser John Bolton, and with Marco Rubio, a top member of the Senate and Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees. Bolton and Rubio only on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Then, a federal judge blocks a Texas activist from putting blueprints online to make plastic guns on 3D printers. Cody Wilson joins us to explain why he thinks it's a good idea. Plus, just hours after this -- IVANKA TRUMP, FIRST DAUGHTER: I do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people. WALLACE: President Trump bashes journalists again. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Whatever happened to fair press? Whatever happened to honest reporters? They don't report it. They only make up stories. WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the Trump family divide. All, right now, on \"Fox News Sunday.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. While top national security officials say the threat from Russian meddling in the upcoming midterms is real, President Trump keeps calling it a hoax. It's just one of several issues along with North Korea and Iran where the president's statements appear at odds with the rest of his administration. In a moment, I'll talk about the seeming disconnect with the president's national security adviser John Bolton. But, first let's bring in Kristin Fisher in Columbus, Ohio, where President Trump held another of his highly charged rallies last night -- Kristin. KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS: Well, Chris, this was President Trump's second campaign rally since five of his top national security officials stood side-by-side sounding the alarm that Russia is continuing to try to interfere in our elections. And yet at both rallies, President Trump did not back them up. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We got to stop meddling, we got to stop everybody from attacking us, but there are a lot. Russia is there, China is there. FISHER: President Trump once again refusing to place the blame squarely on Russia. But he had no problem taking China to task for smacking U.S. farmers with retaliatory tariffs. TRUMP: China is targeting the American farmer. Because China is smart and they know the American farmers love Donald Trump and they say, what can we do to stop Donald Trump? FISHER: The retaliatory tariffs are hitting one of the president's key constituencies, prompting a $12 billion bailout for farmers. The president's lengthy defense of his tariffs inside a sweltering high school gymnasium made clear he is feeling the heat. TRUMP: So much for my brand-new beautiful suit. FISHER: The president and Republicans are also feeling the heat heading into Tuesday special election for Ohio's 12th congressional district. It's why President Trump came to this reliably Republican district, to rally his supporters around Troy Balderson, who's locked in a tight race with Democrat Danny O'Connor. TRUMP: A vote for Danny boy and the Democrats is about to let criminals and drugs pour into our country and to let MS-13 run wild in our communities. (END VIDEOTAPE) FISHER: And that is exactly what we can expect more of heading into the midterms. This is President Trump's third campaign rally this week and that pace is only expected to accelerate -- Chris. WALLACE: Kristin Fisher reporting from Columbus, Ohio -- Kristin, thanks for that. Joining me now, the president's national security adviser, John Bolton. And, Ambassador, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\" JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Glad to be with you. WALLACE: Let's begin with breaking news. What leftist Venezuelan president is calling an assassination attempt against him yesterday. Let's put up this video. Pretty striking. The president, President Maduro, speaking at a military event when drones loaded with explosives exploded. You can see security protecting him with ballistic blankets and military -- it was a national guard event at the event in Caracas, begin the stampede. Question, did the U.S. play any role, and what's our reaction to what he was calling an assassination attempt? BOLTON: Well, I can say unequivocally there is no U.S. government involvement in this at all. Just within the past couple of hours, I have spoken with our charge in Caracas, the head diplomatic official down there. He and his staff were up much of the night making sure that Americans in Venezuela were safe. As of now, we think everybody notice to the embassy is in a secure position. They're going to will evaluate conditions today but they focused on that principle responsibility and as of now feel pretty confident that Americans are accounted for. Now, with respect to what happened last afternoon, look, it could be a lot of things from a pretext set up by the Maduro regime itself, or something else. He's made accusations accusing the outgoing president of Columbia responsibility, what he calls the extreme right wing in Venezuela, that means the vast opposition to his authoritarian role and he's blamed unnamed fancers (ph) in the United States. These are things he has said before and you have to take them for what they are worth. If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of U.S. criminal law, we'll take a serious look at it. But in the meantime, I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and the oppression of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. WALLACE: Let's turn to the apparent -- I suspect you'll challenge this, the apparent disconnect between what Trump administration officials are saying about Russian meddling in 2016 and in 2018 and what President Trump is saying about it. Here's how DHS Secretary Nielsen described the threat this week and on the president just hours later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) NIELSEN: Our democracy itself is in the cross hairs. TRUMP: I had a great meeting with Putin. We discussed everything. I had a great meeting. Now, we are being hindered by the Russian hoax. It's a hoax, OK? (END VIDEO CLIPS) WALLACE: So, Ambassador, which is it? Is Russian meddling a threat to our democracy or is it a hoax? BOLTON: Look, I know that there's this narrative in the press that there's a distinction between the president and the rest of his administration. You know, I got to know Eugene McCarthy, the late Democratic senator, very well. He was a client of mine in Buckley against Valeo. He's an iconoclastic guy. He used to describe the press as a group of birds sitting on a telephone wire. One would fly off and then they'd all fly off. That's what this narrative I think it is all about. The president knew exactly what was going to be said at that press briefing on Thursday. He's the one who directed it be held. It came as the result of a National Security Council meeting we had held the Friday before where the heads of the operating agencies and departments before who attended the press briefing on Thursday and others told the president what it was doing, he felt it was important that the American people hear directly from the people responsible for election security at the federal level, hear what they were up to, at least in a non-classified environment. So, that's why we had the briefing. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: -- because they are saying this is a clear and present danger that Russia did it in 2016, they are continuing to do it now. You have the secretary of homeland security with her hair on fire saying our democracy is in the crosshairs and then you have President Trump saying we are being hindered by the Russian hoax. That's not the press making that up, that's anybody who looks at it has got to see a difference there. BOLTON: I think what he's saying by the hoax is the idea that somehow the Russians directed and controlled his campaign or direct and control his administration, that there was some conspiracy or some violation of U.S. law in 2016. (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Mueller is also investigating (ph) Russian meddling. He's handed down an indictment of 12 military intelligence officers of the GRU. BOLTON: And there's no question that that's going on. That's what everybody said on Thursday. WALLACE: So, that's the hoax? BOLTON: The hoax is the idea that the Trump campaign was a beneficiary of a concerted effort together with the Russians to affect the 2016 election. As to that, I don't think there's any evidence publicly but everybody who participated in the press conference Thursday agreed, as has the president on several public occasions that the intelligence community assessment of Russian meddling in 2016 is valid. WALLACE: But one of the most powerful ways that Mr. Trump can try to prevent any meddling in the 2018 election is to stand up in public and call out Vladimir Putin and say knock it off. I want to go back to Helsinki and to the joint summit news conference there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: I know you say that it was the first issue, election meddling, that President Trump brought up with Putin in their one-on-one meeting. But why not stand there right along side Putin, with the whole world watching and say, we are not going to stand for anymore meddling? BOLTON: Well, as the president said, he misspoke. The subsequent point in the press conference and that he intended to say just that, he had a statement issued the next day that I think made clear where he stood on the issue. And as I say, you can't read any motive into what he did other than his deep concern about Russian election meddling than to put the four operating heads and myself out for that press briefing. The whole point of that was to show what his administration was doing to counter Russian meddling and other broader influence operations. WALLACE: But in Kristin Fisher's piece about the rally last night, he talks about meddling and he said there was a lot of people involved. There was Russia, there was China, there was North Korea. No, there wasn't, it was Russia that was interfering. That's what everybody's been focusing on. That's what you focused on in your briefing. BOLTON: Right. There's no question that Russia was the principal violator in 2016 and that their activity this year puts them in the lead, although as people said, activity so far at least is down from 2016. But it does not exclude the potential for others to meddle and the broader issue that I think FBI Director Christopher Wray talked about in particular of influence efforts that go beyond the specifics of a particular election. I think that's very troubling too and something we need more focus on. WALLACE: I -- you talked about the media and the idea that they all jump off the telephone line at this electric -- BOLTON: Not every one of them, but a lot of them. WALLACE: But a lot of them do it at the same time. In a much more direct way, the president critiqued the media. And I want to put up his tweet. He's been on something of a Twitter tear today and this is one of them. The fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it's true. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American people. They purposely cause great division and distrust. They can also cause war. They are very dangerous and sick. Ambassador, what wars have we started? BOLTON: Look, I think the issue of press bias has been around for a long, long time. As a boy, I supported Barry Goldwater in 1964. I thought the press was biased against him. I don't think it's changed much since then. WALLACE: I absolutely agreed. There is press bias. People, you know, people get stories wrong and people are called out for it. And we should be called out if we make a mistake. Cause war? Sick, divisive? This is taking it to a completely different level. BOLTON: Well, that's the president's view based on the attacks that the media made on him. There've been other administrations that have been highly critical of the press as well. You go back -- I remember John Kennedy cutting off the White House subscription to The New York Times. WALLACE: It was The Herald Tribune, but close. BOLTON: Sorry, close enough. I was much younger, what can I say? But I think this kind of adversarial relationship is difficult. WALLACE: OK. North Korea, this week, we learned that North Korea continues to produce plutonium, continues to build new missiles. There are reports that North Korea is violating the sanctions by ship to ship transfers. They've done it, it's increasing. That China and Russia are stepping up their efforts to ease around the sanctions. At what point does the Trump administration say that Kim is playing us, that he isn't serious about denuclearization and basically call him on this? BOLTON: Yes. Well, that point may well come. As I've said to you and others before, there's nobody in his administration starry eyed about the prospects of North Korea actually denuclearizing. But I think what's going on now is that the president is giving Kim Jong-un on a master class and how to hold a door open for somebody. And if the North Koreans can't figure out how to walk through it, even the president's fiercest critics will not be able to say it's because he didn't open it wide enough. We are going to have to see a performance from the North Koreans. There's no question about it. WALLACE: How soon, though? I mean, there's talk in his exchange of letters, they are discussing another summit. BOLTON: Well, they are talking about in the exchange of letters what is necessary to get performance on the commitment that North Korea itself made in Singapore to denuclearize. That's the central issue for us. There's a lot of interest in inter-Korean negotiations. They are looking at further discussions there. That's important to them. That's not our priority, though. Our priority is North Korean denuclearization. Kim Jong-un promised South Korean President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom on April 27th that he would do it and that he would do it within a year. So, the focus here is getting Kim Jong-un to follow through on what he committed to the president at Singapore. WALLACE: So, you're willing to leave the door open for a year and that it shuts? BOLTON: No, the year period -- there's been a lot of discussion about where the idea of finishing this in a year comes from. It comes from Kim Jong-un. That if they make a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons, they can do it within a year. We are waiting to see evidence that in fact that strategic decision has been made. WALLACE: Have you seen evidence of that strategic -- BOLTON: Unfortunately, I can't talk about intelligence whether it's leaked into the news media or not. I'll just say the president is doing everything he can beginning with the film that he showed to Kim Jong-un in Singapore about what the future can be if North Korea denuclearizes. He's doing the best salesman job he can on that point. WALLACE: We're still a long way away from building condos on beaches in North Korea. I have one last question, I've got a minute. BOLTON: I don't want a condo on a beach in North Korea under any circumstances. (LAUGHTER) WALLACE: That makes two of us. I got one minute left. Remember your training here in TV. We seem to be starting an escalating trade war with China. I want to put these up on the screen. We've imposed or scheduled tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. They have retaliated. Now, we are talking about 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese exports and they are threatening tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. products. Here's White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER: The president is impatient, you know? So, he has said to our team take a look, take a look at raising the tariff on the last 200 from 10 to 25. Take a look. (INAUDIBLE) He's impatient. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: How far is President Trump prepared to go here in his standoff with China, and if Chinese President Xi doesn't blink, doesn't back down, how long is this -- could this go on? BOLTON: Well, I think as Larry is saying, don't underestimate President Trump's resolve here. And the reason he's so resolved is that for decades, China has been the principal malefactor trying to use free trade aspiration most of the rest of the world has, to pursue mercantilist goals. It steals American and European intellectual property. It engages -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: How far are you prepared to take this? BOLTON: Far enough to get China to change its behavior and they need to understand that. WALLACE: And if they don't change their behavior? BOLTON: I think the pressure will continue. I think the president has made that very clear. WALLACE: Ambassador Bolton, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you, sir. BOLTON: Glad to be with you. WALLACE: When we come back, Senator Marco Rubio joins us exclusively to talk about his push to hit Russia if they meddle in our midterms, as well as his plan for paid family leave. And a little later, should blueprints to make a plastic gun in your own home be available online? The debate over these homemade firearms and free speech, that's all coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: President Trump's off-the-cuff statements about Russia, North Korea and Iran stand in contrast to the rest of his administration and much of the Republican Party. We want to discuss that with Senator Marco Rubio, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees. Senator, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\" SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: Thank you. Thanks for having me back. WALLACE: You are trying to get the Senate to pass what you call the DETER Act, which would invoke automatic sanctions against Russia or any country that interferes with U.S. elections. Here's what some top intel officials of the Trump administration said this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day. DAN COATS, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: It's pervasive, is ongoing with the intent to achieve their intent, and that is drive a wedge and undermine our democratic values. (END VIDEO CLIPS) WALLACE: Senator, if you can get Congress to pass your legislation, given what we just heard there, should sanctions be imposed on Russia right now? RUBIO: Well, there's always calls for sanctions against Vladimir Putin's government because of their consistent and ongoing violations of human rights and the likes, and there have already been sanctions in place. And to their credit, this administration has imposed tough sanctions already for what happened in 2016. But what we're hoping to do is deter future activity, in essence create a situation where Vladimir Putin has to weigh the cost and the benefits. We're going to show him what the costs are by detailing them ahead and then when he weighs the cost and the benefits of taking similar action in 2018, hopefully, he'll determine the costs are too high compared to the benefits. I can't guarantee that, but I can guarantee if we don't do something, he will interfere again in multiple ways because right now, the costs are too unpredictable and too low. WALLACE: Well, one interesting aspect of your legislation as that it would -- under the bill, it's the director of national intelligence, not the president who would certify that interference had taken place. Given all the president's talk about the Russia hoax, don't you trust him to call out Kremlin meddling? RUBIO: I do, especially if it happens in 2018. I think -- and that's part of the bill that we'll probably have to rework in some way. There's some concern about it because we want to pass a bill. And so, our -- the important thing we want to do is create an automatic way for sanctions to kick in. Now, there probably is going to have to be an addition of a presidential waiver like all sanctions bill have and the like. The DNI will still play a key role. That's the way we crafted it, but I know my -- the partner I'm working with on this, Senator Van Hollen, a Democrat, and I are willing to make reasonable changes to the bill that allows us to pass it and that's probably one of those that we heard a little bit of pushback on. We want to get something done and we are willing to do whatever it takes to pass a law that has real sanctions that will deter but at the same time can pass the House, pass the Senate and will be signed into law by the White House. WALLACE: President Trump this week tweeted this about the Russia investigation. I want to put it up on the screen. Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further. Afterwards, you said that special counsel Robert Mueller should be allowed to finish his work and all the truth should come out. In pursuit of that truth, should President Trump sit down with a special counsel to answer any questions about Russian collusion, about obstruction of justice? And what if he refuses in a special counsel gets a subpoena? RUBIO: Well, the second question is really for the president's lawyers. I'm not in a position to give legal advice to the president about what the right thing to do or not do in those circumstances. But let me talk about the first part of it and that is, the president -- look, this is no mystery, OK? He believed strongly, he says he knows for a fact, obviously, that he did not collude with the Russians, and he thinks this investigation that Mueller is conducting is solely about collusion, and that's how he feels very strongly about that. My position based on everything I know about this case is the following: I believe it's in the best interest of the president and of the United States of America and the American people for that investigation to run the course for all the truth to come out, and for -- I think it's the best thing that could happen for him, and I think it's the best thing that could happen for the country. Obviously, he is annoyed by that investigation continuing to go on because it's about him, and he believes and has said repeatedly and emphatically that he did not collude with the Russians. I'm limited to what I can say because the Senate is still doing our investigation but I am comfortable in saying this, if there was evidence, strong evidence of collusion, I guarantee it would have been leaked by now, but let's wait for the process to play itself out and I think that's what should happen. Mueller should continue. He should finish his work and the truth should come out, and I think that's in the best interest of everyone, including the president. WALLACE: But as part of that process and you say the best interest of the president and the country, should he sit down and answer all questions? RUBIO: Well, it's easy to say that from a political realm but that's not an interview, it's an interview with a law enforcement official, with a special prosecutor. And there are plenty of people who are innocent, whose lawyers would tell them do not sit down and answer questions from a prosecutor because there's all sorts of other problems involved with that. That's a decision for the president to make alongside with his attorney. It's my understanding from what I've read in the press that he wants to do it. It's attorneys who have questions about that, but there are plenty of innocent people whose lawyers tell them do not sit down with a prosecutor and answer questions. So, I don't want to prejudge this or somehow imply that by not sitting down, he's guilty of something. WALLACE: Let's turn to North Korea, do you think that the Kim regime is playing President Trump? Do you think they have any intention of giving up their nuclear and missile arsenal? RUBIO: Well, I'm about to tell you I'm wrong about, but I do not believe that he is ever going to give up his nuclear arsenal. What I do believe he will do is a series of unilateral concessions that do not undermine his capabilities in the long term. For example, I think he's more than willing to tear apart facilities that are no longer necessary for old muscles because he's got newer ones that work better. I believe he has undisclosed sites that he thinks he can shield from the world. I believe that he believes that even if he gets rid of some of the thing -- new enrichment capabilities he already has existing weapons and existing enriched capabilities that he can hide from the rest -- from the world. And every single time that he does one of these productions he is engendering goodwill internationally, which is ultimately his goal, to undermine international support for sanctions by arguing, look at all these things I'm doing, the Americans are not reciprocating and undermining sanctions at the U.N. and internationally. That's his goal in my opinion. WALLACE: Well, Senator -- RUBIO: And I hope I'm wrong. WALLACE: Well, Senator, let me ask you about that because it appears to be working. We understand that North Korea is violating the sanctions by doing ship to ship transfers. We now hear that Russia is doing business with North Korea, that they are bringing thousands of more guest workers into the country or in effect slaves who send money back to the regime. I mean, isn't Kim succeeding in lowering the temperature, breaking apart the alliance of sanctions and President Trump is being played? RUBIO: Well, neither one of those two things are new. The laborers to Russia has been going on the whole time. The ship to ship transfer is the only way they've been able to evade. I think what we need to be very careful about is undermining, for example, any split between us and South Korea. They're going to try to exploit it. I think the Chinese are trying to drag this out. The Chinese would love for this to be a step-by-step process that drags out. I think their biggest concern initially was that we would cut a deal with them directly. I don't know if the president is being played. I think he's hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. The sanctions remained in place. We haven't changed a single sanction on North Korea. I think what they need to be more cautious about is we need to continue to engage our partners around the world so that they are fully aware of what's actually happening in North Korea and what isn't happening, what's real and what isn't real. That's what I'd be very cautious about. I don't have any concerns about anything they've done so far. WALLACE: I want to ask you about one of your other big issues and that is you have introduced legislation to create paid family leave. You would take the money that would go to the parents of newborn children from Social Security payments they would get later on. Democrats say, one, the benefit is too small, two, it shouldn't come out of retirement payments, and, third, they say that most people take family leave for illnesses, either their own or family members. They don't take it for childbirth. And, in fact, Ivanka Trump, who's a big supporter of paid family leave, said there's no chance this is going to happen in this Congress. RUBIO: Well, we got -- nothing is going to happen in this Congress other than the bills that are already stacked up and ready to go. This Congress ends in six months, five months, and we have elections in between. This is a big issue. It's a revolutionary idea and it's going to take time to pass. Now, here's what it does. It's very simple to understand. Number one, it's an option. You don't have to do this. Number two, the benefit is comparable to what you're going to get in the private sector in terms of paid family leave for the birth of a child. And number three, the concept is this, if you choose to take paid family leave, at least six weeks up to 12 weeks, you can take -- you can decide that some of your retirement benefits from your money, and Social Security, you can advance it and take it now instead of later. A portion of it. It's up to you. It's a choice you have. It's an option you have. For the 85 percent of Americans that today have no options at all other than to skip paychecks, how many people can afford to skip one paycheck, not to mention four or five or six after the birth of a child? WALLACE: Senator Rubio, thank you. Thanks for joining us. RUBIO: Thank you. WALLACE: Please come back, sir. RUBIO: We will. Thank you so much. WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump's escalating attacks on the media. The face-off with reporters gets even more heated. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president's threat to shut down the government before the midterm elections over funding for his border wall? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: Coming up, the latest battle over gun control. And this one's in 3-D. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ED MARKEY, D-MASS.: A 3-D printer cartridge has become as deadly as a gun cartridge. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: We'll talk with the man behind the push to publish gun blueprints online, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES: I'm a little torn myself. I would personally prefer before. But it -- whether it's before or after, we're either getting it or we're closing down government. We need border security! SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: It would be bad politics for the Republican Party to shut the government down. We'd get blamed. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Senator Lindsey Graham warning President Trump not to shut down the government over immigration issues ahead of the November midterms. And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove. Philippe Reines, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton. Susan Page of USA Today, and Jason Riley from The Wall Street Journal. Well, Karl, simple question, would shutting down the government over the wall and immigration issues helped or hurt Republicans in the midterms? KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hurt the Republicans. They're seen as being in charge of the government. And they've got the presidency, the Senate and the House. And if they can't get their act together, regardless of how strong the president describes the culprits as being the Democrats, it will hurt the Republicans. Remember one thing, the president's approval is 46-51 in the latest Fox poll. His approval in that poll on immigration is 43-55. He's worse in immigration among the Americans than his overall approval rating. WALLACE: So, don't push immigration? ROVE: Well, don't shut down the government over immigration. Shut down -- if you want to shut down the government, shut down the government over the economy, where he's actually seen as doing the right thing. But people don't believe, particularly when it comes to the wall, that it's -- that it's the right thing. The wall -- the wall is the -- the weakest border security is great. You'll notice he has stopped talking about the wall and he's talking about border security because even inside the White House they figured out the wall is not as popular as border security. WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of a possible shutdown we got this on Twitter from Independent02. If POTUS, the president, shutdown the government, how is he going to get his SCOTUS, Supreme Court, picked confirmed? And should the Republicans be blamed if POTUS does this? Philippe, how do you answer Independent02? PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON SENIOR ADVISER: Well, as my insider knowledge of the GOP, I mean I think this is another example of the president posing a bigger problem to his own party than the Democrats, who most of the time are just innocent bystanders to this. I don't know what he gets out of it, but I don't think he cares what he gets out of it. You have -- I don't think he really cares what happens in November of 2018. WALLACE: Well, come on. Wait, wait, wait, of course he does. I mean he -- REINES: I don't think he does, frankly. WALLACE: He knows what happens to his agenda if he loses the House. REINES: I think he knows that he gets to run against the House in 2020. I think he does not fear impeachment. It won't be a problem. I don't think he buys into it as much as maybe Karl does or the -- his Republican colleagues in Congress do. WALLACE: All right, I want to switch subjects. I know you want to weigh in on this but I'm going to switch subjects and turn to the presidents bashing in the media. I know it's always all about us, but it seemed to hit critical mass this week. I -- I -- you just heard my conversation with Ambassador Bolton in which the president says the fake media can cause wars, they're sick, divisive. We also had this fascinating contradiction this week between Ivanka Trump, who spoke about the fake media and then President Trump just hours later. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IVANKA TRUMP: I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns, and -- and gripe, especially when they're sort of feel targeted. But, no, I do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people. TRUMP: They can make anything bad because they are the fake, fake, disgusting news. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: And, Susan, there was also that moment in the White House Briefing Room this week where CNN reporter Jim Acosta, some will say that he was grandstanding, I kind of agree with that, but he challenged Sarah Sanders, the press spokeswoman, to declare that the press, the media are not the enemy of the people, and she refused. SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY: You know, I care more about what the president says then I care about what the press secretary says. And for the -- you know, Mr. Bolton, in your interview, said that an adversarial relationship with the White House is -- is common with the press. And having covered six White Houses, that is true. No White House really likes the press. But the rhetoric that the president is using, enemy of the people, this is a phrase from Stalin, is chilling and unprecedented in modern times. It does not recognize the role that the founders saw for a free and vigorous press to be -- to hold officials accountable and to be the friend of the American people. And I think it's -- I think it's enormously serious. WALLACE: And, Jason, I -- I -- let me just ask you a question. You had U.N. officials who were in charge of freedom of expression around the world this week say that these kinds of comments -- and, again, I don't think we're talking about criticism of the media. We're talking about fake news, starting wars, enemy of the people -- that undermines the role of a free press around the world to hold governments accountable. JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Ivanka Trump is right. The press is not the enemy of the people. And -- and -- and you're right that this -- some of this -- what -- what this rhetoric coming out of the White House is unprecedented. But so is some of the behavior of the media these days. Media that is supposed to be covering this White House objectively and is behaving much more like political activists than they are like objective journalists. This too, I think, has reached a new low in terms of the press behavior. And when that happens, I do believe that the press deserves to be called out here. The press should not be the story. The story should be what -- making sure that the voters are informed. And -- and too often these days, the press is making themselves the story. WALLACE: But the president -- wait, wait, but the president does make -- the president does -- well, wait a minute, the president makes them a story. RILEY: And that's this adversarial relationship that I think all administrations have. The problem here is that the press, too often, takes the bait and -- and we get eventually (ph) cycles -- WALLACE: Well, I agree with that. RILEY: And this is what we end up talking about. And the press loves -- the press loves talking about the press. PAGE: That is -- that is incorrect. I -- as a reporter, I do not love talking about the press. I wish the press could be in a more traditional role here. I think what is happening -- there are certainly things to criticize about the press. There's no question about that. We ought to be held accountable for our errors. But I think what the president is doing is undermining faith in the institutions that stand to challenge him, and that would include the press and the (INAUDIBLE). RILEY (ph): I think the media -- WALLACE: Let me -- wait, let me -- let me bring in Karl, because as a White House official, you were, I'm sure, you felt the victim of unfair coverage. Where's the line between legitimately criticizing the media for things that, as Jason points out, we do wrong, whether it's biased reporting and accurate reporting, and what the president is doing right now? ROVE: Look, any White House has the right, if it disagrees with coverage, to be specific and precise in criticizing that coverage. If the wall -- if \"The New York Times\" has a bad story about the Trump administration, I don't -- I think the administration ought to say, we think this is what's wrong. But, look, the veracity of these generalized slurs, if you will, against the press, and the frequency of them is disturbing to me. I watched the speech and there was -- I lost track about 18 or 19 times that the president went after the press. And every time he did, that crowd roared its approval. But that crowd represents the hard-core Trump base. This does not help him with his bigger problem. Back to the -- the Fox poll, 46-51 approve. Twenty-eight percent strongly approve. Those were the people who were screaming their cheers when he said enemy of the people. But 41 percent strongly disapprove. That's why the president's numbers are so -- he is enraging the opposition was simply reinforcing a much smaller base. WALLACE: I -- you were talking before about how maybe losing the midterms would be good, would be smart politics, or at least not caring. Is bashing the press smart politics for this president? REINES: Absolutely. It's working for him. But that doesn't mean it's right. And I think it's part of a larger problem, that it's part of a war on the truth. And to be honest with you, you know, I've been on the other side of this. I think you know that and Susan probably knows that. We -- WALLACE: Again, we should point out, you worked for Hillary Clinton. REINES: I did. And, you know, the media is not always perfect. But, you know what, you get on the phone, you talk about it. You don't call them the enemy of the people. My -- my beef now is, the media has to just accept that this is not normal behavior and they have to realize that they are in combat and they have to start acting differently. They have to stop broadcasting the daily press briefings live, get rid of the soap opera aspect of it, the grandstanding. They have to use the word lie when he lies, et cetera. WALLACE: Well, I disagree with that. Thank you, panel, see you next Sunday. When we come back, the debate over 3-D printed guns. Cody Wilson wants Americans to have the information to make guns in the privacy of their own homes. He joins us next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: He's been called one of the most dangerous people in the world for his push to put blueprints online to make guns on 3-D printers. And now Cody Wilson is at the center of a legal battle over making that information available to everyone on the Internet. Mr. Wilson, director of Defense Distributed, joins us now from Austin, Texas. So, simple question, why on earth do you think putting these blueprints for plastic guns online is a good idea? CODY WILSON, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED: Hey, Chris. So, I've put the blueprints for all types of guns. All technical plans. All data. All blueprints, past and present. I put them all online, and that's the right that I've secured. It's not like I'm somehow only fascinated by the idea of a printable gun. That was just a mere technical demonstration of a much wider possibility of the digital production of firearms, which is in no way precluded by current law. WALLACE: But as I understand it, you say this is your First Amendment right. You're talking about information that you're putting online, not what happens after people receive that information. But I don't have to tell you that the First Amendment is not an absolute right. You're not allowed to cry fire in a crowded theater. Courts have -- have exercised prior restraint to stop people from publishing troop movements in the time of war. It's not an absolute right, Cody. WILSON: So, Chris, as the hardest newsman in the game, I'd expect you to not propagate that ignorance, right? Fire in a crowded theater has not been good law for over 40 years. That case was replaced. The standard is, even the most inflammatory speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it produces immanently unlawful action, right, or direct incitement or is likely to produce imminent harm and -- I mean these -- these are not the standards. Like, we need to correct the people's ignorance here. Fire in a crowded theater is a pseudo-profundity, OK? The First Amendment, without questions, protects this kind of data, lawfully produced. It's got a cognizant government authority. It's directly related to another protected right of the people, which is their Second Amendment. So speech about another amendment is even more protected than the use of like -- WALLACE: Well, well, wait, wait, first of all, we don't know whether it's protected, because, in fact, a judge issued a temporary restraining order. There's going to be a court hearing about this, this week. And I know you're going to -- you're going to be pursuing this. Here you talk about speech that -- that incites or creates the opportunity for illegal action. Here's the problem with putting these blueprints about plastic guns on the Internet. It allows people to create -- to make guns that are untraceable. There's no serial number. It allows them to make guns that are undetectable. They're all plastic. They could get through a metal detector. It also allows people who would be prohibited from having guns, whether it's someone with a history of mental illness, a felon, domestic abuse or even a terrorist, it allows them to make guns. Take a look at -- at -- at Democratic Senator Ed Markey. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARKEY: These downloadable firearms are available even to those who could not pass a background check. It's the ultimate gun loophole. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: The NRA has supported the law that makes these guns, undetectable firearms, illegal for 30 years. WILSON: So, Chris, I don't think Ed Markey knew you could legally make a gun in the country until last week. And I think that's part of like what's inflammatory to -- at least the Democratic establishment. This is also their discovery that it's been legal in this country since its founding to make a gun for yourself. Well, I'm sorry that you just found that out, OK, but you should have -- you should have made a law, right? You're Congress, make a law. Make it illegal to make guns in this country. I'd like to see that. WALLACE: But -- but -- but they did made an Undetectable Firearms Act which passed 30 years ago, Cody. WILSON: Right. And -- and, look, it's legal to make a gun if you include all requisite amount of metal in it. And, Chris, like this is why I'm not in jail today, right, my printable guns have the amount of metal in it. You know, there are security norms. I respect the norms. Of course, maybe even that type of law ultimately couldn't survive Second Amendment scrutiny. But I'm not here to argue for -- for -- or against our security norms. I'm literally here to argue that what I won in court over five years in the western district of Texas was the right -- and not just singularly, but all Americans have the right to share data for making firearms on the Internet. This is not controversial. The progressive case, the H-bomb nuclear -- nuclear plans, these are all protected by the First Amendment. I'm sorry that some people are just waking up to the idea that the First Amendment protects scientific inquiry that doesn't advantage, what, the gun control movement? WALLACE: You first put blueprints online in 2013 and it was downloaded almost 100,000 times before you were stopped by the government. Since you put the blueprint again, after a settlement with the federal government, online, it was downloaded more than 20,000 times. To us -- is this -- is the genie already out of the bottle? Is this information already out there and we're arguing about something that's already happened? WILSON: Frankly, Chris, that's -- that's the case. When these attorneys general came into Washington, and they, your honor, he's going to release all this stuff August 1. Well, look, in one sense I released it five years ago. In another sense, I released it July 27th. I can't make a judge read a brief, OK, but these are APA claims. These aren't gun control act claims. These -- these attorneys general have no standing. The judge can't even review the decision that the State Department made. So I'm just sitting here watching all these gun files already online and people arguing about what reality is when we both know that guns are now downloadable and they have been repeatedly demonstrated to be. WALLACE: To a certain degree I think you're protecting -- you're saying, hey, I'm just making the information available. I'm not responsible for what people do once they get the information. But the fact is, Cody, there are real-world consequences here. What if somebody takes your information, makes a gun and then goes out and kills someone, potentially, God forbid, kills member of your family, would there be -- do you bear any responsibility? Do you feel -- would you feel any remorse? WILSON: So I credit the question as like an honest question. I -- I credit your question is good faith, right? But I literally believe in the Second Amendment to the point of that it's all right and it should be expected that there will be social costs for protecting a right like this. Why is the people's right to keep and bear arms on the Bill of Rights? Why is it even protected? Because we know that there are downsides and that there are consequences to allowing free people to own the means of self-defense. I mean of course we should expect and have a mature attitude that bad things can happen. WALLACE: But the government has made decisions that, for the right -- best of society, certain people should be prevented from having guns, and that there should be -- it should be easier to trace and easier to detect. You're going around all of that, Cody. WILSON: Oh, I disagree. With respect, I disagree. The government has regulated commercial manufacture of arms and the arms and transfer and interstate commerce, but the government has never regulated the production of firearms that you're allowed to own. An American, can to this day, right now, make a gun and there's no requirement to put a serial number on it. Again, I'm sorry that a bunch of politicians woke up to the reality of this just last week, but this is the way it's always been. WALLACE: Cody -- Cody Wilson, thank you. Thanks for talking with us. WILSON: A pleasure. WALLACE: Up next our Power Player of the Week. The Army's art collection puts powerful Nazi propaganda from World War II under lock and key. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: One of the highlights of this job is to get to see historical treasure trove's that aren't open to the public. As we told you in February, the Army opened its doors to show us one of its explosive collections. Here is our Power Player of the Week: (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHARLES BOWERY, U.S. ARMY CENTER FOR MILITARY HISTORY: They used it to enhance, in their view, sort of the sanctity of the Nazi way of life. WALLACE: Charles Bowery is the chief of Army history. And we met at a huge warehouse at Fort Belvoir outside Washington. It holds thousands of pieces of military art and artifacts. The battle standard of an African-American regiment in the Civil War. A Taliban motorcycle. Norman Rockwell illustrations from World War II. WALLACE (on camera): Do you ever feel like you're in that huge warehouse at the end of Indiana Jones? BOWERY: We make that joke all the time. WALLACE (voice over): But we were there to see the Army's stash of Nazi propaganda, 586 pieces seized during Hitler's fall and sent back to the U.S. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden. The luxurious mountain residence. WALLACE: The man in charge of the operation, Gordon Bilky (ph), who was appointed by President Roosevelt. WALLACE (on camera): Why was it so important to remove this art from Germany postwar? BOWERY: They believed that the presence of these pieces in German society could be essentially a powder keg that could kick off additional incidents of the rise of Nazism. WALLACE (on camera): Pieces like this 1937 painting, \"In the Beginning Was the Word.\" BOWERY: The piece is very intentionally titled to mirror the first verse of the book of John in the Bible, and it very clearly equates Adolf Hitler with John the Baptist. WALLACE (on camera): It's an almost godlike figure and his disciples. BOWERY: That's correct. WALLACE (voice over): The Army seized another work called \"The standard Bearer.\" BOWERY: It portrays Adolf Hitler as a medieval night. He's carrying a Nazi flag. He's mounted on a horse. And he is prepared to lead his people into battle. WALLACE (on camera): Now what is the hole there? BOWERY: An American soldier up his rifle bayonet and he punched through the eye of Hitler as a direct message. WALLACE (voice over): The Army found this huge bust of Hitler in the eagles nest. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where the Nazi furor held meetings of triumph in the mountains of Bavaria. WALLACE: A grand hall he used for key meetings. BOWERY: The monumental scale of it conveys as personal power and the fact that this was a cult of personality that he led through individual magnetism. WALLACE: Perhaps most fascinating are these watercolors painted by Hitler, an aspiring art student and then a soldier in World War I, long before his rise to power. BOWERY: One of the comments on his early evaluations of his work was that while he was pretty good at depicting buildings and structures, he was not so good at depicting human life. WALLACE: But chances are you will never get to see any of these works in person. The Army keeps them locked up in its mammoth storage facility. WALLACE (on camera): Is their concern that some of these pieces could be used as a rallying point for Neo-Nazis here in this country? BOWERY: That's the heart of the tight control that we maintain over the collection. WALLACE: It could be potentially dangerous? BOWERY: The term I like to use is powerful. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: The Army is building a national museum near Fort Belvoir to open in 2020 that will house many of the military artifacts now in that huge warehouse. But don't expect to see any of the Nazi propaganda that glorifies a tyrant. And that's it for today.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Elko, Nev. (AP Photo/Alex Goodlett) Welcome to FOX News First. Not signed up yet? Click here. Developing now, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018 THE LEAD STORY - \"BLUE WAVE\" BUST? - \u00a0A new national poll a few weeks before the midterm elections shows the chances of a \"blue wave\" are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats ... The NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows 48 percent of registered voters would prefer having the Democrats in control of Congress, compared to 41 percent supporting the GOP. That 7-point gap has narrowed from the 12-point gap the Democrats had in September. The poll also showed President Trump\u2019s approval ratings at their highest yet: 47 percent. The poll showed 49 percent disapprove. \u201cThe current data shows that the Democratic advantage has ebbed but still with a large advantage. And the GOP shows some life,\u201d Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who conducted the poll alongside Republican pollster Bill McInturff and Hart Research Associates, told the Wall Street Journal. Why are Democrats apparently losing ground? Troubled candidates and distractions may play a role. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., on Sunday evening, had to fend off allegations of domestic abuse during his debate against his GOP rival for state attorney general. In her debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had to defend taking a DNA test in an attempt to prove her Native American heritage. Warren said that she took the DNA test in an effort to rebuild \"trust in the government\" through transparency. Critics remain dubious about Warren's Native American heritage and the jury is out of whether the Massachusetts senator rebuilt any trust. ICYMI: FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE - SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER GRILLED ON ACTIVIST'S DEATH: Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister sent his condolences on Sunday to the family of Jamal Khashoggi but offered no new information on how - or why - the Saudi activist was killed in the country\u2019s consulate in Turkey almost three weeks ago ... Speaking during an exclusive interview with FOX News\u2019 Bret Baier, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir said that the country is currently investigating Khashoggi\u2019s death and that the 18 people implicated in his slaying would be punished appropriately. He said Khashoggi was killed by operatives who went \"rogue.\" \"This was an operation that was a rogue operation,\" he said. \"This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had. \u00a0They made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it.\" Al-Jubeir added that none of those involved in Khashoggi\u2019s death had close ties to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Al-Jubeir noted that the investigation was still in its early stages and said that Saudi officials currently don\u2019t know the exact cause of Khashoggi\u2019s death or where his remains are. Still, critics suspect Saudi authorities are trying to covering up the circumstances of Kashoggi's killing to shield the powerful crown prince. President Trump says he wants to wait for the outcome of the Saudi investigation. Meanwhile, Turkey said it will announce details of its own investigation on Tuesday. Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, reportedly has been placed under Turkish police protection. CARAVAN CAMPAIGN ISSUE: A growing caravan of Honduran migrants streamed through southern Mexico on Sunday heading toward the United States, after making an end-run around Mexican agents who briefly blocked them at the Guatemalan border ... They received help at every turn from sympathetic Mexicans who offered food, water and clothing. Hundreds of locals driving pickups, vans and cargo trucks stopped to let them clamber aboard. The caravan of Central American migrants has anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people \u2014 mainly from Honduras \u2014 according to estimates. President Trump tweeted on Sunday that border security officials continued their \"full efforts ... to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens\" attempting to travel to the U.S. southern border via a large migrant caravan \u2014 while also describing such caravans as \"a disgrace to the Democrat Party.\" GROWING TENSION WITH RUSSIA (WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ALLEGED COLLUSION?): National Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials in Moscow Monday in the first of two days of talks ... The talks could be tense as they come after President Trump announced the U.S. will pull out of a decades-old bilateral nuclear agreement that he said Russia had been \"violating for many years.\" Top Russian officials called the president's move a \"very dangerous\" provocation that would lead to \"full chaos.\" COMING IN 2020: HILLARY-TRUMP 2 - Will there be a presidential election rematch between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump? Michael Goodwin, New York Post columnist and FOX News contributor, predicts it is inevitable ... The list of potential Democratic candidates to oppose President Trump is growing, but none are \"compelling.\" That's why Clinton has never truly faded out of the spotlight. \"Which is why Clinton, despite her enormous flaws and two presidential defeats, can\u2019t be ruled out as the party\u2019s best hope,\" Goodwin writes in his column on FOXNews.com. \"God knows she wants it more than anybody else. It\u2019s also why I have been saying for months that she was keeping her options open and might actually seek a rematch with Trump. And that was before she and Bill Clinton announced their six-month speaking tour.\" AS SEEN ON FOX NEWS WEEKEND 'A DANGEROUS TIME FOR AMERICANS' - \u00a0\"When you cross the border into these United States illegally, expect to be arrested.

            "article_content": "resident Trump and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California at the Capitol on Wednesday. (Associated Press) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has signaled his intent to introduce legislation this week that would\u00a0fully fund President Trump\u2019s\u00a0wall on along the nation's southern border. The legislation by McCarthy, who is looking to drum up support among the GOP's rank\u00a0and file as he eyes\u00a0House Speaker Paul Ryan's speakership, is expected to call for full wall\u00a0funding alongside other enforcement measures already approved in the House. \u201cFew things are more fundamental to a nation than a protected border,\u201d McCarthy tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cProud to introduce the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act.\u201d Congress has already funneled $1.6 billion to\u00a0construction as part of the omnibus spending bill for the 2018 fiscal year, but McCarthy\u2019s new bill would direct about $23.4 billion\u00a0toward building the wall, a signature issue for Trump. McCarthy\u2019s bill will also include measures dealing with sanctuary cities and criminal gangs, among other immigration-related issues, but it will not address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. It is unclear if this legislation will serve as the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, the annual measure with funds DHS. That\u2019s one of the seven appropriations packages not funded under the current \u201cContining Resolution\u201d which runs the government through December 7. It comes as Republican leaders in the House are gearing up for what they say will be a post-midterm election fight over the wall. \u201cWe intend on having a full-fledged discussion on how to complete our mission to secure the border and yes, we will have a fight about this,\u201d\u00a0Speaker\u00a0Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters on Monday. McCarthy, who is traveling to the border later this week, has positioned himself to fill Ryan\u2019s post as speaker\u00a0when the Wisconsin lawmaker vacates his seat in January, but he faces stiff competition from Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. If the House passes McCarthy\u2019s bill, it will have to make its way\u00a0through the Senate, where it will need 60 votes to avoid a filibuster hurdle before January. Otherwise,\u00a0it'll need to be voted on again by the next Congress in\u00a02019. Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump tells supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, that he will do everything in his power to stop political violence, slams media's 'constant, unfair coverage.' President Trump on Friday night condemned the media\u2019s coverage of his administration\u00a0as divisive to America. The comments, at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, came as the nation has been consumed by the topic of the deepening political divide, and just hours after a suspect was arrested in Florida over\u00a0mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats\u00a0and Trump\u00a0critics. That suspect,\u00a056-year-old-Cesar Sayoc, appeared to be a passionate advocate for Trump on his social media accounts, frequently posting conspiracy theories and criticisms against Democrats and liberal celebrities. \"As you know, the suspect has been captured \u2013 great job \u2013 and is now in federal custody,\" Trump said. \"This is finding, truly, a needle in a haystack, when you think about it. Political violence must never, ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it. \"Everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction,\" he continued. But he also stressed that \"the media has a major role to play whether they want to or not.\" \"The media\u2019s constant, unfair coverage, deep hostility and negative attacks only serve to drive people apart and undermine healthy debate,\" he said. Republicans, Trump said, did not play political games after a Bernie Sanders supporter shot at GOP congressmen in 2017, including Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who was badly injured in the attack. \"That would have been wrong,\" he said. \"It would have been the wrong thing to do.\" \"Yet the media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people,\" Trump continued. \"Ninety-four\u00a0 percent of the press I get is negative, even when I do something wonderful.\" \"We want honest coverage from the media,\" he said. \"That\u2019s all we want.\" The president was in the state to make a campaign push for Rep. Ted Budd and GOP candidate Mark Harris. Budd is a first-term congressman facing Democrat Kathy Manning. Harris, meanwhile, upset Rep. Robert Pittenger in a May GOP primary and faces Democrat Dan McCready. \"Get 'em to Washington please, and fast,\" Trump said after Budd and Harris spoke at the rally. \"I'm here tonight because we can't take any chances. Get out and vote.\" \"This is one of the most important elections of our lifetime,\" Trump said. \"A vote for Democrats is a vote for open borders and a vote for tax hikes.\" \"This will be an election of common sense,\" he argued. \"We need borders. We need a great military. We want lower taxes. It's not conservative or liberal. It's common sense.\" The mail bomb saga, with its focus on packages sent to outspoken Trump critics, has been one of the major news events highlighting what many see as a growing polarization in America. At the same time, there have been repeated instances in which Trump-aligned GOP lawmakers and members of the administration have faced heckling\u00a0and scorn while venturing out in public for things like dinner at a restaurant. And some Democratic leaders have drawn fire for appearing to encourage such hostile engagement. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But even after October 17th, a Canadian citizen who drives from Vancouver to Seattle may be asked by a border agent if they have smoked pot before, and if they say yes, they could get banned from entry to the U.S. for life, even though pot is legal in Washington state. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has long sought to keep those who consume the substance out of the country. CANADA TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA AFTER LANDMARK SENATE VOTE Agents screening foreign nationals attempting to enter the U.S. are therefore allowed to deem a foreigner inadmissible to the United States if they admit to having consumed marijuana in the past.\u00a0 Asking people about their drug use is entirely at the discretion of a border agent, and if someone lies or is unwilling to answer, agents are allowed to search a person\u2019s belongings for evidence of past drug use, including their cell phone. Landmark bill paves the way for recreational cannabis to be grown, bought and sold. The assumption by the Canadian legal community had been that this border policy would come to an end following legalization. However, the U.S. government confirmed earlier this month that the policy will continue to apply to Canadians crossing into the U.S. after October 17th, and CBP has said that changes in a foreign country\u2019s laws won\u2019t impact their practices at home. \u201cThis is U.S. law, and under U.S. federal law, marijuana remains illegal\u201d, a spokesperson from CBP told Fox News. MARIJUANA STOCK BACKED BY PETER THIEL SURGES ON US IMPORT APPROVAL Canada\u2019s ministries of Justice and Public Safety, which are jointly overseeing the process of marijuana legalization, have said they are continuing to work closely with the U.S. government to ensure that there is as little disruption for Canadians travelling to the U.S. as possible once marijuana is legalized next month. CANADA STRUGGLING WITH ILLEGAL BORDER 'CRISIS' OF ITS OWN AHEAD OF CRUCIAL ELECTIONS However, a spokesperson from Public Safety Canada reached by Fox News did not express optimism that the current situation at the border would change significantly soon. \u201cThe United States has the sovereign jurisdiction to deal with people crossing the border into their country, just as we have the same powers for those entering into Canada,\u201d the spokesperson said. Getty (CBP confirmed to Fox News that anyone who works in the marijuana industry could be subject to a ban from entry to the U.S., whether they work for a government-run pot dispensary or one in the private sector) However, they emphasized that \u201cdespite one-in-eight Canadians using cannabis today, 400,000 people move between our two countries every day almost entirely without incident.\u201d The Canadian government has long urged its citizens not to lie if a U.S. border agent asks about their pot use. If an agent is able to find evidence from someone who claims they have not smoked pot before that indicates otherwise, they can still be banned from entry to the U.S. anyway \u2014 in this case, for lying to a customs officer. Even Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has long been open about his past use of marijuana, said this month that he would never lie to a U.S. border agent if he was asked if he had used cannabis. Concerns have also been raised about how this policy will impact employees of marijuana stores in Canada, which will \u2014 in many provinces \u2014 be run by the government.\u00a0 Even if someone who works for the stores doesn\u2019t consume marijuana themselves, a U.S. customs officer could find legal grounds to ban them from entry to America. At least one American lawyer has argued that this could even apply to the premier - the Canadian equivalent of a governor - of a province, because of government-owned dispensaries in places including British Columbia and Qu\u00e9bec. CBP confirmed to Fox News that anyone who works in the marijuana industry could be subject to a ban from entry to the U.S., whether they work for a government-run pot dispensary or one in the private sector. \u201cWorking in or facilitating the proliferation of the marijuana industry in Canada, or U.S. states where it is deemed legal, may affect a foreign national\u2019s admissibility to the United States\u201d, a spokesperson said. The spokesperson did not directly respond when asked by Fox News if elected officials in governments that run their own dispensary chains would be exempt from this policy. In an interview with a Vancouver radio station last month, lawyer Len Saunders called that potential detail \u201cthe worst-case scenario\u201d for Canadian provincial governments. Despite\u00a0the ban on pot smokers and pot sellers, the U.S. government seems to have less\u00a0of a problem with actual pot entering the U.S. from Canada. Weed imports\u00a0from British Columbia-based Tilray Inc. received\u00a0the okay from the D.E.A. several days ago, for use in a study\u00a0on medical cannabis being conducted by University of California San Diego. Canadians who end up getting hit with a lifetime ban at the border can apply for a waiver from CBP that will allow them to come to America.\u00a0 Once they apply for it \u2014 at a cost of over $500, there\u2019s no guarantee that waiver will be approved. Meanwhile, American expatriates living in Canada, as well as American tourists returning home from a trip to Canada, won\u2019t have to worry about being locked out of their home country if they smoked legal pot north of the border: CBP\u2019s policy only applies to foreign nationals.",

            "article_content": "Kristin Fisher reports on the special election for Ohio's 12th congressional district between Troy Balderson and Danny O'Connor. Republicans and President Trump faced a series of major tests on Tuesday, as voters in five states headed to the polls in races that Democrats hoped would serve as an energizing prelude to a liberal takeover of Congress in November. Kansas, Ohio, Missouri, Michigan and Washington are the battlegrounds, and in the run-up to Tuesday, they have seen no shortage of drama -- ranging from insurgent socialist-backed candidates to last-minute, all-in presidential endorsements and attention-getting ads featuring a Jeep equipped with a replica machine gun. Perhaps the most-watched contest is in Ohio, where a special election is being held to determine who will replace retired Rep. Pat Tiberi. Republicans have controlled the 12th Congressional District for more than 35 years, but polls have shown the two candidates in the race, upstart Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, 31, and two-term Republican State Senator Troy Balderson, 57, in an effective tie. Regardless of who wins on Tuesday to fill Tiberi's seat, the two candidates will square off again in November's general election. Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, left, is trying to become the first Muslim governor in the state. (AP) Still, the race is widely seen as a\u00a0bellwether for the upcoming midterms; Trump carried the district by double-digits in 2016. In an effort to tap into that enthusiasm, Trump shook up the Ohio contest by staging a freewheeling rally in suburban Columbus on Saturday night. In a sweltering auditorium, Trump said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., \"controls Danny O\u2019Connor, whoever the hell that is.\" Trump renewed that line of attack on Twitter as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday, saying O'Connor is \"weak on Crime\" and promising that Balderson would be a \"great Congressman.\" Trump hoped to have a similar 11th-hour effect in Kansas, where less than 24 hours before polls opened, he stunned the party establishment by endorsing Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who had supported the president and worked with him closely. The endorsement was a major blow to Gov. Jeff Colyer, who had the backing of the National Rifle Association and Kansas political legend Bob Dole. It also alarmed some Republicans, who fear that Kobach's hard-line conservative views will alienate voters in the general election and give Democrats an opening. Trump-endorsed Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach frequently drove this Jeep on the campaign trail. (Kobach campaign on Facebook) WATCH: WHY IS KOBACH SO CONTROVERSIAL IN KANSAS? Like Trump, Kobach promises a direct rhetorical style, telling voters repeatedly: \"I don't back down. I double down.\" His use of a Jeep with a replica gun mounted on top (and an American flag paint scheme) during campaign stops this summer prompted backlash. Kobach called his critics \"snowflakes\" and continued to use the Jeep. Kobach told Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" on Tuesday that he is an \"insurgent conservative\" primarily concerned with cutting taxes and stopping illegal immigration. He added that Trump's endorsement \"helps a great deal.\" Other races on Tuesday will set the stage for potentially key races in November that could determine which party controls Congress. In Washington, Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, is running for her fourth term in the U.S. Senate \u2014 but not without a fight from nearly 30 challengers. That group includes: 13 Republicans, four Democrats, five independents and one Libertarian, among others. WILL WASHINGTON CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE PULL OFF AN OCASIO-CORTEZ STYLE UPSET? Former Washington GOP chairwoman Susan Hutchison has emerged as the leading Republican contender to take on Cantwell. Although\u00a0Fox News rates\u00a0the Senate race as likely to break Democratic, Hutchison told The Seattle Times, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have this crowded ballot if Maria Cantwell wasn\u2019t vulnerable.\u201d Also in Washington,\u00a030-year-old Sarah Smith \u2013 the progressive challenger to Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith in Tuesday's 9th\u00a0Congressional District primary -- is hoping to replicate the unexpected success of 28-year-old socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Smith has frequently compared herself to Cortez on the campaign trail, and her platform shares many similarities to Cortez's. Ohio congressional candidate Troy Balderson campaigned Tuesday as the GOP hopes to hold onto the hotly contested 12th Congressional District. (AP) In Missouri,\u00a0 Republicans are set to pick their candidate to take on Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, in the fall. McCaskill has represented Missouri in the Senate since 2007, but Fox News has her bid for re-election rated\u00a0as a toss-up. Out of a crowded field of Republican candidates, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley has emerged as a favorite, even securing\u00a0Trump\u2019s endorsement\u00a0months before the primary election. And in Michigan, two Republicans are hoping to secure the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat. African-American business executive and Iraq War pilot John E. James, who has Trump's endorsement, is taking on Sandy Pensler, a detergent manufacturer. The state is also home to an electric gubernatorial showdown, as both parties vie to replace term-limited\u00a0Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican.\u00a0Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, who was endorsed by Trump, is up against Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, state Sen. Pat Colbeck and Dr. Jim Hines for the GOP nod. For the Democrats, Abdul El-Sayed, Shri Thanedar and Gretchen Whitmer are battling for the nomination. Whitmer, a former county prosecutor and member of the state legislature, has emerged as the establishment favorite. El-Sayed, on the other hand, has campaigned as a more progressive choice with Sen. Bernie Sanders and\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0both\u00a0lending their support\u00a0to the man hoping to become\u00a0Michigan\u2019s first Muslim governor.

            "article_content": "148 federal judicial vacancies, while 76 are pending nominations. Doug McKelway reports. It is said there are decades where nothing happens. And there are weeks where decades happen. Congress has a version of this. It\u2019s a month called \u201cAugust.\u201d Crazy congressional things happen in August. This is ironic because, well, Congress is supposed to be on recess in August. But the biggest question buzzing around Capitol Hill now is whether the Senate will cancel or shorten that recess \u2013 and meet anyway. President Trump initiated this year\u2019s fretting over a canceled recess with a tweet: \u201cThe Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!\u201d A group of GOP senators then launched an effort to stay through the summer\u2019s hottest stretch. \u201cIt is time to drain the swamp. We can help do that by keeping the pumps running in August,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont. Daines and others want the Senate to stick around to wrap up spending bills and confirm Trump\u2019s nominees. Democrats may suggest there\u2019s an ulterior motive. Republicans hold a narrow, 51-49 edge in the Senate. Thirty-three seats are up this fall. A staggering 24 of them are held by Democrats compared with just nine for Republicans. Many Democrats facing re-election represent battleground or red states: Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Bob Casey, D-Pa., and others. Meantime, Republicans are defending conservative strongholds like Wyoming. The field is tilted toward the Republicans. It\u2019s a freak of political nature. But neither party has faced an electoral map this challenging since 1938. So, it\u2019s a great strategy for Republicans to tether Democrats to Washington and rob them of valuable campaign time at home. Meantime, GOP challengers can barnstorm those same states. There was a big push in the Senate last year to gut the August recess over nominations and the annual defense bill. But it didn\u2019t really work out. The House cut town. The Senate hung around for a few days in early August, knocking out a massive slate of 77 nominees in one fell swoop with no debate, and got out of Dodge. But things are different in an election year. Plus, voters are perpetually anguished about Congress \u201cnot getting anything done.\u201d Therefore, it looks great to remain in session. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was circumspect when asked about carbonizing the recess. \u201cI\u2019ll have more to say about the August break in the near future,\u201d the Kentucky Republican replied. Many senators fully expect the Senate to conduct business during at least a part of August -- even if it\u2019s a pantomime for optics or plays out like last summer: in for a few days and then gone. But what can the Senate really accomplish in August when it comes to the annual spending bills? A senior Senate Republican source says the Senate may remain in session to work out nominations, but not appropriations. Here\u2019s the problem: President Trump is irate over the $1.3 trillion spending bill he signed into law in March to avoid a government shutdown. \u201cI will never sign another bill like this again,\u201d thundered the president after taking fire from conservatives. Congress and the president must come to terms with the next round of spending before Sept. 30. Expect DACA, immigration and funding for a border wall to emerge as flashpoints. Democrats and Republicans are working feverishly behind the scenes to reach an accord on spending bills before the Sept. 30 deadline. It\u2019s unclear whether either body of Congress can knock out a handful of spending bills at all before August. This is why Congress often lumps the 12 annual spending bills into a gigantic, legislative slab and passes them at once. This is what infuriates the president. There may be an effort to ditch the \u201comnibus\u201d effort where lawmakers fuse the bills into one. Instead, lawmakers may try a \u201cmini-bus\u201d approach, mixing just two or three bills together. But something else could derail the appropriations process. Republicans recently cobbled together a \u201crescissions\u201d bill. A rescissions measure does just that. It cancels spending Congress already allocated. The Republican effort to nullify old spending could jeopardize good-faith efforts to finish the spending bills in a timely manner. \u201cSenator McConnell and I, we\u2019re getting along very well. I think we even enjoy each other\u2019s company. He laughs at my jokes,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. But Schumer says the rescissions effort \u201cis going to make it harder to get the appropriations process moving forward in a bipartisan way.\u201d In the old days, Congress deserted Washington in August because it was hotter than fire. The Founders erected the city on a swamp, and the Capitol lacked air conditioning. Thank to Willis Carrier, the inventor of air conditioning, lawmakers no longer have to leave. This August could be eventful. Or not at all. There could be the illusion where the Senate is meeting \u2013 but key votes are only scheduled on certain days, luring everyone back to town. That could maintain the charade that the Senate is \u201cin session working over the August recess.\u201d So there may be a few days in August where a decade happens. Or maybe nothing at all.

As a caravan of thousands of Central Americans renewed their slow march toward the U.S. on Wednesday, others chose to travel in smaller groups following routes well-worn by decades of migrants fleeing poverty and violence.(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell) WASHINGTON \u2013 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order as early as Thursday sending 800 or more troops to the southern border to support the Border Patrol, a U.S. official said. Mattis is responding to a request from President Donald Trump, who says he's \"bringing out the military\" to address what he's calling a national emergency at the border. Thousands of Central American migrants are now making their way through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States. The U.S. official was not authorized to speak publicly because not all details of the military arrangement had been worked out, and so spoke on condition of anonymity. The additional troops are to provide what one official described as logistical support to the Border Patrol. This would include a variety of things such as vehicles, tents and equipment, and perhaps medical support. It was not immediately clear how many, if any, of the extra troops would be armed. Because they would not be performing law enforcement duties they would not be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role. There already are about 2,000 National Guard troops assisting at the border under a previous Pentagon arrangement. Trump announced that he's \"bringing out the military\" in a tweet Thursday morning, blaming Democrats for laws he said make it too hard to stop people at the border. He said those trying to enter the U.S. \"will be stopped!\" Trump tweeted Monday that he'd alerted the military that the situation was a \"National Emergy\" \u2014 but the Pentagon said then that it had received no new orders to provide troops for border security. Trump told a rally crowd in Wisconsin on Wednesday that the military was \"all set.\" The president's tweets reflect an effort to thrust immigration politics into the national conversation in the closing weeks of the congressional election campaign. He and his senior aides have long believed the issue \u2014 which was a centerpiece of his winning presidential campaign \u2014 is key to revving up his base and motivating GOP voters to turn out in November.",

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis sparred Thursday in Fox News\u2019 Florida Republican gubernatorial\u00a0debate over their support for President Trump, while\u00a0DeSantis championed his relationship with the president and Putnam argued he\u2019s more focused on local issues than his opponent. Putnam, who spent 10 years in Congress before being elected statewide in Florida, used his opening statement to portray DeSantis, elected to Congress in 2012, as a creature of Washington. \u201cWhat an exciting time to be in front of a live audience of 1,000 Florida Republicans,\u201d Putnam said in his opening remarks. \u201cIt's different than a Washington, D.C. studio. Welcome to Florida, congressman.\u201d DeSantis played up Trump\u2019s endorsement of his campaign, expressing doubt that Putnam adequately supports Trump. \u201cI am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump in this race,\u201d he said. Added DeSantis, \u201cWhen Donald Trump was trying to win Florida in 2016, Adam Putnam did not attend a single rally with him. You couldn\u2019t find Adam Putnam if you had a search warrant.\u201d Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis face off over the Supreme Court, relations with Russia, President Trump's agenda and endorsement and the current political climate in America. But Putnam played up his support for Trump, saying, \u201cI support our president's\u00a0agenda for our country.\u201d He later emphasized: \u201cI am focused on Florida.\u201d The two candidates took shots at each other throughout the hour-long debate. But on the issues, they both called on Trump to appoint a conservative to the Supreme Court, criticized California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters for her controversial recent comments and expressed concern over school shootings while defending Second Amendment rights. Thursday\u2019s debate, moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, took place at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center in Kissimmee ahead of the Aug. 28 primary. The debate unfolded amid breaking news of the mass shooting at the Capital Gazette\u00a0newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland, where police said at least five people were killed. The candidates discussed gun control, referencing the recent infamous massacres in Florida at a nightclub and a high school. FOX NEWS POLL: FLORIDA GOP GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis debate federal immigration reform and the separation of migrant families at the border. \u201cIt is critically important that we defend our rights and protect our students in the schools,\u201d Putnam said. \u201cThose two things are not\u00a0incompatible.\u201d \u201cMy wife and I have two young\u00a0kids under the age of two,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThe thought that someone would\u00a0come and shoot them fills me\u00a0with rage.\u201d Both called for the removal of Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County who came under criticism after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in February. \u201cI would have removed that\u00a0sheriff from Broward County.\u00a0He failed his citizens and he\u00a0should have been removed,\u201d DeSantis said. Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis debate sanctuary city policies, gun control, support for the Second Amendment and entitlement reform. \u201cSheriff Israel is under\u00a0investigation and he needs to\u00a0go,\u201d Putnam said. Thursday\u2019s televised showdown is part of Fox News\u2019 series of debates leading up to the 2018 midterm elections. Though Trump endorsed DeSantis, a recent Fox News poll of Florida likely GOP primary voters finds Putnam ahead of DeSantis by a 32-17 percent margin. However, 39 percent of voters said they're unsure who they will back in the primary. Meanwhile, 46 percent of those supporting a candidate say they could still change their mind. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a crowded Democratic primary for governor, including Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene, former U.S. Rep.

            "article_content": "File photos - File photo - A U.S. worker builds a section of the U.S.-Mexico border wall at Sunland Park, U.S. opposite the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, November 9, 2016. Picture taken from the Mexico side of the U.S.-Mexico border/A Mexican gray wolf (REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/AP2011) Over 2,500 scientists are warning that the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico will have a negative impact on wildlife. The border wall was a key part of President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, but continues to spark controversy. While Trump has reiterated his desire to strengthen America\u2019s southern border, critics have questioned its effectiveness, its economic impact and its cost. The President\u2019s budget plan earlier this year included a $23 billion request for border security, $18 billion of which would be allocated to building a wall. Published in the journal BioScience, the letter has been endorsed by over 2,500 scientists across the globe. The signatories warn that the wall spells bad news for the area\u2019s nature. HOW AI AND TECH COULD STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S BORDER WALL \u201cIn North America, along the 3.200-kilometer [1,988-mile] US\u2013Mexico border, fence and wall construction over the past decade and efforts by the Trump administration to complete a continuous border \u2018wall\u2019 threaten some of the continent's most biologically diverse regions,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAlready-built sections of the wall are reducing the area, quality, and connectivity of plant and animal habitats and are compromising more than a century of binational investment in conservation.\u201d The border bisects areas inhabited by 1,506 native animal and plant species. Some 62 of these species are listed as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, according to the scientists. By significantly altering the landscape, the border wall threatens a number of animal populations, the letter says. \u201cPhysical barriers prevent or discourage animals from accessing food, water, mates, and other critical resources by disrupting annual or seasonal migration and dispersal routes,\u201d the scientists explain. Continuous walls, they add, could prevent endangered Peninsular bighorn sheep from moving between California and Mexico to access water and birthing sites. It could also be difficult for other endangered animals such as the Mexican gray wolf and the Sonoran pronghorn to cross the border and re-establish recently destroyed populations or bolster small groups. SOMEONE JUST KILLED ONE OF THE LAST REMAINING JAGUARS\u00a0IN THE US \u201cAs climate change and increasingly warm, dry conditions redistribute resources and shift habitats in the borderlands, the wall may prevent some populations from tracking these changes,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cFragmented populations may suffer from reduced genetic diversity and face greater extinction risks.\u201d In the letter, scientists claim that the border wall bypasses environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The border wall also devalues conservation investment and scientific research, they say.

            "article_content": " This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" October 30, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Great show, Tucker. Good to see you.\u00a0\nAnd welcome to \"Hannity.\"\u00a0\nOne week from tonight, seven days, you will tune into the Fox News Channel, the fate of your government rests in your hands. So much at stake, your paycheck, your taxes, your retirement, your 401(k). Your economy, immigration, border wall, originalist federal justices, due process, presumption of innocence, peace through strength and so much more.\u00a0\nI argue tonight that we are at a crossroads in this country will either get better or worse. In one week, you have the power. Not the pundits, not the fake news network, not the pollsters, you get to decide and shock the world. Coming up, we'll profile all of the biggest races all across the country. We'll explain the three possible election outcomes.\u00a0\nAnd also tonight, President Trump just wrapped up a very solemn trip to Pittsburgh where he, the First Lady Melania, met with the victims and mourned this weekend's horrific attack. Vile, evil deranged monsters like this man responsible for Saturday's anti-Semitic massacre will never define us as a country, even though there are people that try to politicize such tragedies. Unbelievable.\u00a0\nWe will respond to all of that hateful coverage that you've been watching. Not here of course.\u00a0\nSo, sit tight, buckle up. We have a busy show. Time for our breaking news opening monologue.\u00a0\n(MUSIC)\u00a0\nHANNITY: One week from tonight, you tune into the Fox News Channel, the election results at this hour will be pouring in. The balance of power and Capitol Hill will be decided. You will definitely see one of three results.\u00a0\nIn the best-case scenario, Republicans pick up seats in the Senate. That helps with confirmations of Supreme Court justices and holds onto a small majority in the House of Representatives.\nThe second scenario could happen, split decision. This is what most analysts are predicting and the GOP would hold onto power in the Senate, pick up seats, but lose the House and, yes, Nancy Pelosi would be the next speaker of the House.\u00a0\nThird, worst-case scenario involves Republicans losing both the House and Senate -- meaning you get Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Schumer.\u00a0\nOh, I'd like to say it's unlikely. That would pretty much be an unmitigated disaster and a really bad night. We've had them before, kind of like when Obama won twice, but you can prevent that.\u00a0\nThankfully, the Senate is looking pretty strong for the Republicans. We look at North Dakota, Democrat incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is now down by double digits against Republican Kevin Cramer. In Nevada, GOP Senator Dean Heller, he is maintaining a consistent, but it's always a tough state, lead against his opponent.\u00a0\nThen we have incumbent Indiana Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly now down to Republican Mike Braun. It's a little complicated in Indiana because there's a libertarian on the ticket and that would split and siphon away votes mostly from the Republican Braun and help Donnelly, so libertarian vote pretty much is a vote for Chuck Schumer and Donnelly.\u00a0\nMeanwhile in Florida, razor, razor-thin, close as it can be. Well, Rick Scott, one of the most effective governors in the c history of the state, bringing in over 2 million jobs in his term and he's in a very close race against Democratic do-nothing Senator Schumer wannabe incumbent Bill Nelson.\u00a0\nAnd let's not forget about this all important race in Arizona. You know, American hero Republican Martha McSally, a vet, 28 years, six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her opponent, Kyrsten Sinema, a radical disgrace for decades, even trashing the people of Arizona, calling them crazy, comparing the state to a meth lab of democracy and she says Arizona is famous in a Lindsay Lohan kind of way, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0\n2003, not long after the 2001 trade center attacks, she even suggested it was OK if Americans go fight for the Taliban, our enemies. She also promoted events at Arizona State University featuring a radical far left lawyer, the one who were presented, oh, radical blind sheikh. And then, by the way, Sinema organized antiwar rally with self-described witches. As Martha McSally said, while she was fighting for a country she was running antiwar protests and wearing a pink tutu.\u00a0\nAnd yesterday, Project Veritas unleashed a private video showing how she and her campaign are caught on tape openly admitting just how far left she is. But she's hiding it from the people of Arizona.\u00a0\nIt's amazing how consistent the Democrats are. Don't tell them what we really think. We can't win on who we really are. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEOAPE)\u00a0\nMICHELLE DAVIDSON, SINEMA'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I mean, I think you have to look at this why Kyrsten approach is so, I think, important.\u00a0\nWe can't be talking about this with Republicans now.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\u00a0\nDAVIDSON: We can't, right?\u00a0\nLAUREN FROMM, SINEMA'S FIELD ORGANIZER: There's a lot of very conservative people in Arizona and so she can't alienate the conservative or moderate conservative voters by being super pro- she is pro-choice. She is very liberal, she's progressive.\u00a0\nBut she doesn't, in this election, want to draw too much attention to being progressive because she's trying to be more -- that's why I think she took so much Democratic help, too. Otherwise she wouldn't have won also.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) move up, become powerful.\u00a0\nKYRSTEN SINEMA, D\u2014ARIZONA, U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: I believe that we should offer citizenship to every person in this country who isn't bad. You know, if you haven't committed a bad crime, you know, then you should get a path to citizenship. That's what I believe.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Sinema is the latest Democrat caught on tape by ProjectVeritas.com. Arizona, do you really want to put someone that thinks it's okay to fight with the Taliban, that radical, in the U.S. Senate?\u00a0\nThe campaigns of, let's see, Democrats Claire McCaskill, Phil Bredesen, Heidi Heitkamp, they were all exposed on camera proving our point. If you want to win and you are a Democrat, you cannot reveal who you really are or what you really believe in. You've got to lie to your constituents. That is pathetic.\u00a0\nSenator McCaskill, members of her staff revealing their far left plans, strip gun rights from law-abiding American citizens in Missouri -- by the way, always voting with Obama, not voting very often with Trump at all. McCaskill should be defeated in a state that is Trump territory.\u00a0\nIn Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, well, his staff admitting that he would never support actually Kavanaugh's nomination if elected and that people in his own state are kind of ignorant despite promising otherwise. Caught in a lie. Lying to the people of Tennessee.\u00a0\nMarsha Blackburn, she is up in the latest polls there. If Republicans have a really, really good night, if you want to be optimistic, why not, right?\u00a0\nDemocratic incumbent Manchin is now down 2 in West Virginia. This is a real race.\u00a0\nTester in Montana is within the margin of error, only up 3. He could be defeated.\u00a0\nCorrupt New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez now at risk of losing that race, now within the margin of error. Nobody saw that coming.\u00a0\nAnd meanwhile, the balance of power in the House is very much up for grabs at this hour. \"Real Clear Politics\" putting 204 House races in the Democratic column, 199 in the Republican column. Thirty-two toss ups will decide the majority.\u00a0\nTo make it simple, we are putting up on the screen, we have all of this on hannity.com detailing, you know, the balance of power. These races will tip that balance. And by the way, there could be as few as a four-point win either side. All these races you're looking at are neck and neck.\u00a0\nAnd tonight, also, we're tracking one gubernatorial race very closely. That's Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida in a very tight race against radical Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, far left corrupt socialist calling for a 40 percent tax hike for businesses in Florida. That will destroy the economy of Florida.\u00a0\nGillum is actually facing an ongoing federal investigation into serious corruption and accepting bribes valued at thousands of dollars from undercover agents, including tickets to the hit Broadway play \"Hamilton' and a luxury vacation. Florida, you better wake up. You cannot let that man be your governor or you will see your economy tank.\u00a0\nEarly voting has now started all over America. If your state has early voting, you want to go vote, get it done. Ask yourself this question tonight, are you better off than you were two years ago? Is the economy better off?\u00a0\nHave burdensome regulations on businesses been cut dramatically more than at any other time in our generation? Are we now finally on a real path to becoming energy independent? The lifeblood of our economy? Do we now have better trade deals?\u00a0\nOh, and is little rocket man talking about denuclearization of the Korean peninsula? Has he stopped shooting rockets over Japan?\u00a0\nIs our relationship with Israel better? Do we pull out of that disastrous Iranian deal? Are we having better relations in terms of a new coalition? Israel, the U.S., Jordan. Egypt, the Saudis, to stand up against Iranian hegemony?\u00a0\nDid we get to originalists as promised on the U.S. Supreme Court? Do you care about presumption of innocence or are you worried about protecting your borders tonight? Do you support the president's new plan to end birthright citizenship for those who came to this country illegally? Do you want a wall on our southern border?\u00a0\nWell, one week from tonight, one week from today, all of it is on the ballot. Get to the polls and vote or else you get the government you will deserve. You will wake up on November 7th and you will hear Speaker Pelosi or soon to be Speaker Pelosi, Speaker-elect Pelosi, Senate Majority-elect Chuck Schumer. Let's see, Maxine Waters, Adam shifty Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Elijah Cummings, they will all be committee chairmen and women. That is not going to be good.\u00a0\nThe Democratic agenda will become reality. What do they want? Open borders. They want to keep Obamacare. Really? How did that work out for you?\u00a0\nThey want their crumbs back. They want higher taxes. They want activist justices on the court. They will open endless investigations into the president. They will block any investigation into the deep state.\u00a0\nMark my words: America gets the government they deserve. But polls are often wrong. So, on the one hand tonight, we are going to go over the poll numbers, but on the other hand, they were wrong -- if you look at the exit polls in 2004 and 2016, John Kerry was supposed to be president and so was Hillary Clinton, they often get the polls wrong.\u00a0\nBy the way, Hillary -- she still hasn't quite recovered. She's still forcing her way into the public stage. Not really a pretty picture, including recently when she made this offensive joke. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHILLARY CLINTON, D, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't want to paint with a broad brush, every immigrant is this, every African-American is that, every other, you know, person with different religious beliefs or whatever, that's childish.\u00a0\nUIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do you think of Cory Booker --\u00a0\nCLINTON: I adore him.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ye, what you think about him saying kick them in the shins essentially, start to get to that kind of political --\u00a0\nCLINTON: That was Eric Holder.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That was Eric Holder. Sorry.\u00a0\nCLINTON: I know they all look alike.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, they don't.\u00a0\n(LAUGHTER)\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, well done.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: The mainstream media all but ignored those remarks. I just wonder, how would they have reacted if Donald Trump said it? You can hear the audience laughed, cheered, moderator grinned ear to ear.\u00a0\nBut what if a Republican made that same comment? We all know the outrage or feigned, I guess it would be, moral outrage and selective moral outrage of fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC and elsewhere it would be nonstop, all conservatives painted as racists.\u00a0\nToday, President Trump, he visited the site where an actual racist, vile, anti-Semitic monster attacked a synagogue, killing 11, injuring six others. The president, the First Lady Melania met with the victims, mourned this horrible attack and sadly even as we speak, the mainstream media, those on the left are still going to great lengths, lying to paint a false narrative picture of the president, of Fox News, talk radio and even many of you, the American people.\u00a0\nRacist, condoning and inciting such reprehensible violence night after night, day after day, minute after minute. They paint all conservatives, most Republicans as cancerous hate-mongers.\u00a0\nLet's take an example. \"GQ\" writer Julia Ioffe yesterday on fake news CNN Jake Tapper's show. She actually said that Trump is worse than ISIS and we are getting lectured by CNN lecturing the president on civility. This is a joke.\u00a0\nTake a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nJULIA IOFFE, \"GQ\" WRITER: I think this president, one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did. I think the president has far more supporters who espouse an equally hateful ideology.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: After not pushing back at all, Jake Tapper later gave Ioffe an opportunity to explain the remarks. She partially apologized, then continue to just bash President Trump in one breath. And, of course, she wasn't banned from fake news CNN or MSNBC. Instead, they just continue to feature her as the great guest over and over again.\u00a0\nAll week, she's been spewing absurd anti-Trump hatred and the mainstream media apparently loving it. But they lecture us on civility. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nIOFFE: This tale of anti-Semitic comments, anti-Semitic tropes seem to follow him everywhere. There might be fire where that anti-Semitic smoke is.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You say that Trump sets the tone. He has allowed bigots go about their business.\u00a0\nIOFFE: Absolutely.\u00a0\nThe ways in which he condemns racists where you can see it so half-hearted. It's like a kid being forced to do something by his parents.\u00a0\nIt's interesting you mentioned World War II because when Donald Trump said that he was a nationalist, he didn't just off the cuff say he was a nationalist. At that point, I think, kind of the racism and anti-Semitism that he had been winking at in these dog whistles I think became a vuvuzela.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And, of course, the media lecturing the president on civility and tone on talk radio and civility and tone and lecturing FOX News, they wonder why people chant that they suck constantly, regularly. There's no introspection, no internal conversation that maybe they've earned it and the president calls them fake news and they bubble and fizz like Alka-Seltzer in water and with just one week to go until election day, Ioffe, others, mainstream media speaking literally now in one hysterical voice of the Democratic Party desperate to win in seven days.\n\"NewsBusters\" study in the lead up to the midterms, mainstream media's coverage of President Trump coverage has been ten times more negative than the coverage of all Democratic candidates combined. And, of course, we see it every two and four years -- racist, sexist, you've heard my list, but this time it's even worse. Now, the mainstream media literally trying to link President Trump, Fox News, talk radio, everyone they disagree with and hate anyway with vile atrocities, with an anti-Semitic attack that took place in Pittsburgh.\u00a0\nI'm not making it up. We got the tape.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nDON LEMON, CNN: The terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them.\u00a0\nJIMMY KIMMEL, ABC: Yes, if you guys stop saying mean things about me, I'll stop inciting angry lunatics to kill you.\u00a0\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Whether the president knew what he was saying, the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated.\u00a0\nSTEVE SCHMIDT, MSNBC: What a Trump is doing is stoking and inciting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his name. Anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events and the incitement is as dishonest as they are blind.\u00a0\nTREVOR NOAH, COMEDY CENTRAL: I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to draw the lines between these people and the rhetoric that is being parroted by the president of the United States right now.\u00a0\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The racists and the anti-Semites think that he is perfectly tolerant of racial violence and anti-Semitic violence.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes, the president is the most pro-Israel president in our lifetime. Ask the prime minister of Israel. Ask Ron Dermer. They are pointing it out.\u00a0\nAnd to blame individuals like this is beyond hateful. We'll get to that later.\u00a0\nAnd so, we have anti-Trump hatred. It's become so unhinged, even the rabbi from the synagogue that was attacked, he's getting hate mail. Why? Because he's meeting the president who was going to mourn the lives of innocent people killed. Take a look.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nRABBI JEFFREY MYERS: When I first said that the president was welcome, I received a lot of emails, too numerous to count. I can't keep track for every mail I read, two appears as I'm reading that one. So, I just cannot keep up with it.\u00a0\nI've received many emails that are not happy with those words. The thing that saddens me is those emails also contain hate, and it just continues in this vicious cycle. Hate promulgating more hate promulgating more hate, and that's just not the solution. We need to be better than this.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Pretty despicable. We do need to be better than this. The violence has got to stop. The threats, the intimidation have no place in this country.\u00a0\nSadly many on the left, political differences now just demonize somebody you disagree with. To them, Republicans are evil, the president is evil, FOX News, talk radio is evil. It's why you see this kind of rhetoric, over the top from liberals like -- oh, actor James Cromwell saying this week that there will be, quote, blood in the streets if Democrats don't take back power and destroy the president's agenda. Tried to walk it back, good luck with that.\u00a0\nThis kind of rhetoric is not only surprising, but it's regular. The left is using the politics of fear for decades. I tell you every election season. Every two years, every four years, this is what they do, this is their playbook.\u00a0\nSo, will you stand against the vilification of political differences? Are you going to buy into these hysteria, this vile, vicious untrue attacks? Are you going to let Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer control the fate of your government?\u00a0\nIs there anything the Democrats are offering to you, the American people, to help this country become a better place? To help its citizens, the forgotten men and women? The same party of Obama's record failures. What about appealing for impeachment for no reason, endless bickering, obstruction. That's all they're offering.\u00a0\nHealth care? Oh, how does that promised, keep your doctor, keep your plan, and pay less work out for America? It was horrible. Most people have one provider, that's it. No choices. Losing doctors, losing plans.\u00a0\nYou think open borders is smart? Really? We are not a country that has sovereign borders, the rule of law? They want to eliminate ICE? They want more sanctuary cities and states and free health care whether you are a citizen or not?\u00a0\nThey want to take back your crumbs and say so? Really? They want to pick your pocket of every dime you have. They want liberal activists, judges on the court.\u00a0\nIn other words, they want to bring back the failed policies of Obama's. Is that what you want? Are you better off than you were two years ago today? Is America better off? Is the economy better off? Are we more secure as a country?\u00a0\nThat decision will be yours in seven days. You can once again shock the world.\u00a0\nJoining us now, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, along with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\u00a0\nYou know, I looked down in Florida, I'm shocked that a guy like Gillum, who wants to raise business taxes 40 percent, is under corruption investigations, has said awful things about law enforcement, wants to impeach the president, Medicare for all. I don't know who's going to pay for it. How is this even a close race?\u00a0\nAnd the same with Bill Nelson. What is -- is there any one thing anyone could say Nelson has done in the century that he's been there?\u00a0\nPAM BONDI (R), FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes, I can. He's only passed 1 percent of the bills in the 45 years that he's been in political life. It's unreal.\u00a0\nThe man has basically done nothing. He's voted for higher taxes 300 times versus Rick Scott, a businessman, a career businessman, who has turned our state around. We are in the black. He's created millions of jobs. He has lowered taxes.\u00a0\nOur state is in the best shape it's been in because of Rick Scott. He's a businessman and he wants to serve in the Senate.\u00a0\nThen you take that down to the governor's race with Gillum, like you said. This guy signed the Dream Defenders pledge. People go online and look at that pledge -- anti-gun, anti-law enforcement, anti-jail, anti-police.\u00a0\nVersus Ron DeSantis, who has dedicated his life to service. He's an Iraqi veteran. He served in the war for us.\u00a0\nThis guy -- it's unreal. He believes in lower taxes. He cares about our state. People have got to get out and vote, Sean. This election is crucial.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Ronna, let me run through the states, yes or no, does Rick Scott and DeSantis win Florida? Polls show it's neck and neck.\u00a0\nRONNA MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIRWOMAN: I think they do win Florida. At the president is going down to Florida tomorrow. He's going to go down a second time before Election Day, and Pam just laid out the differences between these candidates. I mean, Gillum is extreme. He will destroy the Florida economy.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Right, but let me ask you other questions. I want to move on.\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Go ahead.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Marsha Blackburn, does she beat the guy caught lying on tape, Bredesen? Does she win?\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Yes, I think Marsha Blackburn wins Tennessee.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Is Claire McCaskill in that case, Hawley win?\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: We are seeing that race narrow. We need Missourians to go out and vote. But I think Josh Hawley wins that race.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: How does Dean Heller do in Nevada?\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Dean Heller is doing great right now in Nevada and we also have two potential pickups in the House in the third and fourth districts.\u00a0\nHANNITY: What about Arizona? Will Sinema, the radical, have any chance against McSally? Because those polls are dead even.\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Yes, Sinema is the greatest actress on the planet and she deserves an Oscar for her award-winning change, but I think McSally pulls that out. Listen, it's narrowing. It is neck and neck.\u00a0\nHANNITY: North Dakota, Heitkamp is in --\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Cramer will be the next senator from North Dakota.\u00a0\nHANNITY: And what about Jon Tester? Could he lose? It looks like it.\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: He can and the president is the biggest aid. Every time he goes into that state, we see Rosendale go up.\u00a0\nHANNITY: What about other states we're looking? Indiana, I hope people don't vote libertarian.\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Indiana, Braun has opened up a lead. West Virginia, Manchin is on the ropes. You look at New Jersey.\u00a0\nHANNITY: What about New Jersey?\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: Yes, New Jersey -- I mean, listen, it is within the margin of error. Bob Menendez is a crook. Bob Hugin is a businessman. These are states that we can win.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Last question, while Republicans hold the House?\u00a0\nMCDANIEL: I think we'll hold the House, but it's going to be tight. We've got to get out and vote.\u00a0\nHANNITY: I would argue that tonight we are down five seats by my measure.\u00a0\nPam?\u00a0\nBONDI: Got to vote. Everybody's got to get out there and vote. John James, Michigan, Bill Schuette for governor of Michigan. Got to vote.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Another great, he's a star. John James has cut the lead down to 6 in Michigan. You're right.\u00a0\nAll right. Good to see you both. Appreciate it.\u00a0\nWhen we come back, we have surprising numbers coming out ahead of the midterms. We will look at the polls. Doug Schoen, John McLaughlin will look all across the Senate and the House of Representatives. You vote one week from today.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. So, the midterm election is one week from today and some races are down to the wire.\u00a0\nAs of today, \"RealClearPolitics\" map has Democrats up 5 in the House. That's how close it is.\u00a0\nJoining us now to help explain where things stand, Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, former Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin.\u00a0\nDoug, you were on with me, it's funny, it's what the polls show. So, you got, what, 32, what we say toss ups in the country.\u00a0\nDOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.\u00a0\nHANNITY: You told me just a couple of days ago, you said Democrats plus 5.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Yes.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Actually tonight, if the election were held today, I think you're right. I think the Democrats would get the House because Republicans have to sweep those 32 races. My hope is, is that the Trump voters understand the severity of Nancy Pelosi being speaker and that that would overcome that deficit.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Yes, I think that's a hope, Sean, not a reality. I think the Democrats will win narrowly. I would say that I don't see the blue wave materializing that the Democrats hoped would show up but there are enough vacancies, open seats and frankly Democratic --\u00a0\nHANNITY: You have 45 retirements and you got the headwind of history.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Right.\u00a0\nHANNITY: But if they pick up seats in the Senate, that's the split decision that most people are calling tonight, one week out, John McLaughlin. But pundits are wrong. They were wrong in 2014, 2016, 2004. Just a few examples off the top of my head.\u00a0\nJOHN MCLAUGHLIN, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: Right, they are wrong again. But you know what? I can't disagree with you or Doug right now because there are too many open seats. And the election really depends upon a turnout from the rest of this week and on Tuesday, because the early voting states, you see the Republicans are doing better than -- they are doing about what they did in '16 -\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: In Florida.\u00a0\nMCLAUGHLIN: -- in Florida but not as well as they did in '14 because the Democrats and the anti-Trump vote are coming out a little bit better. So, we really have to watch that.\u00a0\nPlus, you can't let up on Election Day. Remember, everybody was saying a year ago when you had Virginia and Alabama, they were saying, gee, the Democrats won't come out, we'll get our vote out it will be a usual turn out. No.\u00a0\nInstead of 2.2 million in Virginia had 2.6 million and there was 11 percent more Democrats. This year the Republicans have to stay fired up right through Tuesday. And that's what the president is out there doing the rallies that he's doing. And he's kind of get polling needs to catch up--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: It's kind of carrying a lot of these guys on their back.\u00a0\nMCLAUGHLIN: Yes.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. So, you would say tonight that Republicans are a little behind in the House and there's got to be some urgency.\u00a0\nWe put up on my web site Hannity.com those races that will tip the balance of power. But really, every race matter. There's always a couple of surprises somewhere. What about the Senate? How many -- we'll start with you, John. How many Republicans, do you think they pick up seats, if so, where and how many?\u00a0\nMCLAUGHLIN: that's where the Republicans have put in their resources. They probably should put more back into the House, but they will pick up three, four, maybe five seats in the Senate because in those states, being with Trump or without Trump really matters because you have 26 out of the seats up for grabs are Democratic seats. Ten are in states that Trump won.\u00a0\nSo Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble. Manchin is in trouble in West Virginia. I think McCaskill is going to lose in Missouri. So, you've got a trend where Democratic incumbents are in big trouble. Like you've been saying in Indiana if they vote for the Republican instead of the libertarian, Donald is in trouble in Indiana. So, the Republicans are doing--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: So, what do you see in the Senate? You believe the Republicans hold the Senate as a Democrat, Doug Schoen?\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Yes, I do. I'm a little less bullish on the Republican chances than you and John. I think Arizona remains in play, Indiana is within the margin of error. I don't really believe that necessarily McCaskill goes down but I have to say, all the trends are moving toward the extent there are trends in the direction of the Republicans.\u00a0\nThe only contrary state now is Arizona. Nevada remains within the margin of error but moving marginally in the direction of the Republicans.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes. Look, Florida to me is too close to call. I think we hold Tennessee. I do think Claire McCaskill loses. I think that Project Veritas tape has hurt her. Her lying about her R.V. trip hurt her, her voting reliably Schumer hurt her. She's not a moderate.\u00a0\nI think you're right about Nevada. We hold that. I think Kyrsten Sinema is in trouble because as more and more gets known about here. Heitkamp is going to leave. Tester is going to be a tight race in Montana. I think Donnelly if they vote libertarian, John is right, we win that. And then interestingly, even West Virginia is in play now. Even New Jersey might be in play.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: Yes. I think the Democrats will hold New Jersey, hold Tester and it won't be three or four, I think it will be a couple of seats but clearly the Republicans are poised to hold the Senate as the Democrats win the House.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. But John, you do say Republicans can come back.\u00a0\nMCLAUGHLIN: Yes.\u00a0\nHANNITY: What is it going to take for them to make up that five seats, say, deficit if we are all right? Because we are all agreeing. A little behind tonight on the House.\u00a0\nMCLAUGHLIN: You said the magic words, stop Pelosi. Fifty-five percent of Americans don't like her, 30 percent -- 30 percent are favorable to her. We've seen it where they don't want her as a speaker. Even Democrats don't want her as the speaker. So, we've got to draw that contrast between her.\u00a0\nHANNITY: By the way, Doug is not going to admit it, he doesn't want her. He's not going to admit it.\u00a0\nSCHOEN: No. I will say it here. No Pelosi, no impeachment, yes to the Democrats.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. One week from tonight, let's see how smart we are. All right. When we come back, more of the media's shameful, despicable double standard. Democrats for years have been palling around with radical racist anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan. You almost hear nothing about it. We've got the full report. That's next. Straight ahead.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: In the wake of the synagogue Pittsburgh massacre, the media has been vilifying President Trump saying his rhetoric is somehow connected to this horrific shooting.\u00a0\nNow the media is saying next to nothing about major Democrats, their connections to one of the biggest racists and anti-Semites in America, Louis Farrakhan Nation of Islam. Here's what Farrakhan said about the Jewish people.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nLOUIS FARRAKHAN, LEADER, NATION OF ISLAM: The Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.\u00a0\nThe satanic Jews. They control everything and mostly everybody.\u00a0\nThere were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks.\u00a0\nSee the Jews have control over those agencies of government.\u00a0\nThe powerful Jews are my enemies.\u00a0\nFarrakhan, by God's grace has pulled the cover off of that satanic Jews.\u00a0\nCall me an anti-Semite. Stop it! I'm anti-termite.\u00a0\n(APPLAUSE)\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: And we could spend all night on the racist side of him. Joining us now, author of \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump,\" Harvard law school professor Alan Dershowitz, and CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for the president, Pastor Darrell Scott is with us now.\u00a0\nYou know what bothers me? I've got pictures, Alan Dershowitz, of Bill Clinton, what, two months ago.\u00a0\nALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: Right.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Sitting three seats down from this virulent racist and anti- Semite who I have gone after my whole career. Eight years after Obama, then the picture comes out of Farrakhan and Obama. You know, he hung out with a lot of other radicals in Chicago as well.\u00a0\nThen we've got Keith Ellison. Nobody ever wants to talk about Keith Ellison who associated with this guy. This is one of -- this guy is evil and then they blame Trump, who I think is the pro -- most pro-Israeli president in our lifetime in a generation. The only one that had the guts to make Jerusalem the capital. A great relationship with the prime minister. We are truly friends and partners and best allies and they accuse him of causing what this horrible terrorist act in the synagogue?\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Well, you know, I'd like to put what I call a testing hypothetical. When I was a professor I always asked hypothetical questions. What if Bill Clinton's, one of his people that he loved in the area of country and western music died and Bill Clinton was invited to sit at his memorial service and he walked in and three seats away from him was David Duke?\u00a0\nIs there anybody in the world who believes that Bill Clinton wouldn't have gotten up and left? But he didn't leave when he was seated three seats away from Farrakhan. What's the reason for that? Does he think that somehow Duke is worse than Farrakhan? Farrakhan has a much bigger following and is much more of -- advocates the kind of violence that we saw.\u00a0\nIs it that you have a different standard when you have a black bigot than when you have a white bigot? That won't wash. You know, I'm so disappointed in my friend Bill Clinton. I voted for him twice, I regard him as a friend but I cannot imagine how he can sit next to one of the most evil anti- Semites in the world.\u00a0\nThe black caucus has welcomed Farrakhan. Other leaders of Congress have welcomed Farrakhan. It's an extraordinary double standard. There has to be one standard against anti-Semitism. You cannot tolerate it. You cannot normalize it. You cannot make it acceptable and all of these actions implicitly make Farrakhan's anti-Semitism acceptable and normalized.\u00a0\nHANNITY: I can't say it any better than that, Pastor Scott.\u00a0\nDARRELL SCOTT, FOUNDER & PASTOR, NEW SPIRIT RIVAL CHURCH: Well, the thing that immediately comes to mind when you say that about Bill Clinton and the thing that ashamed me is the fact that he was sitting in a Christian church.\u00a0\nFarrakhan is not only notoriously anti-Semitic, he's also anti-Christian as well.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Right.\u00a0\nSCOTT: So, to have him sitting on the platform in a seat of honor in a Christian church, that was deplorable as well. But you know, black leaders and black pastors, they embrace Farrakhan and they're afraid to offend him simply because they think that because of his suppose it pro-black bigoted message that they need his approval, they need his endorsement in order for them to get elected or to have the power.\u00a0\nThey are afraid to make an enemy out of them but the truth be told, Sean, and Professor Dershowitz, truth be told, a number of them privately share his anti-Semitic feelings. And they buy into those anti-Semitic stereotypes that Farrakhan perpetuates. And you know--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Well, they have to be exposed. They have to be exposed without regard to their race.\u00a0\nSCOTT: Yes, he perpetuates this victimization and he identifies the Jews as the oppressor. And so, he's doing this to the masses and the leaders buy into it and they even have a somewhat unspoken agreement that will keep this in private between us, but we really share the same ideals. And it's a shame. It's a shame that this man is allowed the latitude in America that he's allowed because he is who he is.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Well, you know, it's easy for people on the right to condemn people on the left who are bigots and it's easy for people in the left to condemn people on the right. What's hard and what needs to be done is people on the left condemning bigotry from the hard left and people on the right condemning bigotry on the hard rate. It's the special obligation of people to condemn the extremists on their side of the political spectrum.\u00a0\nHANNITY: But you know but--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nSCOTT: Even within your own ethnic group. Blacks that need to condemn bigotry by blacks. Whites need to condemn bigotry by whites, whoever. We need to do it within our own confines as well. We can't say we just condemn bigotry if it's against us. If it's bias we have to condemn it as well.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Look, I have condemned bigotry among some Jews, extremist Jews who have expressed anti-black or anti-Latino sentiments. It's the obligation of everybody to condemn this kind of bigotry no matter what the source.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: I agree with both men. I agree on one thing.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Whether you agree with them on other issues.\u00a0\nHANNITY: I was raised Catholic. The corruption of the Catholic Church is beyond any comprehension. It is unacceptable. People should be going to jail for the horror that they committed, the crimes, the evil that they perpetrated and the cover-up anybody involved similarly should be in jail. You're right, professor.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: But you have to praise the Catholic Church for its attack on anti-Semitism. That was maybe a little late in coming but it has been so strong, so strong.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well, historically was late, professor, let's be honest.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: But it has been so strong that today from pulpits all over the country anti-Semitism is repeatedly condemned and that's a good thing.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes. And I don't think the relationship with Israel has been any closer as it is now.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nSCOTT: You're absolutely right.\u00a0\nHANNITY: And you know, you see this submerging alliance against the Iranian hegemony. We might actually have a chance of peace in the Middle East like nobody imagine a few years ago. Thank you both for being with us.\u00a0\nDERSHOWITZ: Thank you.\u00a0\nHANNITY: When we come back, one week from tonight the election results will be pouring in. Senator Lindsey Graham, Mike DeWine, they're next as our coverage continues. Stay with us.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. Midterms just a week away. The fundamental rights that make this country great all in the ballot. Due process, presumption of innocence, our Constitution, the economy, our safety, our security.\u00a0\nJoining us tonight champion of those right, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. He is running for the governorship of Ohio.\u00a0\nMike, this is an important race for this reason. People forget these governor's races, `20 we get the senses. And then you get all the realignment, congressional seats begin to change and they rewrite what the districts are and usually the party in power has greater say.\u00a0\nMIKE DEWINE, GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, R\u2014OHIO: Well, you know, Sean, it's amazing how much money has been poured into the state from the Democrat side. They really recognize the importance of the governorship in 2020. They get it, and so we've seen millions and millions of dollars coming from California and New York outside the state of Ohio.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Yes. And you know, senator, you've been -- you now -- this moment in the Kavanaugh hearing I would argue was a tipping point. That moment doesn't happen I'm not sure Kavanaugh got through. And I said it to you then, I'll say it to you now. You did the right thing, it was clear, it was moral in justice and indignation and you spoke for a lot of people.\u00a0\nYou now have been in a lot of states. You're travelling all through.\u00a0\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R\u2014S.C.: Yes.\u00a0\nHANNITY: I don't know who's busier, the president and his 11 stops before Election Day. I think you have probably as many.\u00a0\nGRAHAM: He's got a better plane.\u00a0\nHANNITY: He's not going to like it if you have more than him by the way.\u00a0\nGRAHAM: No, don't worry. But he's got a better plane. I can't promise you that.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Sure. Let's talk about what is resonating with people on the stops. What are issues resonating. I assume immigration? Not wanting to give crumbs back? The Democrats desire to impeach. Open borders. Yes, judicial nominees, the Kavanaugh effect?\u00a0\nGRAHAM: All the Kavanaugh and the caravan. I mean, if you're Republican and you're not excited about voting, you're legally dead. Kavanaugh was an assault on everything we hold near and dear. Why it is always our judges.\u00a0\nThis has been a nightmare for red state Trump Democrats between the Kavanaugh debacle, despicable character assassination and a caravan trying to overrun our borders. This has been a nightmare for red state Democrats unless unified Republicans, again, whether you are a Bush Republican, Trump Republican, vegetarian Republican, you were upset about what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0\nThey tried to destroy this man's life to hold open the seats so they could fill it. They do not recognize President Trump won the election and he chose a qualified person and it is resonating all over this country. It has united Republicans. It has put Democrats on the defensive.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Explain on the issue of Mexico, because I know you got the attention of the Mexican government yesterday with your comments.\u00a0\nGRAHAM: I did. I'm about to get it again if you will give me 30 seconds.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Go ahead.\u00a0\nGRAHAM: I appreciate the phone call for -- I -- they do watch Fox News. Thank you, Mr. Ambassador, from Mexico, calling me. I like what you said to me. It's important that we keep this caravan away from the United States border. We can work on fixing the triangle countries, make their lives better and we can work together to secure both sides of the border but you need to stop this caravan. I appreciate what you said to me and keep working with Trump. I think you'll be a good ally.\u00a0\nHANNITY: All right. Let me, Mike DeWine, if we look at Ohio, no Republican has ever won the presidency without winning your state and it is truly a swing state. Two times voted for Obama. Votes for Donald Trump. Even with the hostility I would call it of John Kasich, but as the economy since Donald Trump has been president better for the people of Ohio and more specifically how do you help it?\u00a0\nDEWINE: Well, we would move forward. Certainly, move forward under President Trump. If you go back eight years when my opponent Richard Cordray was the attorney general and Ted Strickland was the governor, we had lost 400,000 jobs. We had double digit unemployment. Things were going south.\u00a0\nToday we've regained those 400,000 jobs, plus 150,000 other jobs this past year. In September to September. We gained more jobs, new jobs for the state of Ohio then we've had for any year for 21 years.\u00a0\nHANNITY: Well.\u00a0\nDEWINE: So were moving in the right direction. What we don't want to do is go back to the tax--\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: I got to run.\u00a0\nDWINE: Tax issue (Inaudible) all the time.\u00a0\n(CROSSTALK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: If you've got Lindsey Graham on your side and Bill Cunningham on your side you're doing pretty well because they are both great Americans. All right. We'll be watching Ohio closely. One week from tonight.\u00a0\nWhen we come back, Rush explains why you must vote in seven days.\u00a0\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Today Rush made a wise observation about why it's imperative that we all vote.\u00a0\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST: It is a seminal moment when a political party as its official position refuses to accept election results, and that's where we are. And that is why we are where we are. They refuse to accept it.\u00a0\nFor whatever reason, they hate Trump, they don't feel good about it, they disagree, whatever. It doesn't matter why, but just the fact that they refused to accept the results is a horribly dangerous thing.\u00a0\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u00a0\nHANNITY: Right on. One week from tonight, you have the power to once again shock the world. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is next.\u00a0Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

            "article_content": "Former GOP presidential nominee thanks supporters; Dan Springer reports from Provo, Utah. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is projected to win his primary runoff in the race to replace retiring Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, marking the latest in a string of victories by Trump-backed candidates on Tuesday. In all, seven states were holding primaries or runoffs across the country on Tuesday, with the Utah contest among the highest-profile. As victories by Trump-backed candidates piled up, the president weighed in on Twitter, calling Tuesday a \"big night.\" \"The Democrats are in Turmoil!\" Trump wrote. \"Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!\" The president also retweeted an image of himself surfing a massive red wave, while a panicked donkey on top of a small blue puddle mutters repeatedly, \"Blue wave!\" Romney beat back a challenge from little-known state Rep. Mike Kennedy, who emphasized his local experience in order to draw a contrast with the former GOP presidential candidate. Romney and Kennedy were competing in the runoff because neither\u00a0was able to secure at least 60 percent of delegates' support at the state GOP convention earlier this year. Romney is set to face Democrat Jenny Wilson, a county councilwoman,\u00a0in the general election in the deep-red state. ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRAT OUSTED IN SHOCK VOTE IN NEW YORK Romney, who lambasted Trump as a \"fraud\" and a \"con man\" in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, has softened his tone substantially since then. Trump has endorsed Romney in the race, saying in February that Romney has his \"full support and endorsement.\" \"I think President\u00a0Trump\u00a0will be re-nominated by my party easily, and I think he'll be reelected\u00a0solidly,\" Romney, whom Trump briefly considered as a potential secretary of state, said in June. In a weekend op-ed published in The Salt Lake Tribune, Romney wrote that the Trump administration's policies have exceeded his expectations, but he pledged to \"continue to speak out when the president says or does something which is divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\" The unusual on-again, off-again relationship between Trump and Romney led the Boston Globe this week to call him \"the face of Trump's enablers or enemies. Or both.\" Voters also headed to the polls in New York, Maryland, Colorado, Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Carolina on Tuesday. TRUMP'S PICK WINS BIG IN SOUTH CAROLINA Buoyed by a risky, full-throated endorsement by President Trump,\u00a0South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster was projected to win Tuesday's Republican gubernatorial runoff election. The White House went all-in to support McMaster, with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence campaigning on his behalf in recent days. In New York, another Trump-backed candidate, Rep. Dan Donovan, prevailed over the comeback candidacy of Michael Grimm. Grimm, who had been convicted for tax fraud, was considered a liability in the district in November for Republicans. And in a shocking result, 10-term Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, a fierce Trump critic and chairman of the influential House Democratic Caucus, was summarily unseated by far-left 28-year-old candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In Maryland, incumbent Sen. Ben Cardin won the Democratic nomination for his bid to earn a third term, beating far-left convicted leaker Chelsea Manning and six others. Fox News' Alex Pappas, Kaitlyn Schallhorn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In the final hours of the midterm campaign, Republican leaders appealed to the president to focus on the economy and dial back on the harsh immigration rhetoric. John Roberts reports for 'Special Report.' To some Republicans' chagrin,\u00a0President Trump has openly embraced Democrats' efforts to cast\u00a0Tuesday's midterm elections as a referendum on his record and political clout, a kind of ultimate test after a bruising midterm season that saw many of his hand-picked candidates surge to victories in key primaries. Election Day marks voters' first nationwide opportunity to react not only to Trump's tenure, but also to the slew of recent developments that have reverberated in the public consciousness, including\u00a0the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue,\u00a0the swelling migrant caravans\u00a0making their way to the U.S. border with Mexico, and\u00a0the\u00a0mail bombs sent to prominent liberals by an outspoken supporter of the president. \"In a sense, I am on the ticket,\u201d Trump told a raucous election-eve rally in Ohio, one of three he held in the final hours before Election Day.\u00a0\"The midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didn't they?\"\u00a0he added. \"Do you even remember what they were? People say midterms, they say, 'What is that, what is it,' right? Now it's like the hottest thing.\" Trump has held 26 rallies since October as he criss-crossed the country, boosting not only local candidates but also his own stake in Tuesday's vote. In\u00a0Mississippi in October, Trump urged supports to imagine they could vote for him when they head into the voting booth:\u00a0\u201cI'm not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I'm on the ballot. I want you to vote. ... Pretend I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d At an airport in Indiana ahead of another Monday evening rally,\u00a0Trump simultaneously seemed to downplay his role while also expressing an eagerness to bear the responsibility for his party's performance on Tuesday. \"It's really about the candidate, but if they want to give me the credit or the liability, I'll be willing to take it,\" Trump told reporters. \"In a sense, I am on the ticket.\" Over the past several months, Trump has unabashedly taken credit for the big wins enjoyed by several Republican candidates throughout this year's\u00a0primary season, which often came directly after his endorsement. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is locked in a tight gubernatorial race against Stacey Abrams, had surged ahead of Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle only after he secured Trump's backing.\u00a0Similarly, Republican John Cox\u00a0secured a spot on Tuesday's ballot in California's gubernatorial race when Trump urged the party to coalesce behind him. KEMP ANNOUNCES LAST-MINUTE PROBE INTO POSSIBLE VOTER\u00a0HACKING BY GEORGIA DEMOCRATS Perhaps the most stunning example of Trump's influence unfolded on June 12 in South Carolina, when Trump-bashing\u00a0Rep. Mark Sanford was unseated by Katie Arrington. As voters headed to the polls, Trump tweeted that \"Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA\" and called him \"MIA and nothing but trouble.\" Also attributable, at least in part, to Trump's endorsements: Republican State Sen. Troy Balderson pushing back a challenge from\u00a0insurgent Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor in Ohio's special election in August; South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster's win\u00a0over rival businessman John Warren; and\u00a0New York Rep. Dan Donovan's rise to beat\u00a0Michael Grimm. \"When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36,\" Trump tweeted. \"That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.\" (Fox News currently rates Balderson's bid for Ohio's 12th Congressional District as lean Republican.) TRUMP ANNOUNCES PLAN TO DENY ASLYUM-SEEKERS WHO DON'T ARRIVE AT PORT OF ENTRY, IN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO REJECT MANY CARAVAN MEMBERS But as voters head to the polls, some Republicans are suggesting that\u00a0Trump's fiery, immigration-focused messaging may have derailed the GOP's electoral chances in some key races. And Trump himself seemingly acknowledged that, despite his efforts, his party is looking at long odds in several congressional races. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well in the House,\" Trump said.\u00a0\"But, as you know, my primary focus has been on the Senate, and I think we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate.\u201d Last week, Trump rebuked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and told him that he \"should be focusing on holding the Majority\" rather than challenge his proposal to end birthright citizenship -- which was widely seen as an effort to cast some blame on Ryan if Democrats retake the lower chamber. Last Friday's jobs report showed the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7 percent, the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years, and that employers added roughly 250,000 jobs in October. Consumer confidence is at record-high levels. In an exclusive Fox News op-ed published Monday, Trump focused extensively on the\u00a0economy, which he called \"red-hot\" and \"the envy of the world.\" TRUMP MAKES CLOSING ARGUMENT IN FOX NEWS OP-ED: VOTE REPUBLICAN AND CONTINUE THE JOBS BOOM At times, though, Trump has appeared unwilling to discuss those figures publicly. \"Sometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy because we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" Trump said at a rally Wednesday night in West Virginia. He proceeded to discuss the migrant caravan and birthright citizenship -- more contentious issues that analysts say may turn off some moderate voters. \"Does that bring a single person to the polls? Is it moving any undecided voter \u2014 toward you, anyway?\" Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist asked, in an interview with\u00a0The Washington Examiner. \"Immigration is not a consensus issue within the current Republican Party because so many Republican voters are immigrants.\" In an interview with The Los Angeles Times on Monday, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Trump \"owns the Republican Party even more than Reagan\" -- and he's wielding\u00a0that historic influence accordingly. \"He has polarized the election on the issues he believes in, on his terms, despite the news media,\" Gingrich said.\u00a0\"You can argue whether or not it\u2019s the right gamble. But it\u2019s his gamble.\u201d The White House said early Tuesday that Trump will be eagerly watching to see if that gamble has paid off. \u201cAfter 11 rallies in 8 states and weeks of campaigning for Republican candidates, the President will spend today making phone calls, monitoring Congressional, Senate and Gubernatorial races across the country and meeting with his political team for real-time updates,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\u00a0\"Later this evening the President and First Lady have invited family and friends to join them in the residence as they watch election returns.\u201d",

Gov Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, addresses an election night crowd after he defeated Republican John Cox to become the 40th governor of California Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California was elected governor of the nation's most populous state Tuesday night, defeating Republican John Cox. Newsom, 51, handily defeated Cox, a businessman, to keep the California seat for the Democrats. He will succeed term-limited Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown. \u201cNow I can stand before you knowing I will have the incredible privilege of serving as your next governor,\" Newsom said during his victory speech late Tuesday. \"But this victory, this victory is really your victory because of you. The future belongs to California.\u201d FULL MIDTERM RESULTS With 46 percent of precincts reporting, Newsom held 57 percent of the vote while Cox trailed at 43 percent. A former mayor of San Francisco, Newsom held a sizeable lead over Cox heading into Tuesday\u2019s vote. Newsom, a Trump critic,\u00a0led in polls and fundraising in a state where Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million edge in voter registrations. \u201cBut tonight America's biggest state is making the biggest statement in America,\" Newsom said. \"We're saying unmistakably and in unison that it's time to roll the credits on the politics of chaos and the politics of cruelty. Now is time for going far and going together. MIDTERM LIVE BLOG Newsom served as lieutenant governor under Brown and has pledged to pursue universal health care and a surge in housing construction. He has said he would expand Brown's criminal justice reforms, which reduced sentences for some offenses, particularly drug crimes. He has also advocated immigration reforms that would help immigrants illegally living in California. In addition to opposing a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, Newsom has suggested expanding benefits and legal defenses against deportation. \u201cAnd to those who wonder whether polarization is permanent who think today's big dreams are tomorrow's broken promises who question whether a 40 million person melting pot of different faiths different families and futures can live and prosper together,\" Newsom said during his victory speech.\u00a0\"California is your answer.\u201d As mayor of San Francisco, Newsom\u00a0gained national attention for ordering the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples before it was legal. California has not elected two consecutive Democrats to serve as governor since George Stoneman and Washington Bartlett in the 1880\u2019s. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "During a 'Make America Great Again' rally, President Trump says that the Democrats will 'erase our borders.' President Trump was back on the campaign trail Saturday evening campaigning for Republicans in Florida in a quest to get more members of his party elected during next week\u2019s midterm elections. The president\u2019s stop in Florida -- he made it alongside Vice President Mike Pence -- was to boost support for Republican Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott, who is running for the Senate, and Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking to succeed Scott as governor. It was the second rally of the day for Trump, who\u00a0also appeared at an earlier campaign event in Montana. Pence, who took the stage ahead of Trump,\u00a0described Scott as \u201ca proven leader\u201d and DeSantis as \u201cone of our strongest supporters in Congress.\u201d \u201cRick Scott and Ron DeSantis will stand with this president and they\u2019ll always put Florida first. Which is more than you can say about either one of their opponents,\u201d Pence said. Upon taking the stage, Trump described the rapidly approaching midterms as \u201ca big one\u201d and \u201cone of the most important elections.\u201d \u201cIn just three days, the people of Florida are going to elect Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis to protect your jobs, defend your borders and continue making America great again,\u201d Trump said. He accused Democrats of wanting \u201cto give away our country,\u201d and to \u201cknock it down with a giant wrecking ball.\u201d During the rally, Trump made reference to a woman that he said accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of raping her and slammed Democrats for being \u201cso horrible\u201d during Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination for the nation\u2019s highest court. During Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, he was accused by multiple women of sexual assault and misconduct. Kavanaugh denied all the claims against him. \u201cAnd today, an accuser who said she was raped admitted she was lying,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe was lying. She never met him. It didn\u2019t happen. Can you imagine? And the Democrats were so horrible on everyone, so horrible.\u201d \u201cAnd by the way, what about the others? When are they going to say things like she did. She said it never happened, she never met him. She didn\u2019t even know why she did it. And they tried to destroy a great man with a great, incredible family,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf this man, who people predicted ten years ago would be a Supreme Court justice some day because of his intellect, can you imagine if he didn\u2019t get the job because of that? And then you find this out later on. But she admitted nothing happened, she never met him. This is disgraceful.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Friday referred a woman who had accused Kavanaugh of raping her \u201cseveral times\u201d in the backseat of a car to the Justice Department for \u201cmaterially false statements\u201d and \u201cobstruction.\u201d Judy Munro-Leighton, according to Grassley\u2019s office, \u201calleged that Justice Kavanaugh and a friend had raped her \u2018several times each\u2019 in the backseat of a car.\u201d Those accusations were made via a \"Jane Doe\" letter provided to Sen.\u00a0Kamala Harris, a California Democrat and committee member, Grassley\u2019s office wrote. Upon further investigation, however, inconsistencies in the story emerged. \u201cUnder questioning by Committee investigators, Ms. Munro-Leighton admitted, contrary to her prior claims, that she had not been sexually assaulted by ... Kavanaugh and was not the author of the original 'Jane Doe\u2019 letter,\u201d Grassley\u2019s office wrote in a\u00a0Friday referral to the DOJ. During the rally, Trump spoke about employment levels and the nation\u2019s economy. He also accused Democrats of wanting to \u201cerase America\u2019s borders\u201d and talked about a caravan of Central American migrants making their way toward the U.S. border. \u201cWe have to have a border. If we\u2019re going to have a great country, we have to have a great, strong, powerful border,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you look at that caravan coming up, that\u2019s not what we want. That\u2019s not for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we want people to come through our strong borders. But they have to come in legally. They have to come in absolutely through a process. And they have to come in through merit so that they can help all of the companies that are moving back to Florida and moving back to the United States.\u201d In a plea to the crowd to vote for Florida Republicans next week, Trump made a specific reference to familiar Democratic targets \u2013 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California Rep. Maxine Waters. \u201cThis Tuesday I need the people of Florida to send a message to cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and the radical Democrats by voting for Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott,\u201d Trump said.

They want to obstruct it. They want to resist. You know their campaign. They want to resist.\u201d Trump was in town to stump for Nevada Republican Dean Heller, who is facing a midterm challenge for a U.S. Senate seat by Democratic U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen. He mocked Rosen, calling her \"Wacky Jacky.\" Heller, who once said he opposed Trump, has allied himself with the president after Trump persuaded Danny Tarkanian to drop out of the Senate race, the Associated Press reported. Heller\u2019s vote was instrumental in passing Trump\u2019s tax-cut legislation in 2017, a senior adviser to Donald J. Trump for President Inc., said in a statement to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. President Trump speaks at a rally in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Sept. 20, 2018. (Associated Press) \u201cEighty percent of what this president has done has been very, very good, very positive,\u201d Heller said Wednesday. During his speech, Trump listed his accomplishments in office, including his tax cuts, job creation numbers and immigration policies, while criticizing opposition from Democrats and the media. In addition, Trump said, \u201cWe are rebuilding our military. We are crushing the terrorists and we are taking care of our veterans.\u201d He urged the crowd to vote in order to keep the Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. \u201cYou better go out and vote,\u201d Trump told onlookers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be changing that logo to \u2018Keep America Great.\u2019\u201d He also mocked former President Obama for campaigning for the Democrats running in the midterm elections. \"When I was running, I swear, I think he campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton,\" Mr. Trump said.

It\u2019s Election Day and it\u2019s hard to remember a midterm where the stakes have been higher. The ads have run. The policies have been put forward. The candidates have made their cases to the American people. Now it\u2019s time to vote. President Trump made the decision to treat 2018 like a presidential election year. He crisscrossed the country to make his final argument to the voters on behalf of Republican candidates. He presented compelling facts and accomplishments to show voters why it\u2019s in their best interests to vote for Republicans and keep both houses of Congress in GOP hands. In 2016, Trump campaigned for president as the ultimate political outsider who would come to Washington with fresh ideas and a new way of conducting the nation\u2019s business. This president has defied all expectations by outworking, outsmarting and outmaneuvering the failed liberal leadership in the Democratic Party. No one gave him a chance. The establishment scoffed at him at every turn. The New York Times and Washington Post were helping Hillary Clinton measure the drapes at the White House. In the face of all that, Trump decided to do even more campaign rallies and overcome all odds to win. Since Election Day on Nov. 8, 2016, the American left has made it clear that they hate this president more than they love our country, resisting and tarnishing him at every turn. The mainstream media, liberal academia, and the socialists in the Democratic Party launched a coordinated effort to try to end this presidency before it began. They failed miserably. To the new president trying to drain the Washington swamp, everything was on the table because Washington needed a lot of reforming and the swamp creatures fight back. The left didn\u2019t like what President Trump was planning to do to their failed status quo so they resorted to mob tactics. It didn\u2019t work; because when it gets hot in the kitchen, Donald Trump is at his best. This president decided to get to work and do it his way. And by any metric, he\u2019s succeeded \u2013 and he\u2019s just getting started. The president promised to get our economy growing again. He\u2019s delivered with millions of new jobs, the highest wage growth since 2009 and more Americans working than ever before in our history. The Trump economic program of low taxes and less red tape is working wonders for all Americans. The president promised to make America safer and more respected around the world again. He\u2019s made good on his word. ISIS has been decimated. North Korea is not test-firing missiles and setting off nuclear bombs, and is instead at the table talking. Iran is being held accountable instead of being bought off. President Trump promised to nominate judges to the federal bench who will defend the Constitution and not legislate from the bench. With the confirmations of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 along with historic numbers of circuit and district court judges \u2013 it\u2019s another promise made and promise kept. This president has defied all expectations by outworking, outsmarting and outmaneuvering the failed liberal leadership in the Democratic Party. Why? Because the president\u2019s desperate opposition is fresh out of ideas. The shameful chaos orchestrated at the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing can only get you so far. By contrast, President Trump is full of innovative ideas and is poised and ready to press on with his agenda to Make America Great Again. President Trump will continue to fight for higher quality and more affordable health care for the American people. The president will continue working tirelessly to secure our border. He will continue fighting for fair trade for American workers. President Trump will continue to reform and streamline the federal government to make it more responsive to the American people. And he will continue to deliver on his peace through strength foreign policy by putting American interests first. You want to hear the Democratic plan if the party takes control of Congress?\u00a0 It starts and ends with partisan investigations and multimillion-dollar taxpayer-funded smear campaigns. The Democratic Party has hit a new low and it is time for a coalition of reasonable Americans to stand up and be counted. Control of the U.S. House of Representatives is going to come down to 20,000 votes in 15 to 20 districts. If you want to help President Trump continue the success of the past two years, get out and vote Republican and convince your friends and family to do the same! The election of 2018 is going to be remembered as the one that mattered most. Please be a part of it and vote, because even though President Trump is not on the ballot his agenda most certainly is!",

Officials in Arizona said Tuesday that problems with voting machines in several polling places temporarily prevented people from being able to cast ballots in the state's primary elections. A spokesman for Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes\u00a0told Fox News on Tuesday afternoon that \"all polling locations dealing with technical issues this morning have been fixed.\" A source familiar with the process said that because of the problems, Maricopa\u00a0County may ask a court for an extension for polls to stay open past 7 p.m local time. Former pollster for the Trump campaign Jim McLaughlin examines Tuesday's primary races. Earlier, Fontes said\u00a0that his office, in the state's most populous county, learned of the issues Monday afternoon. Four polling places, he said, were down at 10 a.m. \"This is not a hiccup, this is a serious concern where lots of voters in Maricopa County are not able to get voting,\" Fontes said. The contractor hired to set up voting machines in the Phoenix area apparently failed to send enough technicians, leaving several polling places out of operation. Fontes says he sent his staff to as many locations as possible to make fixes. Fontes says the contractor didn't set up the machines on time. More than 100 calls from voters have reported problems Tuesday. According to ABC 15 in Arizona, some voters say they were turned away from the polls because of tehnical and computer issues. One frustrated voter, Ben Saylor, told the Associated Press he arrived at his polling place in north Phoenix and was told the equipment would not be set up until lunchtime. He was directed to a vote-anywhere polling station and also was told he would have to cast a provisional ballot. \"If you're a registered citizen, and you have the right to vote, there should be no such thing as a provisional ballot,\" Saylor said. Among the elections taking place Tuesday is the Republican primary to replace outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake. In the race, two-term Rep. Martha McSally has emerged as the frontrunner as she fends off challenges from the right from former state Sen. Kelli Ward and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the state\u2019s governor\u2019s race, President Trump has endorsed the re-election effort of Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who is facing a challenge Tuesday from former Secretary of State Ken Bennett. \u201cGovernor Doug Ducey of Arizona is doing a great job,\" Trump said. \"It would be really nice to show your support tomorrow by voting for him in Tuesdays Primary. Doug is strong on Crime, the Border, and our Second Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my full and complete Endorsement.\u201d Meanwhile, Ducey is expected to appoint someone soon to fill the seat of the late-Sen. John McCain, who died Saturday.

            "article_content": "A major factor working in favor of Democrats this election season is the public's concern over health care and its growing approval of ObamaCare; Doug McKelway reports. The 2018 midterm elections are less than two weeks away, and many polls show there is a sizable bloc of independent voters who have not yet made up their minds. At the same time, health care remains the No. 1 issue for the American people. The best way for Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters \u2013 and honor commitments to the Republicans who already support them \u2013 is to clearly articulate how they would fix our broken health care system. This is an example of what that plan should be. It could be titled: Republicans are creating a better health system and pledge to do more. NEWT GINGRICH: IGNORING HEALTH CARE COULD SPELL DISASTER FOR REPUBLICANS IN 2018 ELECTIONS Republican principles for America\u2019s health and health care system 1. We believe every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life, supported by a health system that is simple to use, innovative and affordable. 2.\u00a0We believe that every American should have his or her choice of doctors and insurance that meet his or her specific needs. 3.\u00a0We believe the health system should be transparent about health-care costs and quality of treatments options, and that this information should be available to every American in a simple, understandable way so patients can make better decisions about their own health. 4.\u00a0We believe in protecting patients with pre-existing conditions so that they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage 5.\u00a0We believe in the importance of American medical innovation that leads to breakthroughs that dramatically improve health outcomes while significantly lowering costs. 6.\u00a0We believe that the doctor-patient relationship is at the center of an effective health system, and it should not be disrupted by micromanagement from public and private bureaucracies. 7.\u00a0We believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits; and that they, their families, and their doctors should make their own medical decisions \u2013 not unelected government boards, bureaucrats, or private third-party payers and middlemen. 8. We believe in a competitive health-care market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs. One-size-fits-all government-controlled health care interferes with doctor-patient relationships, kneecaps new medical breakthroughs, provides less access to treatments, and leads to long wait times for critical care. 9. We believe that the current health-care system in America is far too expensive. While it is very good at treating people when they become sick, it is much less effective at helping Americans remain healthy \u2013 which is equally as important. 10.\u00a0We believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what\u2019s working and fix what\u2019s not. Destroying what\u2019s good about our health system in an attempt to fix what\u2019s bad is not an acceptable step toward a better future. If the American people re-elect Republicans to a majority in the House and Senate, we pledge to enact a series of practical and specific changes, based on what works in the public and private sectors, to build a better health system. Republican accomplishments in improving America\u2019s health and health care system Consistent with these principles, Republicans have taken several steps to improve the simplicity and affordability of America\u2019s health and health-care system. So far, the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have: 1. Passed legislation to eliminate the ObamaCare individual mandate penalty. 2. Passed legislation to end pharmacy \u201cgag\u201d clauses so patients can find the lowest prices for drugs. 3.\u00a0Passed Right-To-Try legislation. 4.\u00a0Passed $6 billion in new funding to fight the opioid epidemic. 5.\u00a0Passed the historic VA Mission Act, which replaced the troubled Veterans Choice Program and passed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to make sure Department of Veterans Affairs employees are held accountable for bad behavior and bad service. 6.\u00a0The Trump administration is providing more affordable health-care options for Americans through association health plans and short-term limited-duration plans. 7.\u00a0In the first year of the Trump administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved more affordable generic drugs than ever before in history. Thanks to its efforts, many drug companies are freezing or reversing planned price increases. 8. The Trump administration reformed the Medicare program to stop many hospitals from overcharging seniors on their drugs \u2013 saving seniors hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone. 9.\u00a0The Trump administration cut high-dose opioid prescriptions by 16 percent during its first year in office. This year, President Trump signed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to direct even more resources to fighting addiction and crack down on dangerous synthetic drugs that are killing tens of thousands of Americans a year. 10. Under the Trump administration, the VA expanded telehealth services, walk-in clinics, same-day urgent primary and mental health care, and launched the promised 24-hour White House Department of Veterans Affairs Hotline. Republican promises for additional improvements to America\u2019s health and health-care system If the American people re-elect Republicans to a majority in the House and Senate, we pledge to enact a series of practical and specific changes, based on what works in the public and private sectors, to build a better health system. This system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick. These legislative changes will: 1. Protect patients with pre-existing conditions with an alternative approach to the Washington-knows-best method of ObamaCare, which doubled premiums in the individual marketplace. We will do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches, like high-risk pools and reinsurance, so everyone \u2013 regardless of medical history \u2013 has access to affordable insurance. 2,\u00a0Further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drug supply chain (from manufacturers, to pharmacy benefit managers, to health insurers); making sure patients receive the benefits of drug manufacturer discounts and rebates; changing Food and Drug Administration rules to accelerate the release of new and generic drugs to market; and creating incentives to give more patients affordable access to new, highly-effective treatments that cure diseases and save money over time but have large up-front costs that create short-term challenges for public and private payers. 3. Lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax; reducing Washington mandates that limit choices and drive up the cost of insurance; allowing the self-employed and small businesses to band together to purchase insurance so that they can have the same negotiating power as big businesses; and making it easier for smaller companies to self-insure. 4. Strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare Part D patients from excessive out-of-pocket costs for drugs; protecting the market competition model of Medicare Part D, which has kept premiums low for seniors; eliminating unelected boards and bureaucrats that have decisions over treatments; and protecting Medicare as a program for seniors by opposing government-run health care, which would strain resources and limit availability and access to health services. 5.\u00a0Maximize medical innovation by fully funding National Institutes of Health research that leads to new cures and treatments; creating incentives for private sector research dollars to flow into national health priorities, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease; repealing the medical device tax; reforming the FDA to give patients access to breakthrough treatments faster and at lower costs; and applying pressure on foreign countries to pay their fair shares for U.S.-developed drugs. 6. Make health-care simpler by passing additional legislation to make the price and quality of health care providers visible and useful to patients; insisting on patient rights to ownership and portability of their medical records; liberating primary care physicians to practice their craft with minimal interference from government and insurer bureaucracies \u2013 including expanding patient access to direct primary care options; and reducing or modifying federal mandates, which increase administrative overhead, incentivize waste, and interfere with the kind of doctor-patient relationship that keeps people healthy for the long term. 7. Fight the opioid crisis by reducing the use of opioids to treat pain; enhancing border security to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into our communities; investing in research to create non-addictive painkillers; and improving access to evidence-based treatment \u2013 including medication-assisted treatment. 8. Address the underlying costs of health care by focusing on treating chronic disease; shifting to payment models based on value and long-term health outcomes; passing medical liability reform to reduce unnecessary and duplicative testing; fighting health-care fraud through public and private investment in information technology that the credit card industry uses successfully; and emphasizing public investment in improving the social determinants of health status, such as access to public transportation, affordable housing and healthy food options. This is the type of Contract on Health that Republicans should be willing to sign \u2013 and deliver \u2013 to the American people so that we can all live longer, healthier, more productive and more enjoyable lives.

The Trump administration officially opened the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, in a historic move cheered by Israelis but met with mass protests from Palestinians that turned deadly in the lead-up to the ceremony. Clashes at the border had left dozens of Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded by the time the ceremony ended. But Israel's prime minister praised the Israeli security forces for protecting the Gaza-Israel border, as U.S. officials held out hope that the prospect of peace is still in reach. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump, left, among others, unveil the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. (Ronen Zvulun) In a video address moments before his daughter Ivanka unveiled the embassy plaque with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Trump\u00a0touted the embassy opening as a \u201ctestament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people.\u201d In moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city -- a relocation long debated in Washington -- Trump said America was simply recognizing reality. \"For many years, we have failed to acknowledge the obvious, plain reality that the [Israeli] capital is Jerusalem. At my direction, the United States finally and officially recognized Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel,\" Trump said. The relocation fulfills a key campaign promise of the president and makes good on Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital just months ago. To mark the occasion, the Trump administration sent a huge delegation including Ivanka Trump, son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, Mnuchin, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan. \u201cThe United States will always be a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of peace,\u201d Trump said in his video address. \u201cWe extend a hand in friendship to Israel, the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors. May there be peace.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed how \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d he and the Israeli people are to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump, by recognizing history, you have made history,\u201d Netanyahu said Monday, reminiscing on his childhood, when he was forbidden to run too close to Jerusalem. \u201cMy mother said you can\u2019t go any farther, that was near the border. There was sniper fire. That was then\u2014this is now. Today the embassy of the most powerful nation on earth, our greatest ally, the United States of America, today the United States Embassy opened here. What a difference.\u201d Netanyahu added that it was a \u201cgreat day for Israel,\" for the U.S.-Israel alliance and for peace. \"We are in Jerusalem and we are here to stay,\" Netanyahu said. But Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, vehemently oppose the relocation. Weekslong protests flared to new levels of violence in the hours before the ceremony at spots along the Gaza-Israeli border. Netanyahu referenced the clashes during his remarks, praising the \u201cbrave soldiers protecting\u201d the borders. But the violence threatened to overshadow the jubilant ceremonies in Jerusalem. At least 52 Palestinians were killed and 900 wounded, Palestinian health officials said, as Israeli security forces fired on a surge of protesters at the border, vowing to prevent a breach. It marked the deadliest day since the Hamas-led border protests began in March. Ivanka Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. (AP) Earlier Monday, Mnuchin said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to relocate the Israel embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is a \u201cnational security priority\u201d for the U.S. Kushner, also a senior White House adviser, said that the sitting president has \"delivered\" where previous presidents \"backed down.\" \u201cWe believe, it is possible for both sides to gain more than they give \u2013 so that all people can live in peace \u2013 safe from danger, free from fear, and able to pursue their dreams,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cJerusalem must remain a city that brings people of all faiths together.\u201d Israel prepared enthusiastically Sunday for the formal embassy opening with a gala party at its Foreign Ministry that included Ivanka Trump, Kushner and other U.S. officials. Netanyahu told revelers that Trump's December declaration recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital was \"the right thing to do.\" President Trump said in prepared video remarks that the U.S. \"finally and officially recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\" (AP) The prime minister said Trump's decision recognized a 3,000-year Jewish connection to Jerusalem and the \"truth\" that Jerusalem would be Israel's capital under any future peace deal. Meanwhile, Israel bolstered its border security as thousands of Gaza residents amassed at the Israeli border.\u00a0Since weekly border marches began in late March, dozens of Palestinian protesters have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded by Israeli army fire. Hamas leaders have suggested a possible border breach in the days leading up to the embassy celebration, while Israel has warned it would prevent protesters from breaking the border at any cost. Palestinian officials have criticized the Trump administration for its decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas cut ties with the U.S., declaring it unfit to be the sole mediator for potential peace between Israel and Palestine. The Trump administration had brushed off Palestinian criticism, saying that the embassy move could be a first step for brokering a peace agreement.

            "article_content": "President Trump rallies in Indiana for Senate candidate Mike Braun as the candidates he endorses are cleaning up in primaries. For Republicans to win in the midterm elections, they must understand \u2013 and make clear to the American people \u2013 that Nov. 6 will be a big-choice election, when voters will decide between two competing alternative universes. If Republicans maintain \u2013 or even grow \u2013 their majorities in the House and the Senate, America will be operating in a grassroots rebellion-conservative-Republican universe. That will mean that progress on President Trump\u2019s agenda will continue (and possibly accelerate). More conservative judges will join the federal bench. Our taxes and unemployment figures will remain low, while our jobs numbers, wages and economic growth will continue to increase. In additions, Republican majorities in both houses will ensure that our borders will be secure, our military will be strong, and our nation will prosper through free, fair and reciprocal trade practices. If Democrats are able to take the House and gain seats in the Senate, we will be in the media-left-Democratic Party universe. These groups will oppose every Trump-Republican plan that is proposed \u2013 and likely try to impeach the president at the first frivolous opportunity. Every day will be dominated by scandals and defined by identity politics. Nominated judges will sit in limbo as the federal court caseload builds \u2013 delaying justice and fair trials for many. Democrats will raise our taxes and reverse the economic gains of the Trump administration \u2013 causing unemployment to rise and our economy to stagnate. I describe this concept in-depth in a political strategy paper I wrote called \u201cThe Republican Choice for 2018: Win or Lose.\u201d I wrote this paper because I truly believe every Republican candidate, campaign manager, consultant and political committee member must understand and communicate the stakes of this election. As I explain in the paper: \u201cA big choice alternative universe campaign requires thinking, planning, and training to make the transition from \u2018politics as usual\u2019 to \u2018politics as history.\u2019 It is also the only path that will keep a Republican majority in the House. \u201cThe current pattern is a war of district-by-district attrition. The consultants and professionals believe Republicans can outspend Democrats one district at a time and use traditional attack tactics to overcome them even in an unfavorable environment. \u201cThis explains the number of Nancy Pelosi attack ads and the relatively few big picture, big choice ads. It also explains the constant search for personal weaknesses (DUIs, past business deals, etc.). However, in a potential wave election, this kind of district-by-district effort simply gets drowned by the national messages (see 1974, 1980, 1994, 2006, and 2010 for examples). \u201cRepublicans must move from district-by-district attrition to a national message \u2013 and do something unexpected. Republicans need a national brand campaign, so Americans actually hear that there are more jobs than unemployed, we have the lowest level of African-American unemployment recorded, the average American family will have $2,000 more in their budgets, retirement savings have increased, wages have gone up, etc. \u201cIn order to define a big choice, we must ensure that people believe the choice we are defining is real. Right now, there is a lack of belief in many of the accomplishments that have been made. \u201cWe need to be defining the value proposition of the Republican Party to the electorate, so we can break from patterns of the past and propose a compelling future.\u201d President Trump has already intuited that this is a big-choice election, and he has begun using language that defines the two universes from which voters will have to choose. You saw several examples of this while President Trump was campaigning in Montana last week for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to take Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s seat. Most pointedly, President Trump defined the immigration fight in clear, big-choice terms. \u201cThis election is a choice between Democrats who want to abolish ICE, and Republicans, who want to abolish MS-13,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt is very simple.\u201d President Trump \u2013 and every Republican \u2013 should continue thinking in these big-choice alternative universe terms. If they do not, the left and the elite media could get the \u201cblue wave\u201d for which they have been fighting.",

            "article_content": "Former President Obama hoping to rally support for Nevada Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. Peter Doocy reports from Las Vegas. Former President Barack Obama defended his record at a Las Vegas election rally Monday, telling Nevada Democrats to \"remember who started\" the country's economic recovery after the Great Recession and accusing President Trump of practicing \"corrupt politics.\" Obama came to Nevada to galvanize support for Rep. Jacky Rosen, who is locked in a tight race for the Senate against incumbent Dean Heller. The former president was also joined on stage by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak, who is running against Republican state attorney general Adam Laxalt to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval. Obama, who won Nevada in 2008 and 2012, railed against the GOP tax law, efforts to repeal ObamaCare, Trump's attacks on the media, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions,\u00a0the separations of immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border and Trump's claim to have turned the American economy around. \"When you hear all this talk about economic miracles right now, remember who started it. Remember who started it,\u201d Obama said. \"I hope people notice that they run things into the ground and we have to come and clean things up.\" Former President Barack Obama meets with people at a rally in support of candidate for Senate Jacky Rosen and other Nevada Democrats, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) Despite Obama's repeated pointed criticism of Trump, the former president never mentioned his successor by name. \"Unlike some, I actually try to state facts,\" Obama said at one point. \"I believe in facts. I believe in a fact-based reality. Fact-based politics. I don\u2019t believe in just making stuff up. I think you should actually say to people what\u2019s true.\" He also took shots at Heller, whom some observers have called the most vulnerable incumbent in this year's Senate races despite\u00a0never having\u00a0lost an election over nearly three decades in public office. \"The current senator, he doesn't seem to be willing to stand up to [Trump],\" Obama said. \"He just goes along, even when you get a sense he knows it's not right.\" TAILGATERS SET UP BEFORE TRUMP RALLY IN TEXAS The rally at a University of Nevada, Las Vegas arena included specific appeals to young people and Latinos, key demographics who could boost Democrat numbers if they participate. The warm-up acts for Obama included\u00a0hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa and Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin and a speech from actress America Ferrera. The former president has generally kept a low profile since leaving office and has been selective about campaigning for Democrats in this year's midterm elections. Obama endorsed candidates up and down the ballot around the country, but in September\u00a0he broke with the traditional deference that past presidents show successors and gave a sharp critique of Trump. In subsequent appearances for Democrats in California, Ohio and Pennsylvania, he avoided a similar reproach and instead focused on urging people to vote. TRUMP GIVES 'LYIN' TED CRUZ' NEW NICKNAMES Though Obama used his speech Monday to say Republicans have been rolling back the progress his administration made, the GOP on Monday responded with an identical criticism of Obama and Democrats. Keelie Broom, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said: \"Nevada saw some of its darkest days as a result of relentless government overreach advanced by the Obama administration.\" \"We've made incredible strides thanks to President Trump and our GOP-led Congress, and it's insulting for Barack Obama to come out here and try to rally support for candidates like Jacky Rosen, Steve Sisolak, [U.S. House candidates] Susie Lee and Steven Horsford who will work to systematically dismantle the policies generating all of this progress.\" The event followed visits over the weekend by former Vice President Joe Biden, who rallied with Democrats outside a union hall in Las Vegas, and a rally in the rural town of Elko by President Trump.

            "article_content": "While a majority of Democrats view Immigration and Customs Enforcement negatively, Republicans largely have favorable views of ICE. A sizable chunk \u2014 a full one-third of Americans \u2014 are too unfamiliar with the agency to form an opinion, according to a new poll. (AP, File) The latest rallying cry from the far left to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) isn\u2019t a likely winner this election year, as a new poll finds only a quarter of Democrats support eliminating the agency supported by the Trump administration. The findings demonstrate tension among Democrats about how to address the crisis at the border that intensified in June, as the White House came under fire over the separations of illegal-immigrant families. But even as they don\u2019t want to fully dismantle ICE, 57 percent of Democrats view the agency negatively, including nearly three-fourths of those who describe themselves as liberal, according to the poll released Monday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Last month, a\u00a0Fox News Poll\u00a0found that the call to abolish ICE was not trending among voters.\u00a0The July poll\u00a0showed that 41 percent of registered voters approved of how ICE was handling its job, while an identical 41 percent disapproved. The poll also discovered that, by a margin of more than 2 to 1, voters were against disbanding the agency \u2014 42 percent opposing vs. 18 percent favoring. Some potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, backed getting rid of ICE in response to the separations. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in June:\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s deeply immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and that works.\u201d Others, including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, urged a rethinking of the agency, but stopped short of calling for its abolition. The push to abolish ICE became something of a litmus test among liberal Democrats this summer after self-declared socialist\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseated a 10-term party leader for a New York congressional seat in part by campaigning on the issue. But it hasn\u2019t proved a political winner in other races. President Trump has seized on the Democratic criticism of ICE to paint the party as weak on immigration and national security. The administration worked to reunite separated families after an international outcry, but the process is ongoing. Overall, opinions about ICE are divided along partisan lines. While a majority of Democrats view the agency negatively, Republicans largely have favorable views of ICE. A full one-third of Americans have said they're too unfamiliar with the agency to form an opinion, according to the AP poll. DEMOCRATS CALLING TO ABOLISH ICE INCLUDE GILLIBRAND, WARREN AND OTHERS Dianne Stone, a 68-year-old retired bus driver from Charlotte, North Carolina, said ICE should be modified but not scrapped. After spending decades living in Southern California, she said ICE ought to be less of a law enforcement agency, and more dedicated to helping immigrants negotiate the border. \u201cYes, there are more drugs and crime coming across the border than years ago. But you can\u2019t keep kids in cages,\u201d Stone said. \u201cICE can be part of a more sophisticated vetting process where you\u2019re keeping criminals out.\u201d The public largely is critical of the administration\u2019s progress in reuniting families. Nearly 6 in 10 think the Trump administration is doing too little, though 8 percent say it\u2019s doing too much, and a third think it is doing enough, the AP poll showed. Anna Lee Lish was appalled by the scenes of children separated from their parents at the border in June, but does not blame ICE for the problem. \u201cI thought it was horrific,\u201d said the 60-year-old social worker from Pocatello, Idaho. \u201cICE was just doing its job, following orders. But it\u2019s the policy of separating families that needs to change, not abandon ICE.\u201d The partisan divide is dramatic: 85 percent of Democrats say the administration is doing too little to reunite children with their families, compared to 22 percent of Republicans in the AP poll. Still, that means nearly a quarter of Republicans feel the administration should be doing more. Reviews of Trump\u2019s overall handling of immigration also are divided. More than three-quarters of Republicans largely have favorable views of the president\u2019s immigration performance, while more than 90 percent of Democrats disapprove. Nearly two-thirds of independent voters said they don\u2019t approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue. And while the Trump administration seeks to curb legal immigration, Americans are more likely to say they want to keep it at existing levels \u2014 42 percent \u2014 than to want the number of immigrants let in to be increased \u2014 29 percent \u2014 or decreased \u2014 28 percent, the AP poll found. The AP-NORC poll of 1,055 adults was conducted Aug. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

NIKKI HALEY'S 'TAKING NAMES':\u00a0When Nikki Haley started as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she warned she'd be \u201ctaking names\u201d of countries that do not have \u201cour back.\u201d Now, a newly released annual State Department report on voting records at the world body will tell her who exactly is in America\u2019s corner \u2013 and who is not ...\u00a0The report found that U.N. member states only voted with the United States 31 percent of the time last year on resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly \u2013 down 10 percent from the prior year. Reacting to the report, Haley said in a statement that it was not an \u201cacceptable return\u201d on the United States\u2019 investment and suggested this could factor into aid decisions. BATTLE FOR\u00a0WEST VIRGINIA BEGINS:\u00a0U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins,\u00a0West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and\u00a0former coal executive Don Blankenship, the top-tier candidates in West Virginia\u2019s Republican U.S. Senate primary, sparred in Tuesday\u2019s Fox News Channel debate over who is most conservative and more closely aligned to President Trump, while blasting Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe ...\u00a0Jenkins denied being a creature of the swamp, despite enjoying the backing from Washington Republicans. He emphasized his support for Trump. Jenkins\u00a0attacked Morrisey for past comments where he said\u00a0Trump wasn\u2019t his first choice in the 2016 primary. But Morrisey boasted of his eventual backing of Trump at the convention and his opposition to former President Barack Obama. Meanwhile,\u00a0Blankenship portrayed himself as the true outsider in the race, saying he wouldn\u2019t go to Washington to get along with GOP leadership, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u00a0The U.S. Senate race in West Virginia is considered a toss-up in the midterm elections.\u00a0Republicans hope to unseat incumbent Democrat Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin. PEACOCK SHIELD FOR BROKAW:\u00a0NBC News is facing accusations of victim-shaming and intimidation as it scrambles to protect its legendary anchor Tom Brokaw, who\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct by three women ...\u00a0On Tuesday, Variety reported that NBC News\u2019 powerful standards and practices department, which sets editorial guidelines, mandated that any reports on the Brokaw accusations include that more than 100 current and former NBC News women had signed a letter of support for the embattled newsman.\u00a0The New York Post reported Monday night that many women at NBC News had felt intimidated into signing the letter.\u00a0All this comes after Brokaw shamed his first accuser, former NBC correspondent and former Fox News anchor Linda Vester, in a scathing email which called Vester an embittered liar resentful that she did not become a star at NBC News.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0The biggest media bias - Manchin, Morrisey gear up for bruising battle - Trump: Ohio Dem gubernatorial nominee a \u2018socialist\u2019 - Midterms claim first House incumbent\u00a0- What a bunch of cornholes THE BIGGEST MEDIA BIAS  It was surprising to see some folks describing the results of the West Virginia Republican senatorial primary as an upset. But we can certainly understand why they did. If you watched the coverage of that race for the past six weeks it would have been almost impossible not to think that former coal executive Don Blankenship wasn\u2019t the prohibitive frontrunner.  Every story, every hot take and every piece of analysis seemed obsessed with Blankenship, giving his two main rivals scant attention.  When Attorney General Patrick Morrisey pulled out a decisive win, it might not have been the expected outcome to many, but it was in keeping with all of the reliable public polling on the race.  Republican readers here may be permitting themselves a self-satisfied chuckle knowing that, yet again, their party was the victim of journalistic bias.  Now, we will allow that some reporters wanted Blankenship to win based on the same reasoning behind Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s hope that Blankenship would lose. Some newsmen and newswomen would have enjoyed putting the screws to Republicans in other Senate races, asking them about whatever the most recent outrage from Blankenship was.  But don\u2019t forget that the fundamental, inherent bias in American journalism is not political. It is the desire for conflict and copy.  For evidence look across the Ohio River to the Buckeye State Democratic gubernatorial primary. Former Rep. Dennis Kucinich got lavish coverage for what turned out to be a fizzle of a fight with former Attorney General Richard Cordray. But that one, like the West Virginia race, fit the existing trope: Civil war, outsider vs. insider and populist insurgency. We even heard Cordray, an ultra-liberal pitchfork populist, referred to as \u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cestablishment.\u201d This is where journalists are stretching too hard to get a too-short blanket over the toes of their narrative.  None of this is to say that Blankenship or Kucinich are not fascinating creatures worthy of extensive coverage. Nor is it to say that the political press should discount the chances of underdogs.  Certainly Blankenship did well for himself in the Fox News Channel debate in his contest, and we do not doubt that his numbers got a boost in the immediate aftermath. Nor do we doubt that President Trump\u2019s stated opposition to Blankenship cut into the underdog\u2019s momentum.  But when partisans placed internal polling that showed Blankenship not just bouncing but soaring to the top, it proved irresistible for reporters who are still hooked on that 2016 feeling. They may not have known how to write about Trump when he was running for president, but they are getting very good about writing about him when he\u2019s not running, even if the facts don\u2019t entirely support the thesis.  Trump is president today because he understands the way members of the political press operate. They love to talk about themselves, so Trump baits them with attacks like his tweet today threatening to revoke credentials for those who write unflattering stories about him. He knows they like to cover feuds, so he always has a dozen or so in various stages of grievance articulation.  And he certainly knows they love good copy, which is how he managed to get roadblock coverage for otherwise unimportant campaign rallies. If they weren\u2019t such good TV and so bizarre to cover, Trump\u2019s events would have been treated like the snooze fests of his opponents.  Our advice is to not get sucked in too easily by over-hyped narratives, internal polls and breathless speculation while we move through primary season.  Trust reliable surveys, but only up to a point. Listen to reliable voices, but even then maintain a healthy sense of skepticism. And most of all, think for yourself.  THE RULEBOOK: STAY STRAIGHT\u00a0\u201cWhat has not America lost by her want of character with foreign nations; and how many errors and follies would she not have avoided, if the justice and propriety of her measures had, in every instance, been previously tried by the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part of mankind?\u201d \u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton\u00a0or\u00a0James Madison,\u00a0Federalist No. 63TIME OUT:\u00a0HEY, MAMA\u00a0History:\u00a0\u201cOn this day in 1914, President\u00a0Woodrow Wilson\u00a0issues a presidential proclamation that officially establishes the first national Mother\u2019s Day holiday to celebrate America\u2019s mothers. The idea for a \u2018Mother\u2019s Day\u2019 is credited \u2026 to\u00a0Anna Jarvis\u00a0(1907), who both suggested a holiday dedicated to a day of peace. Many individual states celebrated Mother\u2019s Day by 1911, but it was not until Wilson lobbied Congress in 1914 that Mother\u2019s Day was officially set on the second Sunday of every May. In his first Mother\u2019s Day proclamation, Wilson stated that the holiday offered a chance to \u2018[publicly express] our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.\u2019 In 2002, President\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0echoed Wilson\u2019s sentiments by acknowledging mothers in his official statement on Mother\u2019s Day in 2002. He commended foster mothers as well as his own \u2018fabulous mother\u2019 for their \u2018love and sacrifice.\u2019\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDTrump job performance\u00a0 Average approval:\u00a041.2 percent\u00a0Average disapproval:\u00a053.6 percent\u00a0Net Score:\u00a0-12.4 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0down 1.8 points\u00a0 [Average includes: CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 42% approve - 52% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]Control of HouseRepublican average:\u00a040.8 percentDemocratic average:\u00a047.8 percentAdvantage:\u00a0Democrats plus 7 pointsChange from one week ago:\u00a0Democratic advantage\u00a0up one point\u00a0 [Average includes: CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% Dems - 39% GOP.]MANCHIN, MORRISEY GEAR UP FOR BRUISING BATTLEWest Virginia MetroNews: \u201cWest Virginia\u2019s Republican nominee,\u00a0Patrick Morrisey, has been claiming for months to be the only viable candidate to beat incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic political powerhouse. Now he gets his chance. \u2026\u00a0 \u2018I always thought Patrick might have an edge, and the reason is he had two statewide races under his belt and a little bit more identification, if you will. I\u2019ve done enough statewide races to realize that.\u2019 Both Manchin and Morrisey are well-funded and well-known. Each has won multiple statewide races. And each has controversial connections with the pharmaceutical industry. Morrisey is a former lobbyist for the prescription drug industry whose campaigns have\u00a0been funded\u00a0by those same companies. Manchin has\u00a0been connected\u00a0with Mylan Pharmaceuticals and its EpiPen controversy through his daughter, Heather Bresch, who runs the company.\u201d\u00a0 Manchin announces support for Haspel - The Hill: \u201cSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said on Wednesday that he will vote for CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel to lead the spy agency. Manchin is the first Democrat to come out in support of Haspel, bolstering her chances of being confirmed despite engrained opposition from progressive senators and allied outside groups. \u2018I have found Gina Haspel to be a person of great character. Over her 33 year career as a CIA operations officer, she has worked in some of the most dangerous corners of our world and I have the utmost respect for the sacrifices she has made for our country,\u2019 Manchin said in a statement.\u201dDonnelly squirmy on tax cut repeal -\u00a0USA Today: \u201cThe day before\u00a0President Trump comes to Indiana to tout the GOP tax plan\u00a0\u2013 and to launch Republicans\u2019 [in support of new nominee\u00a0Mike Braun\u2019s] effort to knock of Indiana Sen.\u00a0Joe Donnelly\u2013 the Democrat incumbent was eager to talk taxes. But only up to a point. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Donnelly had plenty of criticisms about the tax\u00a0package that passed in December with no support from Democrats. But when asked if the tax cuts should be repealed, Donnelly demurred. \u2018That\u2019s not even on my radar,\u2019 he said. That\u2019s the question, however, that Republicans will try to force Donnelly to answer over the next six months.\u201dIt\u2019s populist against populist in Ohio Senate race -\u00a0Cincinnati Enquirer: \u201cOhio\u2019s U. S. Senate race will test what happens when a Trump-emulating populist Republican faces off against a Democrat already regarded as a populist.\u00a0Republican U.S. Rep.\u00a0Jim Renacci, R-Waverly, beat Cleveland-area banker\u00a0Mike Gibbons\u00a0Tuesday evening in the GOP primary.\u00a0\u2026 Renacci will face a tougher challenge in the coming months as he tries to oust incumbent Democratic Sen.\u00a0Sherrod Brown. Both Renacci and Brown have different populist styles. Renacci\u2019s mirrors Trump\u2019s maverick businessman and outsider image, even though he\u2019s been a congressman since 2011. Renacci released campaign videos of him riding around the state on\u00a0a motorcycle. He emphasizes his past as a business owner, where he said he made a fortune selling cars and running nursing homes. \u2026 For Brown, his breezy, conversational-style of campaigning and down-to-earth persona punctuated with his gravelly voice has allowed him to stay in the Senate since 2007.\u201d TRUMP: OHIO DEM GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE A \u2018SOCIALIST\u2019The Hill: \u201cPresident Trump\u00a0on Wednesday slammed former Ohio Attorney General\u00a0Richard Cordray\u00a0as a \u2018socialist\u2019 who \u2018should not do well\u2019 in Ohio\u2019s gubernatorial election this November. \u2018Congratulations to\u00a0Mike Dewine\u00a0on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs,\u2019 the president wrote on Twitter, referring to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who won the Republican primary for governor Tuesday. \u2018His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job!\u2019 Trump added, referring to Cordray.\u00a0Cordray is also DeWine\u2019s predecessor, having served as Ohio\u2019s attorney general before heading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\u00a0for nearly six years. Cordray left the agency in November to run for governor in a move that set up a fight over who would serve as his successor in leading the\u00a0CFPB.\u201dMIDTERMS CLAIM FIRST HOUSE INCUMBENT\u00a0Charlotte Observer: \u201cFormer Charlotte pastor Mark Harris defeated Rep. Robert Pittenger in Tuesday\u2019s primary in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, making him the first incumbent in the country to lose this year. \u2018I\u2019ve called Mark Harris, I\u2019ve conceded the race and I wish him the best,\u2019 Pittenger told supporters at what was expected to be a victory party. Harris said, \u2018I invite the congressman and his supporters to join our journey as we focus on keeping the 9th District red in November, ensuring the hard-working people of the 9th District have a congressman who is focused on representing them and their values ...\u2019 Meanwhile, Dan McCready easily beat Christian Cano in the Democratic primary. Though analysts say the district leans Republican, it\u2019s expected to be one of the two most competitive in North Carolina this fall with the 13th District, where Democrat Kathy Manning won a primary to face GOP incumbent Ted Budd. Both races could help determine which party controls Congress.\u201dEstablishment beats Freedom Caucus candidate in Ohio House race -\u00a0Politico: \u201cState Sen. Troy Balderson won the Republican primaries in the special and regular elections in former Rep. Pat Tiberi\u2019s old district. Balderson had 29.2 percent of the vote to 28.2 percent for Melanie Leneghan when the Associated Press called the race with 100 percent of precincts reporting. Balderson won the regular primary by a similar margin over Leneghan. Balderson\u2019s slim victory follows a contentious Republican proxy battle over the seat, which pit former House colleagues against each other in the latest in a series of mainstream-versus-outsider Republican primary battles. Tiberi, who backed Balderson, dipped into his own campaign account to support the state senator, airing TV ads to boost him. But Rep. Jim Jordan, the House Freedom Caucus co-founder, backed Leneghan and cut a competing TV ad for her that aired with help from conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein.\u201d Pence\u2019s brother likely to get a House seat -\u00a0Indy Star: \u201cGreg Pence was a step closer to achieving his goal of following in his little brother\u2019s footsteps Tuesday. Pence, the older brother of Vice President Mike Pence and the owner of two antique malls, clinched the Republican nomination to the 6th Congressional District, a seat once held by his brother. With 96 percent of the precincts reporting. Pence had 47,955 votes to Jonathan Lamb\u2019s 17,523. His more famous brother congratulated him over Twitter Tuesday night. \u2018He\u2019s making Hoosiers & the Pence family proud. Good luck in November!\u2019 Mike Pence tweeted. Greg Pence, a marine veteran and otherwise lifelong resident of the 6th District, ran on the slogan that was he was \u2018ready to serve again.\u2019\u201dLiberal House super PAC draws donors\u2019 ire for leader\u2019s lavish salary -McClatchy: \u201cA new Democratic group \u2013 one with support from Democratic congressmen and three of the biggest names in the tech industry \u2013 is testing the boundary between a new approach to politics and a self-enriching scam. When the People\u2019s House Project launched last May, founder\u00a0Krystal Ball\u00a0billed it as an organization that would defy old conventions and show Democrats a new model for winning campaigns. The former MSNBC host said her political action committee would support longshot candidates who embraced economic populism and lacked a political background \u2013 the kind of office-seekers who normally don\u2019t receive support from party leaders. But thus far, nobody has benefited more financially from the group than Ball herself. Of the $445,000 Ball raised for the group, she paid herself more than a third of that \u2013 $174,000 \u2013 in salary, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. The majority of her salary \u2013 $104,000 \u2013 came in the first three months of this year alone.\u201dPoll finds both parties face challenges ahead of Election Day -\u00a0CBS News: \u201cSix months before Election Day, the 2018 midterms look like a contest that\u2019s up for grabs -- both for control of Congress, and for which arguments will dominate the campaign. More voters say they\u2019d prefer to see Democrats take control of Congress than for Republicans to keep it, but voters also say Democrats must still explain what they\u2019d do if elected -- and it isn\u2019t enough for Democrats to just say they\u2019re different from Republicans. Each party faces a balancing act as they head through primary season. Republican voters want candidates who would support the president\u2019s agenda \u2013 but independents and voters overall do not. Voters don\u2019t want candidates who would go so far as to try impeaching the president\u2013 yet most Democratic voters do prefer candidates who\u2019d back that idea.\u201dTRUMP\u2019S TROUBLES WITH COHEN GET DEEPERLAT: \u201cThe shell company used by President Trump\u2019s lawyer\u00a0Michael Cohen\u00a0to pay off porn actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u00a0received about $500,000 last year from a business linked to a Russian billionaire who is close to President Vladimir Putin. Cohen\u2019s company, Essential Consultants LLC, received the money from a U.S. offshoot of the business empire of Russian oligarch\u00a0Viktor Vekselberg.\u00a0The payment from Columbus Nova LLC came to light in a seven-page report by Daniels\u2019 attorney,\u00a0Michael Avenatti\u2026\u00a0The document disclosed a wide array of previously secret payments that Cohen received last year from companies with an interest in Trump administration business. \u2026\u00a0Novartis, the Swiss\u00a0pharmaceutical giant, paid Cohen\u2019s company nearly $400,000; AT&T, $200,000; and Korea Aerospace Industries LTD, $150,000.\u00a0Novartis often seeks drug approvals from federal regulators, AT&T is fighting a Justice Department lawsuit to block its proposed merger with Time Warner, and Korea Aerospace Industries is a defense contractor.

WHAT A BUNCH OF CORNHOLESCBS Sports:\u00a0\u201cThe Georgia heat makes people do crazy things. One of those things, apparently, is fighting over cornhole. In Douglas County, an Atlanta suburb, the Chamber of Commerce was putting on its seventh annual fundraiser to benefit high school students in the county. Where it messed up was setting a $500 prize.

            "article_content": "Candidates are in the final hours of the campaign in Texas; Casey Stegall reports from El Paso on the high voter interest. EL PASO, Texas \u2013 A year ago today, no one imagined there would even be a race for Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate seat in Texas. But in the months that have passed, Beto O\u2019Rourke, an all but unknown congressman from El Paso, has gained a national spotlight and raised $38 million in the third quarter. O\u2019Rourke has raised more money than Cruz \u2013 more than any other Senate candidate ever. Cruz has an idea why his rival is getting attention and raising big bucks. \u201cIf you\u2019re a crazy left-wing activist,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got this guy in Texas pledging to go after and impeach Trump.\u201d But O\u2019Rourke brushes that aside, claiming Cruz is just playing politics. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to ever hear me talk about Sen. Cruz or the president or really anybody else,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke, claiming he\u2019d rather emphasize his vision for Texas. The day before Tuesday\u2019s midterm election, Texas voters have a stark choice. The two men\u2019s visions for the state and the country are diametrically opposed. Cruz wants a border wall. O\u2019Rourke is against it. Cruz opposes giving Dreamers a path to citizenship. O\u2019Rourke wants one. Cruz wants to end Obamacare. O\u2019Rourke is for expanding Medicare. The differences go on and on. Both men have been crisscrossing the state in the last couple of weeks of the campaign, attempting to eke out last-minute gains. The voting climate in Texas is enthusiastic. During the two weeks of early voting leading up to Election Day, voting has been almost on par with the last presidential election \u2013 well above the most recent midterms. Experts say many of those voting are new voters. \u201cEarly voting numbers in a place like Texas indicate an enormous number of people who have no vote history,\u201d said Daron Shaw, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who is a member of the Fox News Decision Team. \u201cRepublican consultants I know are basically sort of conceding... that Beto O\u2019Rourke is going to win the lion share of that new voter.\u201d Does that mean O\u2019Rourke gets the win? Not so fast. Most experts doubt it. \u201cIt has been 25 years since a Democrat won a statewide race in Texas,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political science professor with Southern Methodist University. Most polls have had incumbent Cruz up throughout the race by varying margins. \u201cThis is Texas,\u201d Jillson said. Texas also has a gubernatorial race this year with Gov. Greg Abbott solidly ahead of his opponent, former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez. That race is expected to bring out Republican voters to help Cruz. Both candidates will have their watch parties in their respective hometowns -- Cruz in Houston and O\u2019Rourke in El Paso.",

            "article_content": "A major setback House Republican leadership and President Trump who supported the controversial farm bill; chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill. **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Freedom Caucus tries to put Ryan out to pasture\u00a0- Trump plays it safe with third V.A. pick - Banking records broaden Cohen investigation\u00a0-\u00a0Pelosi to play favorites in home state primaries - While the rest of you were eating Tide pods\u2026 FREEDOM CAUCUS TRIES TO PUT RYAN OUT TO PASTURESpringtime has been soggy in the east this year, but in much of farm country it has been too dry. The Texas panhandle, Oklahoma, Kansas, and other parts of the interior are in a bad way. Industry experts estimate that about a third of the nation\u2019s cow herd lives in a drought-stricken state. The worry now is that we will see a repeat of 2011 when summer thunderstorms failed to break up the pattern, leaving cattlemen, farmers, and consumers feeling the pinch. But if you are a politician not from one of those states, you might not care so much. And if what you really wanted to do was get yourself booked on television so that you could run for House speaker or a higher office for your home state, those parched shorthorns wouldn\u2019t mean much to you at all. The big news in Washington today was that members of the House Freedom Caucus united to\u00a0defeat\u00a0a farm bill, backed by soon-to-be-former House Speaker\u00a0Paul Ryan. It\u2019s not that caucus members oppose the legislation itself. In fact, the reason they were able to kill the bill was that it had been made in their likeness. Agriculture legislation in the United States has to do with a lot more than soybeans. One of America\u2019s principle welfare benefits, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program, is a $70 billion behemoth that supplies more than 1 in 10 Americans with food. We call them \u201cfood stamps,\u201d but by any name they are a key component of U.S. domestic policy. Ryan wants to finish out his term as Speaker having said that he had done\u00a0something\u00a0about welfare reform. Frustrated by his own party in his efforts to make changes to underfunded entitlement programs, Ryan\u2019s last shot to do something about big-ticket domestic spending is probably food stamps. Populist Republicans like those in the Freedom Caucus and\u00a0President Trump\u00a0initially grumbled that Ryan wasn\u2019t being tough enough on food stamp recipients, but seemed to accept that his administrative reforms were enough. They certainly were enough to lose every Democratic vote on what was traditionally bipartisan legislation. The reason the farmers aren\u2019t getting a new farm bill, though doesn\u2019t have anything to do with farming or food, this is about breaking the Republican establishment\u2019s back. Freedom Caucus members said that they would not vote for the legislation unless Ryan brought forward their preferred bill on dealing with young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as minors. Their\u00a0bill\u00a0on the \u201cDREAMers\u201d probably could not pass the House and definitely could not pass the Senate. By forcing the vote, though, Freedom Caucus members hope to punish their fellow Republicans who take more moderate positions about those in the United States illegally. These are votes that could be used against moderate Republicans in primaries or elections for other offices. The Freedom Caucus came up short in a bid to win a House primary in Ohio last week, but they\u2019ll be back. This is how the 31-member group is trying to hold up the other 206 Republicans in the House. Part of the problem here is Ryan\u2019s decision to announce his departure but try to serve out the year. The Freedom Caucus and its leaders have plenty of time to extract desperate promises from Ryan\u2019s designated successor, Majority Leader\u00a0Kevin\u00a0McCarthy\u00a0Failing that, they will\u00a0attempt to\u00a0install one of their own, Rep.\u00a0Jim\u00a0Jordan, R-Ohio, in his place. Making this potboiler even more dramatic is that the other recent aim of the Freedom Caucus, impeding and discrediting the investigation into misconduct by members of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign apparatus, is heating up at the same time. House Intelligence Committee Chairman\u00a0Devin\u00a0Nunes\u00a0is doing his best to give Trump a reason to force out Deputy Attorney General\u00a0Rod\u00a0Rosenstein. Nunes and the rest of Trump\u2019s team in the House have been pushing Rosenstein to disclose what he says is sensitive information that could damage this case and potentially others if exposed. Without offering any evidence, Nunes said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d this morning that federal agents may have \u201cset up\u201d members of Trump\u2019s campaign team. The suggestion that federal agents were trying to entrap the members of a political campaign into criminal wrongdoing is, needless to say, a very serious one. But then, making such an accusation without evidence would be very serious stuff, too. But whether or not there was a \u201cspy\u201d doesn\u2019t matter for the purposes of\u00a0what Nunes is doing right now. Rosenstein has been playing along with Nunes\u2019 demands up to the point that other, less determined intercessors for the president have been satisfied that no wrongdoing has occurred. But at some point, Rosenstein will flatly refuse Nunes, which could be just the pretext Trump would need to order Rosenstein to comply. Rosenstein would then be obliged to quit. That way, Trump and his legal team (both inside and outside of Congress) could say that the president\u2019s just interested in transparency and accountability, not impeding the investigation that has so dogged his administration. Nunes suggests that Trump staffers may have been entrapped into canoodling with Russian agents, but what he was doing to Rosenstein certainly looks like entrapment itself. Ryan and McCarthy, with the help of Rep.\u00a0Trey\u00a0Gowdy, R-S.C., have been trying to keep Nunes on some kind of a tether for months. Nunes needs Gowdy because for some unstated reason the intelligence committee chairman does not read the intelligence reports in the case provided to him. Instead, Gowdy reads them and briefs Nunes. It\u2019s all impossibly weird. But the strange arrangement may be coming to an end. Freedom Caucus members have been applying maximum pressure against the Justice Department for months. But, this moment with a lame-duck speaker, a designated successor worried about flopping the way he did when he tried to replace\u00a0John\u00a0Boehner\u00a0and anxieties all over the conference about a possible midterm rout makes for a season of rich opportunity. The other 206 republicans do not want to end up the way Rep.\u00a0Robert\u00a0Pittenger\u00a0R-N.C. did last week when he lost to a primary challenger who deemed ultra-conservative Pittenger to have insufficient MAGA zeal. As the president has shown with Nunes booster Rep.\u00a0Ron\u00a0DeSantis, R-Fla, in DeSantis\u2019 bid for Florida governor, the president richly rewards those who are the most outspoken against the Justice Department. The rest of the Republican conference has relied on the fact that Ryan and others could keep the investigation into the investigation from running afoul of decency and good standards, but few of them are likely to take a chance on appearing to be sympathetic to the \u201cDeep State.\u201d The Farm Bill revolt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with farmers. The intelligence committee has increasingly little to do with intelligence. And the legislative branch doesn\u2019t seem to have much to do with legislation. If you are a farmer waiting for help or certainty or a citizen hoping that we can find some way to maintain the rule of law while still holding powerful people to account, you will just have to wait until all of the ambitions of the member of the House are satisfied. THE RULEBOOK: FROM THE GROUND UP\u201cCivil power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions.\u201d -\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 13 TIME OUT:\u00a0IT\u00a0STAYS WITH YOU\u00a0Live Science: \u201cWhen a\u00a0mosquito\u00a0bites you, it doesn't just help itself to some of your blood \u2014 it also kindly gives you some of its spit in return. It's this saliva that's responsible for the irritating itch of a mosquito bite, thanks to a concoction of proteins found in it that people are slightly allergic to. Now, a new study in mice suggests that your immune system could react to these allergy-inducing proteins for up to a week, potentially explaining why an itchy bite lingers so long. \u2026 By analyzing blood bone marrow, skin and spleen cells from the mice, the researchers found that a number of immune cells remained active even seven days after the mice were bitten. This was the \u2018most interesting\u2019 part of the study \u2014 \u2018that the effects lasted that long,\u2019 said senior study author\u00a0Rebecca Rico-Hesse, a professor of virology at the Baylor College of Medicine.\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions.

PICKWaPo: \u201cPresident Trump announced Friday that he plans to nominate Department of\u00a0Veterans Affairs Acting Secretary\u00a0Robert Wilkie\u00a0to become the department's permanent leader, noting that the decision may come as a surprise to Wilkie. \u2018I'll be informing him in a little while \u2014 he doesn't know this yet \u2014 that we're going to be putting his name up for nomination to be secretary of the veterans administration,\u2019 Trump said at a Friday morning event at the White House that Wilkie attended. The president added that Wilkie has\u00a0done \u2018an incredible job\u2019 as the acting secretary. As the crowd applauded the announcement, Wilkie stood to shake the president's hand, nodding his head as he did so. Wilkie then received a standing ovation. \u2026 Trump named Wilkie VA\u2019s acting secretary in March, upon firing\u00a0David Shulkin. Wilkie, 55, moved into the job from the Defense Department, where he was undersecretary for personnel and readiness.\u201d Administration moves against Planned Parenthood -\u00a0NPR: \u201cThe Trump administration is reviving a rule that would deny federal family planning funds to organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals. The rule is similar to one in place during the Reagan administration. The proposal was drafted by the Health and Human Services Department and is currently under review by the White House budget office. The proposed regulation would apply to Title X, the federal program that provides at least $260 million annually for contraception, screenings for sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health services to millions of low-income people, according to the official, who asked not to be named. The rule change would put Planned Parenthood back in the crosshairs after repeated attempts by congressional Republicans to defund the family planning group, which provides abortions but says the federal money it receives does not go toward paying for the procedures.\u201d DOJ reins in judges in immigration cases -\u00a0NYT: \u201cAttorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions\u00a0issued a directive on Thursday that places limits on a tool commonly used by immigration judges and could put hundreds of thousands of deportation cases that are essentially closed back on federal court dockets.\u00a0The move, issued in an interim decision, is unlikely to reopen all the cases. But Mr. Sessions said that immigration courts could not put such cases on indefinite hold by using a practice known as administrative closure, which temporarily removes a case from a judge\u2019s calendar and delays a proceeding that could remove an immigrant from the country.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0The Justice Department said Mr. Sessions\u2019s opinion eliminated the \u2018unfettered use\u2019 of administrative closures and better aligned the immigration system with the rule of law.\u201d President pressuring postmaster to punish Trump foe Bezos -\u00a0WaPo: \u201cPresident Trump has personally pushed U.S. Postmaster General\u00a0Megan Brennan\u00a0to double the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon.com and other firms to ship packages, according to three people familiar with their conversations, a dramatic move that probably would cost these companies billions of dollars. Brennan has so far resisted Trump\u2019s demand, explaining in multiple conversations occurring this year and last that these arrangements are bound by contracts and must be reviewed by a regulatory commission... She has told the president that the Amazon relationship is beneficial for the Postal Service and gave him a set of slides that showed the variety of companies, in addition to Amazon, that also partner for deliveries. Despite these presentations, Trump has continued to level criticism at Amazon.\u201d BANKING RECORDS BROADEN COHEN INVESTIGATIONWaPo: \u201cThe Treasury Department\u2019s inspector general is expanding a probe into leaks of confidential reports about suspicious banking activity by\u00a0Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, to include an uncorroborated allegation that some of those reports were mysteriously absent from a government database. The\u00a0investigation began\u00a0last week after\u00a0Michael Avenatti, an attorney for adult-film star\u00a0Stormy Daniels,\u00a0detailed transactions\u00a0in which large firms with business interests before the U.S. government transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to Essential Consultants, a company controlled by Cohen. Several news outlets reported later that they had reviewed financial records detailing the transactions. The information appeared to come in part from a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).\u201d Giuliani plans to prepare Trump for Mueller interview this summer -\u00a0Politico: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lawyers have begun planning a series of summer prep sessions for the president before a possible sit-down for an interview with special counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller, Trump attorney\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0said Thursday. The planning meetings \u2014 to be held during off-hours at the White House and perhaps over rounds of golf at Trump\u2019s private courses, Giuliani said \u2014 will mirror the then-GOP nominee\u2019s 2016 debate preparation, in which aides briefed an impatient Trump in several brief sessions over many weeks. Giuliani said the briefings likely will begin after Trump returns from a June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un\u00a0if a Mueller interview is agreed to.\u201d Manfort\u2019s ex son-in-law reaches plea deal with DOJ\u00a0-\u00a0Reuters: \u201cThe former son-in-law of\u00a0Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, has cut a plea deal with the Justice Department that requires him to cooperate with other criminal probes, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The guilty plea agreement, which is under seal and has not been previously reported, could add to the legal pressure on Manafort, who is facing two indictments brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort has been indicted in federal courts in Washington and Virginia with charges ranging from tax evasion to bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\u00a0Jeffrey Yohai, a former business partner of Manafort, was divorced from Manafort\u2019s daughter last August.\u201d PELOSI TO PLAY FAVORITES IN HOME STATE PRIMARIESLAT: \u201cHouse Minority Leader\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0said Democrats in the state\u2019s congressional delegation are going to put their thumbs on the scale in some key House primary\u00a0races\u00a0to make sure strong Democratic candidates are among the top two facing voters in the fall.\u00a0\u2018They may be subjected to criticism for that, but I\u2019d rather be criticized for winning than criticized for losing,\u2019 Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said. Under the state\u2019s top-two primary system, the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes advance to the general election in November, regardless of party. Democrats fear that high numbers\u00a0of primary hopefuls could split the vote and\u00a0leave the party without candidates in high-stakes congressional races\u00a0in November. \u2026\u00a0\u2018This is not a reform, it is terrible, it prolongs the process. It costs more money ... it shuts out small parties. So, I don\u2019t recommend this as a policy matter,\u2019 she said.\u201d DCCC April fundraising tops last cycle -\u00a0Roll Call: \u201cThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $11.2 million in April, exceeding its\u00a0monthly fundraising total at\u00a0the same point last cycle. Nearly $3.1 million of the\u00a0April\u00a0haul came from online donations, with an average\u00a0donation of $16, according to figures provided first to Roll Call. The $11.2 million total\u00a0surpassed the $8.5 million the\u00a0campaign arm of the House Democrats raised in April 2016. \u2018The DCCC\u2019s historic grassroots fundraising combined with incredible candidate fundraising will ensure that Democratic candidates have the resources to share their records of service with the voters who will determine control of the House,\u2019 DCCC Chairman\u00a0Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n\u00a0said in a statement. The New Mexico Democrat said he still\u00a0expected\u00a0his party to be outspent by Republican outside groups.\u201d Deportation bus tour breaks down -\u00a0WashEx: \u201cA spokesman for a candidate in Georgia\u2019s race for governor says the politician\u2019s \u2018deportation bus\u2019 broke down during its tour to promote a tough stance on immigration.\u00a0GOP\u00a0candidate\u00a0Michael Williams\u00a0says the bus will visit what he calls Georgia\u2019s \u2018dangerous sanctuary cities.\u2019 The former state co-chair for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign says he wants to send people living in the country illegally \u2018home.\u2019 The candidate\u2019s spokesman\u00a0Seth Weathers\u00a0says that water somehow entered the fuel tank, stopping the bus Thursday morning on the side of Interstate 75 in north Georgia.

[Ed. note:\u00a0There\u2019s a little town in New York named Apalachin that\u2019s name is pronounced \u201cApp-a-lay-kin.\u201d But it\u2019s in the northern range of the Appalachian Mountains, which in that part of the country are pronounced \u201capp-a-lay-chin.\u201d But if I was there to visit the scene of the famous meeting of New York mobsters that took place in 1957 and someone asked me where I was from, I might reply that I was of Appalachian origins, pronounced \u201capp-a-latch-in.\u201d So I guess I can understand your confusion! The short answer is that its regional. Where I grew up, people did and sometimes still do talk about the Allegheny Mountains instead of the Appalachians, but that is now generally understood to only refer to the range that runs from central Pennsylvania down to just north of Roanoke, Va.

This is a rush transcript from \"Journal Editorial Report,\" July 21, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I will begin by stating that I have full faith and support for America's great intelligence agencies, always have. And I have felt very strongly that while Russia's actions had no impact at all on the outcome of the election, let me be totally clear in saying that -- and I've said this many times -- I accept our Intelligence Community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL GIGOT, HOST: Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. Following heavy criticism from Democrats and Republicans, President Trump this week walked back his comments on Russian election meddling, claiming he misspoke Monday during a news conference with Vladimir Putin when he said he couldn't see any reason why Moscow would have interfered in the 2016 campaign. Those comments causing a firestorm and putting the president at odds with the U.S. Intelligence Community and members of his own party in Congress. This, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gets set to head to the Hill next week where he's sure to face a grilling from lawmakers over just what was discussed at the Helsinki summit, and as the White House prepares for a potential second sit-down in Washington this fall. Retired four-star General Jack Keane is a Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, good to have you here. GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Good to be here, Paul. GIGOT: After this week of back and forth, where do you think the president's relationship with Russia and Putin stands? KEANE: I think it's in an early stage of relationship. He's keen on having relationships. You know, he often talks about President Xi which is the long-term strategic threat to the United States of America to be quite frank about it. GIGOT: China. KEANE: As a result of that Mar-a-Lago meeting, and I think he credits himself as a result of a relationship he was able to make some progress on North Korea with China. Whether that actually bears the fruit we think it may remain to be seen. But I think he uses that as a framework, ongoing to have relationships and possibly even though the disagreements are significant, we may be able to make some progress. I think that's about what this is. GIGOT: OK. He's determined to have that relationship. That would be suggested by the second summit invitation. Do you think that's a good idea? KEANE: I don't have any problem with leaders of the world coming together with profound disagreements to talk to each other. I basically think it's actually a good thing. Listen, they're not going -- Ukraine intractable, Syria, intractable, but can we extend the new START treaty for five years that's going to expire in 2021 as a result of these two presidents coming together? Yes. They don't need approval of Congress or the Duma. Can they agree for no nuclear proliferation and put pressure on North Korea and also put pressure on Iran? Is that possible? I think so. GIGOT: OK. Let's talk about the domestic politics here because you know to have an effective foreign policy, you need domestic support. And the way the president handled that press conference has really hurt him in terms of his ability, I think, to maneuver inside Congress and have the support he needs. Why did he get such at odds with the Intelligence Community judgment about 2016, when he really didn't need to? KEANE: Yes, I mean, listen, Monday was a disaster. I think it was a low point of his presidency, to be sure. I don't get it, to be frank, Paul. I mean, I know that they put a huge effort into working the issues, prepping the president, preparing him for the four-hour summit, either the bilateral with staff or the one-on-one, but why didn't they prepare for the press conference? GIGOT: The most obvious question -- KEANE: Yes. GIGOT: -- that he would get at that press conference. KEANE: Yes. It is an appendage to the summit but it is the only place where the whole world is watching you. I'm not in an executive position like that, but I have had a few press conferences in my life, because things bad happen around my commands, and I rehearsed it, and I would say to the guys, OK, tell me what the outcomes are, all right, and tell me what the tone of this is going to be. Those are the two things I was stuck on, what were the outcomes of that press conference and what should the tone of the president be. Both of those were wrong. GIGOT: How much tension is there between, say, Jim Mattis and his view of his Russia and DOD people, on one hand, and also the intelligence services, Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence, and their views of Russia and Putin with the president? KEANE: You know, there's a lot of misunderstanding about this. In talking to the people around the president, who I know, the president drives foreign policy and national security, make no mistake about it. GIGOT: Correct. KEANE: And listen, I think this president -- I mean, despite this week of criticism, he's the toughest guy on Russia since Ronald Reagan, and the facts are on the table. Look, the Trump defense buildup comparable to the Reagan buildup. It has to last a few more years to be sure. Increasing the defense budgets in NATO. We have deployed additional troops on the eastern border on the Russian border. OK? Not to the degree we need, but to be sure, Putin is paying attention to all those three things. Fourth, what we've done in Ukraine in terms of anti-tank weapons. And of course, we've responded twice to Assad's chemical attack, and that's his ally. We're pushing back on Iranians, and that's his ally. Putin is paying attention to that. He's paying less attention to the rhetoric that goes on here. GIGOT: You mentioned NATO. Let's listen to the president to answer a question from Tucker Carlson on Montenegro. KEANE: Sure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, HOST, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\": Membership in NATO obligates the members to defend any other member that's attacked. Let's say Montenegro is attacked, why should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack? Why -- (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I understand what you are saying. I've asked the same question. Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people. They have very aggressive people. And they may get aggressive, and congratulations, you are in World War III. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: Deterrence is the core function of NATO or any alliance like this. Does a comment like that suggest some doubt about whether or not we're willing to commit to that level of deterrence? KEANE: Yes, absolutely. I mean, one of Putin's major objectives -- certainly he resents the fact that Russia strategic buffer from World War II to the president is gone and that strategic buffer was Eastern Europe. And they had an agreement in the \u201890s that, you know, these countries would not become a part of NATO, but they ran towards NATO because they feared the intimidation and the coercion of Russia. That's what Montenegro is all about. They want to get underneath the tent and get some level of protection. That comment there obviously denigrates the whole concept of what this is about. I think they eventually will likely probably come in because of the same reason all the other Eastern Europeans are in there. GIGOT: Right. KEANE: The president will support that, and they will be part of Article V collective defense, fight for one on behalf of the whole collective operation of NATO. GIGOT: But if you are Putin, you look at that and say, maybe just a tad little bit -- KEANE: No doubt about that. I think he looks at Angela Merkel to be quite frank about it. There's guys like me sitting around Putin and saying to him, if we took the three Baltic capitals, would Merkel really commit her infantry? GIGOT: That's exactly -- KEANE: That's a question. GIGOT: It is a question. It is an important one. Still ahead, Republicans are under pressure to stand up to Russia following the president's inconsistent statements this week. What Congress can do to contain Putin and maybe President Trump, when we come back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: 2018 is around the corner. Our job is to ensure what happened in \u201816 doesn't happen again. I believe it will if we don't act. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: There's a possibility that we may well take up legislation related to this. In the meantime, I think the Russians need to know that there are a lot of us who fully understand what happened in 2016, and it really better not happen again in 2018. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell under pressure from members of both parties to respond to Russian election meddling and reiterate support for the American Intelligence Community following President Trump's controversial remarks this week. So what can Congress do to contain Vladimir Putin? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist, Bill McGurn, editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley. Mary, I recall clearly last week you said the summit with Putin was a bad idea. Has the week made you change your mind about that? MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: No, it hasn't at all. I think it is safe to say this was not a highlight of the Trump presidency. Now, as to what Congress can do, they are a little limited, of course, because the executive branch is the one that sets foreign policy, but we have seen Congress impose some pretty significant sanctions on Russia, most notably, after the invasion of Ukraine, and they could do so again. GIGOT: But how much damage here? Before we get a little more on Congress, how much damage here do you think this has done after the full week? He reversed himself and he has second invitation to Putin. How much damage has he done to his presidency after this week? KISSEL: I'm not a Chicken Little, Paul. I don't think the world is going to end because of one disastrous press conference. However, Trump did take a hit. I think he looked subservient to Putin, I don't use that word lightly. And I think what he's done is unified Congress around the idea of cracking down on Putin. And he's raised concerns among the allies, too. Let's not forget about them. They rely on us, in large part, for leadership, whether it's in the Baltics or in Eastern Europe or NATO, as General Jack Keane just talked about. And I think the prestige took quite a big hit this week. GIGOT: Jason? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: I think they have spent the week trying to clean up this mess. That gives you some idea of how much damage they think was done this week. Hurting relations not only with the Intelligence Community, but also with the European Union and NATO. And also domestically. Mary is right. Trump supporters like the fact that he doesn't back down. He plows ahead. He doesn't apologize. Here he was standing next to Vladimir Putin, had the chance to tell him, we know what you did, don't do it again, and Trump went wobbly. And I think that he hurt himself domestically as a result of that. GIGOT: Bill, what about the disagreements we're hearing about between some of the intelligence officials and the White House? Particularly, Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence. He was -- seemed in an interview to be stunned by the news that the president has issued an invitation for Putin to come in the fall, and issued a statement after the summit defending the Intelligence Community. BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Right, well, look, we all know that the Russians meddled. Everyone knows that. I think even President Trump knows it because he walked back his remarks earlier. Look, he's still the president. And I think the storm will pass, probably because another storm will come up in its place. (LAUGHTER) But I would like to see -- there are interesting ideas out there. First of all, we know from this that the sanctions really bite, right? We know that the Russians, particularly Vladimir Putin, really hate those sanctions. I think the actions this week will make it much harder to lift those sanctions, which is a good thing. And there are other interesting ideas. The \"Washington Post\" had a story saying we ought to move our troops from Germany to Poland. To me, that would be an incredible step forward. GIGOT: Speaking of Congress, a 98 to nothing vote this week by the Senate warning the president not to take up Putin's request to have -- to come and have Russian prosecutors interview American officials who might know something about Bill Browder, who is one of the authors of the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions bill that passed in 2012 and has sanctioned I think about 51 Russians. KISSEL: Yes, Putin is trying out the classic Cold War tactics, Paul, where he offers something in return for something that he shouldn't have. President Trump, of course, wants to question the people who were hacking into the DNC servers -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: -- last week. KISSEL: Right, in return Putin says, oh, yes, let me question these 12 Americans that I think have committed crimes against Russia. And Trump fell for it, unfortunately. Now -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: He stepped back from it. KISSEL: Because of that backlash from Congress, he stepped back. That's a good thing. That also shows that checks and balances in the American system work. But the very idea that the White House spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, didn't immediately shut that down, that Putin request, when she was asked about it this week, to me, shows a fundamental lack of communication within the administration and a lack of understanding of Putin's method and his tactics. RILEY: It also shows an inability of Trump to distinguish two things here, which is Russian meddling and collusion. He needs to say over and over again, yes, we know Russia meddled. They better not do it again. My administration had nothing to do with it. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: They are separate issues. RILEY: They are separate issues. He continues to conflate them and his political opponents have no problem with that. GIGOT: Why does he keep doing that? RILEY: I think that's all he's thinking is collusion and he's not distinguishing between the two. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: He's thinking it undermines the legitimacy on the election. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: But you just make the distinction. He's giving ammunition, Bill, to his opponents. What do you think of the second summit? Good idea? MCGURN: No, I think it is a bad idea. I agree with Jason. Look, I think a lot of what has led Donald Trump to say certain things on Russia is he doesn't want to give his enemies any quarter, and that means saying some dumb things and setting off this kind of storm. That said, I think that, again, a lot of this is atmospheric. We all get distracted about it. The president, like many presidents, gets distracted by the idea that having a one-on-one relationship with some dictator is going to improve the situation. That's a perennial problem. And I think the risks here, when you don't have something that you want specifically from them shows what can happen. Look, with Kim, at least we know what we want to do. We want a denuclearized peninsula. I don't think it's a good idea unless you are going to get something that you really want out of it and you know that beforehand. GIGOT: All right, Bill. Thank you all. Still ahead a vote in the House this week on a GOP resolution supporting ICE as calls grow from those on the left to abolish the immigration agency. A look at how the issue will play in November, when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: The House on Wednesday approved a Republican resolution supporting U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement as Republican leaders sought to put Democrats on record over calls to abolish the agency. Some on the left are attacking ICE amid the outcry over family separations at the border, in what is shaping up to be a defining issue in the November election. President Trump seized on the issue this week tweeting, \"The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one. They actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the midterms.\" We're back with Bill McGurn, Mary Kissel and Jason Riley. Jason, what do you make of the House vote on ICE this week? RILEY: Well, it was a bit of show there. But I think it is reflective of the country on this issue, frankly, much more than these progressive Democrats are calling for the abolition of ICE. I think majority of Americans want the border better patrolled, Paul, not eliminated. This idea that people just want to give up on border security is nonsense. It is also strange, given as you mentioned there, we've had this child separation issue. GIGOT: Right. RILEY: A vast majority of Americans have a problem with that. The Democrats had a good issue there. Why change the subject to abolishing ICE? It doesn't make much sense. GIGOT: Yes, Bill, it seems to me that both sides here think that immigration is going to work for them in November. Democrats think they can make hay with the fact that DACA and the DREAMers haven't been legalized and the family separations. Republicans think ICE and the abolition of ICE is an issue for them. Who gets the upper hand here? MCGURN: Well, I think, for the last decade and a half or so, the issue has worked for the Democrats. And I think there's a lot of suspicion that President Obama, for example, as a Senator and now as president, preferred to have the issue, in other words, accusing Republicans of being racist and so forth, than to have a resolution. I thought earlier this year that the failure to get something done on DREAMers, which is sort of the easiest part of the equation because they were brought here by others, they didn't, you know, come themselves -- GIGOT: Right. RILEY: -- was something easier, basically, a border wall for DREAMers. I thought that might hurt the Republicans. But it looks like the Democrats are bent on shooting themselves in the foot. The abolish-ICE thing comes across as we want lawlessness. I mean, these are the same people pushing sanctuary cities and so forth. And I'm amazed at how they are taking an issue and making themselves as unattractive as they can be to the American people. GIGOT: Immigration seems to me works for the Democrats when it is about opportunity and fairness. MCGURN: Yes. GIGOT: And it works for the Republicans when it's about security. MCGURN: Absolutely. GIGOT: Abolishing ICE, Mary, turns it into a security issue. KISSEL: I think that's right, Paul. The greater tragedy here is that there was a deal to be done on immigration reform. Border security in exchange for legalizing the DREAMers. And to Bill's point just now, the Democrats wanted immigration as an issue under Obama. They didn't want a solution. And I think Republicans, unfortunately, are using the same tactic when it comes to ICE. They want an issue, not a solution. The Democrats don't want to deal so you can't put all the blame on the Republicans. But you know, I think the DREAMers here will suffer. GIGOT: This was a developing trend among Democrats, Jason. You've got Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, three Senators, all whom want to run for president, all taking the abolish-ICE position. Is this going to divide the Democrats going forward? RILEY: I think it will divide the Democrats, especially those Democrats who think we're losing white blue-collar workers. I don't know how an issue like eliminating ICE helps attract those. But it's how progressives have really taken over the party. Whether it's $15 minimum wage, a single- payer health care, these used to be fringe issues, held by progressives. Now they have entered the mainstream Democratic thinking. GIGOT: I think you will see a lot of Democrats not adopt abolish ICE, Mary. I think they will just drop it and not talk about it. Trump wants to talk about it all the time. That's how he wants to define this issue between now and November. KISSEL: I think that's why you saw 133 Democrats vote present on this bill supporting ICE. And it's also why you saw some Pennsylvania Democrats, Conor Lamb, Matt Cartwright, vote for the bill because they are in Trump country, and they realize that, and they would like to keep their office. GIGOT: Bill, it also accentuates the issue a little bit of crime. You've got M.S.-13, which ravages some neighborhoods we know here in New York state and elsewhere, and nobody wants that, Democrat or Republican. But ICE is fighting that group. MCGURN: Right. I think it goes back to your point. It's not just -- it's lawlessness. And if lawlessness becomes a defining part of the issue, the Republicans will gain. And they won't back -- they will prefer to keep this as live as an issue. GIGOT: It is a shame because both sides are in their respective camps and we can't seem to get anything done ever on immigration. When we come back, from abolishing ICE to single-payer health care, a look at the Democrats' left turn and the growing strength of progressives within the party. Karl Rove on what it means for the midterms, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y., CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: We need to occupy every airport, we need to occupy every border, we need to occupy every ICE office until those kids are back with their parents. We're not going to win if we don't stand for anything. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: That was Democratic Congressional Candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week calling on activists to occupy ICE offices. Ocasio-Cortez, who ousted long-time New York Congressman Joe Crowley in last month's primary, is just one of the candidates pulling the party left ahead of the November midterms. Last weekend, California Democrats dealt a blow to another party elder, endorsing progressive State Senator Kevin DeLeon over four-term Senator Dianne Feinstein. The 51-year-old DeLeon is the author of California's sanctuary state legislation and backs a single-payer health care system. \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and FOX News contributor, Karl Rove, served as deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to President George W. Bush. So welcome, Karl. How divided are Democrats going into this election? KARL ROVE, COLUMNIST & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, increasingly divided because you just touched on a couple of them. We've seen this throughout the primary season, that in cases of races where the Democrats had a shot to win, they threw it away by going hard left. The key example to me was Nebraska, too. This is the most Democratic part of Nebraska. It is part of the state that Obama carried, that Hillary Clinton did well in. They had a Democratic congressman until recently. He was trying to get the Democrat nod back again. And he'd have a shot in the general election. But the Democrats instead went hard left with a woman named Kara Eastman, who is in favor of Medicare for all, free college, a guaranteed job with a guaranteed paycheck. And in a Midwest district like that, that is sane and sensible, even a lot of Democrats are going to find that too much to go for. GIGOT: But you know, Karl, look, Ocasio-Cortez, it seems to me, has a point at least on one thing, and that is enthusiasm and energy and passion. And if you stand for something, you're going to motivate people to vote. In 2010, as you know, the response from Republicans to President Obama was driven, in part, by that kind of passion. Voters know that Trump is going to have the veto authority. But the Democrats may be motivated enough to put a check on that and some of these issues may not matter as much. ROVE: Well, maybe. But look, she comes from a very liberal district that is not representative of the country. When she goes out to campaign around the country, she's going to raise questions that local candidates are going to have to raise. In Dallas, Texas, in the 32nd congressional district, Collin Allred -- if she comes in and campaigns for Collin Allred, people will ask him, do you agree with her that Israel is conducting an illegal occupation of Palestine? Are you in favor of free jobs, free health care, free college? Are you in favor of that kind of an agenda? Are you a Democratic Socialist? Some of that stuff will work well if you are in, you know, San Francisco, but to win the House, the Democrats will have to win a lot of seats in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and Texas, and the parts of California that don't like how they voted in the bay area. So -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: So, Karl, then what you do is you don't invite Ocasio-Cortez or Elizabeth Warren in those districts. You invite Bill Clinton or somebody who is more popular in those districts. ROVE: Sure, but, look, this is a sentiment that is grabbing -- that is gaining strength inside the Democratic Party. Here in Texas, they nominated a rock star named Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke for the U.S. Senate against Ted Cruz. I think it is hilarious, in Texas, we have the Anglo, Robert Francis O'Rourke running as Beto, and we have the Hispanic, Rafael Cruz running as Ted. But that's the way it is. But Beto O'Rourke came out this week in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. It may be popular in the confines of the Democratic Party, but it won't be popular in a red state like Texas. Or take Scott Wallace in Pennsylvania one. This is a district held by a Republican, won by Hillary Clinton. They nominate the most left-wing guy running in the primary, who turns out to have contributed $300,000 to organizations that support disinvestment in Israel. And it is -- the district has the 38th highest percentage of concentration of Jewish voters of any district in the country. So, yes. Look, it matters that you stand for something. But if what you stand for something is hard-left politics, and you're running in sort of middle America, then the Democratic Party is not going to win as many seats as it might otherwise have won. GIGOT: One of the things we have seen throughout the special elections in the last 12 months is that Democrats have outperformed what you would have had expectations for voter turnout. That's, in part, generated by enthusiasm. A lot of this -- we saw this in Virginia, in particular, is anti-Trump enthusiasm. Why isn't the best Democratic argument were to be simply something like this, we are going to put a check on President Trump. You want checks and balances? The Republicans aren't doing it. We're going to put the check on Trump. ROVE: That would be a good strategy, but instead, they've got \"for the people\" and increasing numbers of their candidates are defining their agenda by adopting left-wing positions, Medicare for all, free college, guaranteed jobs and so forth. But you're right. If they ran a sort of centrist, you know, we're going to work together, Republicans and Democrats, to achieve good things for the country, we're relatively moderate centrist liberal Democrats, we're not nuts calling for impeachment, we're not calling for the overthrow of the government, they could win a lot of seats. But that's not the kind of candidates they are nominating in some critical races. But you're right, if they were smart, that's what they would do. Take, for example, your old stomping grounds, Wisconsin. The Iron Stash, who is a left winger running in Wisconsin, won. It turns out to not only be left wing but turns out to be a deadbeat who couldn't either pay back loans to his former wife or pay his child support payments, but he sounded good to Democrats in that district because he was the most left wing. GIGOT: All right, Karl, we will see how this evolves in the coming months. Thanks for coming in. ROVE: Thank you. GIGOT: Still ahead, President Trump doubling down on auto tariff threats, despite growing opposition from lawmakers and industry leaders. So can E.U. officials work out a deal with the administration when they come to Washington next week? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: They are going to be coming on July 25th to negotiate with us. We said, if we don't negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution, which we don't want to use, but we have tremendous powers. We have to. Including cars. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: That was President Trump Wednesday promising tremendous retribution if his meeting with the European Union officials next week doesn't result in what he considers fairer trade deals. The president is scheduled to sit down Wednesday with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker amid administration threats to slap tariffs on imported cars and auto parts. But resistance to the tariffs is growing with a coalition of foreign and domestic auto companies, dealers and auto part makers, asking the president not to move forward with the penalties. A bipartisan group of nearly 150 lawmakers urging the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to back away from the tariffs. We're back with Bill McGurn, Mary Kissel, and Jason Riley. So, Bill, there's a school of thought that says -- has said for some time, the president's trade threats are really just a negotiating ploy, that he will back away at the end and it won't go ahead. I'm increasingly of the belief that he really wants this kind of a tariff war, and he really wants to stick it to German automobiles. What do you think? BILL MCGURN COLUMNIST: I hope not. I mean, the problem with trade wars is there are a lot of innocent bystanders that get hurt. You don't always know those costs. I think what you see especially with the European Union reaction is when you make these threats, they're more than willing to come back and do the same thing to us. You know, there's not a lot of quiet players. The Chinese would probably prefer to work out a deal quietly with us. But you get into it with the European Union, it is like a game of chicken with a truck bearing down on you. GIGOT: Jason, the Germans, in particular, seem to be his target. He has an obsession -- I don't think that's too strong a word -- (LAUGHTER) GIGOT: -- with German cars. I mean, it sounds to me like he's determined to do it. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: I think he is determined to do it. You have to take him at his word. He's campaigned on this and it's something he's determined to follow through on, for better or worse, mostly for worse I think. Particularly in states that helped elect him, Paul. That's one of the things that's hard to figure out here, whether it's cars or aluminum or farm products. You have companies like Alcoa, aluminum maker, their shares are tumbling because they import from Canada. That's gotten more expensive. Alcoa is based in Pittsburgh. Trump won Pennsylvania. (CROSSTALK) RILEY: And Iowa farmers traveling over to China trying to preserve deals there that have been harmed due to the Chinese trade war. Trump won Iowa. Is this what those voters signed up for? GIGOT: Alcoa is a company that was supposed -- an American aluminum maker. It is the kind of company that Trump said the tariffs would help. In the earnings call this week, you have them saying the tariffs are hurting. Their earnings are down 15 percent or so. So I guess -- and you see this marshalling, Mary, of the domestic companies and the foreign automakers who invest here. Everybody really except for the united autoworkers which has I would say issued tepid support for the tariffs, but everybody else against it. Can Trump still move ahead in the face of that opposition? MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER: Well, I think it depends on what happens to the stock market, Paul. The one indicator that he watches very closely. Look, BMW's largest plant in the world is in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a district that Trump won with more than 60 percent. Now, we haven't seen the effects of these tariffs on the markets. But I think when that happens, Trump is going to wake up. Now, on the European side, my question is, do the Europeans get it yet? Because they didn't believe that Trump would pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. They didn't believe he was going to pull out of the Iran deal. They didn't believe he was going to put tariffs on. So if I were sitting in Brussels, I would be coming to Washington with something to offer Trump, whether it's a loosening of, I don't know, agricultural tariffs. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: No, no, no. No, that is not going to work. (CROSSTALK) KISSEL: -- come ready to deal. GIGOT: Car tariffs it's got to be. It's got to be on automobiles. And it's got to be, at a minimum, it would seem to me, essentially the same rate on tariffs. And I'm not sure even that is going to work because the Germans are going to say, you have a 20 percent tariff on trucks here. KISSEL: I don't know about that, Paul. I think if the Europeans came with a deal to Trump and they could both stand up and proclaim victory and walk away -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Yes, but it has to be on cars. KISSEL: I think both sides would be happy. GIGOT: My point is, it has to be on cars. It can't be farm products. RILEY: Another point worth making is that other countries seem willing to move on and make deals without us. Japan and the E.U. have gotten together to cut deals without the U.S. We lose out economically in cases like that. But we also lose out in terms of influence in the region. There's much more at stake here than simply cars and tariffs. GIGOT: Bill, what about the danger here that this now becomes also a currency war? The president lashed out this week at the falling Yuan and the falling Euro because of the strong dollar. I don't think he understands that one of the reasons the dollar is so strong is because so much foreign capital coming here -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: -- because of the tax reform and the deregulation and faster growth. MCGURN: It is a vote of confidence in his policies, right? Got to know who your friends are. Look, I think Mary makes a good point when she pointed out about the BMW plants over here. I mean, today, what is an American car? What is -- it is such a multifaceted thing. It reminds me, for many years, for about 20 years, there was a dumping suit by Brother typewriter, Japanese company, building typewriters in America against Smith Corona, an American company, building typewriters in Asia. It just ended. It's just ridiculous. GIGOT: I still have my Olivetti, Bill, I'll have you know. (LAUGHTER) MCGURN: You were always a sucker for those foreign -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: I don't know where that was made, but very stylish portable typewriter. I took it on the road in Asia. Still ahead, Google is slapped with a record fine as the European Union accuses the tech giant of anti-trust violations. What it means for Google and its competitors when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: The European Union this week slapped Google with a record $5 billion fine, accusing the tech giant of violating anti-trust laws by requiring that its Chrome browser and search engine be automatically installed on phones that use its Android operating system. Andy Kessler writes \"The Inside View\" column for the Wall Street Journal and he's founder of the Silicon Valley hedge fund, Velocity Capital. Andy, great to see you. Thanks for coming in. What do you make of the E.U.'s fine this week and the charges against Google? ANDY KESSLER, COLUMNIST & FOUNDER, VELOCITY CAPITAL: Well, the fine itself is irrelevant. You look at the numbers, $830 billion market cap, $100 billion in cash, $13 billion in profits last year. That's not the problem. It is the concept of they are annoyed about 11 apps they installed, including maps and search and assistance, trying to say that's anticompetitive. But Google, Android, it is a platform. It is a platform for others to compete on. Lyft versus Uber and Spotify versus Pandora. It is a wonderful competitive environment and they compete against Apple. Bureaucrats are bureaucrats so they had to do something. GIGOT: They say, look, when they go to a handset maker and they say if you want to use Android, you have to put these -- our apps, Google Maps, YouTube, first. KESSLER: Sure. GIGOT: That's favoritism to Google. KESSLER: Well, yes, but you get the operating system for free rather than spending billions of dollars -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: Develop your own, yes. KESSLER: And Samsung, for example, puts their own apps on there. Users can hit delete and put their own apps on it. It is just like the P.C. business and the browser wars. In a sense, it became obsolete almost at the time that Microsoft got their hands slapped. GIGOT: So you think they are looking through the rearview mirror here and technology will somehow make all of this irrelevant? KESSLER: Yes. I mean, phones have already peaked, right? I mean, we're starting to look at what the next platform might be. But my issue is, if you're Google, what do you do? They are going to appeal. They have appealed. That's fine. But you can't let the European Commission of Competition get away with it. If I was Google, I would do the following. There's a billion-plus Android phones that ship every year. Got to figure at least 100 million, probably multiple hundreds of millions ship into Europe. You can shut them off but then you are hurting yourself. Instead, what I would do is I would say, OK, let's create an activation fee, $50, 50 Euros, and not payable to Google but payable to the E.U. You would have to write a check or -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: So the individual user of the Android phone would have to pay the fee. KESSLER: Yes, don't even let them do it electronically. Make them go to a bank or a post office. This thing would blow over in a week. There would be such an uproar and it would never happen. GIGOT: People would blame the E.U. and not Google. KESSLER: Exactly. GIGOT: Are you sure? KESSLER: Yes, it is just like the tariffs. If there's a tariff on my imported Mercedes-Benzes, if I had to pay that money to the U.S. government rather than to the dealer I would go, what do you mean I have to pay? GIGOT: Let me ask you another issue about Google, market cap almost $900 billion, astonishing. Is there a problem in your mind from an anti-trust point of view in the way they use algorithms to steer users to certain kinds of content? For example, their content and advertisers that they want to steer it to. KESSLER: Sure, that was the other European fine they paid for steering people towards their shopping site. You know, it is better to have transparency, to have the algorithms so transparent that if you wanted to have your ad placed first, maybe you would pay more. It's always going to be an issue with platforms, but the more visibility there's -- and you don't see advertisers complaining. You see bureaucrats complaining. But you don't see advertisers complaining because they can get to users. The nice thing about Google, you know the effectiveness of your ad. If it doesn't work, you don't run it again. GIGOT: I want to ask you, as a market analyst, the big companies, the Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Apple have dominated the market. But you wrote an intriguing column this week saying that maybe the seeds of their decline are already planted. Explain what you meant. KESSLER: Well, on Wall Street, it is easy to buy a stock. I'm going to buy the stock. It is going to be the next greatest thing. But no one knows when to sell. I think you need an exit strategy. The day you buy it, you figure out what is going to go wrong eventually. You know, look at Netflix. It blew up this week, right? The subscriber numbers were a million shy, and they took the stock down. When I look at the other ones, some are more obvious than others. Apple seeds of destruction or what we just talked about, is the phone market has kind of peaked. Everyone has one. They don't wear out. Similarly, Facebook, they have a problem in that, you know, they need 2-point-something billion users, doubled in five years. I don't think it is going to double again. They're not allowed in China. Russia has competition for Facebook. What happens as that growth rate kind of slows? Investors get a little nervous and start running for the hills. GIGOT: And that's what you've got to look for as an investor. When is the turn? KESSLER: You look for it the day you invest. And then you keep an eye on it. Say, what are the signs that I'm looking for? Because stocks go up in euphoria, right? Google, Amazon, every day the stock goes up. What is going to go wrong? So that you can be ahead of everyone else. GIGOT: Read Andy's column to tell you when to do that, by the way. All right, thanks for being here. We have to take one more break. When we come back, \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Time now for \"Hits & Misses\" of the week -- Jason? RILEY: This is a miss for former President Barack Obama who went to South Africa this week and gave a speech announcing identity politics. Now I'm opposed to identity politics, too. But this was the same Barack Obama who spent eight years in office making overt appeals to voters based on race and sexual orientation and gender and, suddenly, he decides this is a bad thing. This has to do with the fact that Barack Obama isn't running for office anymore, Paul. GIGOT: So he can oppose it. Well, maybe Michelle will. I don't know. All right. Bill? MCGURN: Paul, three-quarters of a hit to the Republican Senate for setting a record this week, 23 appellate court nominees confirmed, the most since George H.W. Bush. I would give them a full hit except, on Thursday, they botched the nomination of Ryan Bounds to the ninth circuit for a complicated number of reasons. But it's a reminder with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation coming up, this is a team sport and when you have 50-49 majority, you all got to show up. GIGOT: All right. Mary? KESSEL: I'm giving a miss to Turkey for its continued detention of American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who has spent almost two years behind bars on trumped-up charges. A court this week sent him back to jail based on witnesses and other ludicrous things. The Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Turkey and President Erdogan to get him and other American hostages out of jail. But, Paul, I'm afraid they may have to exact more leverage on Ankara to get results. GIGOT: All right. Thank you all. Remember, if you have your own hit or miss, be sure to tweet it to us, @jeronfnc. That is it for this week's show. Thanks to the panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. Hope to see you right here next week.

            "article_content": "Why did conservative House members have to go around Paul Ryan's back in effort to achieve a vote on immigration? Rep. Jeff Denham shares his perspective on 'The Story.' Republican moderates in the U.S. House late Tuesday were reportedly two signatures shy of forcing a vote on a proposal addressing DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), the Obama-era program for delaying deportations of those who entered the U.S. illegally as children. Many believe the bill would have passed if it had reached the House floor. The moderate wing was promised a chance to vote next week on other immigration bills. Moderates needed 218 votes on a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d that would have forced a vote on the DACA proposal, but secured 216. The parliamentary gambit \u2013 a rarely used tactic to circumvent committee approval and the speaker to bring a bill to the House floor \u2013 would\u2019ve forced members to debate a series of immigration bills, including a more bipartisan one that has the backing of all Democrats and some Republicans, according to Reuters. If they stumble on the immigration bills next week, the discharge petition remains alive. Thus, those who may want to sign may still do so. If they command 218 signatures by mid July, the House could consider the discharge petition on the next eligible date for such tactics: July 23 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has been reluctant to press forward with a vote on the bipartisan bill that would give Democrats a major win as election season nears, Reuters reported. Tuesday was the deadline to force votes this month. The failure of Tuesday\u2019s discharge position is not much of a surprise, as the House has successfully initiated such a maneuver only twice in the past 16 years. The most recent time was on a plan to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank in 2015. Before that, it was the House\u2019s version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, known as \u201cShays-Meehan.\u201d Moderates were promised a vote on a compromise immigration plan that would likely include a path to citizenship for DACA participants -- aka \u201cDreamers\u201d -- although details of the plan were still being worked out. Conservatives will also reportedly get a chance to vote on a bill they favor that addresses a path to legal status rather than citizenship. \u201cMembers across the Republican Conference have negotiated directly and in good faith with each other for several weeks, and as a result, the House will consider two bills next week that will avert the discharge petition and resolve the border security and immigration issues,\" a spokeswoman for Ryan said in a statement. Congress was saddled with the immigration issue after President Donald Trump called last year for an end to the program that protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. Federal court orders have kept the program functioning for now. Republican Party leaders worked to derail the moderates\u2019 petition by promising votes later this year on legislation that tackles migrant agricultural workers and rules that force employers to verify workers\u2019 citizenship using a government online system, three aides familiar with the negotiations told the Associated Press. The Republicans spoke on condition of anonymity in describing private talks. U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus chair, said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in Republican leadership for \u201cderailing a legislative process that would have given the American public a debate and vote on legislation that addresses DACA.\u201d \u201cBecause of House Republican Leadership\u2019s reckless and political actions, hundreds of thousands of Dreamers continue to live in an avoidable and cruel limbo,\u201d Grisham said in a statement. House Republicans are scheduled to meet behind closed doors Wednesday to further address the issue that leadership fears could hurt them at the polls come November. U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., a leader of the centrists, praised his group for moving the conversation of immigration reform off the backburner. \"Our goal has always been to force the House to debate and consider meaningful immigration reform, and today we're one step closer,\" Curbelo said. Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "October's good economic news is tempered by market volatility; former Reagan economist Art Laffer breaks down the impact on midterm Election Day. This is a rush transcript from \"Journal Editorial Report,\" November 3, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to flood into your communities. (BOOING) TRUMP: Depleting our resources and overwhelming our nation. We don't want that. (CHEERING) TRUMP: Republicans believe we must defend our borders. We have to defend the borders of our country. And that country is a country that we love, the United States of America. (CHEERING) (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL GIGOT, FOX HOST: Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report\" as we count down to Tuesday's critical midterm elections. I'm Paul Gigot. And that was President Trump making his closing argument in Belgrade, Montana moments ago, and continuing to put immigration front and center in the final days of the campaign. The president hoping to rally Republican voters to turn out Tuesday by framing the issue as a matter of law and order. So is that a smart strategy? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnist Kim Strassel, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley. Jason, let's start with the fundamental question. It is no question, immigration, immigration, in the final days. Is that smart? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Well, I think not all Republicans agree with this strategy. There are some running trying to get more moderate voters and this will make it more challenging. \u00a0But I think the president's calculation is that is a net-plus for his party. He is thinking, listen, Congressional Republicans, without my voters at the polls on Tuesday you are going down. I have to do what I have to do to get my voters out there. This will get them out there. So this is what I'm going to do. GIGOT: He thinks they might not respond to the economic success of the better economy, that this is something that will drive those voters to the polls, the economy won't? RILEY: Well, he believes this is the strategy that helped get him elected two years ago. GIGOT: He is not on the ballot, Jason. RILEY: But his voters have to come out or the Republicans will not do very well. But I would add more substantive level, Paul, he is the president of the United States. Borders do matter. We are a sovereign country. There are thousands of people headed to the border with the intent of causing chaos on the border. He has a duty to intervene. Even on substantive level, I think there something to this. GIGOT: Let's take that one at a time. Substance first. Is there really a crisis at the border? There are caravans coming but, on the other hand, some have dissipated and we have people in place to handle it? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: No, I think there is a crisis. \u00a0What there really is as a crisis is immigration policy in this country. \u00a0That is a bipartisan crisis. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress has failed to address it, therefore, you get a situation like we have at the border. Now, this caravan is coming. It will arrive at the border. \u00a0Donald Trump did not create the caravan. Donald Trump is not responsible for what is going on in Honduras. GIGOT: Right. HENNINGER: He went through this last July when you had the family separation fiasco down there. What it proved is the federal bureaucracies are incapable of processing and handling this many people when they come across the border. So you default to, I think, the president saying, I have to do something about this. And I think most Americans would agree with that. GIGOT: You would agree even sending military to the border in a support role? HENNINGER: Well, yes. The question is whether President Trump is overplaying his hand on the immigration issue. I think it is telling to look at states in which he is appearing this weekend Friday through Sunday. \u00a0It's Indiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. \u00a0These are all states with very close Senate elections. I think what the president is trying to do is win the Senate elections for the Republicans. \u00a0It forces every other Republican candidate in the country to run on this issue in places like Pennsylvania and California where they would rather not. That is what he has done. GIGOT: Kim, let's turn to the raw politics here. If Dan is right about the Senate races, OK, driving Republican turnout, but there's a lot of Republican House races where some House Republicans don't really want that kind of an immigration message. Some have tried to separate from the president's policy on immigration. I'm think of Will Hurd, for example, in southern Texas, thinking about Carlos Curbelo in Miami-Dade County, they've really -- this may not be the best way to close for them? KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Well, immigration overall is not their favorite subject, that's true, but immigration has different pieces and parts. Dan just mentioned family separation. Not a good look for Republicans. But this particular issue, the view within the White House, when you're talking about border control, you're talking about law and order, this is something that not only rallies Trump partisans and the base but it also sends a signal to Independents who are legitimately concerned about this question, and border control and law and order question. So this debut is a better way going at it. And look at Democratic response. \u00a0The fact they don't really want to talk about this, and there are even candidates supporting the president's move to send troops down to the border -- I'm thinking of Kyrsten Sinema out in Arizona, very close Senate race there -- they view -- the White House views this as a better form of the issue. Also, one that takes away from other things they would rather not talk about, for instance, the shooting in Pittsburgh last week. RILEY: I would add to Dan's point whether the president is overplaying his hand, Donald Trump wouldn't be Donald Trump if he didn't overplay his hand. (LAUGHTER) But the same people criticizing him for this are the same people that support more sanctuary cities. The same people have been going around saying abolish ICE, the immigration enforcement officials. These people are not -- they don't want any response, Paul. These are people who want the border erased, not fixed. You have to take with a grain of salt what some on the left are saying in terms of complaining about overreach on part of the White House on this matter. GIGOT: I still think if they had struck a deal, which was -- a year ago -- legalize the DREAMers in exchange for more money for the wall and border security, they had the potential to get that deal until the extremes on both sides decided not to accept it. Then I think that would have benefit the Republicans as the party in power, and given these members of the party in power and given these members in districts that are swing distributes another accomplishment? HENNINGER: Yes, it would have but it just didn't happen. We're left with what we've got. I think it is also revealing that the president isn't campaigning in Nevada and Arizona, two at-risk seats. I guess he thinks he won't help there. GIGOT: All right, thank you. Still ahead, the economy and the midterms, stock market turmoil is stronger than expected, jobs report, what it all means as voters head to the polls on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: America now has the best economy in the history of our country and we want to keep it that way. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: In the last month alone, we added another 250,000 jobs, and nearly 600,000 Americans returned to the workforce. (CHEERING) TRUMP: We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election. Nobody would have believed that. The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in more than 50 years. (END VIDEO CLIP) GIGOT: President Trump in Indianapolis last night touting a stronger-than- expected jobs report. The U.S. economy adding 250,000 jobs in October, blowing past expectations in the final snapshot of the labor market before Election Day. Average hourly wages also rose and are now 3.1 percent above a year ago, the fastest increase in a decade. That good economic news tempered by market volatility. October marking the worst month for stocks in seven years amid concerns over trade wars and higher interest rates. So what will voters make of the economy as they head to the polls on Tuesday? Economist Arthur Laffer is the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates. \u00a0He served as an advisor to President Ronald Reagan. Welcome, Arthur. Always good to see you. ART LAFFER, FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN, LAFFER ASSOCIATES: Thank you, Paul. GIGOT: Just how good is this economy right now? LAFFER: It looks pretty good. We have a long way to go before it's certifiably great. But we've had 4.2 percent GDP growth in the second quarter. The first estimate for the third quarter is 3.5 percent. Both of which are very, very nice numbers. The jobs report is a great number. \u00a0But, again, after we've been going down so long, for 16 years, we have to do it for a long time before we really get up to the prosperity we need. \u00a0Every trip takes a first step, and this is a really good first step, Paul. \u00a0I'm very happy. GIGOT: To what do you attribute the change? As you look at data, remember, last half of 2015 and all of 2016 we barely skirted a recession - - LAFFER: I know. GIGOT: -- a 2017 recession. Now 2018, accelerated to an even higher plane. What is the reason? LAFFER: Could it possibly be tax cuts, regulatory reform -- GIGOT: Could be. LAFFER: -- good monetary policy, a real attempt at trade? The one thing it's not, Paul, is spending control. GIGOT: Right. LAFFER: This is way, way out of control. But I expect Trump to address that next year. But we have had great economic policies. They're really working, just like we said they would, by the way, Paul. Remember that debate we had there in New York. GIGOT: Right. LAFFER: We were completely right on the line. The growth rates are there. \u00a0Let's just hope they continue. We have a lot of room left to grow by the way. The participation rate can go up at least another two or three points. Productivity can rise a lot and be there for a long time. It has been very low for a long time. \u00a0Working hours, I mean, that can rise a lot. What we saw in the jobs report as well was a decline in the part-time employment for economic reasons, which is, you know, a bad sign. With that falling, it is really great. It adds to average hours. So all of these things are happening in the way I hoped they would. I hope they continue but I expect they will. GIGOT: Where do you see anything to worry about? Are you worried at all about the stock market volatility? LAFFER: Of course. GIGOT: Are you worried about the Fed raising interest rates? LAFFER: I'm not worried about the Fed. I think the Fed is doing just the right thing. We need interest rates at the market-clearing rate, not at a low rate. For the last eight, nine years, we've had the Yellen/Bernanke zero interest rates. And that meant no money flooding into the housing market. So we had the lowest new-housing starts per 10,000 population. \u00a0Probably the last nine years were the lowest nine years in history. Now we have the rates coming up, which will attract capital to those markets. \u00a0Frankly, I'm very excited about that. I think Powell is doing a great job. GIGOT: OK. LAFFER: I am worried about trade and I am worried about spending. But I always worry about stuff, Paul. And -- GIGOT: No you don't, Art. You're the most optimistic man in the world. LAFFER: I am, I am. But we have the tax cuts behind us. That is the best bill ever. That tax bill had almost no mistakes in it at all. The deregulation is just fantastic. Monetary policy, I think Trump and Larry Kudlow are doing a great job on getting some trade negotiations. If the president meets with Xi in Argentina, I can't help but think this will be huge plus for America and China. GIGOT: OK. How much of that is at risk if there's a change in the Congress? Obviously President Trump has the veto pen, so he can veto anything they do. LAFFER: Sure. GIGOT: There will not be big enough margins to overrule him on most of that. But on other hand, the Democrats could push him in a different direction. Are you worried about that this? LAFFER: Not really. Democrats are not as bad as they are made out to be and Republicans are not as good they are made out to be. Jack Kennedy was one of the greatest presidents ever with tax cuts and growth. I voted for Bill Clinton twice. I thought he was a spectacular president. Obviously, I loved Reagan. And I like Trump. I think Trump is really spectacular. \u00a0And if the Democrats take over the House, I don't see why they can't think correctly as well on economics. Everyone knows that tax-rate reductions in the right time and circumstances increase economic growth. It is just common sense. You can't tax an economy into prosperity. They may well start to work with Republicans and work with Trump. GIGOT: Why isn't the -- why aren't Republicans, when you look at the elections, the polls, the prospects they might lose the House, why aren't they are getting more credit for this economic turnaround? LAFFER: I don't know that they aren't. We'll see what the elections are. \u00a0In 1982, even though we had the tax bill passed and all that, Reagan got hammered in the off election. It wasn't until 1984 that President Reagan really got it. We squeaked by in the presidency there. We only won 49 out 50 states. It was a real closer. But I think that's going to happen. We have not had enough prosperity yet where people really feel this expansion and all that. It is coming, and it's coming very quickly. By the time we get to 2019 and 2020, I think it will be roaring. Trump will get a lot of credit for that. GIGOT: Any elections in particular, governorships, House or Senate, where you think the economy is worth noting -- (CROSSTALK) LAFFER: Yes. One is really big, and that's the governor's race in Connecticut. GIGOT: OK. LAFFER: A guy named Bob Stefanowski is running against Ned Lamont. \u00a0Stefanowski is a pro-growth, free market, Democratic economic supply-sider, versus a stagnant governor who is trying to raise taxes and doing all of that. It's the classic clash between pro-growth and anti-growth. Bob Stefanowski, if he can pull it out in blue Connecticut, this will be a game-changer. The other one I love is in Colorado. Jared Polis, a Democrat, is running on tax cuts, or potentially on tax cuts. He was my intern for years in my office. I've been on all his family boards. He's is spectacular, a Democrat, and a pro-growth Democrat. (CROSSTALK) LAFFER: So we've got some real, real cutting-edge issues coming along that I'm terribly excited about. GIGOT: I should add, Arthur, that you did advised Stefanowski in Connecticut on his tax proposal. LAFFER: I sure did. GIGOT: OK. LAFFER: But also, Jared Polis. And I'm very much involved in a lot of governors' races, in South Carolina, here in Tennessee. I've been involved in maybe seven or eight. GIGOT: All right. Arthur, thanks. We'll see what happens. Appreciate your being here. LAFFER: We're ready and watching. GIGOT: When we come back, the battle for control of Congress -- LAFFER: Thanks, Paul. GIGOT: -- is coming down to the wire with the number of competitive races continuing to grow in the campaign's final days. We'll tell you which races to watch as the results roll in on Tuesday. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: With just three days to go until Election Day, a look now at the battle of control of the House. The latest RealClearPolitics poll average giving Democrats a 7.5 percent advantage over Republicans in the generic ballot, with 49.4 percent saying they support Democratic candidate in their district compared to 41.9 percent who said they will back Republican. Democrats need to flip 23 seats to take control of the House. \u00a0And their clearest path to victory goes through the 25 Republican-held districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Jason Riley. Kim, Democrats say it's all but assured. Nancy Pelosi guarantying a victory like Babe Ruth going to hit that home run. Republicans are saying, well, we could hold out and win it by couple seats. Who has the better chance of being right? STRASSEL: You know, if you look at all of the things that are going for Democrats, that ought to favor their argument. You have got history. \u00a0Traditionally, the party out of power gains in midterms. They have massively outspent Republicans in just about every one of these races. You had unprecedented huge numbers of Republican retirements that opened up a lot of opportunities for them. On other hand, Paul, if look at what is coming in, the early voting seems to show enormous amount of Republican enthusiasm on the back of the Kavanaugh fight. That has given Republican as lot of hope. And the other thing I would mention is, if you really dig into a lot of polling data, a lot of it is very sparse. It happened months ago. We just don't necessarily know what the state of a lot of these races. I think still think it's a jump ball. Whoever does win, it is likely it's going to be by a very narrow amount, which will present interesting governing problems and issues going ahead, too. GIGOT: Interesting, RealClearPolitics, says 203 Democrats and 196 Republican seats are now likely or guaranteed for the Republicans -- safe seats. If that happens, there are 36 tossups. But Republicans would have to win -- I think only five are in Republican -- are in Democratic districts. Republicans have to win 22 of those 36. RILEY: I think the map right now does favors a narrow Democratic majority. Kim mentioned early voting, and it has been huge. Something like 29 million people have already voted. GIGOT: We have the biggest turnout in a midterm in many, many years. RILEY: Right. In some states, the number of early voters is double what it was four years ago. There's tremendous amount of enthusiasm. But that usually works to the benefit of Democrats when you get those the high turnout numbers. So that is another indication the map is favoring them right now. But this Congress, they have a lot to brag about, Paul. They have gotten a lot done, with deregulation, the corporate tax cut, particularly in the energy sector where we're seeing a lot of growth. They do have something to run on here. And I think, you know, some of them tried to make that an issue in the campaign. Others have not been able to. But they do have something to write home about. GIGOT: Any particular seats you're looking at, Dan, as bellwethers? HENNINGER: Yes, I will watch New Jersey, specifically New Jersey 11, where incumbent Republican, Jay Webber, is running against a newcomer, Mikie Sherrill, a woman, who is Annapolis graduate, former Navy helicopter pilot, former federal prosecutor. She's running for the first time, has raised millions of dollars. This is in northern New Jersey, suburban seat, moderate Republicans, central. She's running as a centrist. Also, in New Jersey 11, you have the incumbent, Leonard Lance, running against Tom Malinowski, a former Obama official. He is running against a centrist. \u00a0These New Jersey seats are going to be indicative because we'll get returns early in the evening, Paul. If they go Democratic, it will be a long night for Republicans. If perchance, one or both Republicans hold their seats, that will be an excellent sign for the Republican Party. GIGOT: Kim, you have one or two you want us to look at? STRASSEL: Yes, I'm looking at Kentucky six. This is Republican district. \u00a0It went for Romney by 14 points, Trump by 15. Andy Barr, the Republican, this is -- it has a Democratic core, Lexington City, surrounded by 19 very rural bluegrass counties. He has done everything right. But he is running against Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, Democrat. She has been running as a moderate. She had tons of money. This is one the Republicans ought to put away. If those early returns come in and show he has lost, it is going to be a bad night for the GOP. By contrast, also looking at Florida 26. You mentioned Carlos Curbelo. This is Clinton district. She won it by 16 points, southern Florida, very Hispanic. He is Cuban-American Republican. He's trying to put distance between himself and the president. \u00a0If he manages to squeak out a victory, it might suggest Republicans who distanced themselves a little bit, running a more-nuanced campaign, might had made some traction with voters. GIGOT: Jason? RILEY: I'm looking at Upstate New York, a district held by John Faso, a Republican. It is a swing district. Obama won in 2012. It swung very sharply to Trump in 2016. He opponent is a guy name Antonio Delgado, one of a number of black progressives running in this cycle across the country. \u00a0The race is very close, within the margin of error. As with the New Jersey race, we'll find out early. If Faso holds on to, it probably won't be the blue wave that some Democrats are hoping for. GIGOT: And it's interesting. The ideological difference between this Faso and this Democratic is really wide. And that's the real difference now between the House majority and a Democrat majority in the House. It is a real big ideological difference. Still ahead, heading into the final days of the midterm campaign, some key Senate races are too close to call. We'll tell you which seats will determine whether Republicans can maintain control when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Republicans fighting to retain control of the Senate on Tuesday and maybe even pick up a seat or two. The GOP now holds a narrow 51-49 majority and with unusually high number of races still considered tossups heading into Election Day. We're back with a look at races to watch. So, Dan, I think, if you talk to the pros, only real guaranteed Republican pickup, Heidi Heitkamp, in North Dakota. That would bump them up. Seven races appear to be very close and could go either way, including three that Republicans hold, Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, which is not done yet. So this could conceivably be a Democratic night. They could end up at the end of the night with Senate control. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: They could, or they might not. \u00a0At the moment, the dead heats are in Senate races in Missouri, Nevada, Arizona, Indiana. Kim said earlier, talking about the House races being a jump ball, there has never been a midterm election like this. In the House, in the Senate, and in the governorships, there are an incredible number of races that are within the margin of error across the United States. Now one that I'm looking at is the Senate race in Florida between the current governor, Rick Scott, versus incumbent Democrat, Bill Nelson. They are in a dead-heat. Bear in mind, Florida is the ultimate close state. \u00a0Donald Trump carried it against Hillary Clinton by just over a single point. So what are they doing down there? Rick Scott has run 1,300 ads in the I-4 corridor, down the middle of the state, about defending preexisting conditions. Believe it or not, Bill Nelson has run over 500 ads saying exactly the opposite. That is the intensity with which they're running down there. Governor Scott has made -- taken a lot of time trying to make inroads in Hispanic communities, specifically the Puerto Rican communities living in the I-4 corridor. That may benefit them in the end. But this race is so tight, it's impossible at this point to predict going who is going to be going to the Senate in Florida. GIGOT: Jason? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: I'm looking another one of those tossup states, Missouri, where the incumbent is Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, running against the state attorney general, Josh Hawley. A deep-red state. Trump won by 20 points. McCaskill has been pretty lucky in her Republican opponent. Last time, she got someone who made a ridiculous comment about rape in the closing weeks of the election and skated through. But all through the summer months she had been ahead in the polls. Since September, complete reversal. Hawley has caught up. \u00a0Now the race is essentially a dead-heat. This is example of a state -- we talk about the Republican closing arguments earlier. The Democratic closing arguments in places like Missouri has been health care. They're trying to harp on the fact that Democrats -- Republicans said they would repeal and replace Obamacare. \u00a0They have not done that. So she is talking about things like Medicaid for all, single-payer. He is talking about things like, what to do with people with preexisting conditions and so forth. That is what the race has been about in states where bashing Trump is not going to get you very far. GIGOT: This is a state where -- McCaskill is a pretty liberal voter in the Senate. We'll see if she can get away with pretending to be more conservative than she is. Kim, what are you looking at? KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Arizona. This is for the open seat of retiring Senator Jeff Flake. It is one of those races, as mentioned by Dan, that Republicans cannot afford to lose. And it is his Republican representative, Martha McSally, former fighter pilot, up against a Democratic House representative, Kyrsten Sinema. McSally has been making a big and very compelling argument about the changed fortunes of Arizona under this president, the economy, economic revival, all the good things that have come. Sinema, on the other hand, has been very much bashing, as you were talking about, bashing McSally for her vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare. Definitely making it out to sound as though somehow Republicans are responsible for these soaring health care costs. And Republicans, as we know, across the country, have had a hard time rebutting those arguments. There's also some questions about Sinema. \u00a0She has a very progressive past, and would she actually be the moderate she claims to be. GIGOT: Let's talk about the stakes in the Senate. If the Democrats do win the House and the Senate, Dan, the Trump administration is shut down, basically. HENNINGER: Yes. GIGOT: He will not get any judges approved to the appellate or the Supreme Court, none, zero, that are nominated by The Federalist Society. Nominated a couple -- Larry Tribe, from Harvard. He might make it. A lot of the nominees won't -- for the administration, will have a hard time being filled out. Then, you would lose your leverage in negotiations over the budget. So the stakes in the Senate are very high. HENNINGER: If that happens, Paul, like it or not, the American people will have to get used to the fact that the 2020 presidential election begins next Wednesday morning. That is the only thing that will be going on. There's a school of thought that Republicans feel, if they hold one seat in the Senate and keep that margin you're describing, they will regard it as very successful evening. GIGOT: Upset potential pick, Bog Hugin, the biotech CEO in New Jersey, running against Robert Menendez, who barely escaped conviction of corruption charges. It might be too long a reach, but we'll see if Democrats are willing to give a Republican a chance in New Jersey. Still ahead, with 87 of the nation's 99 legislative changes up for re- election, we'll look what is at stake in the states on Tuesday, next. (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: A look now at what is at stake in the states on Tuesday. We begin with the 87 legislative chambers up for election across the country. And from Colorado to New Hampshire, Democrats hope to make significant gains after nearly a decade of Republican dominance. Tuesday's results will have far-reaching consequences as states gear up for redistricting following the 2020 census. Former Florida Congressman and attorney general, Bill McCollum, is chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, an organization dedicated to gaining and maintaining Republican control of state legislative bodies across the country. Bill, welcome. Good to see you again. (CROSSTALK) BILL MCCOLLUM, R-CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE & FORMER FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN AND ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good to see you, too. GIGOT: This has been one of the great Republican successes under the radar, gaining something like 968 seats under President Obama. They now control 26 governorships and both bodies in the legislature. Democrats only eight. But is this the year that the Democrats start to whittle away at that advantage? MCCOLLUM: Well, it may be whittled but it will not be a big blue wave. \u00a0When we won the big blue wave -- or red wave, I should say, back in 2010, Republicans flipped 21 legislative bodies. That was a big, big number. We won 700 seats in that election. I don't see anything like that on the horizon in this election for the Democrats. We do have contested hot races. We've got several legislative bodies clearly on the line this particular time, and I think they're going to be real contests. It is interesting, all of them are the same tossup type situations that they have been in, in every election cycle we've had for quite some time now. It is a matter who goes out to vote, like many other races, but they're real, real close races in some of these states. GIGOT: Tell us why -- tell our listeners why this matters. One reason, we mentioned redistricting. You have that coming up on 2010. That is going to be -- 2020, after the census. That is the next census. That's crucial because, if you control one legislative body, you can offset a Democratic governor, say. (CROSSTALK) MCCOLLUM: It is congressional redistricting, but also important for the states themselves because, in the states, we've had great success with Republican governors and Republican legislatures in a number of these states. Taxes are lower. The economies boomed. We put school choice into place in many cases, educational reform, Right to Work, many other things that have caused those states to do quite well. Whereas, the states controlled by Democrats, like in Connecticut, and places that - Oregon and other places, haven't done as nearly as well. Going back to redistricting for a minute, the money in this is enormous. \u00a0The Republican State Leadership Committee is the only national Republican organization that puts money in nationally at the state legislative races. \u00a0We put, this cycle, somewhere between $45 million and $50 million. That is about a 25 percent increase over the last cycle. But the Democrats are exponentially larger. They're putting hundreds of millions of dollars to try to win back these various races and legislative bodies in the states. \u00a0They put them in all kinds of places. We see close races. For example, we have only one-seat majorities in Colorado, in a place like New York State, which has been Republican most the time the last half century -- (CROSSTALK) GIGOT: The state Senate. MCCOLLUM: The state Senate. That is definitely in jeopardy. The Colorado Senate as well. In Maine, it is Senate there. In New Hampshire, both the Senate and House. Those are really tough for us. But we still are in a fighting chance of winning them. Others that are much more likely to go our way but are still going to be very close are Wisconsin, Senate. Both the Senate and House in Minnesota. Both Senate and House in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, I think, we'll win both of them but the Senate and House are being contested strongly with a lot of Democrat money. In my home state of Florida, the state Senate is. I think we hold that as we should hold Arizona and other states we're talking about. But it is interesting how much money they put with special groups. GIGOT: Let me ask you about that money. Where is that money coming from? \u00a0Is this coming from a lot of big donors, the Mike Bloombergs, the George Soros and so on? I know, remember, Eric Holder made a specific announcement he was going to try to raise money with redistricting in mind to win these races? MCCOLLUM: Well, that's right. He raised, we think, somewhere in the neighborhood of the $40 million he said he was going to for the congressional redistricting committee that he and President Obama set up. \u00a0We don't know precisely where the money came from because it interchanges a lot. But we also know there's a group called Forward Majority that just put $1.8 million, for example, into several Florida House races just last week. We have the Center for Public Policy, which is very much a left-side group, that has put millions of dollars in. They say they will spend $40 million to $60 million. We -- we don't know where that is coming from. \u00a0That is in addition to the money coming out of the Soros group, coming out of the Steyer group, coming out of the Bloomberg group on the gun issue, coming out of the pro-choice movement, Planned Parenthood, coming from unions and trial lawyers. Presumably, some of the money is coming from trial lawyers and Hollywood types into these other groups. But it's literally hundreds of millions. It's an exponential increase in what has been spent before. Now, their objective is to win the control for 2021. \u00a0This is a step process. (CROSSTALK) MCCOLLUM: And we're very concerned to hold that. GIGOT: Are there any legislators -- legislatures now held by Democrats in states where you think you have a fighting chance to turn them your way? \u00a0You're playing defense, for the most part. What do you want to turn on offense? MCCOLLUM: The interesting part is, despite being at the high-water mark, 67 of 99 bodies that we've been at forever, we still think we can win in Connecticut. Connecticut is a state where -- you heard earlier about the governor's race. GIGOT: Right. MCCOLLUM: We have a tie for the Senate. We should be able to win the Senate there. We may be able to win the House race. It's about four-seats difference there. We think -- we feel real good about that one. Alaska is another one where we think of a chance nailing that down. I think there are a number of states we could pull some surprises that are still out there. But, yes, we're mostly on defense because we are at the high-water mark. \u00a0And we'll probably lose some. I don't think we'll lose very many, but probably will, to be realistic. I want to add one other thing if I can, Paul. GIGOT: Quickly, Bill. MCCOLLUM: And that is, right now, in the Future Majority Project, we put $20 million into in the last few years. We have increased enormously the number of Hispanics and minority and women candidates in the state legislative races and in the state legislatures in this country. And I'm very proud of that. That has a big part to do with why we're doing well. GIGOT: OK. Thank you, Bill McCollum. Appreciate your for coming? MCCOLLUM: You're welcome. GIGOT: When we come back, with 36 governor seats up for election on Tuesday, Democrats are hoping to make gains in typically Republican territory. We'll look at their chances, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: There's 36 governor seats up for election Tuesday with tight races playing out in several key states. Our panel is back with their picks for the governor races to watch. Kim, you're picking one in the Midwest. That is a place where Republican could lose every single race in the upper Midwest. STRASSEL: Yes. This one is -- would be emblematic of that. So this is Wisconsin where Scott Walker is asking for a third term. You know, in some ways, he has a very good story to tell, on the economy, in particular, in the state. He had the public-sector union reform he got through, which also held advantages for the state. He is also running against a Democrat who is not really that charismatic, Tony Evers, head of Wisconsin public schools. On other hand, Democrats have been gunning for Walker forever. \u00a0There's a lot of money coming in against him. I think the bigger problem is that he is -- you know, he is basically, because of the recall, this is the fourth time in eight years he is asking voters to reelect him. There may be a fatigue question going on there. This is one to see whether or not he can pull that out. GIGOT: Also, one of Donald Trump's least-popular states, is Wisconsin, which won't help Walker. Jason, what are you looking at? RILEY: I'm looking at Georgia where secretary of state, Brian Kemp, running against Stacey Abrams. The race is statistically tied. Both sides are putting a lot of money and effort into this race. Last week, Abrams brought in Oprah, Paul, and Kemp brought in Mike Pence. Gives you an idea of the stakes. What is it interesting about the race, Abrams is running as an unabashed progressive. She is pro-abortion, she is anti-gun rights, Medicaid for all. It is very interesting. This is a deep-red state that Trump won handily -- (CROSSTALK) RILEY: -- but she thinks that is the strategy to win. GIGOT: Kemp is running as a Trump Republican. RILEY: Yes. He's very much running as a Trump Republican. The voters there have a true, true contrast. GIGOT: Dan, what are you looking at? HENNINGER: I'm looking at Florida, which is kind of twin with Georgia. \u00a0Down in Florida, you have Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum running against Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, who won the Republican primary because he was endorsed by Donald Trump. Andrew Gillum is up ashamed running as the second coming of Bernie Sanders. He's in favor of raising the minimum wage to $15, raising corporate tax rates from 5.5 to 7.5, to spend a billion dollars on teachers, winding down their school choice program, expanding Medicaid for all, abolishing the U.S. immigration service, even giving licenses to illegal immigrants. GIGOT: And how is -- (CROSSTALK) HENNINGER: This guy is in a dead-heat with DeSantis in Florida! GIGOT: DeSantis has not been a very good candidate, let's be honest about that. HENNINGER: DeSantis has been running as the second coming of Donald Trump. \u00a0He has rallies in which the crowd yells about Gillum, \"lock him up. Lock him up.\" GIGOT: Because of some allegations about influence-peddling in Tallahassee. HENNINGER: Right. This race has national significance, Paul. DeSantis is Trump's candidate. If Andrew Gillum wins in Florida, that means Florida is at risk for Donald Trump in 2020. GIGOT: Kim, why is Walker behind when he is -- and Bill Schutte in Michigan -- both those states have had spectacular economic records in the last few years. The unemployment rate is way down, maybe even under three in Wisconsin. Yet, they're not -- they might lose both those state houses? STRASSEL: Well, you know, you just hit on it a little earlier. The Midwest has been where Donald Trump has had the most voters sour against him. And so those Republican governors, and in the state houses there, they're all laboring against this. To the extent Donald Trump tried to make this election a referendum on him, that has been one of the main aspects of all of these races rather than the achievements of the Republicans and the legislatures there that have done so much for these states. GIGOT: A test of whether or not the Trump coalition is a majority coalition with Donald Trump not on the ballot and in the states. I want to mention one race, Connecticut. Bob Stefanowski -- Art Laffer mentioned it -- running as a reform growth candidate against Ned Lamont. \u00a0The state of Connecticut's economy shrunk over 10 years by more than 9 percent. That is like Greece. (LAUGHTER) If they can't -- if the voters don't throw the Democrats out for that, what do they throw them out for? We have to take one break. When we come back, \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GIGOT: Time now for our \"Hits & Misses\" of the week. Kim, first to you. STRASSEL: A hit to the Department of Justice, which this week unsealed an indictment against 10 Chinese spies who had hacked into an aviation company and stole intellectual property. Paul, in this country, we've been having a big debate about what to do about China's rampant intellectual property theft. Some of us and those in the business community have been frustrated that the Trump administration's preferred way of handling this has been to escalate a trade war, which threatens our own prosperity. This is a far superior way to go about it. It shows we are watching. And it is the Chinese who will be held accountable. GIGOT: Jason? RILEY: This is hit for Congressman Steve Stivers, head of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, for rebuking fellow Republican Congressman Steve King, who has been saying nice things about Neo-Fascists and white nationals. It's a good example of the Republicans policing their own. We could use more of that on both sides of the aisle. GIGOT: Dan? HENNINGER: I thought we could use some unadulterated good news. So I'm giving a hit to NASA's Parker Solar Probe. This is a little device which was set off in August and is racing towards the moon. This week, it made its first close pass to the moon -- close in this world being 26 million miles away. This little thing is flying along at 153,000 miles-an-hour. \u00a0Kind of nice to see the United States is doing something we would all agree is simply wondrous. GIGOT: And this is going to the sun, right? HENNINGER: Heading towards the sun. GIGOT: Heading toward the sun. HENNINGER: I'm sorry, I said the moon. It is the sun solar probe. GIGOT: It's already passed the moon I think. All right. And remember, if you have your own hit-and-miss, be sure to tweet it to us @JERonFNC. That's it for this week's show. Thanks to my panel. Thanks to all of you for watching. I'm Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

            "article_content": "Nancy Pelosi has led Democrats in the House of Representatives for more than 15 years, and now more and more of those Democrats say they will not support her if the party retakes the majority in November. Plus, 'Manhattan Madam' Kristin Davis testifies before the Mueller investigation's grand jury. #Tucker WASHINGTON\u2014 Nancy Pelosi is the chief villain of Republican campaign ads. The leader some Democrats promise to vote against. The subject of much speculation that her grip on power is coming to an end. Nevertheless, she says she\u2019s not going anywhere \u2014 and certainly not while President Donald Trump is in the White House. \u201cThis is not anything to make a big fuss over, it\u2019s politics,\u201d Pelosi said in a 35-minute phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI can take the heat and that\u2019s why I stay in the kitchen.\u201d Pushing back on those who say her leadership position is in jeopardy, Pelosi all but dared her doubters to envision any other House Democrat sitting across the table to negotiate with Trump. \u201cI have a following in the country that\u2019s unsurpassed by anybody, unless they\u2019re running for president,\u201d Pelosi said. Trump and the Republicans are eager to see her go, she said, \u201cand I\u2019m just not going to let them do that.\u201d With Democrats bullish about winning back the House majority, Pelosi is already beginning to lay out a detailed early-days agenda that could be set in motion come January. Beyond cleaning up corruption, lowering health care costs and providing bigger paychecks, Pelosi told AP the Democrats would push forward legislation on background checks for gun purchases and legal status for young immigrants brought to this country illegally, often referred to as \u201cDreamers.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d she said. Yet Pelosi\u2019s return to the speakership, if Democrats triumph, is far from assured. Dozens of Democrats \u2014 candidates and a few lawmakers \u2014 are saying they may not back her, creating an unprecedented groundswell for new leadership. \u201cI think we\u2019re in different territory now,\u201d said Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who won about one-third of the Democrats during a private caucus vote when he mounted a symbolic challenge against Pelosi two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s time to turn the page.\u201d But Pelosi has faced uprisings from the ranks before, most notably after Democrats lost control of the House after the tea party Republican wave of 2010. Anyone who is counting her out \u2014 and many are trying to show her to the exits\u2014 may be underestimating her staying power. \u201cIt\u2019s immodest of me to say, but I say to women now, \u2018Just go for it.\u2019 Tell them why you think you\u2019re the best person to do this job,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be an example to them, just to say, \u2018Don\u2019t run away from a fight.\u2019 If you think you\u2019re the one that should be there, you make the fight.\u201d It\u2019s not that other Democrats haven\u2019t tried to replace her. Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenant, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, has long coveted the top job, waiting out Pelosi for his moment to hold the gavel. He has been promoting himself to colleagues as a \u201cbridge\u201d to the next generation of leadership. Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina let it be known recently that he, too, is willing to take the helm if Pelosi falls short, lawmakers said. That prospect is appealing to many Democrats, as he would be the first African-American speaker. And younger lawmakers, including the 45-year-old Ryan, have not shut the door on running. Some say it\u2019s time for a clean sweep, and that replacing 78-year-old Pelosi with 79-year-old Hoyer or 78-year-old Clyburn is not the generational change that the Democratic caucus wants. \u201cA lot of new people have come in and said, \u2018Look, do I have to be here 30 years before I insert myself into the leadership group?\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who sees Clyburn\u2019s potential bid as particularly influential in putting votes from the Congressional Black Caucus in play. The chairman of the CBC, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., is likely to support Clyburn if he runs for speaker. The complaints against Pelosi do not necessarily stem from her firm grip on the caucus \u2014 she is known for being direct with lawmakers, using what she has called her \u201cmother-of-five voice.\u201d But her long tenure has left little room for up-and-comers, and her visibility has become a liability for some Democrats. Republicans have poured millions into vilifying Pelosi in ads, some $13 million so far this election cycle, and the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm says Pelosi provides \u201ca top argument\u201d for electing more Republicans. As more and more Democratic candidates and lawmakers stare down campaign ads linking them to Pelosi, some are pledging to vote against her. When the cameras turn on them during the speaker vote once the new Congress convenes in January, it\u2019s hard to see how some of them will be able to belt out the name, \u201cPelosi.\u201d Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., a vocal proponent for new leadership, envisions more of a changing of the guard than an insurrection. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you grab the torch out of their hands and kick them down the stairs,\u201d she said in an interview. The missing piece in the furious behind-the-scenes chatter over Pelosi\u2019s future is an obvious successor. Several leaders-in-waiting having moved on, and one lawmaker who had been seen as a possible replacement, Rep. Joe Crowley, recently lost his New York primary to newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cThere can\u2019t be a race when no one has declared their candidacy,\u201d said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who joined Pelosi for a \u201cMoms\u2019 Summit\u201d in her Houston district this month that drew 600 people. Some of them lined up for the chance to snap selfies with Pelosi. \u201cShe was not an unhappy camper; she was a happy camper.\u201d Democrats are loath to start the new Congress in January with a floor fight over the speakership if they are newly in power. And many Democrats say that, with an unprecedented number of women are running for office, \u201cit would be very unceremonial to have the first woman speaker of the House win back the house \u2014 to lead us to victory \u2014 and then not to have her be speaker,\u201d said first-term Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. \u201cIf we win the House, I think Nancy stays, but there\u2019ll be a transition at some point,\u201d the Silicon Valley congressman said. Pelosi acknowledges she will not lead House Democrats forever and that if she retakes the gavel it will be as part of a transition to a next generation of leadership. Two years ago she was prepared to retire if Hillary Clinton was in the White House. But once Trump won, she felt compelled to stay \u2014 \u201ca four-year extension,\u201d as she puts it \u2014 to protect the Affordable Care Act, banking reform and the party\u2019s other accomplishments. \u201cWe think the fate of the nation is at stake,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "The 'Outnumbered' panel debates the Democrats' chances in the midterm elections. With five months until Election Day, Democrats hold the enthusiasm advantage -- and that puts them ahead of Republicans in the congressional vote as well. A Fox News poll released Thursday finds 48 percent of voters favor the Democratic candidate in their congressional district and 39 percent the Republican.\u00a0 That 9-point lead is up from a 5-point edge the Democrats held in March (46-41 percent). READ THE COMPLETE POLL RESULTS. \u201cIt is important to treat the generic ballot test as more of a barometer than a forecast, and this poll hints at some reemerging headwinds for Republicans,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \u201cPolitical science tells us the Democrats will need a substantial edge in the national vote, maybe 10 points, to make up for gerrymandering and vote concentrations so they can take the House,\u201d says Shaw. More Democrats (72 percent) are extremely or very interested in the upcoming elections than Republicans (63 percent). Voters say Republicans can better handle the issues of border security (+14 points), terrorism (+13), and the economy (+5).\u00a0 Democrats are preferred on climate change (+33 points), health care (+17), immigration (+7), and judicial nominations (D +5).\u00a0 It\u2019s more evenly divided on gun policy (Democrats +3) and international trade (D +2). There is no clear party advantage on taxes or the federal deficit. A year ago, the GOP had a 15-point advantage on the deficit.\u00a0 Now, Democrats are preferred by one point.\u00a0 That\u2019s because fewer voters are saying Republicans can do better.\u00a0 Last June, 50 percent preferred Republicans over Democrats (35 percent).\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s 35 percent Republicans and 36 percent Democrats. \u201cRepublicans will have a difficult time claiming to be the party of fiscal responsibility this fall, and that could hurt base turnout,\u201d says Anderson. Similar story on taxes.\u00a0 The tax cuts that Republicans passed last December have failed to boost their numbers, as the two parties are seen as equal on handling taxes -- an issue where the GOP traditionally holds an edge. The tax reform law and Obamacare are both viewed more positively than negatively by voters.\u00a0 The tax law receives a net positive rating by five points (42 favorable vs. 37 unfavorable), and the health care law by three points (49-46). On immigration, voters by 71-23 percent favor giving legal status to Dreamers. On U.S. border security, by a 28-17 percent margin, voters say it is better today than it was two years ago, while the largest number, 50 percent, says it is about the same as it was in the final months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Majorities of Democrats (86 percent) and Republicans (55 percent) agree on legal status for Dreamers, but Republicans (47 percent) are almost four times more likely than Democrats (13 percent) to say border security has improved. Meanwhile, 4-in-10 independents (43 percent) and 2-in-10 Republicans (20 percent) say it is at least somewhat likely that they will vote for a Democrat in this year\u2019s election with the specific intent of providing a check on the president and the Republican Congress.\u00a0 Among Democrats, nearly 9-in-10 feel that way (86 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,001 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from June 3-6, 2018.\u00a0 The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on how Trump's birthright citizenship interview is sparking exactly the media reaction he was hoping for. I'll leave it to the legal scholars to debate the fine points, but it\u2019s no accident that one week before the midterms, President Trump says he wants to revoke birthright citizenship. Sure, he did it in an interview with Jim VandeHei and Jonathan Swan of Axios for the premiere of the website's string of HBO specials. And yes, Trump expressed surprise that the journalists, who had been digging into the issue, knew about his secret plan to move against the practice. But the president easily could have deflected the question. Presented with the opportunity, he wanted this out there as a pre-election message. For Trump to speak of eliminating the practice where illegal immigrants can arrange to have babies in this country, and they automatically become American citizens, is very much part of his eleventh-hour push on immigration. At a time when he has been pounding away at the Central American caravan \u2014 at least until that narrative was interrupted by terror attacks \u2014 birthright citizenship is shrewdly targeted to his base. \"It was always told to me\u00a0that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don't,\" Trump told Axios. When pressed, he said that \"you can definitely do it with an Act of Congress. But now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order ...\u00a0It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And it has to end.\" The president made this argument: \"We're the only country\u00a0in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits.\" That is wrong. As the New York Times points out, \"dozens of other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study\u00a0by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trump's advisers often cite.\" There is also the not insignificant matter of the 14th Amendment: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Some conservatives have argued that the 14th Amendment was intended to apply only to citizens and permanent legal residents. What's interesting to me is that the right fiercely objected when Barack Obama used his executive power to stop the deportation of the dreamers, saying this was a horrible abuse of presidential authority. They did have a point that Obama was trying to accomplish with a pen what he could not get passed into law, which is why the issue remains unresolved and Trump can threaten to expel younger immigrants unless Congress acts. But I'm not expecting a whole lot of pushback from conservatives who don't like birthright citizenship. Both parties object to sweeping executive orders when they oppose the policy in question, and justify it as a reasonable exercise of power when a president of their party does it. One exception is Paul Ryan, who said yesterday in a radio interview: \"Well, you obviously cannot do that. You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. We didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws via executive action, and obviously, as conservatives, we believe in the Constitution.\" Of course, it's easier for the House speaker to object because he'll be gone in January. You can get the flavor of the mainstream media coverage with this CNN on-screen headline: \"TRUMP CLAIMS HE CAN DEFY CONSTITUTION, END U.S. BIRTHRIGHT.\" Now I understand why many people find the practice unfair, with many illegal immigrants flocking here on temporary visas or through other means to have their babies in U.S. hospitals. And it's worthy of debate. But the constitutional obstacle means it would probably be tied up in lengthy lawsuits. That doesn't matter for Trump, at least not right now. The president, who recently complained that the media were so busy covering terror attacks that they were interrupting GOP momentum in the midterms, has his eye on Nov. 6. And by making the over-the-top claim that he can easily do this with the stroke of a pen, he guaranteed the kind of coverage he needs to broadcast the issue to his supporters. Footnote: Trump used an interview with Fox's Laura Ingraham in part to push back at some critics in the media. The president responded to the Washington Post headline the day after the Pittsburgh synagogue slaughter, \"Critics Say Trump Has Fostered the Toxic Environment for the Political Violence He Denounces.\" \"I was in the headline of the Washington Post, my name associated with this crazy bomber. 'Trump bomber' or something, but I was in the headline when they got him ... They didn't do that with Bernie Sanders ... They didn't do that with President Obama with the church, the horrible situation with the church\" in South Carolina, he said. Ingraham also asked him about GQ correspondent Julia Ioffe, who first blamed Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre and then said on CNN that he had \"radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did.\" Trump said Ioffe \"must be some kind of sick woman.\" I still can't believe that Ioffe, who has also worked for the Atlantic and Politico, said that. But she said she was sorry later in Jake Tapper's show, and repeated that on Twitter: \"I clarified and apologized on air, but I'll say it again here. This has been a very emotional and painful time, but I absolutely should not have gone with such hyperbole on the air. I apologize.\"",

This is a rush transcript from \"Fox News Sunday,\" June 17, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. President Trump uses the Justice Department's inspector general report to attack the FBI and claim vindication. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves. They were plotting against my election. WALLACE: We'll discuss the fallout from the findings and what it means for the Mueller's special counsel investigation with Congressman Trey Gowdy, chair of the House Oversight Committee. It's a \"Fox News Sunday\" exclusive. Then, President Trump with words of praise for Kim Jong-un after the Singapore summit. TRUMP: He speaks and his people sit up at attention, I want my people to do the same. WALLACE: What did both sides give up and what comes next? We'll ask Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. Plus, the president blames Democrats for the separation of families at the border. TRUMP: The Democrats force that law upon our nation but I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children. WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about chances for a compromise on immigration. And, the Washington Capitals take the Stanley Cup down Constitution Avenue, and D.C.'s first major sports title in a quarter century. All right now on \"Fox News Sunday\". (END VIDEOTAPE) WALLACE: Hello again and happy Father's Day from FOX News in Washington. President Trump is back from his summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un and is already taking on his next big challenge, the Department of Justice inspector general issued a report that is sharply critical of how the FBI conducted the Clinton email investigation. And the president says that undercuts Robert Mueller's probe with collusion and obstruction of justice. Joining me now from South Carolina, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, chair of the House Oversight Committee. Mr. Chairman, we get to the I.G. report, I want to discuss how President Trump and his lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, are using the I.G. report. Here's the president linking what the inspector general found in the Clinton investigation to the Mueller investigation of him? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that the report yesterday maybe more importantly than anything, it totally exonerates me. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Mr. Chairman, does the I.G. report exonerate President Trump? REP. TREY GOWDY, R-SC, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Well, it certainly helps him, Chris. I mean, keep in mind, the same people, the same players that were involved in the Clinton probe later move to the Russia probe. John Brennan who said he should be in the dustbin of history. Jim Comey who said impeachment was too good of a remedy. Loretta Lynch who wanted Hillary Clinton to win. And then we got Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, the two FBI employees. Chris -- and this is what's most important to me, those two presumed and pronounced Hillary Clinton's innocence before her investigation ended, and they presumed and pronounced Donald Trump's guilt before the investigation even began. So, when you have that pervasiveness of bias, yes, it's going to help the person who is complaining about the investigation. WALLACE: On the other hand, Robert Mueller was not part of the Clinton investigation. Peter Strzok was fired by Mueller as soon as he found about those very bias and damaging texts. And, of course, we don't know what Mueller has found in the last year in his investigation. So, again, I have to ask, has President Trump been exonerated? I clearly understand your point that there was bias in the FBI. But has he been exonerated on allegations of collusion and obstruction? GOWDY: Well, part of that depends upon what you view the Mueller probe as. Now, you mentioned collusion, the only person in the universe who claims to have evidence of collusion is Adam Schiff. And unlike any other secret he's ever had, he's actually kept this one. He's never told anyone what evidence he has. So, there's no evidence of collusion. Obstruction of justice, Chris, good luck having your star witness being Jim Comey in any prosecution, from shoplifting to obstruction of justice. Good luck if that's your start witness. For me, the Mueller is about what Russia did in 2016 and who, if anyone, they did it with. So, that's what I mean when I say Mueller probe, and I hope he does right to definitive accounting of what Russian did, but there's no evidence Donald Trump did it with them and Jim Comey would be about the starriest witness that I can imagine the prosecutor could have. WALLACE: I find this very significant because you have not been in the tank for President Trump on all this. GOWDY: I'm not now. I'm not now. WALLACE: No, no, I understand that. I'm not saying you are now. But are you saying this morning that Donald Trump is off the hook in the Mueller investigation? GOWDY: Well, I don't know what Mueller has. I do know this: that bias is so pervasive and everyone who's ever stood in front of a jury and had to explain it away we'll tell you it is most miserable feeling in the world. And I have never seen this level of bias. So, you have Peter Strzok who can't think of a single American who can vote for Donald Trump and you got Peter Strzok who says, we'll stop it. The campaign and the presidency, we'll stop the campaign and if it doesn't work, the day after the election, he's talking about impeachment. So, how would you like that to be your lead investigator? Two weeks after you're assigned to look into what a foreign country did to us, the only thing he can think to talk about is an insurance policy to keep Donald Trump from winning, and then he says we'll stop it. I assume the \"we\" is the FBI. So, how would you like if you're Bob Mueller to present that case to a jury? WALLACE: You are co-chairing a hearing on Tuesday where the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who issued this damaging report, will appear. What are the main questions you want to ask him? GOWDY: There are a bunch. It's a 500-page report. And the good news, Chris, is Michael Horowitz proved what we wanted the FBI and the DOJ to do, which is that you can have an investigation that is fact-centric and fair and even-handed. There are a lot of questions I have for him. Number one, you know, the Hillary Clinton failure to prosecute was predicated upon two things. Number one, that her emails were not exposed to foreign actors. There's some evidence that that's not true. Number two, that there was no evidence of intent. Of course, there's no evidence of intent. He didn't bother to ask her. You went into the interview knowing that she was not going to be charged. So, I think some members will ask about that. A lot of members are going to ask about the bias. The same thing that exonerated her implicated him before the investigation began and I suspect some members will ask about the coziness between the FBI and the media. WALLACE: While the FBI is very critical, as you pointed out, and we're going to get into it in more detail about actions taken by Comey and Strzok and others. Here is his overall judgment on the final conclusion of the Clinton investigation. I want to put this up on the screen. This is from the I.G. We found no evidence that the conclusions by the prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations. Rather, we determine that they were based on the prosecutor's assessment of the facts, the law, and past department practice. And here is current FBI Director Christopher Wray. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: So, when they say the final judgments -- yes, there may have been bias, but that didn't affect the final judgments -- are the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, and Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, are they wrong? GOWDY: Well, I'll say this, why did Loretta Lynch ask it to be called a matter and not an investigation? Why was Cheryl Mills in the room when the target was being interviewed? Why did you write an exoneration memo six weeks before she was interviewed? Why did you start playing in your press conference two months before the investigation was over? Here's where I depart from Chris Wray -- I don't think it's my job to prove the bias impacting the investigation. I think it's job to probe that it did not. Here's what I know: they exonerated her before the interview. They said she did nothing wrong before they even bothered to talk to her and the same group said Donald Trump should not be the president and/or should be impeached before the investigation even began. If that is not textbook bias, which is the prejudging of an outcome, I mean, that's what bias is. We are prejudging the outcome. We're prejudging her innocence before we talk to her. We're prejudging his guilt before you even began to look into the fact pattern. That's bias, and, yes, it impacted the outcome. She -- the most important element is intent. That's what they told us. She did not have the intent to commit a crime. The best way to figure that out is to talk to her. But they went into the interview, Chris, saying the only thing she'll be charged with is maybe lying to us. If you're Donald Trump or if you're any other defendant in the country, how would you like that deal? We're not going to charge with anything as long as you tell us the truth. That is blanket immunity and everyone in the country would like that as they go into an interview with the FBI. WALLACE: Now, a couple of top Republican leaders, House Majority Leader McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, are saying given all of this and given the fact that the Mueller investigation is going on for more than a year, it's time to wrap it up. It clearly is putting a cloud over the president. Do you agree with that? GOWDY: I think it's putting more than just a cloud over the president. I think it's putting the cloud over the entire country. This is a unique, Chris. It is a counterintelligence investigation that's become public. Most of them do not. It's a criminal investigation that has political overtones, most of them do not. Combine the two. It is a public counterintelligence investigation with political overtones. This is not your traditional investigation. So, I would encourage Bob Mueller, keep doing exactly what Rod Rosenstein hired you to do. Bob Mueller did not volunteer. We're here because Rod Rosenstein decided we needed a special counsel. Do the very best you can with the evidence and the witnesses you have. But understand that this is being used by political enemies to hurt Donald Trump. Adam Schiff wants to be the chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee. Nancy Pelosi wants to be the speaker of the House. They want Bob Mueller want to do what Peter Strzok and Hillary Clinton could not do, which is beat Donald Trump. So, just be aware that you're being used would be my advice to Bob Mueller. WALLACE: I've got about three minutes left, I want get I'm going to ask you for quick answers. Should, based on what you knew before, and what you know now from the I.G.'s report, should Hillary Clinton have been charged with the crime? GOWDY: I need to interview her effectively. I need to ask her those questions on intent. We know she lied. We know she's concealed evidence. We know they destroyed evidence. Those are all circumstantial markers of intent. So, I would need to interview her without going into it, knowing I was going to clear her like the FBI did. WALLACE: Should Comey and Peter Strzok be called to testify before Congress? GOWDY: Yes. WALLACE: On what issues? GOWDY: Well, Peter Strzok, you name it. The highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer. And, Comey, in the words of my grandmamma, has some explaining to do. He's having a hard time getting his histories to match up. Horowitz was very critical of him and deservedly so. WALLACE: Finally, where are House Republicans in your demand, your call for the Department of Justice to share more documents, especially on this question of the use by the FBI of a confidential informant to penetrate the Trump campaign? And also, do you believe, as some of your colleagues have suggested, that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein threatened the House and threatened staffers for demanding those documents? GOWDY: Well, I wasn't in the room for that January meeting. I've been in the room with some other meetings, where tensions run really high. We had a meeting Friday night. Under the heading of minor miracles, you had members of the House working on a Friday night. Paul Ryan led this meeting. You had Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, myself, and everyone you can think of from the FBI and the DOJ and we went item by item. On both of those outstanding subpoenas, we either have compliance, we have partial compliance, or we have noncompliance. And Paul made it very clear. There is going to be action on the floor of the House this week if the FBI and DOJ do not comply with our subpoena request. So, Rod Rosenstein, Chris Wray, you were in the meeting in the meeting, you understood as just as clearly as I did. We're going to get compliance, or the House of Representatives is going to use its full arsenal of constitutional weapons to gain compliance. This is too important. It was important before the I.G. report. The I.G. report has even heightened the need for us to understand what happened in 2016, so the new guys can either be part of the cleanup crew or they can be part of the cover-up crew. And I would encourage them to be part of the cleanup crew. WALLACE: And very briefly, sir, the areas where you see noncompliance, and you might see action on the floor this week. That's on what area? GOWDY: It would be FISA abuse. It would be a little bit on the Strzok- Page text. We're a little miffed that most damning text the same time you did, where we've been asking for it for a long time. So, Devin's subpoena is largely -- most of the issues were with Devin's subpoena and not Chairman Goodlatte's, and that's FISA abuse and it's what led up to the Russia probe. And Chris and Rod are -- there's no ambiguity. The speaker of the house was really clear. You're going to comply or there's going to be floor action, and I think they got the message. WALLACE: And floor action would be a -- GOWDY: The full panoply of constitutional weapons available to the people's house? WALLACE: Including contempt of Congress? GOWDY: That would be among them, yes, sir. I don't want the drama, I want the documents. And I think that Chris and Rod got that message. Contempt of Congress just means we're going to be talking about this six years from now. I don't want that. I want the documents. I don't want the dram and I don't want the floor fight. But they need to know that we're willing to do it and unless they were in a different meeting than the one -- I have never seen Paul Ryan as animated as I saw him Friday night. He is sick and tired of the delay and he communicated that point very effectively. WALLACE: Chairman Gowdy, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you. GOWDY: Yes, sir. WALLACE: And I got to say, you had a lot to say today. Thank you, sir. GOWDY: Happy Father's Day. Thanks. WALLACE: Same to you, sir. Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the FBI's handling of the Clinton investigation and what it means for the Mueller probe of President Trump. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. The I.G. report yesterday went a long way to show that. And I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Certain actions taken by the FBI, intentionally or not, help the Trump campaign and hurt the Clinton campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: President Trump and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer drawing very different conclusions from the I.G. report this week on the Clinton email investigation. And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist, Karl Rove, Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Chris Stirewalt, FOX News politics editor. Well, Karl, I've got to say, that was a different Trey Gowdy that we have heard because for weeks, for months, he's been the one Republican kind of pushing back on other Republicans and certainly the Trump White House or rushing to judgment, the Mueller is fake, he pushed back on spygate. Today, he was basically, it seemed to me, saying, that the I.G. report and what it found in terms of rampant bias on the part of Comey and Strzok and others has blown the Mueller investigation out of the water as far as it concerns president Trump. KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, I had a slightly different take on some of that. I do -- look, this was a very damaging report, the I.G. report, to Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page's lover, and to generally the FBI itself. But, it raises questions about what the FBI did in 2016 in Papadopoulos, and others in the Trump campaign. But at the end of it, we have in May of 2017, the appointment of Bob Mueller. And when he finds out literally in matter of days and weeks later, the text messages with Peter Strzok, he essentially fires him. He removes him from his position as head of the counterespionage section of the FBI. And because you can't fire an FBI agent, he has some detailed to human resources. I mean, as about the biggest emotion as you can possibly get. WALLACE: I understand all of that. But when I asked Gowdy about exactly that, he in effect said that the fruit of all this is poison, that the launch of the investigation was poisoned. That Comey would be the main witness or a main witness in any obstruction of justice case against President Trump is fatally flawed. I mean, Gowdy did not leave -- I gave him a lot of opportunities and he didn't want to take them. ROVE: I agree with him about Comey. Comey is one of the biggest victims out of not only this I.G. report but the whole process. But, look, there is no -- WALLACE: I wouldn't say not a victim, but -- ROVE: Yes, you're right. (LAUGHTER) ROVE: He gets what he deserves. WALLACE: Yes. ROVE: But, look, what we do have here is, look, let's look into the question of collusion but, look, there's never been any evidence of collusion. Every presidential campaign leaks. The Trump campaign leaks than worse than any I've seen in my life. If there was any collusion, we would have heard a hint about it from somebody inside the campaign. But at the end of the day, Mueller's investigation is going to be judged by the report of the Mueller investigation. We're going to make a judgment about it, and my sense is, is that it's going to clear the present of any question of collusion between his campaign and the Russians and there will be people like Paul Manafort who have real liability and have real legal problems because of their actions unconnected to the campaign. WALLACE: I want to go back to that newly discovered text exchange between two FBI officials in August of 2016. That's Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. Let's put it up on the screen. Page: Trumps not ever going to become president, right? Right? Strzok: No, no, he won't. We'll stop it. Congresswoman Harman, you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to say, that is pretty damaging. And this is coming exactly at the point when the Clinton campaign is ramping down, and the Trump -- the Clinton investigation is ramping down by the FBI, and the Trump investigation is ramping up. JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN, D-CALIFORNIA: Well, first of all, happy Father's Day, to everyone. WALLACE: Thank you. HARMAN: To my two sons and two sons in law. But, you're right, and it's not pretty damaging. It's very damaging. And Comey's actions, all three of his press events in 2016 were inappropriate and wrong. And the I.G. nails him on and should have nailed him on it. Yes, he is a compromised witness, if he ever becomes a witness. All of that is right. But let's understand, let's -- that there are two different investigations. One was the investigation and what the I.G. looked at with the Clinton emails and things that happened in 2016. And the second is, Mueller's investigation. And I agree with Karl that that investigation is a different one. Trey Gowdy went out of his way to say it should be completed. Most members of Congress -- (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: Yes, well, wait. But except he said it should be completed in terms of Russian interference. HARMAN: Correct. WALLACE: Russian interference. He wasn't talking about collusion or obstruction. HARMAN: Well, I don't think we know. I hope there is no collusion or obstruction, but I think we should let the investigation conclude and find out what Mueller knows. And Mueller, no one -- while some people are impugning Mueller, but I certainly wouldn't, and most members of Congress wouldn't. He had an exemplary run as the head of the FBI and U.S. attorney before that. He was nominated and supported by immigrants and Republicans when he became FBI director, right around 9/11. I worked closely with him in my role as ranking member of the intelligence committee. And just the last comment about the FBI, this isn't the first strange event at the FBI. I had my own event which was very strange with the FBI. My view is that, yes, there need to be changes at the FBI. But Christopher Wray seems to be a responsible leader and will take in a better direction. WALLACE: Chris Stirewalt, how big a deal is this to hear Trey Gowdy who's been a pretty honest broker on all of this suddenly, really change his opinion about the Mueller investigation and President Trump's potential legal liability? CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR: I suspect that Trey Gowdy will do the same thing with the Mueller investigation that he rightly did with the inspector general's report, which is wait for the work to be concluded and then render judgment after that fact. I heard him definitely saying it was time to wrap up but I also heard a guy that said he did not express any concern about Mueller. But I definitely heard this -- anybody who's attached to the Comey administration at the FBI, the catastrophic Comey administration at the FBI, if you're of that leadership bubble up there, you better not be part of what comes out at the end for Mueller. And Mueller's findings have to be able to rise above the decrepitude of Comey and his team. It has to be better than that. WALLACE: Gillian, I want to pick up on another point that Trey Gowdy made today which I thought was news and something I didn't know about -- and I don't think has been reported that there was this big meeting on Friday night between House leadership and the top leadership, Rod Rosenstein and Chris Wray, FBI, Department of Justice deputy attorney general, and they basically put the wood to the Justice Department and said, you produce these documents or we're going to go to the floor and we are going to take serious action to force you to comply with our subpoenas . GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Chris. A quick word if I may on the Strzok/Page texts. I've been scouring the intelligence community all week on this story. And over and over, what I hear from operatives and analysts is that those few text messages that you highlighted for viewers have been more damaging than anything that's transpired so far in the Mueller investigation and are probably going to be more damaging than anything that could come out in the future. And it's something that I think is causing a lot of -- causing people to pause and reflect upon their service in the intelligence community. When it comes to -- when it comes to the inspector general's report, I just want to point out, there's an uncomfortable reality buried in the inspector general's report for the Trump administration which is that they got five of the most important national security departments and agencies unfilled inspector general positions -- Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, the CIA. Even White House inspector general position is currently vacant. So, it's quite -- every time they lob sort of criticism against the Obama administration for the way they policed themselves, it highlights the fact that they are choosing not to police themselves at all -- at least up until now. WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left. Carl, your reaction to Gowdy and the revelation that House Republican leadership is fed up. ROVE: Friday meeting didn't need to take place. Wray and Rosenstein and the FBI need to be responsive to the will of Congress. Congress has oversight on the Department of Justice and FBI. And it is astonishing to me that these request for access to documents have been stonewalled, delayed, ignored. And the speaker was right and the House is right. And I don't understand why. Wray has a chance to make a clean break with Comey in the past, and he can do so by being forthcoming. I hope to God they are forthcoming here in the next 24 hours. WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here. We'll see you all a little later. Up next, President Trump defends the deal he made with Kim Jong-un, saying it's made the world safer. But Democrats say he gave up a lot without getting much in return. We'll talk with Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services about those concerns, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: A look at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York, home of this year's U.S. Open. The Singapore summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un produced stunning and surprising pictures. But what about the substance? Did the two leaders resolve differences that could lead to a nuclear confrontation? Joining me here in Washington is Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. SEN. JACK REED, D-RHODE ISLAND: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: President Trump says that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat, his words, and on Friday he added this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have solved that problem. Now, we're getting it memorialized and all. QUESTION: You solved the problem? (CROSS TALK) TRUMP: But that problem is largely solved. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Senator, your reaction? REED: North Korea is a nuclear threat. The president's statement was absolutely, in my view, preposterous. North Korea has between 20 and 60 nuclear weapons. They have missiles that they can deliver those weapons to Japan, South Korea, Guam. They have an intricate infrastructure of nuclear laboratories, testing facilities, et cetera. This issue is just beginning to be dealt with. It has not been solved. WALLACE: But -- and -- and in fairness, it -- it hasn't and the president acknowledges that, although he clearly is more optimistic than you are that it's going to get settled. North Korea has suspended its nuclear bomb and missile test for months. It has destroyed one of its main testing facilities. The two sides are talking at the highest level. Would you concede that President Trump has dramatically reduced tensions between the two countries? REED: Well, I think initially President Trump helped elevate the tensions. I mean the fire and fury, the demeaning Twitters about Kim Jong-un, et cetera. I think the path of diplomacy that he's chosen is the wiser one and I commend him for that. But if -- the meeting itself, the summit, was a great victory for Kim Jong-un. He got the prestige of the first leader of North Korea to be literally embraced by the president of the United States. His sorted record on human rights, on mistreating his own people was not only ignored, but, frankly, contradicted in many respects by the president's comments. The sanctions regime, which, again, the president, I think, and his staff did very well in putting it together, will dissipate given the lack of enthusiasm for enforcement, guarantees about the security of North Korea, which the president seemed to imply and is different than -- than the -- the maximum pressure campaign he's put on. And then conceding with that any other quid pro quo, the exercises that we conduct with the South Koreans was, I think, a mistake. Indeed, the president chose to call them provocative war games, which are not the case at all. So, at the end of that summit, Kim Jong-un walked away, I think, with a great deal. And we're just now beginning to try to put together -- put it back together. WALLACE: I just want to press on that one point here. The top Democrat in the Senate Armed Services Committee, the president did agree to suspend joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. He did, however, say that if North Korea drags its feet on denuclearization, he can always resume the games. So how -- how big a deal is that? REED: It is a big deal. First of all, it was a complete surprise to our allies, the South Koreans and the Japanese. They are very concerned. Second, it is part of our determined not war gaming but deterrence of the North Koreans. And if this goes for a long period of time, operationally we'll lose the skills that we need to collaborate with our colleagues in the region. And I think also it was interesting that the Chinese were among the first to report the succession of these exercises. And I think they're going to take a great deal of comfort from that. So -- WALLACE: Let me switch subjects on you. REED: Yes, sir. WALLACE: President Trump announced Friday that he is imposing now finally - - not threatening but imposing stiff, new tariffs on China effective July 6th. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're just going to do $50 billion on $50 billion of high technology equipment and other things coming into the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: China responded quickly that it is going to respond and it's going to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. farm products, on crude oil, on U.S. cars. Senator, are we now in a trade war with China? REED: It looks that way. But the -- the president, I think, is right in calling out China. They have abused, in many respects, the free trade arrangements that have been built up over generations. They don't allow American companies to compete in China or international companies, as they are allowed to in other countries. They have, I think, used the trade system to their advantage. So the president, I think, is right in taking action. The question is, are these actions coordinated? I don't think so. I mean he -- before he left for the Singapore summit, he had a very, very difficult meeting with the G- 7. So he's not going into this trade battle with China with the unified effort by the western powers. And then, second, I think a lot of his judgements seem to be snap judgements. He imposed tariffs on countries aiming at China and it wound up sort of hitting Canada and other countries where we have not only trade relationships but very strong national security relationships. So the concept, I think, is right to go after China. The methods, I think, he employs, just, in many cases, is counterproductive. But to the trade war issue is, we are -- could be dangerously approaching such a trade war. WALLACE: I want to switch to one other subject which is gaining interest and concern by the moment, and that is the issue of families at the border being separated. Let's put up some statistics. In the first six weeks after the administration launched its zero tolerance policy, we now find out that 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults coming across the border illegally. Here is President Trump's explanation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's the law. And that's what the Democrats gave us. And we're willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate. But they just don't want to negotiate. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Your reaction to the policy and the impact it's having in terms of separating these families. REED: It's not the law. It's the president's policy. In fact, he has stated, and it's been reported in the press, that he's using it as a negotiation tool. He's using it to intimidate families so they don't come across the border. He's using it as a political ploy. So it's not the law. And to say it is law is just misrepresenting -- misrepresenting the fact dramatically. WALLACE: Let -- let me -- let me ask you about two aspects of that. One, in terms of trying to deter families from coming across the border, they're coming across illegally, what's wrong with that? REED: We should have, and we've tried in the past on a bipartisan basis to develop comprehensive immigration reform, which would secure the border. We -- we can't have a border that is open. But it also would recognize, one, the individuals that are here for many years and, two, provide a much more effective process if people are seeing asylum, if people are trying legitimately to -- to come into the United States. We have to protect our borders. But it is, I think, repugnant to most Americans when you have people like Dr. Franklin Graham condemning these family separations as abhorrent to the core American values. That's -- WALLACE: Franklin Graham, the -- the son of Billy Graham. REED: Billy Graham. WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you about the other aspect of it, because it has been suggested -- some people in the White House are saying, this is a negotiating poly. And the argument is that the president has suspended the DACA program, although the courts have stopped that, and he has imposed this policy to try to bring Democrats, like yourself, to the table to create a kind of grand bargain, yes, he'll stop this policy, he'll provide some protection on -- for the dreamers, but, in return, you, the Democrats, will give him the border wall and limits on legal immigration, things like the visa lottery and chain migration. REED: I don't think Americans would like to see children, two years old, four years old torn away from their parents as a negotiating poly in Washington, D.C. I think that's the American view of this. There are other ways to negotiate between Republicans and Democrats. Using children, young children, as political foils is abhorrent. WALLACE: But as you saying that you will not agree to a deal that has this as an element in it? REED: I'm -- I am just saying that this is repugnant to most Americans. And when you have leaders of the -- community leaders, like Dr. Graham, speaking out, that sends a strong, strong signal. There are ways we can negotiate. We had, a few months ago, we thought, a deal with the president with respect to some enhancement of water -- border security, including stretches of the wall. In return, the DACA, the dreamers, would be allowed to stay. At the last moment, that blew up. That was a fair, comprehensive, bargained negotiation and he just sort of walked away from it. But to use children in this way, to me, is something that, frankly, you know, that's not what we're about in this country. WALLACE: Senator Reed, thank you. REED: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: Thanks for coming in. Always good to talk with you, sir. REED: Yes, sir. WALLACE: Coming up, our Sunday group returns to discuss the showdown over immigration. Will the party's resolve their differences on separating families and the dreamers and border enforcement? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We had good chemistry. You haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. TRUMP: You haven't had any research. They just blew up there test site. SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ), RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: This is the weakest statement I have ever seen come out of any engagement with North Korea. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, questioning President Trump's positive assessment of the nuclear deal he struck with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. And we're back now with the panel. Congresswoman Harmon, how do you assess the Singapore summit? What are the pluses for the U.S.? What are the minuses? JANE HARMAN, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-CA): Well, it was a made for TV moment. And let's understand that there were two big images. One was at the G-7, with Trump's sitting like this, glaring at Angela Merkel, and the second one in the exact same timeframe was shaking hands with Kim Jong-un and slightly later saluting in return to his salute a North American -- A North Korean general. How do I assess it? I think it's a short-term propaganda win for Kim. He got almost everything he wants. Jack Reed just said that, Senator Jack Reed, on your program. But I think if he just makes no more threats and doesn't test again, he's gotten away with becoming a nuclear nation, being recognized by the world and I think there will be more economic advantages to him. I think China will trade more and we won't punish China for trading with North Korea. And I think that, you know, yay him. Just one other comment. There are two winners here short term I think. One is China, which now has much more of an advantage in Asia now that we're suspending our exercises and possibly reducing or eliminating our troops in South Korea. But the other is Russia. Because of what we did with the G-7 and the new tariff plan -- let's not call it a war -- Europe is destabilized and that gives Russia huge advantages with respect to Ukraine and in the Middle East because were renounced the Iran deal, it seems to me, Russia has more free reign in Syria and parts of the Middle East. WALLACE: Gillian, as someone who worked on the National Security Council for President Bush and President Obama, President Trump seems confident he got a deal from Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, even if that isn't spelled out in the final agreement. The joint agreement that they signed. Do you share the president's confidence? GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I share the president's hope and optimism, not necessarily his confidence, because I think no matter what is said now, truly only time will tell. One thing to point out that, you know, a lot of -- in the wake of -- of this summit, it seems to be that the response is breaking down along political lines, much like it did to President Obama's overtures to the Iran regime. But when it comes down to policy matters here, there's one major challenge the Trump administration's facing that President Obama didn't really have to deal with back in 2012, '13 and '14, and that is North Korea's continued super aggressive gray zone warfare in cyberspace. I've been speaking to cyber expert and tech experts this week who say that during the lead up to the summit, even as the summit was ongoing, North Korea sponsored hackers were infiltrating U.S. banks, financial institutions and carrying out attacks on them. And this is something that they've not yet dealt with. They might be able to get to some kind of a de- neutralization deal without addressing that, but it will ultimately fall apart unless the Trump administration confront this head on. I hope they're doing it behind the scenes through covert channels. WALLACE: Let's turn to the other subject I discussed with Senator Reed, and that's the separation of families coming across the border, which I think it's fair to say is sparking growing outrage as we now learn that almost 2,000 miners were separated from their adult parents as they came across the border in the first six weeks after the president and his administration announced a zero-tolerance policy. Here was the president on this, this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're all saying about separating the families. And that's a Democrat bill. That's Democrats wanting to do that. And they could solve it very easily by getting together. But they think it's a good election point. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Karl, what do you think of this separation of families? The zero- tolerance and what's come from it. What do you think of it as policy and what do you think of it as it apparently is being used by the Trump administration as leverage to get the Democrats to negotiate a bigger deal on immigration? KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, let's -- let's take the politics of it first and then go back to the policy. If you take a look, there's a new Harvard Harris poll that -- that says, give the dreamers a -- they can remain here and have a path to citizenship in return for which there is increased -- use merit rather than family connections. You eliminate the diversity lottery and you provide funding for the border wall. And in that poll, that deal gets better than two to one. So at the end of this -- WALLACE: In favor of it? ROVE: In favor of it. And so at the end of this, the president's position, I'll give you the dreamers and a path to citizenship in return for these three things has the support of the American people. So the administration's on firm ground. The president's not on as firm a ground when it comes to his description of the -- of the detention of minors and separation from -- of families. This is being driven by a decision by the Justice Department for zero tolerance. That is to say anybody who comes across the border is now going to be charged. It used to be to the policy that if you came across the border, if you were a Mexican, you were immediately removed out of the country. Now apparently they're going to charge the Mexicans with an immigration violation. That makes it impossible for them to enter the country legally in the future to work or become a U.S. citizen. So the administration had taken the zero tolerance policy and rather than taking, you know, OTM's, we would hold them and move them out of the country within 30 or 35 days. Now you have to hold these people until the whole process of charging them, litigating in a court, finding them guilty or not and then processing them out of the country takes place. And we only have two facilities in which you can put families intact. A small one in (INAUDIBLE), New Mexico, and another one in Dilley, Texas. We used to have a big facility in Taylor, Texas, but the courts have made us, in essence, restricted and then Obama closed it down. WALLACE: So where -- so where are we on the idea that somehow this policy, which is sparking a lot of growing outrage, is going to be an effective tool for the Trump administration to use to bring Democrats to the negotiating table? ROVE: Look, my hope is, is -- I know the president said it's a negotiating tactic. I hope the Democrats will not get stuck on trying to win that argument with the president. They're not going to convince him that this was the wrong thing to do. They ought to find a way to resolve the situation, which is, provided an opportunity for the dreamers, to -- to -- and this is also incumbent upon the Republicans in the House. The dreamers get a path to citizenship and get to remain here and there are other changes on the other side, including money for the border wall. Look, we have a border -- we have a wall along, I think, 600 miles of the board. It needs to be replaced and upgraded. That's primarily what the president is talking about. He has given up on the notion of -- of building a wall at the top of the canyon in Santa Elena Canyon in Texas, which -- where the U.S. border is 1,500 feet in the air. He's finally given up on that notion. So he's talking about a limited wall. WALLACE: OK. ROVE: Maybe a couple of dozen miles more than we now have, but upgrading it to make it modern and repairing it. WALLACE: Chris, let me bring you into this, because it strikes me that the president is in the kind politically risky position here. One, to the degree that he keeps the separation going -- and I'll ask you, does he get blamed for this or do Democrats get blamed? And, if he were to get a deal, which would include, what Karl says, the amnesty or citizenship for the dreamers and a lot of hardline conservatives are going to call that amnesty -- CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICAL EDITOR: Right. WALLACE: That has some downside for him too. STIREWALT: So he is in a box. And he's in a box with his own base. And he's in a box because Republicans can't agree on anything. Their real problem here is, they can't come to terms amongst themselves about what does acceptable immigration legislation look like. Paul Ryan, they just totally faced Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan did a deal. He avoided a discharge petition that would have been basically rebellion among the members of the House. You know how rare that would be. So Paul Ryan defeats this and he says, OK, boys, hang together because we're going to come out with legislation next week. And then the president goes and dumps on it. No, we're not going to do that. Now, later, the White House comes back and tries to clean it up and say, well, what the president meant to mean was this. WALLACE: But in any -- well, wait, but, in any case, the president, 5:30 Tuesday, is going up to Capitol Hill to talk to House Republicans to try to work this out. STIREWALT: They've got to do a deal. Until Republicans can agree on what they think immigration policy should look like amongst themselves, the Democrats are off the hook. They are totally getting away scot free because Republicans have to finish their own work first. ROVE: And, remember, Quinnipiac, 64 percent of Republicans believe that dreamers out to be allowed to remain and allowed to apply for citizenship. Sixty-four percent of Republicans. Seventy-seven percent of independents, 92 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of the Americans overall. Republicans ought to do it absent the Democrats. WALLACE: So we've got less than a minute left. Will Democrats be forced to deal to try to end the separation of families or do they actually see this as a political benefit for them, as heartless as it may be? HARMAN: (INAUDIBLE) shame on anybody who wants these kids to be pawns. It's the wrong policy. The right policy was something Mike Pence and John Kelly, when he was the head of Homeland Security, tried to pursue in Florida, where they had a summit on helping Central American governments, the push factor comes from Central America. Mexico should police its southern border better. But these kids and migrants are coming from Central America, where there's rampant corruption and danger to their families. That's why they're coming through. WALLACE: So clean up the situation at home. HARMAN: Yes. WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. When we come back, Lord Stanley comes to Washington, finally. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALLACE: While our trip last week to Singapore was fascinating, the downside was we missed being here in D.C. for the Washington Capitals victory celebration. On Tuesday, the streets here rocked the red as the newly minted district of champions held a parade. It's Washington's first major sports title in 26 years. Days before, Alex Ovechkin and the Capitals made franchise history, beating the Vegas Golden Knights in game five of the Stanley Cup finals. Ovechkin and his teammates hoisted the cup along Constitution Avenue, headed for a rally in front of the Capitol. Some 100,000 fans celebrated the victory, 44 years in the making, doing it peacefully with no arrests. And just possibly showing our nation's leaders what can be accomplished when everyone pulls together. We congratulate owner Ted Leonsis, the players and the city of Washington on the victory. Now let's do it again next year. And that's it for today. Have a Happy Father's Day. For all you kids out there, especially mine, call your dad, and we'll see you next \"Fox News Sunday.\" END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" June 14, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: This is important, we're going to get to the bottom of it and there's going to be a huge follow-up when the FBI rank and file talk. Let not your heart be troubled, there she is Laura Ingraham. You wanted to be in Singapore, just admit it. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I understand that the Singapore government, they're going to bring back caning, they cane people over there. If you don't get out of the country sometime soon they're going to, they're like, \"When is Hannity ever going to leave? He's going to-\". Anyway your family wants you home Hannity so get back home safe. Fantastic show with Rudy tonight, loved it. HANNITY: They're trying to get rid of me. Only 22 hours, that's it. I'll be on a plane watching Braveheart over and over and over again. INGRAHAM: Yeah and patent. Braveheart and patent okay, get it right. HANNITY: Freedom up. INGRAHAM: Exactly, thank you so much, all right. Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is 'The Ingraham Angle.' Inspector general's bomb shell report on the FBI and DOJ, rocking the nation's capital, as a result, the IG has referred five, count them, five FBI employees for investigation. Now we have full analysis and reaction tonight from every Angle including the first remarks from the House in Del Chair Devin Nunes. Here are the highlights to bring you up to speed really quickly. The report from the DOJ Inspector General Mike Horowitz on the Hillary Clinton email investigation found that former FBI Director Jim Comey did not follow the bureau's procedures. Comey's actions damaged the FBI's image if impartiality, amazingly, Comey still refuses, though, to admit that he was wrong. He wrote, magically he wrote it so fast in today's New York Times, \"Nothing in the inspector general's report makes me think we did the wrong thing\". Now remember it was that very insubordination by Comey that Trump cited when he fired the FBI Director in 2017 and now the DOJ's inspector general agrees. Now, maybe the most shocking revelation was the vow to stop Trump from becoming President and an exchange between FBI loved birds Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, Page texted, \"He's not ever going to become president right, right?\" and he replied, \"No, no, he's not, we'll stop it\". Remember how highly placed these two were in all of this. Strzok was the FBI's lead investigator in the Clinton email probe and a top investigator sliding seamlessly in to the special counsel's Russia investigation, busy boy. Page was a senior FBI lawyer who also was on the Mueller team, so it's good gigs. Remember it is President Trump who the left said was damaging our institutions, him not the rest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump will stop at nothing to discredit the institution that are meant to keep leaders honest. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The level of lying in this administration has already greatly exceeded that which was done in the Nixon administration and I think it's sort of silly to compare Nixon and Trump, but this is extraordinarily corrosive and damaging our system. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those people are weirdly non-political, they're doing their job, they believe in their job but they're not super political people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It sows distrust in our institutions and I think it's irresponsible and maybe he needs a history lesson. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Okay here's a history lesson for you. It's now been revealed that the very people who running those institutions did the most damage to them. Despite Stzrok and Page's toxic texts, the IG Report said their bias did not directly affect their actions which is fairly astounding, shocking finding really, when you take into account all that we've learned. Not let's review today's report with our top notch panel of experts, Sol Wisenberg with the White Water deputy counsel who interviewed, remember, President Clinton, retired FBI special agent Bobby and John Solomon, investigative reporter for 'The Hill.' All right I want to get to so much with all of you, John Solomon, of all the things we learned in this report, to you, what is the most shocking? JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: I don't think anything's shocking, we've been reporting this for months, right? INGRAHAM: Thanks. That's a great line, that's a great lead into the segment. SOLOMON: There is a really consequential thing about this report, the president is under investigation for obstruction for firing James Comey. This report makes that he wasn't fired for stopping the Russian case. He was fired because he was incompetent, he violated the justice department rules. If you're the president's lawyer you have a get out of jail card with Bob Mueller with this report. It makes clear he should have been fired for insubordination. INGRAHAM: In May 2017, I want Sol to react to this, Mueller was appointed special counsel and the next day Strzok and Page exchange texts and the discussion is whether Strzok should join the special counsel's investigation and Strzok wrote, \"For me and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished business. I unleashed it with the midyear investigation, MYE, now I need to fix it and finish it\". So when Solomon says he's not shocked by anything in this, sorry John, that is a shocking revelation. He wants to finish it, big talk from such a little man. Sol SOL WISENBERG, FROMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Well it's shocking, something can be shocking but not surprising. And he shouldn't, as I've said before, even if we didn't know any of this stuff, he had no business transferring over to the Russiagate investigation, or whatever you want to call it. But I think the, I look at the OIG Report, and I think that they do say that Strzok is biased and left a big cloud over the organization. What they said is we can't say other people made decisions too and we can't say that his bias affected them. But you look at one thing that is stunning in this report and is very ironic, the OIG cannot explain, they said there's no rational explanation why after they found over 300,000 Clinton emails on the Wiener laptop in late September, the FBI did nothing for a month. I say that it's ironic because it's pretty clear there's a real possibility they did nothing because they thought it would hurt Mrs. Clinton during the election. But by waiting so long, when they were finally pressured by the Southern District of New York and decided they had to act, Director Comey said, \"Well I had to make my statement to Congress because I didn't think we'd finish analyzing the emails before the election\". If he had done his job, if they had all done their jobs in late September when they learned about the Clinton emails on the Wiener laptop, they would have been finished and he wouldn't have made that incredibly damaging announcement. And I think the reason that they just stood down is because they didn't want to hurt Mrs Clinton, I see no other rational explanation for that and neither does Mr Horowitz. He doesn't say we had any proof of it, he just says we can't understand it. It's really amazing. INGRAHAM: Yeah, we can't explain it. On page 294 of the report Bobby, it kind of jumps out of the page at you. It's titled, `Hillary Clinton and Foundation crime against children', and it's referencing all the emails that were on this Wiener laptop and there was an effort to, I guess sequester, certain emails away from the probe. You can see Coleman's notes containing the following entry, \"Anthony Wiener texting 15-year-old sexually explicit, initial analysis of laptop, thousands of emails\" et cetera. But they had a conversation about which emails would be allowed to be looked at in this case and which would be set aside, and that also raises a lot of questions. Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton exchanged thousands of emails, apparently, that I don't think were looked at in this investigation at all. Bobby your reaction to where we are here. BOBBY CHACOON, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Yeah I think that that specific question, I think, has to do with a search warrant. So the office that actually got the search warrant on that laptop, it was for that sexual crimes case against Antony Wiener, and that had specific requirements to the warrant so you can only look for certain things, so they were looking for emails of that type. When it was transferred down to Washington for the investigation, they were looking for different things, that's why the call went from New York to Washington too weeks later saying, \"Hey, did you guys get your warrant? You need to get a warrant for the stuff you need to look for on that laptop\". And to Sol's point, it's my opinion, this is my opinion, that they were sitting on that laptop and they thought they could sit on that laptop till after the election. But when New York called down and said, \"What are you doing with this, why haven't you gotten a warrant yet for your stuff?\" that panicked them. They then went and told Comey, I don't think Comey knew, because he claims not to have known but there's no reason why he didn't know. He didn't go to McCabe and said, \"Why wait two weeks before you brought this to me?\" It's beyond the pale, it's not believable. WISENBERG: He knew. INGRAHAM: Oh come on. Yeah I remember Obama supposedly didn't know anything either though guys. Solomon I got to get your weigh in on this, remember back in 2015 when the Hillary private server, classified information thing blew up, the President was asked a question by Bill Clam. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL PLANTE, CBS CORRESPONDENT: Mr. President when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was secretary of state? BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: At the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was a lie, that was lie, page 425. We want to be really specific on the show tonight so people understand that we're actually going through this report. There's a lot of headline readers are going to say, \"Oh there's nothing in this report\", there's a lot in this report, it's fascinating. I'll just read it off the screen, \"FBI analysts and Prosecutor 2 told us that former President Barack Obama was one of the 13 individuals with whom Clinton had direct contact using her clintonemail.com account\". One of 13 people, he had a pseudonym like a lot of Presidents do, with his official email, but he lied about. Why did he lie about it, why didn't he say, \"You know something I think I might have\" SOLOMON: There's no doubt. It's a great question. We don't know the answer and someone should ask President Obama. There's a lot of thing s about the Clinton email case that go back to the idea she was treated differently and there are still unprosecuted crimes still under the statue of limitations that this FBI and this Justice Department could potentially look at, and one of them is destruction of the server. How could it be that the Clinton team instructed someone or caused someone to destroy emails that were under subpoena by Congress and no one's been charged? They get immunity, they move on. I want to agree with one of the things that Sol said that was really important today, he talked about the difference in how they handled this in October, Strzok was the guy that made the decision, we're going to prioritize Trump over reopening Hillary Clinton. That says that in the report, he made a conscious decision to prioritize Trump as the man that was about to defeat Trump. INGRAHAM: And let's not forget what the IG did say is, they cannot rule out bias in the decision to prioritize Russia and Trump over Hillary, could not rule it out. He soft peddled a lot here. I got to say, Horowitz, everybody's like that Horowitz is great, but he seems to soft peddle a lot though. I know you can only conclude what the document says, I get that, but he really put yourself into a pretzel to come across as light with some of these guys as he did. I want to read something, that Sol I know you are very interested in, about Paul Cambetta, who was the individual who worked for Hillary Clinton involving the deletion of emails and so forth. This is page 147 of the report, don't we all feel like we're back in law school here Sol? 147, get your highlighters out. Guys I'm sorry we have so many pages, 103, sorry here it is, \"Cambetta stated that only he and one other administrator had the ability to delete a mailbox from the server when the agent showed him documentation indicating that an administrator had manually deleted back up files and used BleachBit on March 31st, 2015. He stated he did not recall, in addition, he stated that he could not recall the content of the March 25th, 2015 with Kendall and Mills. In sum, Cambetta took responsibility for the deletions without implicating Clinton or her attorneys\". Sol WISENBERG: Well just think you look at this, this is just absolutely sickening how they handled this person Cambetta. First of all, in their opinion, he had lied to them twice in regular interviews and he then declined to answer invoking the Fifth Amendment. But the agents thought that he had lied and they thought they had a decent chance, I thought they had enough, to do an indictment. Now if this had been Bob Mueller, think of what he did to Papadopoulos, if this had been Bob Mueller or any other aggressive counsel, they would have indicted him and put the fear of God in him, and then tried to flip him. Here, he lies to them twice, they give him immunity and he comes in and finally admits that he obstructed justice, which is what they suspected, by erasing items that were under subpoena or under an order to preserve them, but after admitting that he says, \"You know what, that crucial conversation I had about these deletions on March 25th with David Kendall and Michelle Mills, I can't remember anything about that\". Now, this to me, I know everybody's down on special counsels, but this to me is why there should have been a special counsel in this investigation. Because the special counsel who comes in and does a serious investigation, is a prominent person who's not intimidated by Mrs. Clinton, or anybody else or David Kendall, and puts the fear of God into people and that simply wasn't done here. In addition to all of that, the decision at the end, they had already given up, but the decision at the end to let Cheryl Mills and Miss Samuelson just sit in on the investigation of Mrs Clinton and the excuses for why they didn't issue a grand jury subpoena are just absolutely appalling to me. Again, this is just not the way Bob Mueller would have done it. INGRAHAM: So Bob I got to ask you. We also learned a couple of other things, we also learned that Jim Comey himself used a Gmail account for his official business so it's like contagious here. So he uses an unsecure email account to do FBI business, number one. Number two, we learn that FBI agents routinely got little perks and benefits from journalists when they had no business talking to journalists, I guess they got tickets to things, dinners and the like. What about that? They get treated to drinks, meals after work and golf outings? What is that? And by the way, some of them were attorneys, they were attorneys. CHACOON: Yeah it's hard to understand what was going on there. The rank and file, out in the field officers often rolls its eyes at a lot of things that FBI does at its headquarters and I'm sure that's happening here today and will happen tomorrow, I mean, we often keep our distance from FBI headquarters. It's unbelievable, now, to hear this stuff coming out. First of all, these guys never should have been running an investigation. These investigations should have been run out of the Washington field office by experienced agents who do this day and day out. These are FBI Managers who are not investigators, they left the world years ago to get into the management chain and work their way up. So these are not seasoned investigators, no matter what they want to call themselves, this needed to be done out of a field office, FBI headquarters, provides oversight but they shouldn't be the one making investigative decisions and because as you get higher in any bureaucracy, you become more politically sensitive. This was being done by politically sensitive people. Now to Sol's point, I think that there is a stark difference between these two investigations, the Clinton investigation and the Russian investigation. And since we have the same basic investigative team staring out both, we need to know why there was difference, well now we know. Now we know the biases that were brought to the table. Now we know that Strzok, he wanted to reprioritize the Russian investigation over the Clinton email investigation. They were wholly done differently, I still want to know why a grand jury was never seated for the Clinton email investigation, it was not a very aggressive investigation, in my opinion. You have to seat a grand jury, you have to issue grand jury subpoenas, you have to put people under oath before grand jury if you want to do a serious and aggresive investigation. WISENBERG: There were some subpoenas, just to make it clear. There were some grand jury subpoenas but no witnesses were ever forced to come to the grand jury. INGRAHAM: And people were given immunity, he should have never been given immunity. At one point they were shocked that, I think it was Cheryl Mills, who was in a meeting when they discussing whether to subpoena Hillary Clinton. What is Cheryl Mills, a close associate of Hillary Clinton, doing in an FBI conversation about whether a subpoena? CHACOON: A potential witness in the same case. INGRAHAM: This is like, Sol you learn this, right, in ethics class in law school, right, continuing legal education, do we actually have to do that, I guess, for the FBI? This is insanity, complete craziness. Anyway great panel, great panel to all of you, thank you very much for your insights. And I want you to stay right there for an important reaction to the IG Report you're not going to see anywhere else. My exclusive interview with the House Intel Chair Devin Nunes, just moments away.  INGRAHAM: Continuing coverage of the IG Report out today, well despite some explosive revelations, some law makers are still suggesting that parts may have been redacted. Joining us now to give exclusive reaction is House Intel Chair Devin Nunes. Congressman, this is what we've all been waiting for on the Hillary email matter. Your initial reaction. DEVIN NUNES, HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The first thing I could think of is, there is information that we got today at 11 o'clock/12 o'clock that Chairman Gowdy had to call and tell me what it was, text messages that we had been asking for since late last year. Now these are text messages that clearly were pertinent to our investigation and to Pfizer abuse and to the Russian investigation, whether or not there was collusion. There are emails or text messages somebody held from us. So every day that goes by, there is a new example obstruction of a congressional investigation. INGRAHM: So I want to read to you an exchange between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the star-cross lovers. She basically said, \"Donald Trump isn't going to get elected right, right?\" and he answers basically don't worry, \"No, no, no, no we'll stop it\" What does that tell you? The lead investigator, the lead investigator. NUNES: Well he was the lead investigator in the Clinton email case. He's the lead investigator that starts off the counter intelligence investigation using our intelligence agencies to go after and target the Trump campaign, this is the gut who leads that off. But worse than all that, worse than all that, I just want to repeat what I said in opening, why wasn't that given to Congress? Why did I find out about that today at noon? I mean this is a classic case of obstruction, but then the question is, who's going to go investigate these guys? We're going to come out and be very transparent to the American people. We're ultimately going to get all the documents that we want and ultimately this is all going to spill out and people are going to ask, \"Well what are you going to do? Who's going to get busted? Who's going to go to jail?\" INGRAHAM: So Lisa Page's text was released before but the Strzok, \"Don't worry, we'll stop it, no, no, no we'll stop it\", that came today. NUNES: How could that have possibly been redacted? And that's the problem, thy keep blocking things out, across the board, not giving us documents that at the end of the day always end up being pertinent to our investigation. INGRAHAM: The IG the following in part of the report, \"Under these circumstances we did not have confidence in Strzok's decision to prioritize the Russian investigation over the following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Wiener laptop was free from bias\". So the IG cannot confidently state that that decision was not free from bias. But they are all dining out, on the left, that there was no political bias on the part of Comey that was found. So they're trying to really downplay it. NUNES: Yeah, let me tell you what we really know about the time. So we actually had, I've never actually said this before because we had whistle blowers and we couldn't really use the information, but now that it's in the IG Report, we can. We had whistle blowers that came to us in late 2016 who talked to us about this laptop sitting up in New York that had additional emails on it. The House Intelligence Committee, we had that but we couldn't do anything with it. INGRAHAM: When was that again? NUNES: In 2016. INGRAHAM: Do you know when exactly? NUNES: I think it was late September. INGRAHAM: Okay so ultimately, they didn't move on this until late October? NUNES: So good FBI agents brought this to our attention, but what could we do with it? INGRAHAM: Well there's another exchange I want to bring to your attention. NUNES: Because you know why? As I said it had all been classified, and so this is the game that Comey and company had been playing as they hide behind this top secret, classification. INGRAHAM: Well they all though that Hillary was going to win and rocking the boat was tough. He made a decision to go after that laptop because he thought, \"If somebody finds out, they'd think the whole election was illegitimate\", and then they quickly dispensed it as, \"there's nothing here to worry about\". NUNES: That's true, but what also is true is the same people in charge today still believe they can run the clock out and they're trying to run the clock out for the rest of this Congress so we can't finish our investigations. INGRAHAM: Are there still people in the FBI today who believe they operate by a different set of rules? NUNES: At the top. At the top I think that is still true and we heard some great words today from Christopher Wray, the new Director and I got to tell you it's a little bit frustrating because we've had these very same conversations with him, many months ago, where we said look, you're not responsible for any of this. You need to clean this up and we'll support you in cleaning this up. But yet, here it is today we get this text message at noon today, one this absolutely pertinent to our investigation. Now maybe they have a good excuse for it, but the problem with it is, if they didn't give it to us it's a problem, but if they didn't know about it's an even bigger problem because who was obstructing the investigation? INGRAHAM: All right there are some other things that we need to get to. There's another exchange, FBI attorney sent, number two, they don't identify who this is and I think it's important to know who this is, for some reason we can't get the person's name. \"FBI Attorney number two sent an instant message to FBI attorney number one commenting on the amount of money the subject of an FBI investigation had been paid while working on the Trump campaign\". Someone they were looking at, how much they get paid. FBI attorney one says, \"Is it making you rethink you commitment to the Trump administration?\" FBI attorney number two says, \"Hell no, viva la resistance\". NUNES: Yeah that's awful, that's awful. INGRAHAM: I mean the resistance to Trump winning, apparently, for all we know, still be working at the FBI. They're blowing this off on other networks saying this isn't important? NUNES: Well now there's five, I think there's five now. The IG Report can't get through it all. But there's five people have been kicked off the campaign, right? So if there's five people who have been kicked off the campaign, I mean off the Mueller team, how is it possible, if you look at the rest of the people that were there, they were all Clinton donors. So I don't know how this is going to end up fairly. I don't know where this going. INGRAHAM: Should we learn the names of these attorney who are sending these messages? Or are part of the resistance? NUNES: I don't know why, unless they're an undercover agent. INGRAHAM: An attorney, they're identified as attorneys. NUNES: It should not be a classified name, no. Unless they are working under cover, no. This should not be classified, this is the stuff that always happens-- INGRAHAM: So now I know how you feel because I feel this is happening I the whole country now. There was another issue involving the FBI employees at every level of the organisation. This is from the report, \"With no official reason to be in contact with the media, who are nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with the journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks\". We also found that they were getting benefits from the journalists, getting perks, getting tickets, getting meals. NUNES: They were leaking like crazy but the problem with it is, is that the IG Report discovered that this happened a couple of years ago. But don't forget the leak that just occurred last week where at midnight the department of justice sends out this that Devin Nunes and Paul Ryan had a chance to read documents and they didn't read them. Remember that? That was a leak in the middle of the night, a midnight kind of press release so that we would wake up in the morning and have to answer all this new narrative that they are creating that Republicans asked for documents and don't read them. This is what we are dealing with. So it's not as if the leaks have actually stopped. Now they are just doing it, it's the FBI people that are leaking. Now it's just at the top level the Department of Justice that's leaking. INGRAHAM: There was a few people in the media today, more than a few, downplaying all of this. I want to play for you a little short montage. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST: I expected a sledgehammer. We just got the same kind of hammer you use to nail painting on the wall. I was surprised at how mild it was. JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: If you look at this assault on the FBI that has taken place over the last year-and-a-half, that has been the clarion call of some of the opposition saying that these are crooks. They are corrupt. They tried to throw an election. This report does not say that. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Congressman. NUNES: If you look at the one gentleman on there, that's the guy that it is one of Comey's buddies. He was working at the FBI. A lot of these agents, the other networks have just hired all of these former FBI and DOJ Clinton people and Obama people, and that's just what this is. INGRAHAM: Josh Campbell, a buddy of Comey's, so nothing there to see. This is all good. Congressman, you still have a lot more to get to with the Russia investigation, and -- NUNES: We're almost there. We're almost there. But there's a reason why they've been hiding these documents for two months. And it's probably very similar to what we found in the I.G. report. INGRAHAM: Thank you so much, appreciate you coming into night. NUNES: Anytime, thank you. INGRAHAM: I have my own take on runaway prosecutors at the highest levels of government. You do not want to miss tonight's Angle before Roger Stone and Dinesh D'Souza react. That's coming up in just a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Prosecutors, politics, and personal ambition, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. As a former criminal defense attorney, I saw my share of individuals and companies caught in the crosshairs of government investigators who desperately wanted a trophy on the wall. We know the scenes. A CEO arrested and cuffed at his or her office for all the employees to see for maximum humiliation, a prosecutor holding a press conference claiming the evidence will show that some high profile person is guilty of myriad crimes, meaning jail for the rest of his adult life. It's all high drama. It's all like an episode of \"Law & Order.\" Now of course we need prosecutors to help lock up the bad guys, whether they are white-collar criminals or violent offenders. And when they are operating professionally, I'm talking about prosecutors, and in good faith, they should be recognized for the public service that they provide. But long before today's I.G. report was released, come on, most of us knew the FBI's handling of the Clinton email and Russia probes are textbook examples of how cases should not be handled. Of course, the usual suspects spent most of the day downplaying the findings of the I.G., because the I.G. found no political bias. Oh, it is just run-of-the-mill insubordination here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST: We just got the same kind of hammer you use to nail in a painting on the wall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Hillary case was properly decided on the law, and that's headline number one. Number two, no indication or evidence that political biases. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D\u2014CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: It's deeply disturbing the Republicans remain obsessed with undermining our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: OK, nice try, Nancy. But the I.G.'s findings show the opposite. As we discussed earlier, the evidence shows that FBI director Jim Comey operated according to his own set of rules in the Clinton email investigation. Quote, \"Comey admitted that he concealed his intentions from the DOJ until the morning of his press conference on July 5 and instructed his staff to do the same. We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so. We acknowledge that Comey faced difficult choices in late October 2016. However, we found it extraordinary that Comey assessed that it was best that the FBI director not speak directly with the attorney general and the deputy attorney general.\" Like so many people in this town, he thought, Jim Comey, that his title gave him a license to ignore basic prosecutorial protocol. And no wonder he wasn't all that keen on pursuing Hillary's use of an unsecured server given the fact that we found out today that he himself was using a personal Gmail account to conduct government business. Even Hillary referenced that in a tweet today. And if you, like I, thought Comey came off as imperious in television interviews for that stupid book of his, check out this tweet. He said today in a tweet \"I respect the DOJ I.G. office which is why I urged them to do this review. The conclusions are reasonable even though I disagree with some. People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. I pray no director faces it again. Thanks to I.G.'s people for hard work.\" He lost me at \"people of good faith.\" And notice by the way how he makes himself out to be the victim here. It's unbelievable. Comey should change his middle name to hubris. The man has learned absolutely nothing from this experience. And remember, by the way, this is the guy who signed off on three FISA applications and didn't think it was necessary to tell the FISA court that Hillary paid for the Steele dossier. This is the same man who allowed Peter Strzok, the FBI agent, to change the description of Mrs. Clinton's use of the private server from grossly negligent to merely extremely careless so as not to trigger the underlying criminal statute. But of course there was this breaking news to compete with the I.G. release today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The New York attorney general had just announced a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Filed just less than an hour ago, a 41- page civil complaint alleging that the Donald J. Trump Foundation was actually an empty shell. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: New York's attorney general is suing President Trump and his three eldest children, alleging, quote, self-dealing another persistent illegal conduct at the president's charity. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: I'm sure this is all just coincidence, the timing of this lawsuit, come on, against the Trump Foundation is beyond suspicious. Remember, it comes from the New York attorney general's office. Consider the source. Disgraced former attorney general of New York Eric Schneiderman, who you might remember sent out a fundraising email right after the investigation into the foundation was opened. He is a truly odious figure who abused and humiliated his female victims and then used his office and his position to threaten them into silence. Mark my words, we haven't heard the last of what he did to his victims. And the person who continues his crusade, Barbara Underwood, who set up on taking over for Schneiderman, quote, \"I believe this job at this moment in history is the most important job I have ever had.\" Yes, little subtlety there. Think about it. Donald Trump operated a foundation that had zero overhead, no administrative costs, and gave away more than $19 million to a variety of charitable causes. Trump and his companies personally poured $8 million into the foundation. Now there was a mistaken contribution made to Pat Bondi's campaign, but that was rectified once it was discovered. In other words, this is a penny-ante stuff that would never be pursued by the New York state of attorney general's office if Donald Trump hadn't gotten into politics. This is yet another example of politicized law enforcement, an abuse of process. This time it was through a civil action on the state level. Where were they, by the way, at the federal level when the Clinton Foundation was accepting funds from foreign governments while Hillary was secretary of state? Sometimes they wanted to get meetings with Hillary. Meanwhile, Comey and his political activists posing as agents bent the legal standards for Hillary Clinton, allowing her to walk free. And they assumed that she was going to be going into the White House let's not forget. Clinton in setting up that private server made up her own rules, just as Comey did in clearing her of any criminal wrongdoing. My friends, this is all a hideous perversion of justice. Now FBI Director Christopher Wray is insisting the I.G. report clears the FBI, though, of structural responsibility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: Nothing, nothing in this report impugns the integrity of our workforce as a whole. REP. TREY GOWDY, R\u2014S.C.: Chris Wray, I'm sorry. You are wrong. Chris, there are consequences. The consequences are that your fellow citizens question whether or not they can have confidence in the world's premier law enforcement agency. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Remember when Jim Comey said this, by the way? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: It makes me mildly nauseous to think we might have had some impact on the election. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) INGRAHAM: It makes me wildly nauseous reading this I.G. report and learning how Comey and his colleagues intended to impact the election. And they failed. And that's the Angle. Two men who know all too well what it's like to be targeted by the government. Stay right there because Roger Stone and Dinesh D'Souza react next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Joining us now are two men have been unfairly targeted by investigators tangled up in that mess. Informal presidential adviser Roger Stone, author of the new book \"Stone's Rules, How to Win at Politics, Business, and Style,\" and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza whose new movie \"Death of a Nation, Can We Save America a Second Time?\" comes out August 3rd. Looking forward to that. Both of you, it's great to have you both on tonight. So Dinesh, let's start with you. Whether it's the New York state attorney general's office going after the Trump Foundation that gave away $19 million with no overhead, no administrative costs, which a lot of wealthy people do. They set up their own private foundations and then donate the money from there, whether that or what we find out about the bias in Peter Strzok and the merry band of prosecutors from the I.G.'s report, what's your takeaway tonight? What should the American people be thinking? DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER: I think the American people, like me, are arriving at the realization that in America today there are quite a few criminals with badges. Growing up as I did in India, we had a lot of corruption, and we knew there were criminals on the street and there were criminals with badges. And the criminals with badges are more dangerous because they don't just violate the law. They corrupt the law. They exploit the neutrality that you expect of them. They pervert the democratic process, as Peter Strzok tried to do, by essentially rigging. Think about this. This is unprecedented. The FBI attempting to in a sense shape the outcome of a democratic election. So these are terrible things happening now in America. And I think the American people are realizing that something needs to be done about them, and it's not enough to know about them. Some action needs to be taken. INGRAHAM: It's like you're operating in an alternative universe if you watch any of the other networks tonight. It's no big deal. Let's move on to Stormy Daniels. Roger, I have to read part of this report. A lot of stuff not being covered at all again by other media outlets. This is a quote from the report. November 9th, 2016, a text message from an FBI, unidentified employee. This is a day after the election, \"All the people who were initially voting for her,\" Mrs. Clinton, \"would not and were not swayed by the decision the FBI put out.\" In other words, the late Weiner emails. \"Trump supporters were all poor to middle-class, uneducated, lazy POS that think he will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. They probably didn't watch the debates, aren't fully educated on his policies, and are stupidly wrapped up in his unmerited enthusiasm.\" Has anything ever encapsulated, Roger, the elites' disdain for the American people. ROGER STONE, AUTHOR OF \"STONE'S RULES\": No, and I think when we get to the bottom of it, we're going to find out that at the end of the day the Obama Justice Department, the Obama FBI used the authority and the capability of this state and a bogus dossier to conduct surveillance on the Republican candidate for president and to infiltrate his campaign with spies. So FBI Director Wray today said we respect the congressional oversight, at the same time refusing to hand over any information regarding that very FBI infiltration of the Trump campaign. INGRAHAM: Dinesh, magically Jim Comey has already written an op-ed for \"The New York Times.\" It comes out. It's already written. It's published today. I'm just going to share a small part of it. He said \"This independent assessment will be useful to thoughtful people and an important contribution and historical record. Its detailed report should serve to both protect and build the reservoir of trust and credibility necessary for the DOJ and the FBI to remain strong and independent.\" Wild. The man has learned zippo, Dinesh. D'SOUZA: You also see the collusion between the deep state operating behind closed doors and organs like \"The New York Times\" which time these kinds of counterpoints to immediately try to defuse the impact of the I.G. report. What I want to know here, Roger mentioned the notion of getting to the bottom of it. The tremendous kind of glee and sense of immunity with which these agents at the high level of operating suggest to me that they would not do it without someone giving the order. There's that question from \"The Godfather,\" who gave the order? And you know, Laura, the phrase, cui bono, who benefits is a good way to try to guess who gave the order. Hillary benefits, but Hillary clearly couldn't have given the order. She was secretary of state and then she was out of the government. Obama on the other hand very much did not want Trump to win. He knew that Trump would try to erase his legacy. It's very embarrassing for him to be succeeded by Trump. I wonder if Obama is the one who gave the order. INGRAHAM: Roger, we have some emails to that effect. Final thoughts. We already found out the president lied when he said he found out about Hillary's private email server when everybody else did. Now we find out he's one of the 13 people she communicated with on the private server using that private email account, so he lied about that. STONE: When you add to the fact that Peter Strzok says in one of his text messages the president wants to know everything, the question is very clear. What did the president know and when did he know it? He answered that question. I think he has to answer it under oath to the Congress. INGRAHAM: He is going to be going out on the campaign trails. Apparently he's the only person who can win elections for the Democrats. So he's going to be fanning out this election season. Thank you both. Phenomenal analysis as always from both of you. Now we have some breaking news on immigration to bring to you after the break. This is very important. Ron DeSantis is here to give us the latest. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Just in to us moments ago, the House GOP is releasing the text of their new immigration proposal expected to be brought to the floor as early as next week. Wow. What's the rush? Among the highlights -- ending the controversial policy known as catch and release, ensuring minors who enter the country illegally are not separated from the parents. That's not going to draw more people in. Calls for an end to the visa lottery system, but instead just reallocates the 55,000 visas to supposedly a merit-based program. Let's discuss with Congressman Ron DeSantis. And money for the wall, apparently, $25 billion for the wall. Ron, no E-Verify which I'm told doesn't matter, but I think it matters. The chamber doesn't like E-Verify. E-Verify means you don't get to work unless you are verified to be legally in the country, correct? Chamber doesn't want it. REP. RON DESANTIS, R\u2014FLA.: Yes. And so if you are doing an amnesty that's 1.8, maybe more million people. INGRAHAM: We didn't have that in the bullets, but there's a huge amnesty. DESANTIS: Guess what's going to happen. That's going to create an incentive for more people to come illegally. And if you don't have E-Verify to kind of remove a disincentive, that wall, even if it's a good faith effort at the wall, and I'm not sure it is, that ain't going to be built in a day. You need to strip the courts of jurisdiction over lawsuits because this thing will get tied up forever with the wall. So without E-Verify you're going to have a border surge like we had in 2014. That obviously is going to have a lot of people moving but that's also a wet kiss to the drug cartels because they are going to be able to move a lot product across the border if there's a border -- INGRAHAM: I'm told asylum fraud is addressed, but again, it just was release, 293 pages. We haven't had time to go through the whole thing. DESANTIS: Here's the thing, Laura, the Goodlatte bill has what we campaigned on. The Goodlatte bill and chain migration. INGRAHAM: Here's what they say. They won't get it through. They won't get it through. It's not going to pass the Senate. It probably won't pass the House, although Paul Ryan, apparently it will be brought up next week. Then I hear Goodlatte was involved in writing this new bill. I don't know if he was or not. DESANTIS: We need to defund sanctuary cities. We need E-Verify. We need to end chain migration, get rid of the diversity visa lottery. We need to do all those things. And look, make people go on record for that. It's not a popular vote in the Republican Party, but even in these Democrat district, people want E-Verify. It's not even a partisan thing at the grassroots level. INGRAHAM: Business doesn't want E-Verify, so the money that is coming into these campaigns, they do not want to check the identity of people. DESANTIS: And that means it undermines the rule of law, harms taxpayers, and lowers wages for Americans. That's not a good deal. INGRAHAM: But they will say it's the best we can do. And it does address some of the chain migration. We'll see how much it addresses. We understand that the amnesty could reach parents as well. So it's not just the Dreamers. Parents are included. DESANTIS: Don't forget, Laura, it's going to the Senate and either die or they're going to make yours. Those were the only two options. The Senate ain't going to just pass this. And so you're really running a risk that this could get -- INGRAHAM: Devil's advocate here. They say the Freedom Caucus people, you never can govern. You say you want to get something done but then when you can get something done, limit chain migration, bring down the immigration of the country, you just say no, were not going to do it. DESANTIS: The goal is to end illegal immigration. This would fuel more illegal immigration if you don't have things like E-Verify. Will it work, yes or no? INGRAHAM: The president has got to think long and hard about this because this seems like a bum's rush to me. I do like the feeling of being rushed. DESANTIS: No committee hearings. INGRAHAM: That's convenient. All right, that's it for us tonight. We'll be in San Francisco tomorrow, so tune in. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" is next. Stay there.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" July 2, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JEANINE PIRRO, GUEST HOST: And welcome to \"Hannity.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro, in tonight for Sean. In less than one week from tonight, President Trump will announce his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Early this morning, the president met with four potential candidates and plans to meet with at least two more later this week. Meanwhile, during an interview with our own Maria Bartiromo, President Trump weighed in on how or if Roe versus Wade will play a role in his decision. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\") MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Are you going to ask your nominees beforehand how they might vote on Roe versus Wade? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's a big one, and probably not. They're all saying don't do that, you shouldn't do. But I'm putting conservative people on. And I'm very proud of Neil Gorsuch, he's been outstanding. His opinions are, you know, so well written, so brilliant. And I'm going to try and do something. I like that. But I don't think I will be specific in the questions I'll be asking. And I'm actually told that I shouldn't be. BARTIROMO: Because on the campaign trail, you said you would leave it to the states. TRUMP: Well, maybe someday it will be to the states. You never know how that's going to turn out. That's a very complex question. The Roe v. Wade is probably the one that people are talking about in terms of having an effect. But we'll see what happens. But it could well end up with states at some point. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And joining us with more from the White House on what will be an incredibly important decision is Ed Henry -- Ed. ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Judge, good to see you. And, in fact, what the president is doing is moving very quickly to get through these interviews of potential nominees to the high court because he wants to get the clock ticking so it gets harder and harder for Democrats to justify any obstruction, any delay beyond the midterm elections, what they say they want to do. They want to stall this. The president is likely to get his nominee in the end because of the precedent that has been set for just a simple majority. But in that interview with Maria that you mentioned, he made it clear he would not ask any candidate about Roe v. Wade. That is in part aimed at trying to secure yes votes from those two women, pro-choice Republicans, Murkowski and Collins. But Collins already indicating this weekend she'll oppose anyone who would vote to change existing law on abortion. Collins says that the White House has told her they're actually expanding the list beyond the original 25 names that the president talked about it on the campaign because of her concerns. But the president runs a risk of upsetting evangelical conservatives who love that list of names. We're hearing though that the president seems to be standing strong and has now the list down to about six. Appellate court judges from the right, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Amul Thapar, Joan Larsen, Raymond Kethledge, and Thomas Hardiman. We've heard these names before. The president today made clear the list is actually getting smaller. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I'll be meeting with two or three more, and we'll make a decision on the United States Supreme Court, the new justice, that will be made over the next few days. And we'll be announcing it on Monday. (END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: So, given the possible Republican no votes and on top of the fact that Republican John McCain has not been voting because of health, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may need to reel in some Democrats who supported Justice Neil Gorsuch, all of whom have tough re-election battles where the president carried it big. You see them there, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin. As for the push by more liberal Democratic senators like Chuck Schumer who say they want to push this beyond the midterms, we checked, and it's interesting. Four of the last eight justices who have been confirmed have been confirmed in midterm election years. So, that argument by Democrats can be difficult, Judge. PIRRO: All right. Ed, thanks so much. THOMAS: Thank you. PIRRO: And while President Trump weighs his Supreme Court options, America's left is already acting apocalyptic. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER, ON \"REAL TIME\"/HBO: We first have to find ways to stop that vote from happening. BILL MAHER, HOST: Find ways, what does that mean? Like what? MOORE: Well, I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States capitol. JENNIFER RUBIN, BLOGGER, WASHINGTON POST'S \"RIGHT TURN\": Instead of circling the Capitol with a million people, take the million people to Maine and go to LL Bean and tell them in Maine, you need to leave Maine unless Susan Collins votes the right way. That's how you play hard ball. You do it smart. You go to Alaska. You say, you know what, all of those Alaskan cruise, we're going to start boycotting Alaskan cruises if your senator -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE, ON MSNBC: But to go back where there's plenty of historical precedent, increase the court, putting an additional justice on for every far right justice that's approved under the kind of rule -- JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, MSNBC: Again, the logic doesn't matter. What the court will be looking at, Susan, is precedent and there is precedent. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One woman actually told me that she was an activist in the '60s and she had not been very active since then. And when she heard about Kennedy stepping down, she literally got physically ill. (END VIDEO CLIPS) PIRRO: Keep in mind, the people you just saw don't even know who President Trump is going to nominate. Joining us now with reaction is the author of the upcoming book \"Why We Fight: Recovering America's Will to Win\", Fox News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka, former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and Fox News contributor, Ari Fleischer. All right, guys, I want to reference that video that we saw where Michael Moore is calling for a million people to surround the U.S. capitol to prevent Senate vote, that's what it's for, to prevent the vote. And now, they're talking about getting companies to move out of states if Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski don't vote the way they want. But the most interesting I thought was Tom Rogers who talked about increasing the number of justices on the court for every conservative justice who is put on. Is there, I'm going to start with you, Ari, is there any kind of precedent to assume that if a conservative justice dies, that only a conservative can replace him? Or if a swing justice retires, that we've got to put a swing person in there? ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, of course not. There isn't. Here's the beauty of our system, judge, why I sleep so well at night. The reason Donald Trump can put whoever he wants on the Supreme Court within reason, and the Senate will confirm it, is because the American people elected Donald Trump and the Republican Senate. If the American people had elected a Democratic president and Democratic Senate, the Democrat could have done that. These decisions are fundamentally made by the people. And our system works. That's why Donald Trump is in this position. And when the Democrats talk about going to the extremes they are, a million people around the capitol, now, that's Michael Moore who said that, they're talking about subverting the system so they can save their version of the system. That is not democratic. That is as wrong as wrong gets. PIRRO: All right. And, Dennis Kucinich, Democratic congressman, I mean, do you look at the Democrat Party of today and say to yourself, wait a minute, they're talking about abolishing ICE. We've got people who are actually out there opposing a nominee for the Supreme Court justice, when we don't even know who the person is. DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN: Well, judge, we have to keep in mind that Roe v. Wade is definitely a flash point. You have millions of American women and men who stand with them are not going to be silent if a new Supreme Court appointee favors criminalizing abortion. The Burger court in 1973 declared that there's a right to privacy under due process in the 14th Amendment. And I think that anything that goes beyond that balancing and creates an imbalance will cause people to mobilize all over the country. PIRRO: Well, and so, Sebastian, I mean, what do you -- Sebastian Gorka, what do you say to that, the concept that, you know, they're going to mobilize? It's not as though any Supreme Court nominee is going to get up there and say, I support Roe v. Wade, or I don't support Roe v. Wade, or I'm going to be an activist or I'm not. Isn't it all going to be based on decisions that have already been written and interpretations of those? SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: You're the judge, you know better than anybody. This is just scare tactics. They've been pulling this out since Bork's nomination in the 1980s. Roe v. Wade, as you said, we don't even know who the president is going to nominate. This is the left. They disagree with democracy when it doesn't go their way. And they understand the stakes involved here, Judge. If we have a conservative justice appointed and then voted in by the Senate, we will inoculate the republic for at least a generation from the lunacy of the left. From the identity politics, the idea is that we don't need immigration from the lunacy of the left, from the identity politics. The idea is that we don't need immigration policed on the border, the idea that you can give everything to everybody for free, the legislating from the bench that we've seen for years now. It will be defended in the Supreme Court by constitutionalists. PIRRO: (AUDIO GAP) -- ran for office, he said he was going to vote or put conservative justices on the Supreme Court bench, no one should be surprised. We're talking about Heritage and the Federalist Society. I mean, I can't imagine that they aren't individuals who are pro-life. But I think the significant point, Ari, is that when a Lindsey Graham gets on television yesterday and he says, yes, I don't have a problem if you're, you know, what your politics are. I just don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. That's interesting. FLEISCHER: Yes. But, you know, it is really what the senators think about their individual positions is not what's at stake because the Senate positions will cancel each other out. It is the decisions made on the basis of facts presented in a court of law and the justices weigh in. And again, that's the way our system should work. It's not a roll call vote of the United States Senate. But what I have noticed in the past, there is a difference between the two parties. There's a litmus test in the Democratic Party. And you heard it all the time, the Democratic primaries, the Democrats always say, I will not nominate anybody who isn't for gay marriage, who isn't for abortion. It is an overt litmus test. Republicans typically say that they want somebody with a temperament that is proper for the bench, to hear the cases and to hear them wisely. And Donald Trump has said he'll name conservatives. So, you know, I understand the Democrats have a fear that Roe v. Wade will be overturned and the states will decide it, and it will be allowed somewhere, others places won't. But they act as if abortion is the only thing the Supreme Court does. PIRRO: Right. FLEISCHER: It is the first issue and the only issue so many Democrats talk about. It's so much broader than that and that's why you really do want somebody who is a big thinker and I think that's frankly the list that Donald Trump has put together. PIRRO: And, you know, Dennis Kucinich, I mean, there are two women on that list, and I know that, you know, as I said, it's almost as though this is apocalyptic right now for the left. But nominating a woman won't make a darned bit of difference will it for the left? KUCINICH: Well, whether it's a man or a woman, and, you know, I certainly would applaud President Trump for considering a woman to be appointed to the court. But whatever the gender of the person, one must be aware that we're at a time of great polarization in this country, and people are very afraid that some basic rights that have been constitutionally protected under the 14th Amendment for example, for the last 45 years, could just be vitiated by a new court. So, that's -- you know, we have to realize that's a concern. And what we need to know, I think, Judge, is in a larger country, polity, we need to find ways of depolarizing this whole debate over abortion and start to focus on things like prenatal care, post-natal care, child care, universal health care, living wage, and shift the debate to really show that whatever your position, we can appreciate life. PIRRO: But, Dennis, wouldn't you agree that part of the problem is that the left is going crazy in the event that someone is pro-life and is appointed to the bench. I mean, that's what it's about. They're making it an issue. You can sit there and say, it's great, we should worry about childcare. Sebastian Gorka, I'll go to you. At the end of the day, you've got Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly. I mean, these guys are, and lady, are in a tough spot right now. But let's assume that Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski decide, if -- she's not pro-choice or he's not pro-choice, I'm not interested. What do you think the harm is going to be if these Dems, in the Trump heavy states, vote for this justice? GORKA: Well, if you look at what's happening, just the last few days and weeks, politically in America, it's as if a Democrat Party don't understand what happened on November 8, 2016. They're doubling down. The idea that you have somebody who wants to have no borders on the South, who believes that we have black sites run by ICE, these people want to boycott cruise liners in Alaska? The Dems are so out of touch with America, it's going to be very, very good for the Republicans and the president come November and come 2020. PIRRO: There's no question, Ari, that in the end, the president will surely get his way, it's not like there's going to be, you know, the left is going to be able to say we want this person. President is going to nominate someone he wants. But to be realistic about it, if this second justice and when this second justice is appointed, we will have a Supreme Court that is conservative, or conservative leaning, without a doubt, for the next generation. FLEISCHER: I think conservative leaning. I don't think you can say conservative yet, because I think it's a history of the Supreme Court shows, they have their independent minds that they use. Justice Roberts might turn out to be more moderate than people think. We just don't know. And that why I value intellect, I value temperament as opposed to positions previously taken. Times change and I want to see what kinds of minds our justices have. That's the most important thing on the bench. So, a lot of it from both the right and the left, you can be -- you can go too far ballyhooing how far change can go, and especially for an institution like the Supreme Court. We'll see. PIRRO: And, Dennis, with respect to the hearing itself, what do you think some of these candidates, or nominees are going through right now? They're meeting with the president, four have met, two more as I understand it are going to be meeting with him. How do you think they communicate to him without him asking the question, how conservative and supportive they would be? KUCINICH: I think we have to take the president at his word that he hasn't asked for a litmus test. And I think there'll just be an honest exchange and the president will make his decision based on the interaction I would think, you know, from reports that I've heard from other people who've been appointed. So, we'll see. But you can bet that those whose names are coming up are going to be carefully scrutinized. And, keep in mind, you know, this nomination is going to go through. We have to keep in mind that Mr. Obama's nomination of Garland was held up for 293 days. And never saw the light of day. So, you know, that's the politics. PIRRO: Politics are rough. But in the end, I mean, at least we don't have the filibuster, judicial filibuster, Sebastian Gorka, and it's just right now a majority vote. And if we -- you know, John McCain is not voting, if we lose the two that we might lose, I mean, there are three that may come over. Last words, Sebastian Gorka? GORKA: Well, to quote a certain former senator from Illinois, elections have consequences. And so does the fact that now the Republicans have the House and the Senate and these rules are now in place. After the president and his meetings, I know exactly what's happening. The president, you know, judge, has a preternatural capacity to read individuals very, very rapidly. He's meeting them. He gets a gut instinct for who they are and I think it's going to be one question. Are they originalists? Do they look at the Constitution as talking about eternal truths? If he thinks that, then that person is going to the top of the list. PIRRO: Originalist, texualist, constitutionalist, who respect precedent and stare decisis. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being with us this evening. KUCINICH: Thank you. PIRRO: All right. And coming up, Kellyanne Conway on how some prominent Democrats are calling for ICE to be abolished. Plus, Michelle Malkin and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on the left continuing to verbally attack women in the Trump administration. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Welcome back to \"Hannity\". In their continued push for open borders, many elected Democrats are joining the far left to attack ICE, with some even calling for it to be abolished. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role and the way that it's being administered and the work it is doing. We need to probably think about starting from scratch. REP. MARK POCAN, D-WIS.: ICE isn't doing what it was created to do, it's being used as his own personal police force, and in those actions, it's actually making us less safe. SEN. KRISTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: I don't think ICE today is working as intended. I believe -- CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: You think you should get rid of the agency? GILLIBRAND: I believe that it has become a deportation force. And I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues. And I think you should re-imagine ICE REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT, D-N.Y.: It's too aggressive and over the top, and I think it's lost its course. So, therefore, we should replace it with something sensible, something practical. They still have to be law enforcement agency but one that's a little bit more humane. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and -- (CHEERS) (END VIDEO CLIPS) PIRRO: During his interview with Maria Bartiromo, President Trump responded to calls to end ICE and even issued a warning for the Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: You know, ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13 and they take them out, because they're much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones, you get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house. I love that issue if they're going to actually do that. They're seriously talking about that? Because they -- you are going to have a country that is crime ridden, the border patrol, the border patrol agents, ICE, these people are incredible. Between Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and getting rid of ICE and having open borders -- and the biggest thing, you have open borders, all it's going to do is lead to massive, massive crime. That's going to be their platform. Open borders, which equals crime. I think they'll never win another election. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And yesterday, the president tweeted: The liberal left also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job and want open borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable. Make America great again. Joining me now to discuss is counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. All right. Good evening, Kellyanne. I have to tell you something. I just wrote it down again. When they say ICE isn't doing what it was created to do, what do they think ICE was created to do, serve coffee and tea? KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's an excellent question that nobody is asking them. I think it's time to tamp down the emotion and go for some of the information. If you quiz most of those people, including elected officials, as to why ICE is created in the first place and response to 9/11, and what it is supposed to be doing. And, by the way, what it does do. At the White House, we're working on that exact document, so that people get information. ICE provides so many services that are critical to everyone's security in this country, Jeanine. You know when Kirsten Gillibrand jumping on the abolish ICE train up in New York where she's United States senator, ICE has removed 40 criminal aliens in recent weeks. I mean, she's going against the security of her own people when she calls for this nonsense. Cynthia Nixon, an actress who happens to be running for governor against Andrew Cuomo and pulling him to the left, is saying they're a terrorist organization. No, you've got it backwards, they stop terrorists from coming into the country. They also seize thousands of pounds of narcotics, and they get rid of child smugglers, and they detect people who are transnational gang members. I mean, the president is putting it this way. It's a binary choice. PIRRO: Right. CONWAY: You're either for open borders and the crime that comes with that, or you're for a sovereign nation that has physical borders and less crime. And let me tell you one more thing, you see this argument now with the Democrats. You've got some of the older, more senior Democrats saying, well, I don't think abolishing ICE is a good idea. And you got Democrats disingenuously talking about immigration reform. When President Trump brought them to the table in the cabinet room for one solid hour in January and all they wanted to talk about was the Dreamers, was DACA. They didn't want to talk about immigration reform. The president come on with the 70-point immigration plan and he boiled down to four points. It's been up for a vote in Congress. They're being disingenuous when they say they want to do this. PIRRO: Well, clearly. I mean, the president was willing with go with DACA and they weren't. I mean, think about it. When Obama was president and he had the ability and the House and the Senate, he didn't do anything. And you know, they want to make it an issue, or so it seems, and never resolve it, so they can say Republicans are against it. But what I don't understand, Kellyanne, it's like saying to people we don't want this police force and immigrants should be able to come in, we don't want to know who they are, what their records are, if they have a record, we just, you know, don't care. Do people not understand the impact -- CONWAY: You know what, Jeanine -- PIRRO: -- on the finances here? CONWAY: That's right. Well, I think the average American does. I think Americans do understand the impact on their financial security, on their everyday security. But also, you've seen Mark Penn was Hillary Clinton's pollster and chief strategist. He came out with the Harvard Harris poll where he asked the question about abolishing ICE. Do you know not abolishing ICE, keeping ICE as it is, got tripartisan support, majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents all agreed that abolishing ICE is not a good idea. So, these Democrats who are just trying to out-left each other for 2020 having done nothing in 2017 or 2018 that I can point to, they're thinking about 2020. Folks, do something in 2018 that's meaningful. So, they're going -- they're saying abolish ICE, but basically, they're -- instead of advise and consent, they're doing obstruct and distract. Instead of abolish ICE, they should be thinking about how to protect our borders. And there are a lot of Democrats I think getting very nervous about where the party is truly going. And let's see who's following them leftward off the cliff. PIRRO: Well, I think that, you know, when the president said in that recent interview, he said you know what, it's a great issue. If they want to go forward with that, then you and I both know the president has great instincts. He really gets it. He's an outsider president, he made it. Everyone said he wouldn't make it. I mean, he gets it that Americans, in addition to the economy, they want safety and security. And by saying we want open borders, we're going to abolish ICE, we want something, who said they wanted something kinder and they don't want deportation force. CONWAY: Right. And let's reimagine ICE, whatever that means. Hey, Jeanine, guess what? They say they're for open borders but none of them has the guts to go and foot the bill. They go to the protest. They don't go in the well of the Senate. They don't go in the House and introduce bills that say we're going to reimagine borders, we're going to reimagine the fact that Congress made it a crime to enter the country illegally. None of them have the guts to do that. PIRRO: Yes. Well -- CONWAY: Where's the piece of legislation? It's cheap and easy to wave a sign and go scream into a megaphone. It's harder work to come back here to Washington and actually do your job. And you know what, this president, he's on task every single day and he ran successfully on issues like illegal immigration, like having borders and security. And he always talks about the drugs that are pouring in also. He's on top of that as well. (CROSSTALK) CONWAY: Of all people, President -- PIRRO: It's a huge issue. CONWAY: You know, President Obama this past weekend -- that's right, President Obama this past weekend told the Democrats, you got to do more than mope. They've gone from hope to mope. And they're wondering where he is. Why he is not a stronger voice? Why isn't he speaking up and speaking out in a number of these issues? PIRRO: OK. CONWAY: Other than the $400,000 speeches. PIRRO: I want to ask you -- CONWAY: So, they're in disarray. We're not paying attention to that. We're just going to get borders -- sovereign nation with borders. PIRRO: All right. I want to ask you about Supreme Court nominees. I'm curious, two women in the group. The group is a very small group, maybe, five, maybe seven. What do you think? CONWAY: Well, don't forget the list is 25. And that's really the key here. This president has been transparent from the beginning. For two years. (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: But word is that the president is down to five. There may be two. We have Amy Barrett and Joan Larsen. What do you think of them? CONWAY: Well, I'm not going to comment on individual jurists. I can tell you that everyone that the president is considering checks all of the boxes for brilliant and capable, a judicial temperament, not putting their personal feelings where the Constitution belongs. The law, the judiciary interprets the laws. It does not make the laws. You have too many judges today making things up as they go along. The executive (Inaudible), the legislative branch should be making them. But it's the interpretive function of the judiciary that is so important here. This president has said he wants academic and professional credentials. And I think anyone you see on the list are people of great intellect, honorable men and women on the president's list. And look, the president put out his list then he added to the list. Jeanine, this man is so transparent and accountable, and such an important decisions. I want to tell you as somebody who spent some time with him today as well in this issue. I just have to tell you, he understands the gravity. As he has said nominating to the Supreme Court is one of the most important things that any president does. PIRRO: Of course, of course it is. CONWAY: And every -- all of the nominees, all of the justices on the Supreme Court, outlast anyone's presidency of eight years. But in many ways some of these jurists outlast the president who actually nominated them. They understand, he understands that you're talking about 30, 40, 45 years of jurisprudence. And he takes the decision very -- this with great gravity and responsibility. Now other people are advising, but it's his decision to make and he's respectful to the United States senators-- (CROSSTALK) PIRRO: That ultimate without a doubt. CONWAY: -- on the right and the left, you know, who are advising and consenting as well. PIRRO: Well, I have a feeling that the president will probably, as with Gorsuch, get the person on the Supreme Court that he wants. Anyway, Kellyanne Conway, good to have you on the show, thank you. And coming up, Michelle Malkin, and Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi. And by the way, don't forget to buy a copy of my book on Amazon or Barnes and Noble, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And here I have it, but it's not of the yet. So the question is, is this real or just a cover. What do you think? E-mail me. Go on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Is it a real book or not? More Hannity after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. Some members of America's left are continuing their ongoing assault on the women associated with the Trump administration. The Washington Post Michelle Rubin actually encouraged the left to continue harassing Sarah Sanders. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER RUBIN, CONTRIBUTOR, MSNBC: We're not going to let them go through life unscathed. Sara Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss no muss after lying to the press, after inciting against the press. These people should be made uncomfortable, and I think that's a life sentence frankly. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: That's not all. Over the weekend, Michelle Wolf, best known for botching the White House correspondence dinner with attacks again Sarah Sanders, called Ivanka Trump a selection of names some of which are too graphic to air. But here's an example. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN: Is your nickname herpes because you're not necessarily the most dangerous person in the administration but you're very unpleasant, totally incurable and you always show up when we're about to get (muted). Remember this course is a path to change and Ivanka is the prettiest tumor in the swiftly moving cancer. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: And joining me now with reaction is the host of Michelle Malkin investigates on CR TV, syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. And I should note that it's Jennifer Rubin with Washington Post. All right, now, you know, I thought it was over. I really did. After my show on Saturday night, I said, you know what, they probably just vented. But over the weekend they got worse. We're not going to let this one go unscathed, but needs to be a life sentence. And, of course, Pam, we know what happened to you, and Michelle, both of you have been harassed. Now it's continuing. Pam, what's your take on this? PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, my take on this is Michelle Wolf does not know Ivanka. I do. She's a loving wife, a remarkable mother, she's great human being. And she's not going to break down. They couldn't get to the president so they think they can get to people around him. Ivanka is not going to be broken down by this. But none of us are going to be bullied. But everyone who say these things they need to realize and they know this, Jeanine, just like you, Michelle and I know this, there are people out there who exist who will be emboldened by this to do harm to someone. Something bad is going to happen. And everyone just needs to say stop it, unequivocally, stop. Stop doing this now. PIRRO: You know, Michelle, I had some one on my show, and he said well, you know, it's on both sides. I said to him, I said, do me a favor. Tell me where conservative women have taken on a Democrat female whether she's elected or not elected, or spokesperson, give me one example. It's the same on both sides. I don't know that to be the case, do you? MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, CRTV: It's not the case. And I've documented the war on conservative women for upwards of 20 years now. It is not, and never has been, Judge Jeanine, the case that conservative women, who very vigorously oppose ideas on the other side go and target the children of people with which we disagree. We're not the ones that have forced the other side to have to hire a private security guard to speak on college campuses as I have over the years and so many other female conservatives who are outspoken. What this is about is the fact that the c word, the real offensive c word to the left, is conservative. This is about criminalizing and ostracizing female conservatives for being female and conservative. The left considers it an ideological felony to be a woman and a conservative. And even more than that, they think it's a capital offense to be a minority and female and conservative. So that's what this is really about. PIRRO: And, Pam, you know, what she says is so true, I mean you were at the movie theater, you know, and I've gone to universities, I've had to have security, I mean, most of my life anyway. But you know, going forward, it doesn't sound like they're doing anything to tamp it down. What should Republican conservative women do? BONDI: Well, first of all, you won't be bullied, Michelle won't be bullied, Sarah won't be bullied, Ivanka won't be bullied, I won't be bullied. But the other side has got to stop it. You got to just unequivocally, all of our Democrat friends out there who we all know need to come out and say stop it. Stop it, this isn't right. Someone is going to get hurt. And I told you, there was a state rep with her children-- PIRRO: Right. BONDI: -- children, being screamed at and harassed by the same people that came after me. So this, women attacking women, got to stop. PIRRO: You know, Michelle, she's right. But this isn't about civility any more. If we say stop it, don't on, this is that going to stop them? No. Should charges-- (CROSSTALK) BONDI: They need to say it. MALKIN: Yes, I think that there needs to be -- yes, I think there needs to be legal consequences for people who are inciting violence. And the best thing that we can do is what we're doing. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, turn the table and put the mirror on people who are nothing of the type of self-appointed civility police that they talk about. In fact, these are the worst, most vile offenders against civility. And when you have people who think that it is part of proper public discourse to call for giving a quote, unquote, \"life sentence\" as this loom, Jennifer Rubin, has done against Sarah Sanders simply for doing her job, that has crossed the line. It is beyond the pale. And the Washington Post and the owners of the Post should be ashamed that this woman is employed by them as a co-called conservative columnist. That's the biggest joke. PIRRO: And you know what, Pam Bondi, you are the attorney general, you're very powerful woman in a state with your own security detail in your own guards. And yet they have no fear going in your face within an inch of your face. BONDI: They don't. And that's where people need to realize someone is going to get hurt. And like Michelle said, I mean, the ultimate bullying, this Michelle Wolf woman saying go after their deepest insecurities, really, to say that it's horrible. But see we're not going to get in the gutter with them, that's the difference. And Democrats, there are plenty of Democrats out there who do not agree with what's happening and they just need to unequivocally say stop. Stop this. Do not do this. Someone is going to be harmed. PIRRO: All right. So good to have you both on tonight. Thanks so much. And still to come, President Trump keeps racking up the accomplishments. And members of the mainstream media are even finding it hard to ignore them. That and more, after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The regulation rollback has been the biggest ever in the history of our country. No president, even during full terms, has cut back anywhere near what I've done and we have more to do. Now we are going to have regulation, we're going to have clean water, we're going to have clean air, we are going to have the cleanest water, cleanest air. But we are, we have more regulation cutting to do. But I think I may have had a bigger impact to this point. I think ultimately, the tax cuts as they kick in and they kick in, you see the kind of hundreds of billions of dollars brought back into the country already, I think ultimately that's going to be something really special. And you are seeing the result right now. If you look at what happened to steel and aluminum, we practically built a new industry in at period of four or five months. It's incredible of what's happening. But the thing that I'm focused on now is trade. I have to straighten our trade deals. We're going to make it reciprocal, we're going to make them fair. And I will tell you don't know about this, but every country is calling, every day, saying let's make a deal, let's make a deal. It's going to all work out. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. That was President Trump this weekend, in an interview with Maria Bartoromo, highlighting his exceptional record of accomplishments. Even members of the mainstream media can't downplay his success any more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK TODD, HOST, MSNBC: The announced retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this week helped to make one political reality clear. Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning. And the Democrats right now are reeling. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: Joining me now with reaction, Salem radio talk show host Larry Elder, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, and GOPAC Chairman David Avella. Guys, did you ever think you would hear Chuck Todd say that Trump is winning and Democrats are reeling? I mean, I couldn't believe it. You know what, I'll start with you, Larry Elder, I mean this is, it really is amazing what the president has been able to accomplish, I don't know, how many weeks, someone said 75 weeks, maybe. Go ahead, Larry. LARRY ELDER, TALK SHOW HOST, SALEM RADIO: Well, it is amazing, judge. And his assertion, quote, \"despite his overall unpopularity?\" Close quote. He's more popular than Obama was at this point. I don't think anyone saying that Obama was, quote, \"overall unpopular,\" close quote, during that period of time. But they still can't figure out why they won let alone why he's succeeding. And the answer is, Americans broadly like his policies. The economy is doing well. More Americans believe the economy is doing great. They have to believe that in a very long time. The stock market is doing well. The regulations he's cut have been even more severe than he said. He's cut almost four regulations for everyone regulation that we have added. The American people broadly believe that the borders need to be secured. Broadly believe that we need to do something about chain migration, about catch and release, about the visa lottery. So overall, Donald Trump policies are hash tag winning. PIRRO: OK. So Charlie Hurt, I mean, there's an article here in the Hill that I'm looking at and it says Trump just keeps on confounding his hapless detractors. Your take? CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's probably safe to say that a lot of people like Chuck Todd are probably tired of winning by this point. But I think we did, I think we sort of crossed over a Rubicon over the last couple of weeks, and I think that's the left that Donald Trump really isn't going to get strung up on these bogus Russia charges. Stormy Daniels isn't going to bring down the president. And then as Larry Elder just pointed out, you know, the most alarming thing of all is the fact that the economy is booming, Donald Trump is right, it's the removal of all these regulations that have been, that are setting the economy on fire. The American people do agree with Donald Trump despite all of the haranguing by the media, they have agreed that the border should be closed and to have Democrats now arguing to abolish ICE-- PIRRO: It's just crazy. It is crazy. HURT: -- playing into the president's hands. PIRRO: All right. And David Avella, OK. So we got economy, regulations, we got the stock market and the left is going ballistic. They are relentless in assaulting and I can't imagine that normal thinking people are buying it. DAVID AVELLA, CHAIRMAN, GOPAC: Well, now that abolishing ICE is the litmus test for Democrats who want to run in 2020. Donald Trump is well on his way to being re-elected and finishing what he started, which is eliminating or reversing every policy President Obama put in place. Hence now why Jobs are being created, folks have more money in their pockets, we're working toward securing our border, our military is getting the funding it needs to protect our country. An agenda and a set of accomplishments serve this country well. And ultimately, serve President Trump well for wanting to be re-elected. PIRRO: And you know what, Larry Elder, I mean, it is actually stunning where we are right now. Because when you think about the president has not really had all the Republicans supporting him. I mean, it was and it wasn't his stumble but Paul Ryan, and healthcare, Obamacare, and all of the other, you know, starting -- the president realized he's a businessman what he needed to do to get around those establishment Republicans, you know, who are trying to stop him. ELDER: Can you imagine where he would be if he didn't have the media against him? There's a book called \"Left Turn\" written by my friend Tim Groseclose, he's a professor at George Mason, judge, and he said if the media were truly fair and balanced the average state would vote the way Texas does, which is about 8 to 10 in favor of Republican vote. And the Democrats are countering this with free tuition, guaranteed jobs for everybody, $15 minimum wage, as was opinted out, getting rid of ICE. I don't think that's a winning message for Americans in the off year, let alone in 2020. They don't know what to do. They are literally unhinged. PIRRO: Well, and you know what, Charlie Hurt, we don't have a lot of time, but you know calling for the, what they don't like what say is broken, immigration is broken, ICE is broken. I mean, it is not something that is going to bring them any success, is it? HURT: No, absolutely not. The immigration system has been a disaster for decades now under both parties. Donald Trump is the first person who come along who actually actively wants to do something to fix it. The Democrats just want to campaign against it. And this idea that they are going to campaign on abolishing ICE is I think will be their doom. PIRRO: It's Crazy. Crazy. David Avella, last word? AVELLA: Well, one area the president and Senate Republicans have worked quite well at is getting judges confirmed. Not only the Supreme Court judge and Gorsuch, but also at the district level. And we're going to continue to see that success with whoever President Trump ultimately nominates being on the Supreme Court here before the end of the year. PIRRO: Is anyone tired of winning yet? Thank you, gentlemen. ELDER: Not me. PIRRO: And coming up, wait until you hear what disgraced FBI Director James Comey is saying these days about how people view him. Don't go anywhere. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey took part in a question-and-answer session over the weekend. And in a rare moment of truth, acknowledged that he is not liked by either side. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your Republican colleagues with whom you have these conversations, are they outraged? JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Well, most Republicans don't talk to me anymore. So I have succeeded in making pissing off everyone. (END VIDEO CLIP) PIRRO: That will do it for us tonight. But don't forget to buy a copy of my book on Amazon or Barnes & Noble, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: A Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" Thanks for being with us. I don't know if this is real yet because it's not out. So you have to guess. Is it real or just a cover? I'll be back tomorrow night filling in for Sean. Have a great night.

This is a rush transcript from \"Hannity,\" June 6, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: All right, Tucker. Great show as always. All right. This is just an amazing news night. Stay with us. Welcome to 'Hannity.' Eighteen months and counting and guess what? We're still waiting for that inspector general's report on how the FBI and DOJ completely mishandled the Clinton's server investigation. But tonight, parts of that I.G. report and their findings are being leaked. We'll share it with you and it's not looking good for James Comey, Andrew McCabe or Loretta Lynch. But we will see. Are there going to be criminal referrals? We have new information. Also, we have breaking new information surrounding Mueller's runaway witch- hunt as he is now demanding that all witnesses turn over their phones so his merry band of Hillary-supporting and Trump-hating sycophants can comb through private communications. Are these witnesses going to be allowed to follow the Clinton model? Are they going to be allowed to delete, bleach bit, remove the SIM cards and bust them up with hammers? Interesting thought, I doubt it. Also, the First Lady Melania Trump back in the public spotlight tonight after weeks of rampant and frankly disgusting speculation from your corrupt news media. We're going to show you how the president responded earlier today. And also, the president shining a light on criminal justice reform in the wake of his latest clemency grant, an amazing story. We'll analyze that and much more. And more fallout, Bill Clinton still under fire for his disaster his book tour. Looks like Slick Willy is no longer getting a free pass from his friends in the media and the Democratic Party. And we have yet another -- this one's probably the best one yet, amazing economic statistic, yes, all in a hundred -- and 501 days of Donald Trump. We have all of that, a lot to cover. Busy news night in tonight's very important opening monologue. (MUSIC)  HANNITY: ABC News now reporting at this hour, the DOJ's watchdog, Michael Horowitz, is coming out strong against James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch in his forthcoming report, which examines how Obama's Justice Department and FBI -- well, mishandled the criminal case into Hillary Clinton. In other words, we were right and your media was wrong. And, of course, fired FBI Director James Comey, he cleared Hillary Clinton of all charges, but not before many public missteps, misdeeds surrounding the investigation. According to the report, quote, one source telling ABC that the draft report explicitly uses the words insubordinate to describe Comey's behavior. Now, the I.G. report will also allegedly rebuke Loretta Lynch and fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. None of this is surprising. Remember, the McCabe report came out, then comes the criminal referral. After all, we know about Comey's exoneration before investigation. We know about Loretta Lynch's illicit tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just before she helped clear his wife of all these charges. And we all know about McCabe's Democratic ties and rampant pattern of lying. And we also know Hillary Clinton -- she did commit felonies. She did obstruct justice. That is indisputable at this point. As we reported last night, Andrew McCabe, he's now requesting immunity from the U.S. Senate in exchange for his testimony, possibly against his former boss James Comey. The full, unredacted report should literally have been released by now. And frankly, if it's released any time between now and next Wednesday, remember we have the summit on Tuesday of next week, that means they're trying to bury this on a summer weekend, so it doesn't get the coverage it normally would. If they release it early next week, they are totally trying to bury this during this all-important summit in Singapore. What Americans deserve, what you deserve is justice in the form of criminal referrals for everybody we just mentioned it has been long months and Mr. Obstruction himself of Congress, Rod Rosenstein, he has had this report for two weeks already and I could only imagine what he's trying to get removed or changed or redacted. Our own Catherine Herridge has a new report about FBI love bird, one of the two, Peter Strzok in this case, remember he was the agent demoted after his rampant anti-Trump text became publicly available, our own Catherine Herridge is reporting that he was actually the lead investigator in this Clinton case. He hated Trump. He wanted the insurance policy and then he moved on to the Russia, so-called Russia collusion case and then he was put on Mueller's witch hunt team. In other words, this Trump-hating FBI agent played a lead role in pretty much completely everything, including clearing Hillary Clinton of charges, crimes we know she committed, and then tapped to investigate Donald Trump. One more reason the inspector general's report should have been released by now. And meanwhile, as the Mueller witch hunt churns on, the special counsel -- this is interesting -- they are demanding that witnesses turn in their phones so team Mueller and, of course, his pit bull Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Rhee, who worked for Clinton, get to review all of their electronic communications. He wants the phones turned over even texts that are on what are called encrypted apps like WhatsApp or Signal or one of these things. Maybe Mueller's witnesses, I don't know. If I advise them to follow Hillary Clinton's lead, delete all your emails and then acid-wash the emails and hard drives on the new phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer into little itsy-bitsy pieces, use BleachBit, remove the SIM cards, and then take the pieces and hand it over to Robert Mueller and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law, how do you think that would work out for everybody who Mueller is demanding their phones of tonight? I'm certain the result would not be the same as Hillary's. And meanwhile, the person in charge of his Mueller witch hunt, the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, he has responded to growing calls for his recusal, writing a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham stating he will recuse himself if deemed appropriate, and he recommended -- he's the guy that recommended Comey's firing. He signed off on the final FISA warrant based on Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier that even Christopher Steele said there may be 50/50. So, given that Rosenstein is overseeing an investigation where he's a key witness and he signed off on the FISA I think it's probably deemed inappropriate a long time ago. And earlier today, former New York City mayor, current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had very strong words for the seemingly never-ending fishing expedition to undo the election of you the American people. Watch what the former mayor had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: They are a group of 13 highly partisan Democrats that make up the Mueller team, excluding him, are trying very, very hard to frame him, to get him in trouble when he hasn't done anything wrong. Now, they may not know they're doing it. They may not realize they're doing it, but they can't -- they can't emotionally come to grips of the fact that this whole thing of Russian collusion didn't happen, right, that they're trying to invent theories of obstruction of justice. The president's fired the FBI director. The president has the right to fire the FBI director. The president should have fired the FBI director. He was a terrible FBI director. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Even Comey said he had a right to fire him. We'll get back to this witch hunt in a minute. And also tonight, bad news for the Trump-hating mainstream media. Their rampant, disgusting conspiracy theories about our first lady, Melania Trump, being missing in action came all crashing down today as the first lady appeared alongside her husband at an event in Washington, D.C. So much for the conspiracy theories. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'd like to sort of maybe say and pay some respects to some of the people here today. I have a list. Of course, we have to start with our great First Lady Melania. Thank you, Melania. She's doing good. (APPLAUSE) She went through a little rough patch but she's doing great, and we're very proud of her. She's done a fantastic job as first lady. The people love you. The people of our country love you. So, thank you, honey. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: I'm glad she's healthy. And by the way, her approval ratings are higher than the president's. Also, the president delivered a very special message for the media today, on Twitter, writing: The fake news media has been so unfair, so vicious to my wife, our great First Lady Melania, during her recovery from surgery. They reported everything from near death to facelift to she left me in the White House for New York or Virginia to abuse, all fake and she's doing really well. Let's turn our attention now to Kim Kardashian. OK, you didn't expect me to say that, did you? She visited the Oval Office as you know recently, to shine a light on the criminal justice system and reform in particular and one case involving Alice Marie Johnson who was a great-grandmother. Remember, she was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of nonviolent drug charges. It was only a first offense. Today, President Trump commuted the sentence of Ms. Johnson who has already served 22 years. A few hours ago, Kim Kardashian thanked the president, writing, quote: So grateful to @RealDonaldTrump, Jared Kushner and to everyone who showed compassion and contributed countless hours to this important moment for Ms. Alice Marie Johnson. Her commutation is inspirational and gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance. And, of course, by the way, this is likely just the beginning of what is a long needed conversation in this country about sentencing criminal reform that the president has vowed to tackle, this two-tier justice system that we now know way more than we should about, it stretches wide and it stretches far. These issues must be addressed, equal justice under the law, equal application of the laws. We do wish Ms. Johnson all our best tonight. And meanwhile, someone was actually benefited from our two-tiered justice system, speaking of which, his whole entire life, former president Bill Clinton. Yes, he's back in the spotlight, believe it or not. He's finally facing some backlash from the mainstream media and Democrats over his long history of sexual abuse and misconduct. And Democrats and the media, remember, they protected the Clintons all through the last presidential campaign that is until November 9th, 2016, the day after Hillary lost. Remember this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPORTER: Do you think differently or feel more responsibility? BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it. And -- REPORTER: Did you ever apologize for it? CLINTON: Yes, and nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you typically have ignored gaping facts in discussing this and I bet you don't even know them -- REPORTER: Do you feel you owed her an apology? CLINTON: No, I do. I do not -- I never talked to her, but I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry. I dealt with it 20 years ago plus, and the American people, two-thirds of them, stayed with me, and I've tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work. That's all I have to say to you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Following that interview, Bill Clinton actually trashed NBC News for finally asking a tough question, kind of questions they should have asked her in the campaign in 2016 and they fired back. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS: The former President Bill Clinton expressing some regret over his controversial remarks about Monica Lewinsky here on \"Today\", but still making false allegations about that interview with Craig. CRAIG MELVIN, NBC NEWS: Overnight, the former president said that his interview with us was not his, quote, finest hour. Speaking with Mr. Colbert, Mr. Clinton made another public apology for his behavior during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but also took issue with the questions we asked him earlier this week. GUTHRIE: I think the tape speaks for itself. MELVIN: Yes. GUTHRIE: You of course did not assert that he never apologized. You asked whether he had apologized. MELVIN: Thank you very much. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Of course, NBC News, the rest of the media, is about 30 years too late. Remember, they gave Bill Clinton a complete and total pass until his wife lost the election. Right here on \"Hannity\", we did call out Clinton's alleged sexual assault year after year, way before the Me Too Movement and way before the left seemed to care about his misconduct. You might remember this: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You described a scene where he was biting on your lip and then when it was all over, he was leaving, said, you better put some ice on that. JUANITA BROADDRICK: Yes, and casually put on his sunglasses and walked out the door. KATHLEEN WHILLEY: It was a terrible ordeal for me and I -- no woman should be subjected to it. It was an assault. HANNITY: He assaulted you. WILLEY: Yes. HANNITY: He and -- he touched, grabbed, fondled and kissed us against your will. WILLEY: Yes. HANNITY: And it's an allegation that is not made by one woman, it's made by multiple women. WILLEY: Many of us. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I said, well, I may need to be going or something and the next thing you know, he pulled down his -- he sit down and pulled down his pants, his whole everything, and he was exposed, and I said, I'm not that kind of girl, and I need to be getting back to my -- to my desk. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That Juanita Broaddrick interview, one of the hardest I've ever done in the twenty-three and a half years here at Fox, only one more example proving that we will never be the mainstream media, we do care about people, the American people and we cover the stories they just refuse to because they're so politically-oriented, agenda-driven. These are issues that should transcend politics. Finally, tonight, we finish with yet another amazing piece of economic news, perhaps the best ever. For the first time since the stat started recording, the United States has more jobs today than jobless claims. Get that -- more jobs available than we have people on the unemployment lines. And on top of that, we have 14 states today with record low unemployment numbers and record low unemployment for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans. Remember, if this was the Obama administration, I guarantee you, Chris Matthews would be having a lot of thrills running up and down his leg. It'd be non-stop 24/7. But this president did promise you jobs, jobs and more jobs, and in 501 days, guess what? He's delivering.  Joining us now with reaction to our monologue and all the breaking news tonight, he's the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and that is Joe diGenova. Let me start with the I.G. report, 18 months later. I have a problem, he doesn't -- but we did have a good result in the case of McCabe where there was a criminal referral, but now, Rod Rosenstein and the DOJ, they have had this report for now two weeks. Why am I suspicions the same guy that has obstructed Congress and won't hand over the documents that they've subpoenaed to do their congressional constitutional oversight? Why do I not trust them that they want changes, revisions, redactions to protect themselves? JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Well, the reason is very simple, Sean. Rod Rosenstein is a careerist. He believes in the institution of the Department of Justice and the FBI to the exclusion of any accusations of fault. And what's happening right now is that the I.G. report is being scrubbed by Rosenstein and his minions and people at the FBI, and they are removing as much embarrassing information about the bureau as possible. And unfortunately, it's going to delay the release of the report and perhaps put it out during the Singapore summit. This conduct by Rosenstein and the people responsible for the delay is reprehensible, but it is of a pattern because what they want to do is they want to hurt the president -- believe it or not, the deputy attorney general wants to hurt the president and he wants to prevent the release of truthful information to deny transparency to the American people to protect career people inside the Department of Justice and the FBI. What happened during the campaign and what happened during the Hillary Clinton email server investigation is a national disgrace and Rosenstein should be at the forefront of releasing that information. And instead, he is trying to hide substantial portion of it. HANNITY: Let me -- so it's not going to be Michael Horowitz, the inspector general that decides the release date here. So, in other words, if it's released any time between now and all through next week with this historic summit taking place in Singapore with Kim Jong Un and President Trump, would you agree with me that they're either burying it on a summer Friday weekend, or they're burying it during one of the most historic summits in history? DIGENOVA: Well, there's no question that that is their intent. Otherwise, this would have been released a long time ago. The reason it's being delayed is also to allow the leaks which you saw today, the partial leak of the description of Comey's insubordination. Wow, that's a big surprise, he was insubordinate. He was more than that. He not only was insubordinate, he subverted the Department of Justice and its core function, even though Loretta Lynch was compromised, there sat Sally Yates with all of her flaws who could have easily described what happened and could have just decided this case on behalf of the attorney general. But what's happening now is there delaying purposely to prevent timely disclosure. HANNITY: So, you're convinced that they're definitely going to try and bury this and the person that would make that decision -- DIGENOVA: Absolutely. HANNITY: -- is who? It's not the inspector general, right? He doesn't -- DIGENOVA: No, it's Rod Rosenstein. The deputy attorney general controls the release of the report. The report -- even though it's going to Congress, is controlled by the attorney general and the inspector general. But -- and they have the right to make changes for national security or other reasons, but we know from the record already -- HANNITY: You have two weeks' worth of changes, two weeks' worth of redactions -- DIGENOVA: No, this was outrageous, yes. HANNITY: -- two weeks' worth of pressuring Michael Horowitz to alter his report. DIGENOVA: Right. And remember, the FBI director assigned additional people so that they could respond more quickly. HANNITY: Let me -- let me go to what has come out as it relates to what's supposedly in the insubordination issue which you raised, now, it's we know the facts in this case. It's irrefutable -- it's indisputable at this point, it's incontrovertible at this point. Hillary in fact violated the Espionage Act. She put top-secret classified special access programming information on a private server. That's illegal, and she lied about it. DIGENOVA: Yes. HANNITY: And as I said, now that Robert Mueller wants everybody's phones in case they used one of these applications I guess, you know, WhatsApp, or whatever you call this stuff, so he wants all this information and interestingly, he wants it and I wonder if everybody that has phones if they did when Hillary did and that's delete the emails, delete the app, acid-washed the phone, break it up to the little bits and take the SIM cards out, how would that work out for all the people Robert Mueller's requesting phones from? DIGENOVA: If they have done any of those steps that you just identified, they would have obstructed justice and we would be subject to prosecution. Of course, that wasn't the way Hillary Clinton was treated because James Comey conducted a fraudulent investigation. No subpoenas. No search warrants. No grand jury. Massive use illegally of immunity, with the permission of the attorney general and Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general. So, what you have is a double standard, and it's just flagrantly visible by the way Mueller is conducting his investigation. The ultimate pressure as opposed to the ultimate no pressure in the Hillary Clinton investigation. HANNITY: Yes. I just -- and what about the larger role? We know -- we've only got a sampling of Strzok's text messages with Lisa Page. DIGENOVA: Oh, yes. HANNITY: The absolute hatred they had for Donald Trump. DIGENOVA: All the animus. HANNITY: Last week, we broke a story on this program that said, no, this is being run out of the Obama White House. And then, of course, they're the ones that want the insurance policy. He's the guy that interviewed Hillary two days before they exonerated her, but they were writing the exoneration in May, this was July. He's the guy that interviewed Flynn and said he didn't lie to the FBI. He's the guy that then flew to London and was involved in the investigation at Trump immediately and Robert Mueller appointed this guy. When are the charges against him coming? DIGENOVA: Well, I don't think there's any doubt that the inspector general's report is going to deal with all of that. It's impossible not to, and if it didn't, then, of course, the Horowitz's performance would be abysmal. But I expected to deal with it. Strzok is a very, very serious person in all of this. He would probably be someone because of the knowledge that he has of Comey's and other activities who may very well be immunized. But my guess is, is that there will be criminal referrals from the investigation involving the way the FBI covered up the Clinton investigation and basically as a bunch of dirty cops led by the senior dirty cop, James Comey, threw the case. It's really the most embarrassing situation in history of the FBI. HANNITY: You know, though, I have faith because there were 30 FBI agents and I predict they're going to be the heroes in this story that want to be subpoenaed by Congress, they want to tell the story of how corrupt their bosses were. They'll be the heroes, the rank-and-file. We can trust them. DIGENOVA: They will indeed. HANNITY: Joe diGenova, appreciate it. More breaking news when we come back. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett. Also, don't miss Jesse Watters, Jessica Tarlov, who's going to win tonight, and much more, straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIULIANI: They are a group of 13 highly partisan Democrats that make up the Mueller team, excluding him, are trying very, very hard to frame him, to get him in trouble when he hasn't done anything wrong. Now, they may not know they're doing it. They may not realize they're doing it, but they can't -- they can't emotionally come to grips of the fact that this whole thing of Russian collusion didn't happen right that they're trying to invent theories of obstruction of justice. The president fired the FBI director. The president has the right to fire the FBI director. The president should have fired the FBI director, he was a terrible FBI director. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That was the president's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, saying that Robert Mueller and his team are trying very hard to frame the president. Joining us now, Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter. Do you see that book right there? Get your copy now, it comes out next month, you don't want to miss it. By the way, to the attorney -- to the inspector general, what you don't tell, our Gregg Jarrett will. The Illicit scheme -- Russia hoax to clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. I said that yesterday. I want to ask a question here. Is the mayor right? Because a perjury trap is framing and that's the title of your book. GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Sure. I think the mayor borrowed the subtitle of my book. HANNITY: You think he basically stole from you? JARRETT: Well, no, I think he believes it. He -- well, it's a form of flattery, isn't it? HANNITY: Oh, ouch! You know, everyone in the world causing me problems every day. Why can't you just say I assume he thought of it on his own? JARRETT: The evidence is increasingly clear that there was a scheme, an illicit scheme, not just a clear Hillary Clinton. That's pretty obvious, as you stated in the monologue, copious crimes, 110 charges should have been filed -- HANNITY: There's no dispute here. She committed felonies, she obstructed justice. JARRETT: Right, and I mean -- how do you explain that people like David Petraeus, Sandy Berger, John Deutsch, Harold T. Martin, Kristian Saucier, Bryan Nishimura, all these people did much less the identical thing that Hillary Clinton did, they get criminally prosecuted and she doesn't. HANNITY: And, Sara, that -- that's the point here. You know, Rod Rosenstein has now held this I.G. report for two weeks, wanting revisions redactions, comments made. I'm sure trying to alter this document the question here is, Gregg Jarrett makes the case in that book we just put up. These documents not what we have exists and he had a lot more information. And that raises the question: will he give in to the pressure? Will he bury it on a summer Friday? Will he bury it during the summit next week? SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The scales of justice, Sean, appear to be not balanced, and that's exactly what Gregg Jarrett saying. I mean, Kristian Saucier spent a year in prison for something so minor and then eventually, thankfully, you know pardoned by President Trump. And now, we see what's going on with Michael Horowitz and how he's being kind of pushed into a corner. I mean, he has to give the people in the report the time to do their due diligence and review the report, but they have to turn back those addendums to the report and they have to be able to -- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Does he have the final say? And who gets to say as to what is released? CARTER: Absolutely. No, absolutely. He has the final say. He has the final say when it's released, and he can come back to them and say, guess what, this isn't a national security risk. I'm not going to redact this. This doesn't -- this doesn't expose sources or methods, we're going to let this report go to public. HANNITY: But, Sara, at the end of the day. He's the inspector general of the Department of Justice. CARTER: That's right. And he knows all -- HANNITY: It's all in the same family. CARTER: That's right, Sean. And he knows all eyes are on him right now. All eyes are on Michael Horowitz and this report and he's going to do the right thing. If he -- if he believes in what he does and I believe he does and we saw that in the last report, he is going to do what is right here. And remember, that April 24 letter -- HANNITY: But, Sara, anything short of Hillary committed felonies, Hillary -- CARTER: That's right. HANNITY: -- obstructed justice, that Comey, Strzok and others rigged the investigation. They exonerated before investigation. Anything short of that is a failure on his part. And it's a cover-up on his part in my opinion. CARTER: And it would be a failure on the American people, it would be a failure to our justice system. And I certainly don't think that's what he wants to do. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: His name is on it. CARTER: I certainly don't think that's his legacy. That's right. His name is on that report. And remember, there are 400 people working with the inspector general. Not all of them on this case in particular, but there's a lot of investigators on his. They interviewed a number of FBI agents. They've also interviewed people that are in that report. And I think we're going to hear Comey, Loretta Lynch in that report. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Well, we're going to hear from the FBI agents, I tell you just from the segment, the heroes in this and you are talking to some of them as well as I. CARTER: That's right. HANNITY: Are going to be people in the FBI in the intelligence community that bravely want to come forward and tell the truth before Congress but they have to be subpoenaed first. And from my knowledge and understanding and my sources, they are already lined up. (CROSSTALK) CARTER: They are lined up. HANNITY: When this report comes out, Horowitz will interviewed, they will be subpoenaed and then the story will be told. And we will be proven right and the corrupt media will be proven wrong. I'm talking too much. Sorry. JARRETT: Well, I think your point is well taken. All we know is just one aspect of the I.G.'s report that Comey was insubordinate. That's a generous attribution to Comey's conduct. I would point people's attention to the April 18th criminal referral by members of Congress to Sessions in the Department of Justice. They identify a dozen potential crimes by Comey for concealing evidence before a FISA judge. Stealing government documents and leaking classified documents. Four instances of potentially lying to Congress. The list goes on and on. HANNITY: Mueller want everyone's cell phones. My advice to them, not really, kidding bad advice would be, follow, Hillary, you know, lead. CARTER: Absolutely. JARRETT: Yes. HANNITY: To lead them acid watch them, bust them out and take out the SIM cards and here little pieces, here Mr. Mueller, here, I'm following Hillary's lead. JARRETT: Hillary Clinton in her assist he has did that they were obstructing justice. (CROSSTALK) CARTER: That's right. JARRETT: What's despicable is that the FBI gave immunity to at least five different Clinton people in exchange for what, you don't get immunity for-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Unless somebody keep their devices. JARRETT: They got to keep their devices. Those devices that the FBI obtained. Some of them they never looked at. The others had nothing on them. HANNITY: Yes. It's amazing. (CROSSTALK) CARTER: And Sean, this is a tactic. This is the tactic of Mueller. He is shaking the trees he's making people nervous. HANNITY: Here's my cell phone, boom, crack it up and have a little pieces say here, Mr. Mueller, courtesy of Hillary. All right. That's why I pause myself on every day. I can't wait for the book. When we come back, Jesse Watters and Jessica Tarlov, this is going to be interesting. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have about like three years of (Inaudible) about me and Donald Trump, so I'm not going to keep going down that road. Despite what (Inaudible) to me I'm not going to the White House. It had nothing to do with the national anthem. I said I wouldn't go to the White House a long time ago. The players didn't create this situation. (OFF-MIC) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, things like that, (Inaudible) you know, taking a knee for the flag was never, you know, could be disrespectful for that. (Inaudible). People will do it, just kind of in a situation where people think, you know, you're disrespecting the flag or stuff like that is never the case. You notice about, you know, killing of unarmed minorities, that's what this was always been about. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: A couple of Eagles players from earlier today reacting to President Trump's decision to cancel the event for them at the White House yesterday. The president by the way was right to cancel the Eagles event after last minute, while only a few members even though most of them had accepted originally we're going to show up. Despite dozens of them by the way RSVP, yes, we'll be there and a thousand fans going to Washington only to be screwed by the Eagles. I never liked the Eagles. I still don't. And I'm sick of the NFL and I'm sick of all of this nonsense. Now we are going to hide in the locker room so we'll take our knee there. We can't respect the flag that people fought, bled and died under. And meanwhile, tonight, the destroy Trump media owes the president and the first lady a serious apology for the absolutely vile and vicious coverage of the first lady and her public absence in recent weeks. She did just have surgery. Well, the first lady joined the president a FEMA briefing earlier today as we showed you earlier. Joining us with reaction, we'll see who rules world it is, she's already a deficit because she's not here, Jessica Tarlov. And he is the co-hosts of not one but two shows 'Watters World' and of course, 'The Five.' Go ahead. JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: You know, Jessica-- (CROSSTALK) JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes? HANNITY: No, no, I have a bone to pick with you tonight. WATTERS: What's that? HANNITY: You are an Eagles fan? WATTERS: Yes. HANNITY: OK. They were invited, they RSVP's yes, the last 24 hours no, we're not coming. They decided last-minute not to come as a group. It was like, one player, maybe three were going to show up. WATTERS: Right. HANNITY: Ten people total. WATTERS: Right. HANNITY: A thousand fellow Eagles fans like you. WATTERS: I was there. HANNITY: OK. You were there. WATTERS: I showed up. HANNITY: You showed up and guess what? (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they weren't there. HANNITY: And they weren't there. That speaks volumes to me about your Eagles. About how classless that was because they were not thinking of you and your fellow fans of the Eagles. WATTERS: Listen, the Eagles blew it. They fumbled it to use the football analogy, Jessica. HANNITY: They fumbled it or they-- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: And they should have gone because, listen, patriotism is more important than politics. If I was to play pro ball, I could have played pro ball. I decided do Fox instead. If I had won a championship which I probably would have and had gone to the White House under the Obama administration-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Jessica, you're leading, you're leading by a mile. WATTERS: I would have still gone to the Obama White House even if they didn't like the president. (CROSSTALK) TARLOV: I haven't even gotten to say anything yet. Of course, he's leading. HANNITY: You're leading. I'm saying you, Jessica. WATTERS: How can she be leading, she's in Europe, Sean? TARLOV: I'm leading. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: OK. But the point is very simple, Jessica, and that is they didn't care about the fans. They had accepted the invitation. A thousand fans even Jesse Watters going to D.C. to watch this unfold. (CROSSTALK) TARLOV: I did see that. HANNITY: And they wasted their time, energy and money and the Eagles didn't care. I blame the Eagles! That's why I am not watching the NFL. TARLOV: It's same for me. Judging by the parade that they had back in Philadelphia, it seems the Eagles care plenty about their fan and they have a great relationship with them. Some of the biggest diehard fans like young Jesse here who even still went to D.C. to be there to honor them in absentia. But I think the real issue here is that whether they are stupid or not, these people these athletes do not feel like this president is a good icon for the country. That he doesn't unite people, he divides them, he doesn't acknowledge the fact that the national anthem protest had to do with criminal justice reform. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Well, wait. You know who's not the good icon? TARLOV: And rather he would make a lot-- WATTERS: Kaepernick that started the division. TARLOV: And say that there weren't coming because of the protest. WATTERS: Jessica-- HANNITY: I'm with Jessica. Stop blaming Kaepernick for what the Eagles did. TARLOV: And not a single one of them kneeled the entire season. HANNITY: Your Eagles did this to their fans yesterday. WATTERS: I think you are a Giants fan and you are being unfair. HANNITY: No, I was a jet fan but after they said they said they are going to pay-- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: You're a jets fan. HANNITY: Not anymore. WATTERS: And you are dumping on the Eagles? HANNITY: Not anymore. Not anymore. WATTERS: Come on, Sean. HANNITY: But I like the Giants more. Well, listen, I was the biggest Philadelphia flyers fan. I wanted to be Bobby Clark. WATTERS: Yes. HANNITY: Bobby Clark, Rick MacLeish, David Schultz, Hounddog Kelly, Bernie Price (Ph). They would have been there. WATTERS: Yes, they would have been there. HANNITY: Yes. WATTERS: And you like a guy with no teeth, that's your idol? HANNITY: I fell off a roof and busted up all my teeth too, so it's not a big deal. Let me go to -- the horrible treatment of Melania Trump. Again, you heard the vicious comments by all of these people. David Frum, Stephen Colbert, the list goes on and on, Jessica. I don't believe this ever would have happened or can I think of it happening to Michelle Obama. TARLOV: Maybe not to Michelle Obama but definitely to Hillary Clinton and there was plenty of chat about her house issue-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: No, let's talk about Michelle Obama. The last-- TARLOV: -- that have dogged her, her entire career. Now there was a CNBC reporter who actually tweeted that he has been heard that people-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: For the first time in my adult life I'm proud of my country. TARLOV: Just decided to ignore. I'm not sure about some big formal apology. HANNITY: That was Michelle. TARLOV: But this certainly didn't turn out to be the story. HANNITY: Can you think of an instance where it happened to Michelle Obama? TARLOV: I'm not -- no. I don't think it would have happened to Michelle Obama but I also think that Michelle Obama would have given people-- HANNITY: Thank you. Now it's my world tonight. TARLOV: -- heads up if she was going in for surgery. WATTERS: Yes. TARLOV: And she would have keep --she would have kept people updated. Melania is a very private person. I totally respect that about her. But the press asks questions. And-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: What they did and said was vicious, vile and horrible. TARLOV: -- you didn't stress my point about the speculation about Hillary (Inaudible) nonstop. HANNITY: She just had an operation. And she had been seen publicly. You have a chance to save your-- (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: I would say the only thing missing is the media's credibility. Think about how good things have to be going in the country for the media to fuss over where Melania is. You know what's really missing? ISIS is missing. Maybe they should report on that. You know who else hasn't seen in a while? (CROSSTALK) TARLOV: I think they give him final credit. WATTERS: Peter Strzok. Where is Peter Strzok? He's involved in an actual conspiracy. HANNITY: All right. WATTERS: They haven't had a good week, the media. HANNITY: You need a good come back, Jessica? TARLOV: I need a good come back. I stayed up until 2.30 in the morning to be here with you guys. I think that's-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: That's a good come back. That's it. WATTERS: All right. All right. What do you think? HANNITY: For the first time ever it's Jessica's world. You're living in it. WATTERS: You know what, Trump was right. I'm tired of winning. HANNITY: When we come back, you're not going to want to miss this. Sebastian Gorka, Geraldo Rivera they are going to duke it out over what is going to be a major issue in the midterms and we're going to show you the ad that is spurring this debate. That's straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: So last night was the biggest primary night of 2018 and we're only months away from the crucial midterm elections. Now as president, well, Donald Trump has said there is a lot at stake in these midterms. I'm saying it's the most important in our lifetime. Think about this. If Democrats take control of the House and Senate they are going to be out for blood. They want to impeach this president, they want to keep Obamacare, they want open borders, and they want more of your money, they want to take back the tax cuts. I hope you won't forget where the Democrats stand on these important issues facing the country. The RNC certainly is not. They have a new ad that is hitting the Dems on their message regarding open borders and the violent gang, rather, MS-13. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MINORITY LEADER: They are all God's children. There is a spark of divinity in every person. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're talking about MS-13. Their motto is rape, torture, and kill. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The victim was stabbed more than 100 times, decapitated, dismembered and his heart was cut out of his chest and then thrown into a pre-dug grave. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The two young men shown here kidnapped, sexually assaulted and shot a 15-year-old girl. PELOSI: Calling people animals is not a good thing. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Not so bad. And just breaking tonight. Department of Homeland Security announcing that border arrests exceeded 50,000 now for the third month in a row. Here with us former deputy assistant to the president Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, the author of the best seller the Geraldo Show, Fox News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, think of the issues. This is the Democratic Party. They want to raise taxes. They've said so. They are saying to each other, don't, don't tell anybody, but we want to impeach the president. We want to do it but just don't say it. Please, please, Maxine Waters, stop. Then of course they want open borders. You heard what Nancy Pelosi said about MS-13 and they want to keep Obamacare. Now, don't you think those are goin to be big issues in November? GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: I think the immigration issue is the hot button issue come November, Sean. I think that that will be the one that resonates and separates the parties. I have a cautionary note. Because I am a Republican and I don't want a Democratic majority because I think they will endeavor to impeach this president, our friend who is doing I think a terrific job. But here's my cautionary note. When you use words like animal you have to be careful but you are specially referring to the people who are animals who are savages. These gang members and not paint the immigrant community with a broad brush. We have the absolute right to protect our borders. We have the absolute right to hard police work through walls, you know, through in any kind of effort that is legal. But we do not have the moral right to separate migrating children from their parents. I don't want us to lose this issue by doing something that is so patently immoral. HANNITY: OK, but let's have the wall. Let's have a wall with a door. You're OK with that? RIVERA: I'm OK with that. As I said-- HANNITY: Right. RIVERA: -- I would like to see the wall on the one side and the DREAMers given a pass, a green light on the other. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: The president offered that and the Democrats did not wanted -- the Democrats didn't take that deal. RIVERA: You are right. You are right. HANNITY: The Democrats have that deal. RIVERA: you are right. HANNITY: Dr. Gorka, as I said am I right on the four big issues of 2018? SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: I think it's absolutely clear. I think Nothing has really changed except the president delivered on those key issues. He started to build the wall. The figures from DHS for Customs and Border Patrol are stunning and it really will be. The economy and the national security, yet again. The bottom line is, Sean, the Dems don't have a message. They are whispering in the background about impeachment but who is their real leader? Where is the-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: They have a message though, open border, higher taxes, and impeach the president and keep ObamaCare. GORKA: Right. Right. More jobs for MS-13. That's their message. I mean, it's a message that's insanity. It literally is Trump derangement syndrome. When Nancy Pelosi gives out a written statement last Friday, saying the national jobs figures mean little. What do you mean, Nancy? (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Crumbs. Crumbs $2,000. GORKA: This is the first time ever. The first time ever that we have full employment. When you've got more jobs available than people looking for jobs. Nancy, what do you want? Do you want more unemployment? Is that what you're arguing for? HANNITY: She wants to take the crumbs back. The $2,000 in crumbs the average families got. GORKA: Right. HANNITY: No, thank you. GORKA: Right. HANNITY: Geraldo, you know-- (CROSSTALK) GORKA: When you've got-- HANNITY: -- for the first time in our history, Geraldo, we have more people -- more jobs than people who unemployed. Historic low unemployment 14 states for Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans and women. RIVERA: Dr. Gorka hits a good point here, Sean. The problem with this divided society is that we're not really on the same team. We cheer against our president's successes. HANNITY: No, the Democrats do. No. Democrats are cheering for America to fail right now. They can't stand his success because it hurts their opportunity to gain power. That's a fact. RIVERA: Well, I tell you when it comes to, for example, the North Korean negotiations, I want everybody to be on the same team. Cheering for success for the president. (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: That's not good for Democrats. (CROSSTALK) GORKA: That's not -- they are -- look, the Democrats don't want America to succeed. That's the bottom line and that's why they want to sabotage the president. And it's absolutely mind boggling. HANNITY: Horrible position to be in. Thank you both. When we come back, our video of the day. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Today marks the 74th anniversary of D-Day. Our brave men and women slamming on the beach boys of Normandy. Largest invasion by land, air and sea in history. Code name Operation Overlord. The allied landing on the Normandy beaches marked the start of a long campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi oppression. Earlier today, the signing of the V.A. Mission Act where the president spoke about the incredible bravery, the unbelievable sacrifice of those soldiers that risked it all to save the world from fascism and Nazism on this day 74 years ago. My father four years in the Pacific. Different area. Same battles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Today, we also mark another milestone, the 74th anniversary of D-Day, the allied invasion of Normandy. On June 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young Americans charged out of landing craft jumped out of airplanes and stormed into hell! They gave their heart, their blood, and their very lives on those beaches to drive out the enemy and strike a lasting victory for our country and for freedom. In every generation there have been heroes like them. Patriots who answer the call to serve, who do whatever it takes, wherever and whenever we need them to defend America. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: God bless all of them. Amazing courage and heroism. We'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura is next. She's out on parole from what I've been reading. Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

            "article_content": "Republicans are split over immigration legislation; Rep. Jeff Denham and Rep. Sean Duffy share insight from both sides of the debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.' This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" May 17, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. INGRAHAM: Move on.org is looking for a copywriter. All right. Hannity, great show as always tonight. All right. Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" The New York Times buries a bombshell deep inside a story that some say confirms the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, Roger Stone will explain why Mueller is now focusing on him after spending a year trying to find dirt on the president. Plus, as we were telling you about earlier this week, a GOP split over DACA threatens to derail Trump's attempts to secure the border, build the wall and build momentum for these midterm elections. Also, the Senate confirms Gina Haspel as CIA director despite the Democrats resistance. Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell, he's been able to secure confirmations for 21 federal appellate court judges nominated by Trump. That's a remarkable 1/8th of the current federal appellate bench. And Raymond Arroyo will be here to explain in \"Seen and Unseen,\" why rebooted tv shows are everywhere. Why the resurrected Murphy Brown is suddenly taking on Fox News. But first, the anatomy of a smear. That's the subject of tonight's \"Angle.\" Today's left leaning media complex, they fancy themselves as the only truly reliable check on the president. Sure, congressional Democrats can give speeches and file minority reports on Capitol Hill and Bob Mueller may be getting a little warmer. But the press believes it has a superior moral responsibility not necessarily to report the truth but to report a version of the truth in a way that is skewed against Trump and his allies. Hence, they take a comment by him about MS-13 members. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have people coming into the country or trying to come in, we are stopping a lot of them. We are taking people out of the country. You would not believe how bad these people are. These are not people. These are animals. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And they turn that comment into this, \"Trump rant on unauthorized migrants. These aren't people, these are animals,\" said the New York Times. Here's how The New York Daily News played it, \"Trump hurls pure hate at immigrants.\" And the Huffington Post squawked, \"Trump refers to immigrants as animals\" again. Now this is an obscene and ridiculous and frankly nefarious plan that then gets picked up by liberal politicians like Chuck Schumer who wrote the following, \"When all of our great, great grandparents came to America, they were not animals and these people were not either.\" On tv, they quickly bounce condemnations around the echo chamber. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did the president mean when he said some immigrants are not people, they are animals? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president of the United States saying these are not people, they are animals. It is a disgusting way to talk about human beings. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a slippery slope when you start dehumanizing people. That's what the Nazis did, and slave owners did. It's not what Americans do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The tone shifted about what it means if you are an illegal immigrant. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: She went to Nazis. Oh my God, do any of these people bother to try to look like they are in any way impartial, calling balls and strikes? You know, learn the facts or understand what the context of the president said or get out of the business. Journalists have an obligation to read beyond the headlines and report the truth. Even analysts, bother to read the full comments and be fair. Speaking of being fair, Jake Tapper and CNN they did note that the president was taken out of context earlier today. And the AP acknowledged it made an honest mistake writing, \"AP has deleted a tweet from late Wednesday on Trump's animals comment about immigrants because it was not made clear he was speaking after a comment about gang members. Even after those clarifications MSNBC could not help itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump lashing out during an immigration round table at the White House and stirring controversy over his harsh rhetoric towards immigrants branding them animals. The White House said he was referring to the criminal immigrant gang MS-13 and not to all immigrants. He didn't make that clear. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He was responding to a point about MS-13, Andrea. She knows better. This, my friends, is the anatomy of a smear. Take a comment out of context. Isolate it. Blast out the worst possible characterization of its purpose and meaning and writers and reporters and politicians spit it back on panels where the number of furrowed brows out numbers the number of brain cells. As for MS-13, about whom Trump was speaking, this is some of what they have been up to lately. In a horrific crime in Washington, D.C., MS-13 members stabbed a man more than 100 times and decapitated him and tore the heart right out of his chest or this case in Louden County, Virginia, where an MS-13 gang member beat a Muslim girl to death with a baseball bat. That was according to the \"Daily News.\" The suspect charged with murdering a 17-year-old Muslim girl during Ramadan was accused of sexually assaulting another woman a week before the teen slaying in Virginia and is reportedly an MS-13 gang member. Then there is this heartbreaking account from the parents of teenage girls killed by MS-13 in Suffolk County, New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There is not a day, a second, that I don't think about my daughter and they just don't understand the pain of a parent losing a child to this gang violence. I hope they never will. Our kids should be burying us, not the parents burying their kids. Their lives are ahead of them. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That was one of the toughest interviews I have done in the history of this show. The pain on a mother's face. As if things could not get worse, the suspects in that case were seen laughing in court during a pre-trial hearing. Unbelievable. No wonder Sarah Sanders responded this way to the animal fracus at today's briefing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Frankly, I think the term animal doesn't go far enough. I think the president should continue to use his platform and everything he can do under the law to stop these times of horrible, horrible, disgusting people. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Good for her. I would say we are insulting animals because they don't behave this way or kill for fun. Thank you very much. The last word on this goes to the president, who cleared up any confusion for all of those commentators on MSNBC about his comments today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT TRUMP: But I am referring, and you know I am referring to the MS-13 gangs that are coming in. When the MS-13 comes in, the other gang members come into our country, I refer to them as animals, and guess what, I always will. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: This is why Trump got elected by speaking bluntly and honestly. Not a lot of concern for political correctness. Frankly, a lot of people are done with that anyway. But he is talking about the challenges facing America, law and order, safety on the streets, law and order at the border. He changed the political landscape and frustrated liberal narratives by speaking to the people as they speak among themselves. If he keeps up that focus, he will get elected again. Perhaps that's why the left is acting like a pack of wild animals over a side comment by Donald Trump. That's the \"Angle.\" Now shifting gears, we are now a year into the special counsel's probe and Bob Mueller apparently has another target. Reuters is reporting he subpoenaed Roger Stone's former social media specialist, Jason Sullivan, to appear before a grand jury tomorrow. Mueller is reportedly interested in whether the Trump campaign was in any way involved in the Wikileaks release of those DNC emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. Stone is a longtime confidante of President Trump and the author of a new book, \"Stone's Rules, How To Win In Politics, Business, and Style.\" Now he joins us exclusively. It's great to see you. How are you doing, Roger? ROGER STONE, AUTHOR OF 'STONE'S RULES': Great to be here. Thank you. INGRAHAM: Congrats on the book. We have some rules we pulled out. What is your reaction to now? We are now into year two of this investigation officially today. They are bringing in the guy who worked for you on Twitter and social media trending. What is going on? STONE: At this point I don't know if I am a person of interest or just an interesting person. It's very clear that not only has Mr. Mueller subpoenaed a part-time consultant who worked for me for three months. He's dropped subpoenas on a number of other young people who worked for me. In all honesty, I think this is driven by a fake news narrative that insists that I must have known in advance about the hacking of the DNC, which I dispute ever really happened by the Russians. I don't think that happened at all never mind by the Russians.I must have had advanced notice of the content, source and the exact disclosure time of the Wikileaks DNC disclosures. That's is of course false. It's not pleasant to have a special prosecutor in your emails and your text messages and phone calls and he was very clearly in mine. It's an enormous invasion, violation of my Fourth Amendment rights. There is no probable cause here. Julian Assange said Roger Stone never said anything on Twitter that he didn't glean by simply following what I was saying in interviews and in on my own Twitter feed. INGRAHAM: Now they are hanging this all on that tweet that you wrote August 21st of 2016 where you said trust me, it will be soon be Podesta's time in the barrel and #crookedhillary. STONE: That's a misquote. What I said was it will soon be the Podesta's time in the barrel referring to two people. Now, people call Donald Trump, the Donald, but no one ever called John Podesta, the Podesta. I'm referring to John and Tony because in April of 2016, their shady Russian business deals were exposed in the Panama papers.As a student of opposition research, I was well aware of that. I never predicted the hacking or theft of John Podesta's emails. I said the Podestas, but that is conveniently omitted from virtually every media report and it's even omitted from the final House Intelligence Committee final report.My lawyers had to write a letter asking for a correction. The Podestas clearly refers to two people, John and Tony. INGRAHAM: Now your old friend, Adam Schiff, said you deny everything and so you need subpoenas for your tweets and your direct Twitter messages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: What we ought to do is subpoena Twitter for direct messages that went to these particular handles or came from Roger Stone so that we don't have to accept and rely upon the word of Roger Stone, which I think that's a hazardous thing to do. One thing that Roger Stone and the president have in common is a philosophy that you deny everything. That only suckers and losers admit to anything. If you deny, it did not happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) STONE: Well, Laura, first of all, I testified fully and truthfully to the House Intelligence Committee and I turned over to them the Wikileaks and Gucifer, a direct message exchanges, which are innocuous -- INGRAHAM: How did you get in touch with the Gucifer 2.0? STONE: Simply by going to direct messages. But here's the point, based on the content, context and the timing of that exchange, it's six weeks after Wikileaks has already published the DNC disclosures. Consequently, chronologically collusion, and the hacking of that material is impossible. They are entirely expos facto. They are benign. I turned them over to the committee. INGRAHAM: So, intel has it, the House Intel Committee has it. STONE: The Senate Intelligence Committee will have it. INGRAHAM: And you wanted to testify in public? STONE: Yes. INGRAHAM: They brought you behind closed doors. Why is that? STONE: Now the House Democrats complained that my testimony is not public when they are the ones who wanted it to be private. I agreed to cooperate with the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committee. I would like my testimony to be in public. I will turn over these same documents and they are complete. INGRAHAM: George Stephanopoulos had Michael Caputo on your old colleague, this is how it went down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST, \"ABC THIS WEEK\": Michael Caputo who's worked on the campaign met with Mueller's team this week. He said they asked a lot of questions about collusion and he was concerned about Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Rick Gates and others. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Very concerned about Manafort, Stone, Gates and others. STONE: Well, it's very interesting. CNBC and MSNBC and that partisan hack tries to pose as a journalist keep insisting that Mueller is focusing on my long relationship with Rick Gates. I didn't meet Rick Gates until 2016. I have never been alone with him. They are focused on dinners. There was one dinner. Michael Caputo was there. John Hagerty (ph) from the Trump campaign is there. Steve Mowsberg (ph) from Newsmax is there. Manafort is supposed to join us. At the last- minute, Gates shows up instead, showing up late and leaving early.There is no discussion of Wikileaks or Julian Assange. This is the only dinner I've ever been at with Mr. Gates and no, we didn't work together 30 years ago. He was not there. That's a falsehood. INGRAHAM: What about this Sam Nunberg comment that he made. He showed up on some shows. This is what you said about Julian Assange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM NUNBERG, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR: The minute he told he met with Julian Assange I assumed he was lying. It's something Roger does. It's one of the Stone rules. It's a Trump tactic to take credit and insinuate yourself. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you say it's something he does, you mean Roger Stone lies to people like you his mentee? NUNBERG: Yes, I call it exaggeration. (END VIDEO CLIP) STONE: I call it bluffing and posturing. Well, when you work with Sam Nunberg, sometimes he would call you 20, 30, 40 times a day, and when you take his call -- INGRAHAM: That's called stalking, Roger. STONE: So, one Friday late in the afternoon when I wanted to get him off the phone. My wife said dinner was ready and Sam kept saying one more thing. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Yes, I am going to fly to London and have dinner with Julian Assange. It's shtick. It's a throwaway line, joke. INGRAHAM: On the ANGLE we talk about things taken out of context then they are isolated, then they are blasted out and then they are used to smear people. That's the art of a smear. STONE: And when I figured he believed it, I milked the joke in an email. But I produced airline records, credit card records that proved I was in Los Angeles. I even produced a receipt from a deli in Santa Monica that proves I was in L.A., and obviously, Laura, my passport, custom's records and airlines. INGRAHAM: You have never been to Russia? You've never ordered a white Russian -- STONE: I was not in London and I never met with or spoken with Julian Assange. INGRAHAM: By the way, \"Stone's Rules\" from your book, which I love. My favorite part of Stone's Rules. Hit from every angle. Open multiple fronts on your enemy. The enemy must be confused and feel besieged on every side. That's what they are doing to Donald Trump? STONE: Well, they are certainly trying to. Look, everything the president needs to do to survive is in this book. I would direct him on this rule, attack and attack and don't defend. I love it when he calls out the fake news media and when he exposes what is the greatest political scandal in American history. The use of a phony dossier to rationalize the surveillance by the state to spy on the Republican candidate for president. INGRAHAM: It's like the art of war. I like it. Roger, stick around for the next segment. The \"New York Times\" confirms that the Obama administration did spy on the Trump campaign. Did the paper do that on purpose? Was it meant to blunt the impact of that upcoming inspector general report? Molly Hemingway, Sol Wisenberg join Roger next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: A \"New York Times\" story may have backfired in spectacular fashion. With a new report that may indicate that the Obama administration did, in fact spy on the Trump campaign. Buried deep in yesterday's piece on the origins of the Russian probe, more than 40 paragraphs down is this revelation. \"At least one government informant met several times with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos,\" current and former officials said. President Trump reacted to the revelation by tweeting that it could be bigger than Watergate. But was this really a misstep by the \"Times\" or was it done on purpose? Roger Stone rejoins us for reaction to this major development. Also, Fox News contributor and \"Federalist\" senior editor, Mollie Hemingway, and former Whitewater prosecutor, Sol Wisenberg. So, your reaction to that little nugget that was buried in the \"New York Times\" piece. SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF COUNSEL, WHITEWATER: Well, it's absolutely shocking and very improper in my view that the FBI apparently penetrated and had an undercover person on the Trump campaign. And if they used the lesser standards of a counter intelligence investigation -- INGRAHAM: Explain that for us for people you don't understand, to open counter intel investigation, you don't need a criminal predicate, correct? WISENBERG: Well, you don't need a criminal predicate. It's one thing to say they had enough evidence to open an investigation of whether there was Russian espionage, but certainly they were not close to being anywhere near able to say we have some evidence of espionage by people in the Trump campaign. They never could have opened a criminal investigation based on that and so instead they used the excuse of counter-intelligence. It's a huge scandal.  You're absolutely right. It was put in that story because they knew it would come out. They could say that's old news and not a big deal. INGRAHAM: Molly? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, I think it's not that this might be happening that the FBI was spying, but we have now are multiple former FBI officials fully saying that there was broad surveillance on the Trump campaign. It wasn't just Carter Page, but it was four separate high-ranking individuals.That it was wiretaps and national security letters and at least one human intelligence source. We don't know a lot, how many there were, were they sent in by the FBI? Were they walk-in? I mean, there is so much information to find out, but it's not a question of that this might indicate that there is spying. They are saying they spied in a pretty broad fashion. INGRAHAM: Remember when Trump was ridiculed by everyone when he said I was wiretapped. He was right. STONE: He was absolutely right. This has to be seen in context. Not only did they use a phony, fabricated dossier as the underlying legal rationale for the spying on the Republican candidate for president. Using the power and the authority and the capability of the state to spy on a presidential candidate, but they infiltrated the Trump campaign with an FBI agent. This makes Watergate look like small potatoes. INGRAHAM: It looks like this guy, Stefan who teaches at Cambridge and an American citizen. You know him, Roger? STONE: I played poker with him. He is an excellent poker player. INGRAHAM: Apparently. It might have been someone who suggested a lot of things to the Trump campaign. He didn't work for the Trump campaign. It was reported that he approached many different Trump campaign people to give them information. What do you make of that? WISENBERG: Well, you would call a potential entrapment. I had not heard that yet. It would not surprise me. It's shocking enough based on the flimsy evidence that they had, they would put someone in the campaign. The FISA is disturbing enough. We know they didn't reveal something very important to the FISA court.To have a plant in the political campaign of your opponent. If you do something like that, you better have dynamite and they didn't have dynamite. It's part of a pattern. The pattern of Sally Yates investigating Mike Flynn for the Logan Act. It's all part of a very disturbing thing. HEMINGWAY: There is an additional problem with this, which is Congress is currently trying to find out information about these things. The FBI is telling them they can't turn over that information. At the same time, you are seeing leaks with personally identifying biographical career information about the source that was used. They are telling the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post,\" but they won't turn over the information to Congress, which is actually -- INGRAHAM: Because they want to make themselves look as good as possible before this IG thing comes out and before other documents come out. I mean, this narrative is being tainted. Burying the lead in the \"New York Times.\" Roger, Rudy said they are discussing with Mueller now narrowing the scope of the questions. I don't like him talking to Bob Mueller at all. I think this whole thing stinks to high heaven, but it looks like they've made progress on narrowing the questions. STONE: I made this point on (inaudible) the other day. There is no circumstance under which the president should go in for an interview. It's a perjury trap. The idea that Rob Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions won't turn over to Congress a co-equal branch of government information regarding the surveillance of the Trump campaign. That's an impeachable offense. INGRAHAM: You think Obama had no knowledge? STONE: On the contrary, what did the president know and when did he know it? INGRAHAM: How does the president of the United States not know that we are doing a counter intel investigation on the opponent of the woman who would succeed him? STONE: Peter Strzok's text messages indicate the president wanted to know everything. They've tried to explain that away. INGRAHAM: I always go back to Susan Rice's e-mail to herself on inauguration day, the president wanted everything done by the book. She said it twice right afternoon on January 20th. Sol, narrowing the scope of the questions. Is that giving you any sense of comfort that they would go in there and answer questions by Mueller given everything we know now? WISENBERG: As I've said many times on this show, if Donald Trump were any white-collar client, famous or not in this circumstance, I would physically prevent him from going in for that questioning. On the point that Roger raised about the information that the DOJ doesn't want to give over. There are good reasons for not giving over sources of and methods. The problem with the DOJ and particularly with the FBI is they have been caught saying several times we can't turn this over because it's sensitive.  And when they back down and un-redact it, it's just embarrassing. They have a credibility problem. INGRAHAM: Mollie, Papadopoulos, they kept saying Papadopoulos was this big impetus for the investigation. The more we learn about that, I'm sorry, but he just seems like a goofball. I don't know him. Like Carter Page, Papadopoulos, this is like ridiculous. Look at these, they are not exactly characters you would imagine compiling information and trying to get with the Russians. But nevertheless we keep learning more about who was approaching him at the time. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Right. The more we learn, at first we were told there were all these questions about Russian interference and involvement with the Trump campaign. The more we learn about what led them to think that, it boggles the mind that professionals would actually have started any investigation at all over these very piddling things. And yet they did, and they are now admitting they were spying on at least four Trump campaign officials and that they were using the entire powers of the intelligence apparatus to do this. Regardless of what you think about Donald Trump, this is such a horrible precedent to be spying on political opponents and to be doing it with, and to be avoiding accountability. INGRAHAM: They spied on you, right? ROGER STONE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: The \"New York Times\" reported an January 20th of 2017 that there was a FISA warrant on me. I talked to those reporters. They will not retract their story. I've asked through a FOIA request for information. It has been denied. We're going to move to-- INGRAHAM: I am not saying this as a Republican or conservative. I find it frightening that the power of the federal government could be used in in this manner in the middle of the political season with spurious or scant evidence. We are out of time, guys. I wish we could hold you guys for the hour. Fantastic panel. It's great to have you, all of you, in Washington. And I got Sol to smile once.Is \"Roseanne\" about to get less political? ABC says yes, but what are the show's stars saying? And we lost a conservative literary lion this week. We'll remember him. Raymond Arroyo, \"Seen and Unseen\" next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose what is really going on behind the big cultural stories of the day. In tonight's segment \"Roseanne\" may be getting a little less political, and is rebooted \"Murphy Brown\" about to take on us at FOX News? For answer we turn to \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the \"Will Wilder\" series, FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo. All right, Raymond, \"Roseanne,\" what is going on? RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The ABC head of entertainment this week said \"Roseanne\" is going to back away from politics. It's going to focus on the family this season. But today Roseanne tweeted out ABC has been nothing but supportive of me. The press has misrepresented what the ABC president said. It looks like she is going to keep on this train where there is a balance between politics and family. Let's face it, it is the story of this family that keeps the family watching. INGRAHAM: First of all, politics, if she wants to keep ratings you've got to have some politics, because it's funny, and it's real. ARROYO: Meanwhile, there's \"Murphy Brown.\" INGRAHAM: Oh, no, we're back to \"Murphy Brown\"? ARROYO: Wait until you see this. INGRAHAM: OK, let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You could not tell the evening news from an episode of \"Entertainment Tonight.\" The problem was I didn't know what to do with myself. And then, we had an election. INGRAHAM: I thought that was betty white. Oh my gosh! (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: Whole hog politics. INGRAHAM: I thought that was Betty White. ARROYO: Candace Bergen, she moved into the tapioca set. INGRAHAM: I'm getting there too. She looks great, but I didn't even know that -- ARROYO: Well, her voice is very husky. INGRAHAM: I'm really dating myself, forget it. ARROYO: She's going to be a host like \"Morning Joe\" opposite her son who is on a \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" type show. INGRAHAM: OK, then there is a long career for me at FOX. ARROYO: The CBS entertainment chief said we probably won't get Roseanne style ratings. I think he is right. INGRAHAM: First of all, it's not going to last a season. All right, I know you are not a big fan of reboots. ARROYO: I am not. But there is one that is really working, and it's on a streaming service. My 15-year-old Lorenzo started watching this. I said, what are you watching? It's YouTube Red, and it's this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard you beat up a bunch of teenagers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't beat up teenagers. I kicked the crap out of a bunch of -- who deserved it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you're going to bring Cobra Kai back to the valley?  Not on my watch. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARROYO: This is the \"Karate Kid\" reboot. INGRAHAM: This is ridiculous. ARROYO: But it's working. And 51 million people are watching this. It's the biggest streaming show in all of television. It is doubling \"Handmaid's Tale,\" \"Stranger Things,\" huge audiences. Why is this working, Laura? INGRAHAM: The '80s are making a big comeback. ARROYO: It's nostalgia for people our age. INGRAHAM: All the kids, the 80s rocked, OK. All the hair bands, you go the great hair bands, you got the great economy. You got Reagan for eight years. It was awesome. I was young. ARROYO: Wax on, wax off, they are killing the competition. And it's just been renewed for a second season. INGRAHAM: You know what my favorite part \"Karate Kid\" was? ARROYO: Sweep the leg, Johnny. INGRAHAM: No. Sweep the knee, not the leg. You don't know anything about karate. Sweep the knee. And then the best one was when he is first learned karate and he looks down at the ground to bow and he goes, \"Eyes, Danielson!\" ARROYO: That's what you do on the Ingraham show? INGRAHAM: Yes, every night when they don't look at me. ARROYO: I'm waiting for \"Golden Girls,\" \"Cheers,\" and \"Magnum P.I.\" to come back. INGRAHAM: As long as they don't ask me to star in \"Golden Girls.\" ARROYO: They won't. INGRAHAM: What about Tom Wolfe? We both knew him, I knew him. What a man. ARROYO: One of the greatest writers, National Book Award winner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM WOLFE, WRITER: The intellectuals in New York, they were startled by that because I had been writing about a lot of groovy things, they thought I must be like them when it came to politics. When I went into a room full of journalists or writers in general, people would look at me as if I just raised my hand and said, by the way, I forgot to tell you, I am a child molester. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He was so great. ARROYO: He was incisive. The words \"Right Stuff,\" \"Limousine liberals,\" \"good ole boy,\" all of those terms came from Tom Wolfe, a great novelist and a social observer like no other. INGRAHAM: One of the best interviews I ever did on radio was Tom Wolfe? ARROYO: Until I was on the show now. INGRAHAM: Exactly. ARROYO: Are you getting ready for the royal wedding? INGRAHAM: Yes. ARROYO: I am preparing too. Are you ready? I don't care who takes her down the aisle. And at $84 million to the British taxpayers, that's a lot of coin for a wedding not at Westminster Abbey. INGRAHAM: We are just looking at the dress. ARROYO: All right. INGRAHAM: A revolt by a few Republicans could cost the GOP control of the House and derail the president's plan to secure the border? Two Republican congressmen are going to debate it up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: An immigration crisis might be brewing for House Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team. We told you last night that the House is just five GOP votes away from bringing several different DACA bills to the floor in a tactic to go around House leadership. GOP leaders fear the effort could cost the party control of the House in the midterm elections. Here to debate it, Republican Jeff Denham from California who supports the maneuver, and Republican Sean Duffy from Wisconsin who opposes it. All right, guys, we're not going to get into all the parliamentary tricks, queen of the hill and discharge petition, we will lose the whole audience. Congressman Denhem, you are really in favor of turning the House floor over to Nancy Pelosi to run this debate. Why? REP. JEFF DENHAM, (R) CALIFORNIA: No, not at all. INGRAHAM: The discharge petition, that's the maneuver, isn't it? DENHAM: Yes. Which we have a Republican majority. We control all of the rules. The leader controls the floor debate. Paul Ryan has his own bill. The president has a bill. Goodlatte has a bill. And yes, the Democrats get a bill too. But ultimately we are going to do what the president is asking for him and give him border security because we cannot wait any longer -- every year that goes by, another half million people come across our southern border. So the eight years Sean and I have been in office together, that's 4 million people from doing nothing. It is time to act -- INGRAHAM: That sounds fantastic. He's practically building the wall himself over there. What is going on? REP. SEAN DUFFY, R\u2014WI: I think we want to get to the same spot. I don't like the tactic. Jeff knows that. I don't think that this petition is the way to go. It does I think turn the floor over to what is called queen of the hill. You put up four bills, the one that gets 218, which is a majority, is the one that passes. Here's the deal. We have a wide agreement on Trump's four pillars. That will pass. So Jeff will vote for that. The Freedom Caucus will vote for that. All we need is leadership to put the Trump bill up in the House. It will pass. It's easy. INGRAHAM: I have a question for you two guys, smart guys. The Goodlatte bill is the right way to go. I know you're from the Central Valley and you're worried about the farmers and worried about those workers coming in. You have to stop this chain migration. That's a mass multiplier of immigration into the United States with distant relatives hopscotching into the country without merit, without basis of merit. Chain migration, got to build the wall and we've got to reform the asylum process. All that has to be done. And we've got to get rid of the visa lottery. That's all in the Goodlatte bill. Why are we having four bills? We don't need four bills. DUFFY: We don't have the votes for Goodlatte. INGRAHAM: That's despicable. DUFFY: I would vote for Goodlatte. But here's the deal, Donald Trump said listen, I want to build a wall. All the other things come in on the backside. So let's come together, put $25 billion in, let's build the wall and make some other tweaks, stop chain migration, stop the visa lottery. We will deal with DACA. But that's a package that the president wants. It's very generous to the DACA kids but also gives us border security. And we can all vote for it. I don't know what is going to happen in the Senate. DENHAM: I can't support the Goodlatte bill. INGRAHAM: Why can't you support it? I'm just curious. Why? DENHAM: Because so many people talk about extending amnesty. I did not support President Obama's executive order. I thought it was unconstitutional and I felt that Congress needs to do its job and actually needs to do real reform. And just doing an extension of Obama's policy three years at a time doesn't make any sense. If we're going to do this we need to make sure that we fix the wall and fix some of them problems, but also have a permanent fix. INGRAHAM: You don't want to build the wall? DENHAM: Absolutely I do. INGRAHAM: You want to build the whole wall? DENHAM: Yes, of course. INGRAHAM: So the only problem you have with Goodlatte is the amnesty for it ends up being 800,000 I think, right, correct? DENHAM: Yes. It is an extension of President Obama's executive order rather than dealing with this as the president has asked for. INGRAHAM: Obama did not deal with chain migration, visa lottery, any of those things. With chain migration you immediately change the game with immigration. DENHAM: True, but he did change the dynamic for these kids that have gone to our high schools and did it in an executive order unconstitutionally. If we are going to fix this because it's now an American problem because presidents of both parties have kicked this can down the road. INGRAHAM: This will divide the party before the mid-term election. DENHAM: This is what the president is asking for. INGRAHAM: He wants the end of chain migration and he wants the wall built and he wants to end the visa lottery. DENHAM: Every other day the president tweets something about this. Two weeks ago he said specifically if we do not have this done before the CR then he did not want to see the CR. He wants to make sure we actually have border security. DUFFY: The problem with the DACA kids is if you don't end chain migration, all of the sudden the kids and the parents who brought them in illegally all of a sudden get legal status. INGRAHAM: The parents are all staying. Let's be honest. They're all staying. No one is going home. DUFFY: We actually have to fix that part of it when we deal with DACA as well. But the key here is Donald Trump ran on the wall. Let's build it, $25 billion. We all agree to that. INGRAHAM: I think Congressman Denham is right. Donald Trump did not win on giving amnesty to the DACA kids. He won on border security, building the wall, and even Californians, the majority want deportations to go on. That Berkeley poll that came out the other day is devastating, 59 percent want somewhat important or very important to start deporting these people out. DENHAM: But the president has also put the Democrats on notice on this issue as well. The Democrats had $42 billion out of the Senate and out of every Democrat in the House. I think it's time to put them to the test on this issue as well. DUFFY: We want to deal with this issue. As Republicans we don't want to turn this over to the Nancy Pelosi. I don't think we will lose the House, but if we did, she'll deal with it. Let's deal with it as Republicans and a family solution. I don't think this is the right process. I think we should come together as a family and get it done outside of turning the floor to Nancy. INGRAHAM: All right, guys, queen of the hill, kings of the Hill. Guys, great to have you on. And speaking of illegal immigrants, we have another shocking example of a suspected criminal put back on the streets instead of being turned over to immigration officials. You will not believe this, make your head spin, coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: This woman, illegal immigrant Juana Loa-Nunez, is accused of a hit-and-run on a church daycare teacher. Jessica Parks of Indianapolis was hit with such force she was thrown into the air and suffered a broken leg before the suspect sped off. ICE issued a detainer request but Marion County released the driver after fining here anyway. They county blames ICE for failing to get a warrant, but Ricardo Wong, head of ICE's Chicago office shot back Marion County brazenly ignored an immigration retainer and released a Mexican woman from its jail without first notifying ICE.\" Pastor James Jackson of Fervent Prayer Church was at the scene of the hit and run and joins us now from Indianapolis. It is another shocker to hear the facts of this. Thank goodness Jessica survived. But your feelings given now that we know that the perpetrator is gone. They tried to approach her at her supposed place of residence and the door was answered by someone who said she didn't live there anymore, pastor. PASTOR JAMES JACKSON, AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT: Absolutely. Laura, thanks for having us on today. I think we are at a crisis point in our country and certainly here in Indianapolis when someone nearly kills someone is released less than a week after the incident occurred. And the agencies involved for making sure she was held accountable for what happened not doing enough. We need to be more conscientious about these kinds of things to make sure that they don't happen again in the future. INGRAHAM: And I think Pastor Jackson, a lot of Americans, they don't hear these crimes reported. We try to keep track of them. Many news organizations will not report the legal status or illegal status of the perpetrators of the accused, of the arrested. So you have to really dig for this information. In this case we were able to get it. And what is amazing here is that Jessica who suffered the broken leg and other more minor injuries, but the broken leg, was thrown from the car, she is forgiving the assailant who has now apparently absconded. JACKSON: Yes, that's something that is not surprising to me that Jessica did forgive her, and certainly we all do. But there is an accountability. And this young woman, Ms. Nunez, fled the scene. And if it had not for a daycare worker in the bus who right there when it happen and chased her down in the bus, and then another citizen also making sure that she was detained, we would have never known possibly who had done this. So for local authorities to release her on bond -- which I don't think that was something that was thought through as thoroughly as it should have been. Ms. Nunez enjoyed a benefit that is offered to U.S. citizens. As a non-U.S. citizen she doesn't have that benefit in fact because she had a level-six felony. So she should have never been released from jail. INGRAHAM: And you obviously have been following the sanctuary policies in places like California, Pastor Jackson, where this kind of stuff, sadly, happens all the time. There are rampant hit-and-runs, DWI's, DUI's throughout the country, especially in areas that are populated by a lot of illegal aliens. And yet they will not cooperate with ICE authorities, and we have a trail of victims leaving behind. Your final thoughts very quickly? JACKSON: I think we are sending the wrong message across the nation when these kinds of things happen, and it's very unfortunate that we would have any city that would protect anyone who is participating in lawless behavior, and for the individuals who are facilitating and financing that kind of lawlessness. INGRAHAM: Sorry to interrupt. It is a shocker this happened. We really appreciate your joining us tonight. And we'll stay on this story. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: We don't have a last bite. We have a last picture. What's this. That's Stormy Daniels, the porn lawyer, Avenatti, with Don Lemon at CNN. That's out in Sag Harbor. It looks like they are having a lot of fun. They didn't invite me. Is that what objective journalists do at CNN on the weekends? That's so sweet.

            "article_content": "Mark Meadows on Strzok and Page Texts Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, who led House conservatives\u2019 successful effort Friday to nix the GOP-controlled chamber\u2019s farm bill, thinks detractors will eventually come around to supporting the measure. \u201cI think we\u2019ll reconsider this bill,\u201d the North Carolina Republican and leader of the House Freedom Caucus said minutes after the bill failed 213-198 on the House floor. Members of the influential roughly 35-member caucus voted against the bill as leverage to try to force House Speaker Paul Ryan to hold a vote on a hard line immigration bill that they support. \u201cI think if we get a vote on immigration we reconsider this bill,\u201d Meadows told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll vote for it, yeah.\u201d GOP leaders thought they had found a way by Friday morning to make the party's warring conservative and moderate wings happy on an issue that has bedeviled them for years. Conservatives would get a vote by late June on an immigration bill that parrots many of President Trump's hard-right immigration views, including reductions on legal immigration and opening the door to his proposed wall with Mexico. And centrists would have a chance to craft a more moderate alternative with the White House and Democrats and get a vote on that. But it all blew up as conservatives decided they didn't like that offer and rebelled. By lunchtime Friday, many were among the 30 Republicans who joined Democrats and scuttled the sweeping farm and food bill, a setback for Ryan, R-Wis., and other GOP House leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., left, speaks during a news conference after the House voted to approve the Republican tax bill, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Meadows described his conversation with Ryan as \"professional,\u201d saying, \u201cHe understands we all got different districts.\u201d He also acknowledged pressure to back the farm bill after Trump tweeted his support. \u201cThere\u2019s always pressure when the president weighs in on one side or the other,\u201d Meadows said. Still, Meadows, who represents an agricultural district, suggested that delaying the passage of a new bill, which included work requirements for Americans on food-assistance programs, was not going to hurt farmers. \u201cHonestly, having a farm bill is critical, [but] you know an extension of the current farm bill is probably just as good for my farmers as this one,\" he said. \u201cTomorrow, the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill, which includes work requirements. We must support our Nation\u2019s great farmers!,\u201d Trump tweeted. The conservatives essentially took the agriculture bill hostage, saying they were unwilling to let the farm measure pass unless they first got assurances that when the House addresses immigration in coming weeks, leaders would not help an overly permissive version pass. Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., a leader of the moderates, said his group would try to write a bill that would let young \"Dreamer\" immigrants in the U.S. illegally stay permanently -- a position anathema to conservatives -- and toughen border security. A moderate immigration package \"disavows what the last election was about and what the majority of the American people want, and the people in this body know it,\" said Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Scott Perry, one of the many Freedom Caucus members who opposed the bill. \"It's all about timing unfortunately and leverage, and the farm bill was just a casualty.\" Denham and his allies were also unwilling to back down. He told reporters that the conservatives \"broke that agreement,\" and his group would pursue bipartisan legislation. \"I'm disappointed in some colleagues who asked for a concession, got the concession and then took down a bill anyway,\" Denham said in a slap at the Freedom Caucus. He also said the concession was a promised vote on the conservative immigration bill by June, though conservatives said they never agreed to that. Such internal bickering is the opposite of what the GOP needs as the party struggles to fend off Democratic efforts to capture control of the House in November. Republican leaders and strategists think their winning formula is to focus on an economy that has been gaining strength and tax cuts the GOP says is putting more money in people's wallets. And immigration is a distraction from that message. On one side are conservatives from Republican strongholds, where many voters consider helping immigrants stay in the U.S. to be amnesty. On the other are GOP moderates, often representing districts with many constituents who are Hispanic, moderate suburbanites or are tied to the agriculture industry, which relies heavily on migrant workers. Trump's willingness to sign immigration legislation also remains in question after a year that has seen his stance on the issue veer unpredictably. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Confusion from the White House over immigration reform strategy; reaction and analysis from the 'Special Report' All-Stars. This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" June 22, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration. They are not separated for a day or two days. These are permanently separated. These are the families the media ignores. As a result of sanctuary city policies in fiscal 2017, more than 8,000 criminal aliens were released back into our civilian population. We don't want people in our country that that don't go through a process. We want people in our country based on merit. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: President Trump today talking about immigration, immigration reform, protecting cities, protecting the country with the border security, tweeting out, however, raising some high brows, \"Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the red wave,\" referring to the election in the fall. Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent for The Washington Examiner; Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mort Kondracke, contributor for Real Clear Politics. Mort, welcome back. MORT KONDRACKE, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Hi. BAIER: Start with you. What about this immigration stance and whether Congress is moving or not moving or what the president is doing in this process. KONDRACKE: Look, from the get go Trump has been demonizing Mexicans as rapists and murderer. He ran on xenophobia, he won on xenophobe. He could have had a deal with Chuck Schumer last year. He would have gotten his wall. The DACA kids would have been legalized. He probably now should add we won't separate families any more but we will put ankle bracelets on people that we want to keep from melting into the population. He blew up the last deal by insisting that legal immigration be cut in half, even though we need immigrants to pay for Social Security and do jobs that Americans won't do. And now he is blowing up whatever chance there was for a House deal, which Paul Ryan should have tried to make a bipartisan bill. But now Trump says you are wasting your time. He said at one point I like both the Goodlatte bill and the compromise bill. Now he says I want no bill. So I think he just -- BAIER: Fred, what about this and how it plays for the midterm and how perhaps the president thinks it plays? FRED BARNES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Well, he doesn't think it's playing very well. Obviously, you know those tweets where he said we're going to have to go back to the midterm election, or go forward to it, and then we can have a red wave and then we can do something. He is basically right about that. He recognizes he is in a fix. Is he not going to get anything passed. The Democrats don't want to pass anything. The Republicans don't have the votes. And he has no great influence on this issue in Congress. So I think it's going to get worse for Trump. We're going to start seeing the thing Republicans hate the most, and that's catch and release, because some of these children will be getting released after 20 days, and they can't be allowed to wander around out there, so you have to let the parents out and tell them they can come back for a hearing. Of course, they never come back. BAIER: Yes, Byron. BRYON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: This is more proof of Republican dysfunction on this issue. They have had trouble with this issue for a very long time. These bills contain the president's number one campaign promise, his number one priority on this which is the construction of a border wall. It takes 215 votes to pass this bill right now. There are 235 Republicans in the House. Does anybody believe there are going to be more Republicans in the house after November. Regardless what the president says about a red wave, they have a chance to pass a bill that would fund the president's top priority, that would fix the DACA problem and would address today's current problem of family separations. And yet they are not able to get this together. BAIER: Do you take a half a loaf in other words? Take a listen to the reaction to the tweet from lawmakers up on the Hill: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the president is expressing his frustration that Democrats don't want to solve the problem while we do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We shouldn't do anything legislatively until we can reconnect these children. That has to be our highest priority right now. REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, R-TEXAS: I think the president did the right thing. I appreciated his tweet today more than you can imagine. REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: The president is right. Chuck Schumer said this earlier in the week. They don't want to do anything. But at least the House should show the American people we are doing what we said. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Mara? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, see, that's the problem. Even if everyone knows you can't pass something through the Senate because it as president keeps on pointing out you need democrat votes there, moderate house Republicans were desperate for a chance to just vote on something just because they are in competitive districts. They want to show their voters they tried to solve the Dreamer problem. They tried to end family separations. But the president pulled out the rug from out from under them and said we shouldn't even bother. Don't waste your time. Just a couple days ago he said I'm with you 1,000 percent. I'm behind these bills. So a lot of confusion not just on the policy, not just what's going to happen to these kids on the border, but also what's going to happen on Capitol Hill. This is an issue that up until now has been a pretty good one for him. It energizes his base. It goes back to some really core issues that he has used all along. It helped him win the White House. But now I think he has muddied the water so much it's hard to know what he wants. BAIER: As you look, Mort, let me just put up the generic Congressional ballot as it stands now, Democrat 46.3, Republicans 40.2. That's the average of the recent polls. It has closed down in recent days. It's tough to see how this all plays, isn't it, by the time you get to the fall? KONDRACKE: Yes. I have no idea how these elections are going to turn out. I think they are going to be all about Trump and his character and so on. But look, if he really wanted a bill, he could put the Democrats to a test. Put a decent bill on the table, stick to it. Tell Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan I want this bill. And let the Democrats blow it up and prove him right. My guess is that if it was a decent enough bill, he could get a lot more than even the wall. He could probably get an end to the visa lottery and he could get a gradual change from family reunification to talent as the basis. I think he is basically a xenophobe. He rode it to the White House. Now he has got all these European pals of his who are xenophobes and I think he is going to ride this wave forever. BAIER: All right, second half of the beltway boys. Wrap it up here. BARNES: Look, this is an issue that Democrats have finally found a part of the issue that helps them, and that's this whole issue of separation of children from their families. It's about the only one that's been around that Democrats could really use. Trump is going to use not this particular part of the issue, but the whole immigration issue this fall in the midterm, and I think it will help him.

            "article_content": "Newly elected Democrats could pose problem for Pelosi's bid to become speaker of the House; reaction from Democratic Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline. Never underestimate a woman \u2013 especially Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to serve as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and once the most powerful female elected official in American history. Now she is poised to claim those titles again in January. Pelosi, a California Democrat representing San Francisco, was speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011. She has been House minority leader since 2011, when Republicans gained majority control of the chamber. But on Tuesday, everything changed when voters elected enough Democrats to make them the majority party in the House again when those elected Tuesday take office two months from now. If Pelosi can overcome opposition by some Democrats who want a younger party leader and is elected to become speaker again, she will be the first person to return to the speakership after losing it since Rep. Sam Rayburn, D-Texas, accomplished the feat in 1955. No one has ever returned to the speakership for a second time after being in the minority for eight years. Pelosi didn\u2019t rise as far as she did in politics by chance. No one in Washington understands politics and power better than she does. Pelosi was born into a Democratic political family and grew up in Baltimore surrounded by politics. Her father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro, served in the U.S. House and as mayor of Baltimore. Her brother also served as mayor of Baltimore. While she was in college Pelosi worked as an intern in the Senate and attended the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. She has been a member of the House since 1987. A progressive who knows how to play hardball, Pelosi knows how to count votes, be practical, and get things done. No one in the House raises more money for Democratic candidates nor understands what it takes to win races better than she does. And no one knows how to get legislation passed better than Pelosi. She is the reason ObamaCare won approval in Congress \u2013 President Obama has said that. Pelosi is the one who came up with the strategy, wrangled the votes and made it possible for the Affordable Care Act to become law. Health care was the most important issue to voters in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, exit polling showed, helping Democrats again take control of the House. When Pelosi was speaker she ran the Democratic caucus far more effectively, and with more accomplishments, than did her two Republican successors \u2013 Rep. John Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Under Pelosi\u2019s speakership and in her time as minority leader, House Democrats have been united and worked together to get things done. During her tenure as the minority leader during the first two years of the Trump presidency, not one Democrat defected on votes involving ObamaCare and the tax code. Not one. Boehner and Ryan were driven from the speakership by their caucus. Pelosi is expected to return as speaker. In every election in modern times, Republicans have attacked women like Pelosi when they campaign against Democrats. It may help Republicans raise money, but it cost them votes on Tuesday. In fact, it cost them the House. More than 100 women were elected to Congress this week. And it\u2019s one more reason I believe Pelosi will be speaker. With President Trump in office and with women under attack by him since he started his campaign for president, most women voters are supporting Democrats and more women are running for elective office. Finally, earlier this year Pelosi delivered an eight-hour speech in four-inch heels on the House floor about Dreamers. In doing so, Pelosi broke a 109-year record for the longest floor speech. So by every measure \u2013 politics, governing, legislating and stamina \u2013 Pelosi has broken all records. And as President Trump will learn with the start of the next session of Congress in January, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will not be someone he can dominate with bullying, insults of threats. If he makes the mistake of underestimating her, he will regret it.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the Politico and Morning Consult poll that lays the blame for a divided country at both President Trump and the mainstream media. If there is one overriding theme to the coverage of Donald Trump's presidency, it's that he is dividing the country, tearing it apart, fueling the rage and possibly even political violence. Strip away objections to his policies, to his personality, to his Twitter insults, to his spur-of-the-moment management style, and it comes down to the journalistic view that the president has done almost nothing to unite America. A major problem with this mindset is that most of those in the media fail to consider that their business is also contributing to the deepening divisions. That simply doesn't comport with their self-image. Most journalists believe they are neutral seekers of truth. Most commentators believe they are offering honest opinions (and, increasingly, that the other side is lying). But in the hyperpolarized Trump era, with so much bitingly negative coverage of the president, the media are increasingly viewed by major chunks of the country as part of the problem. Now I don't dispute for a second that Trump has largely chosen to play to his base. He has made only limited attempts to work with Democrats on issues like health care and tax cuts, and when he has, such as on the dreamers, it has usually come to naught. That approach has been even more pronounced in the final days of the midterms, especially on immigration. And when there have been racially charged eruptions, such as Charlottesville, Trump's comments have managed to inflame rather than soothe much of the public. But a new poll by Politico and Morning Consult contains some pretty troubling news for the press as well as the president. Just 30 percent of voters surveyed say Trump has done more to unite the country, while 56 percent say he's done more to divide it. But in a bigger vote of no-confidence, 64 percent say the national media have done more to divide the nation, and just 17 percent say they've done more to unite it. Put another way, the media are 47 percent underwater on the question, compared to 26 percent underwater for Trump, who has a fiercely loyal base. As you might expect, there's a huge partisan divide when it comes to the president. A sweeping 88 percent of Democrats say he's done more to divide the country, while 25 percent of Republicans say the same. (So do 54 percent of independents.) But again, the numbers are even worse for the fourth estate. Some 80 percent of Republicans say the media have done more to divide America, and 46 percent of Democrats agree (as do 67 percent of independents). This is sobering stuff. The entire national debate has been framed by the media around Trump stoking the flames of divisiveness, not the other way around. The president, of course, has hit back hard, as in this tweet: \"The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually, it is their Fake & Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!\" But the press has largely dismissed such accusations as mere deflection. I do think some pundits really overreached in trying to blame Trump, directly or indirectly, for the serial pipe bomber and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. And perhaps that influenced the poll findings. What would be best for an angry and divided country is if both sides would tone it down. But I see very little prospect of that happening.",

            "article_content": "After an emotional memorial service for at a church in Phoenix, John McCain's body returned to the Washington, D.C. area for the final time, when Air Force Two landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Plenty of lawmakers, government officials and other dignitaries will circulate through the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain as he lies in state in the Rotunda. But there will be plenty of ordinary Americans, too. That\u2019s because the man who designed the Capitol wanted it that way. The House and Senate chambers are for the legislators. But neoclassical British architect Benjamin Latrobe decided the Rotunda is for the people. Discussion about the use of each room in the Capitol dates back to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Usage of the House and Senate were self-explanatory. But in 1806, there was a lot of conversation between Jefferson and Latrobe about how to use the middle of the Capitol. The blueprints focused on creating a grand entrance to the building in the center. Jefferson and Latrobe thought that this expanse in the middle should be a place for the public to assemble. Its use as an ornate vestibule for those going to the House and Senate was secondary. The Rotunda may mimic the interior of the Pantheon in Rome. But in his plans, Latrobe labeled the Rotunda: \u201cthe hall of the people.\u201d And that\u2019s where \u201cthe people\u201d will come to honor McCain. Early on, there was talk about using the Rotunda for Joint Sessions of Congress. But those never materialized back then. Construction of the Rotunda began in 1818. Congress first used the Rotunda for a ceremony in 1824 to honor Marquis de Lafayette, a key figure in both the American and French Revolutions. That set the precedent for how the young nation viewed the Rotunda space. It was a crossroads for the House and Senate, and thus the nation. It wasn\u2019t a room for the fray of politics and policy disputes. The Rotunda was a place where the nation\u2019s people would assemble together, checking their differences at the door. There\u2019s a reason the Rotunda is round. A circle is the symbol of equality. A ceremony for McCain to lie in state is precisely the type of event Latrobe had in mind for the Capitol Rotunda: a place to mourn some of the nation\u2019s most-eminent citizens. McCain becomes the 30th soul to lie in state in the Rotunda. The late House Speaker and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay was the first person to lie in state in 1852, followed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Clay laid in state with an open casket. The last figure to lie in state with an open casket was the late Sen. and Rep. Claude Pepper, a Florida Democrat, in 1989. Pierre L\u2019Enfant composed the master plan for Washington, D.C. L\u2019Enfant died with $46 to his name, and a few pocket watches in 1825. L\u2019Enfant initially was buried in Chillum, Maryland, just outside the city he designed. But they exhumed L\u2019Enfant in 1909. Congress honored L\u2019Enfant by lying his remains in state in the Rotunda. They reburied L\u2019Enfant on a hill at Arlington National Cemetery, overlooking the capital city. McCain\u2019s casket will rest atop the wooden catafalque, a platform constructed for Lincoln\u2019s funeral. It\u2019s pronounced KATT-uh-falk. They used to store the catafalque in the tomb located two floors immediately below the Rotunda. That\u2019s where they initially intended to bury George Washington. But Washington is interred at Mount Vernon. The catafalque is now on display in the Capitol Visitors Center. Four persons have lain \u201cin honor,\u201d one level below \u201cin state.\u201d U.S. Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and, just this past February, Rev. Billy Graham. The ceremony for lying \u201cin honor\u201d looks a lot like the one for lying in state. For Graham, they used a replica catafalque, which is now kept in Washington\u2019s tomb at the Capitol. The catafalque is the wooden platform used for President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s funeral, which is where Sen. John McCain\u2019s casket will rest Friday and early Saturday. (Fox News) No African-Americans have lain in state. Just Chestnut and Parks \u201cin honor.\u201d Parks is the only woman to lie in state or honor. We expect immense crowds to file into the Capitol for McCain\u2019s services when the building opens to the public Friday afternoon. The lines for President Herbert Hoover\u2019s service in the Capitol when he lay in state in 1964 were rather short. By contrast, they kept the Capitol open for 24 hours when Rosa Parks lay in honor in 2005. Parks\u2019 ceremony was different than most. A city bus, similar to the one in Montgomery, Alabama, on which Parks refused to sit in the \u201ccolored section,\u201d transported her remains to the Capitol. President Gerald Ford was the last chief executive to lie in state in the Rotunda in late 2006/early 2007. Some 57,000 people filed past Ford\u2019s coffin in the Rotunda. Security officials scrambled jet fighters when air traffic controllers lost contact with a Kentucky State Police plane carrying then-Kentucky Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s ceremony at the Capitol in June 2004. The incident forced the evacuation of the Capitol complex as they awaited a horse-drawn caisson to bring Reagan\u2019s body to the Capitol for him to lie in state. Reagan\u2019s body was viewed by 105,000 people, twice as many as those who came to honor Ford. Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye was the last person to lie in state in December 2012. Inouye lost his arm during World War II, just across a hillside in Italy where Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole also was wounded. The Kansas Republican came to the Rotunda to pay his respects to Inouye as his fallen colleague lay in state. The two bonded over politics as they convalesced in a Michigan hospital during WWII. When Dole approached the Rotunda, he ditched his wheelchair. With the assistance of his wife, former North Carolina Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole and current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Dole shuffled toward Inouye\u2019s casket in the middle of the Rotunda. Dole shed a tear and touched the casket of his friend. Dole said he got up, and walked because \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Dan to see me in a wheelchair.\u201d A couple of presidents have not lain in state over the years. President Harry Truman didn\u2019t like ceremonies and even turned down the Congressional Gold Medal. The family of President Richard Nixon also rejected the honor out of concern some visitors to the Rotunda might not be respectful. Dozens of House and Senate members will gather Friday in the Rotunda to honor McCain. Vice President Mike Pence, McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan will deliver remarks. Other Congressional leaders will lay a wreath. The dignitaries and lawmakers will depart after the ceremony. But the public will come to say goodbye to McCain in the afternoon. Thousands will queue on the west front of the Capitol in the summertime heat for the opportunity to spend just a few seconds walking past the casket of John Sidney McCain. After all, this is the type of thing Latrobe envisioned for the Rotunda. The House and Senate chambers are for the lawmakers. But the Rotunda is hall of the people.",

            "article_content": "A look at the fracturing relationship between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday lit into federal judges for what he called a dramatic uptick in \"outrageous\" decisions threatening to interfere with the separation of powers by exposing\u00a0internal White House deliberations. In a fiery speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, Sessions warned that \"once we go down this road in American government, there is no turning back.\" He vowed to take \"these discovery fights to the Supreme Court in emergency postures. ... We intend to fight this, and we intend to win.\" Sessions specifically singled out New York district court judge\u00a0Jesse M. Furman, who ruled that\u00a0Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross could be questioned\u00a0in an ongoing lawsuit concerning the legality of the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question\u00a0to the 2020 census. Furman's decision, Sessions said, contradicts longstanding statutory provisions that protect certain executive branch discussions from disclosure, in order to encourage free and open deliberations by executive branch officials. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including several liberal states, are arguing in part\u00a0that the White House added the citizenship question for political reasons. The judge wants \"to hold a trial over the inner workings of a Cabinet secretary\u2019s mind,\" and inappropriately allow inquiry into the motivations for the Trump administration's decisions, Sessions said. Furman's order, which was upheld by a New York federal appellate court, has been stayed by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The full Supreme Court is expected to decide the issue soon. \"Once we go down this road in American government, there is no turning back.\" The pending court challenges against the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell Fox News, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a\u00a05-4 majority on the Supreme Court, but also\u00a0because\u00a0traditionally it's\u00a0been\u00a0the White House's prerogative to decide\u00a0whether to inquire about citizenship on the census. Former President Barack Obama's\u00a0administration didn't ask the question in the 2010\u00a0census\u00a0amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into\u00a0avoiding answering their census questions -- and thus not count toward\u00a0population totals used to determine the number of\u00a0seats each state receives in the House of Representatives. (The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.) Democrats would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominately liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say. TRUMP CENSUS BUREAU NOMINEE QUIZZED BY SENATORS ON CITIZENSHIP QUESTION \"There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,\" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News. \"The recent move is simply to restore what had long been the case.\" Eastman also told Fox News it would be legally permissible for the government to only count citizens for purposes of determining representation in the House of Representatives. However, other legal experts have contested that view, saying the Constitution demands that all \"persons\" be tallied \u00a0-- not all citizens. Nevertheless, Sessions said Monday, liberal states and nonprofits have continued to push even longshot legal challenges in order to dig around in executive branch deliberations. \"This is not the first time we\u2019ve had to seek emergency appellate intervention to stop outrageous discovery,\" Sessions said. Last year,\u00a0the government filed a successful emergency motion to stop a district court's ruling that permitted plaintiffs to question a Department of Homeland Security counselor about advice relating to the contentious Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Sessions called that lower court ruling a \"blatant violation of deliberative process and attorney-client privileges\" and warned that it would have a \"chilling effect\" on deliberations in the White House. He added, \"Too many judges believe it is their right, their duty, to act upon their sympathies and policy preferences.\" The attorney general blamed Obama for encouraging that approach. \"One argument for activism was advocated openly by President Obama when he declared his judicial nominees must judge with 'empathy.' It is a seductive argument. But whatever empathy is, it\u2019s more akin to emotion, bias, and politics than law,\" Sessions said. \"In the recent DACA litigation, for example, a judge last year told one of our DOJ litigators, 'You can\u2019t come into court to espouse a position that is heartless,'\" Sessions continued. \"Not illegal. Not unlawful. Heartless. And later, after I responded in a speech that it isn\u2019t a judge\u2019s job to decide whether a policy is 'heartless,' the judge again scolded the DOJ lawyer by stating that I 'seem to think the courts cannot have an opinion.'\" Judge Nicholas Garaufis denied the government's motion to dismiss a DACA lawsuit, citing President Trump's \"bigoted\" comments. (Reuters, FIle) That judge, U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis, was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton. He ruled in March that a lawsuit seeking to preserve the federal DACA program can continue -- citing candidate Donald Trump's \"racial slurs\" and \"epithets.\" \u201cOne might reasonably infer,\u201d Garaufis said in his politically charged ruling, \u201cthat a candidate who makes overtly bigoted statements on the campaign trail might be more likely to engage in similarly bigoted action in office.\u201d Separately, Sessions also said the 27 nationwide federal injunctions issued by individual judges\u00a0during the Trump administration so far -- which brought temporary halts to high-profile policies like his ban on travel from Muslim-majority nations --\u00a0constitute an unprecedented \"judicial encroachment.\" \"It is emphatically not the duty of the courts to manage the government or to pass judgment on every policy action the Executive branch takes,\" Sessions said. \"In the first 175 years of this Republic, not a single judge issued one of these orders.\" In his confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court in September, then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh was asked by Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy about the constitutionality of individual federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions against presidential action, a recent phenomenon.\u00a0Kavanaugh demurred, saying he could not discuss potential pending issues before the Supreme Court. Sessions noted that Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who concurred in the high court's decision earlier this year to reinstate Trump's travel ban, wrote that such injunctions\u00a0\u201ctake a toll on the federal court system\u2014preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the executive branch.\u201d He added: \"Executive branch officers do not work for the judiciary. We work for the president of the United States. Respect runs both ways.\"",

As reports of the book emerged, Trump fired back while speaking to reporters Friday morning, even as he acknowledged he hasn't read it. \"She got paid a lot of money to write a book,\" he said, and then took a shot at his predecessor, Barack Obama: \"I\u2019ll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military by not funding it properly \u2026 it was depleted.\" In her memoir, \"Becoming,\"\u00a0Michelle Obama reportedly derides the so-called \"birther\" conspiracy as thinly-veiled racism.

LEAKED TAPE CAPTURES TRUMP IN CRUDE RANT WITH TV HOST She also criticizes Trump\u2019s body language during a 2016 presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, which she says amounted to stalking.

This is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" August 9, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I am Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I want to start tonight by addressing my commentary at the top of last night's show. A message to those who are distorting my views including all white nationalists and especially one racist freak whose name I will not even mention. You do not have my support. You don't represent my views and you are antithetical to the beliefs I hold dear. The purpose of last night's Angle was to point out that the rule of law, meaning secure borders, is something that used to bind our country together. And despite what some may be contending, I made explicitly clear that my commentary had nothing to do with race or ethnicity, but rather a shared goal of keeping America safe and her citizens safe and prosperous. Furthermore, as I have said repeatedly on the show, merit-based immigration does wonders for our country's economy, our way of life, and how we define our country. I even said that in my opening thoughts last night. I want to make it really clear that my concern will continue to remain with the families who have suffered the tragic results of illegal immigration. The children put in dangerous and unfair situations at the border, and all those border agents around the country who work to keep our country safe. And now could the expert class be possibly wrong again? That is the focus of tonight's Angle. All right, the prevailing wisdom among the professional political prognosticators is that it's all gloom and doom for Republicans come the November midterms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KING, CNN HOST: We're 89 days away from midterm elections. It is already a steeper than steep hill for the Republican Party. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the best that they can do here is basically a tie, a slight win, that is not good news at all for Republicans come the fall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The turnout lessens the money, lessens -- all still suggest that this is going to be a good election for Democrats. That's not a debate. I think the debate is how big does the wave get? (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: That debate's over. Well -- and they are already busy writing the president's political obit for 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: We are going to tell you about unlucky seven. That's the average number of false, misleading statements President Trump has made per day since inauguration. It's also how much he's losing to a certain democrat in a 2020 match -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel very good about the prospects of both taking back the House and Senate in the midterms. Feel very good about the prospects of taking the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: And while it is true that Republicans have an uphill climb in the House, let's not forget that those same experts who are gleefully forecasting the GOP's demise, are the same ones who had egg on their faces on election night. First, in its latest iteration, the RealClearPolitics average of polls about the country's direction finds that more Americans, 41.3 percent, find that Trump is setting us on the right track than at any other moment since December 2012. That's the right track, wrong track. Second, to the idea that Trump's base is shrinking, there is ample evidence to refute that. A brand-new Pew Research poll finds that for most Trump voters, the warm feelings for him -- I love that -- the warm feelings for him over the past couple of years have endured. Furthermore, Trump has many more converts, people who voted for him but didn't like him who have since warmed than those who liked him in 2016 and have \"cooled\" -- I love the warm cooled. And despite the near daily barrage of negative coverage about Mueller, tariffs, immigration, his approval ratings have remain pretty consistent. And they have even improved with his rural base despite the stories were told about the farmers who would turn on him over his aggressive trade policies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNBC HOST: In 19 farm states surveyed by Morning Consults exclusively for CNBC, 10 states saw President Trump's rural approval rating improved between May and the end of July. Seven saw it stayed the same in that period and just one, Idaho, saw a decline. ERIC NELSON, FARMER: I'm a big believer. If you are in a bad deal, be it a lease, be it an agreement with a business partner, you owe it to yourself to step up and try to make it better for both parties and negotiate it. But for sure, it needs to be better for yourself and I think simply that's what this administration is attempting to do. MIKE BEARD, FARM OWNER: We are going to trust that the president will have at least some success in negotiating a trade deal that will support corn, soybeans, and actually everything that the U.S. exports. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Now, despite all the positive trends for the president, there are a few real areas of concern. First, polling trouble spots. A recent NPR?PBS NewsHour/Marist poll reveals that not only do most female voters prefer Democrats this fall, but nearly six in 10 suburban women strongly disapprove of Trump. And that same Pew poll mentioned above also found that women with a college degree are the most likely Trump voters to have soured on him since the election. And finally, a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC poll found that just 36 percent of independents approve of Trump's job, down seven points from just one month earlier. And also distractions. The president must -- let's face it -- keep his eyes on the prize. Check out the complaint of this former Trump supporter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My issue with this president who I voted for is the fact that he has something negative to say about every other leader. But you try saying one little comment that's negative about Trump himself, he jumps into a fit and he has a twitter tirade. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: But don't women think men have thin skins anyway. I mean, come on. Most of us do. No more the president, I think veers off his message. I said this on Monday and waste time reacting to every distraction, whether it's Russia or Stormy Daniels, all and any of these other things, Michael Cohen, Avenatti. The more he risks losing I t think more voters like Mary. The economy is good. It's a period of peace and prosperity. So, women like Trump the protector, the strong guy. They like that. But for the swing voters, he might not seem as charming when it seems like he's fighting everyone at once. They want things to calm down a little. For President Trump, the message is simple. Be the happy warrior we see at a lot of these rallies. Touting the economic resurgence, you can pat yourself on the back a little. The media is not going to do it. The renaissance in manufacturing and talk about how you want the economy to benefit all people -- forgotten Americans of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities like you did this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: One of the single most important things we are doing is to help former inmates in creating jobs. We are creating so many jobs for former inmates for the first time or are really getting a shot at it. Our unemployment rate is so low, historically low, 50 years. Now, our economy is booming. Businesses are hiring and recruiting workers that were previously overlooked. They are being hired. It's a great feeling. It's a great thing that we have all accomplished. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: By the way, prison reform, jobs training, that is vital. It's a vital issue to this country, recidivism. We want to decrease it if we can. And it's an issue that the president is desperately trying to get to yes on, and it might also have the added benefit of helping with some of those discontented voters who are on the fence as well. Finally, Mr. President, don't ignore that right track reading we mentioned at the top. As the \"Washington Post\" wrote ahead of the 2016 election, \"the nation's mood is intrinsically important, providing a basic gauge of how Americans think the country is doing and whether people are more optimistic or pessimistic than in the past. Presidents can succeed or fail regardless of the public's mood, but the public's overall outlook sets the stage for political debate.\" Sets the stage for political debate -- that final line is most important for Trump and Republicans. Use that data point. Draft off that economic success. Be positive about America's current economic standings. It's a great time to be an American. We have problems but my goodness, other than the early years of Reagan, I can't think of a better economy. Set the terms of the debate yourself. Do not be defined by others. We are already on the right track, Mr. President. All you need to do now is not let the wrong track get you sidetracked. And that is \"The Angle.\" Joining us now with the reaction is Garland Nixon, a radio talk show host, Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chair, and Candace Owens, of Turning Point USA. Garland, your reaction. GARLAND NIXON, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Initially, I still -- and I was the person who predicted Trump would win. Here's what I would say, I think the Republicans will have some losses. They will definitely have losses in the midterm because it is kind of like Yelp reviews. The people that are happy tend to kind of mellow out and the people that are really angry are the most motivated and those are the ones that are going to show up and the Democrats are definitely going to have an advantage as far as people who show up at the polls. The question is how much. INGRAHAM: Matt, some of the trends in this last election, in the 12th district of Ohio, yeah, you pull out a victory may be barely by the skin of his teeth, but the turnout for Democrats was very strong. MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: You're right. INGRAHAM: It was stronger I believe than the presidential turnout in the same district where Trump won big. Now, Trump's approval on that district is quite high, so you can say the candidate made some pretty big mistakes. SCHLAPP: He did. INGRAHAM: A couple of verbal gaffes that was really unfortunate. But does that portend other problems? They are jacked up. You know, blame the Democrats. We were excited in 2010. They are excited now. SCHLAPP: I think that right track, wrong track is very important, but let's take a step away from that and look at what happened in the special election and you are exactly right. In the last week or 10 days of that race, his lead collapsed. He said some stupid things. He might need to go to candidate training school which a lot of candidates need to do. But it also shows the motivation and the energy is definitely on the left. And for Trump supporters out there in the country, what they have to understand is the House is very losable and they can't be cavalier about this idea that I am for Trump, but I'll take a skip of the midterm, because if they do, the House could be lost. And if the House is lost, so much of the Trump agenda stops. INGRAHAM: Candace, you know, the president addressed the issue of Chicago today and he talked about how it is so important that we have good leadership, deliver results for the people on the ground. Should he go to Chicago? CANDACE OWENS, TURNING POINT USA: Absolutely. INGRAHAM: Yes, tell us what your thoughts are because there are some Republicans that say oh, it will be a disaster. Remember he was going to go during the campaign and they had to call it off because of protests. But could he go, listen to the people on the ground in Chicago, hear what they have to say? OWENS: Now is absolutely the time for him to make an appearance in Chicago. And first and foremost, Laura, I want to thank you for this coverage of last weekend. You did so much coverage on Chicago. I didn't see it across all the networks by I did see it on your show. INGRAHAM: Thank you. OWENS: It is such an important issue that is facing the black community that is not spoken enough about. He should send the National Guard to Chicago. I mean it's unbelievable. It's incomprehensible to think that 71 people were shot over the weekend and they haven't even caught anybody for these crimes. It's the perfect time. His polling is up in the black community. The Rasmussen poll that was released two weeks ago shows that his support has doubled since this time last year, which means that black people are paying attention to the results of this administration, not so much the rhetoric of the left, accusing him of racism and sexism at every single turn. Now is the time for him to appear in Chicago. President, please do it. INGRAHAM: I mean, we had Obama do his my brother's keeper initiative. We had Al Sharpton moved there temporarily. But there weren't that, you know, you have a murder rate declined but that's only after the really high average of the last few years. Something has to be done in Chicago. I completely agree with Candace. Let's talk about what the Democrats are facing. The Republicans have headwinds. It's not all peachy over in the Democrat side either. This was the new it girl for socialism, the poster child for socialism, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said this yesterday when she was asked by Chris Cuomo about whether Nancy Pelosi is really the leader of the party or will be. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CUOMO, CNN \"CUOMO PRIME TIME\" HOST: Do you recognize her as the leader? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, SOCIALIST: I think absolutely right now, you know, she -- CUOMO: Go ahead please. OCASIO-CORTEZ: -- she is the leader of -- no, no, no, she -- I mean, speaker or rather Leader Pelosi hopefully, you know, we'll see she's the current leader of the party and I think that the party absolutely does have its leadership in the House. We have our leadership in the Senate as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Garland, I think she was more favorable to capitalism the other day in her comments than to Nancy Pelosi. What's going on with this revulsion toward Nancy Pelosi? NIXON: Two things, number one, let's face it, the Democrats have been losing like a bloody heck for the last eight years and it is certainly not unreasonable to question the people who have lead them, you know, to little big horn, but that also -- INGRAHAM: She also got a lot done as speaker. They did Obamacare. They push the big stimulus under Pelosi. NIXON: Well here's the other issue with her, and that is the Democratic Party has understand that their millennial base, which will be the largest voting bloc in 2018 and 2020, have a different concept. They weren't around for the Soviet Union. The word socialism and things like that, that doesn't mean -- INGRAHAM: So they think everything is -- NIXON: It doesn't mean anything to them words. They're listening to policies and listen -- and the Democratic Party needs to understand that because if they get the millennial vote out, they are in really good shape. And if they continue doing what they are doing, and they don't engage that millennial vote and understand them and they just like beat them up and say -- SCHLAPP: Look, the midterm isn't about millennials. The fact is the Republicans have faults, of course. The best thing Republicans have going for them is when people see their dead center heart and soul of the Democratic Party and its radical and it's left and it's socialist -- INGRAHAM: Anti-ICE, they're going to shutdown ICE. We're going to shutdown deportation -- SCHLAPP: Yes. It's our best thing. INGRAHAM: I mean, Candace, this was tonight, Anderson Cooper with Soike Lee. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\" HOST: Would you want to sit down with Donald Trump? SPIKE LEE, FIL DIRECTOR: No. COOPER: And have a conversation? LEE: I don't -- I don't use his name either. He's Agent Orange. COOPER: Do you consider him your president? LEE: No. Might be Putin. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Candace. OWENS: Here's what I will say about that network altogether. What they do all the time is that they employ black athletes and black stars. We saw this with LeBron James the other week to try to -- it's a mechanism of controls of the black community. They say, hey look, I found some of your idols. I've found people that are prominent in your community and they are saying that they hate Trump and they are hoping they're going to be able to drum up that heat. But it hasn't been successful. This isn't working. They need to switch strategies altogether. As I said, it's not going to matter if they keep doing this. They can bring out any black person that they want that's going to speak out against Trump. The black community cares at this moment about results and we are getting the results that we have finally -- we've been begging for these results. We are finally seeing them. Black unemployment at an all-time low. There are jobs. So look. Spike Lee, CNN, it makes sense but it's not coming down I'm really too concerned about. It's not going to impact the black vote for Trump in 2020. INGRAHAM: Yes, I mean, I can't imagine what would, I don't know. I can't imagine what the left would do, what Democrats would say if someone said something akin to what he just said about President Trump. He calls him Agent Orange. He won't use his name. I mean, they went after -- SCHLAPP: He's not his president. INGRAHAM: -- they went after that Joe Wilson for screaming \"You Lie\" during the State Of The Union, right. They crucified that Joe Wilson. NIXON: -- we heard that stuff -- INGRAHAM: Agent Orange? An athlete went on television and called him, agent -- something akin to that he's not my president? I don't (inaudible) not treated like that. At least should be a follow-up. You'd be followed-up with, OK, what about unemployment? What about the fact that a lot of these Democrat-led cities are crumbling with crime and gang violence? What, you know, about the fact that his numbers among black people have gone up? I mean, did hit him with all these things if the other shoe was on the other foot, Garland. I mean, you don't speak like that. I know you wouldn't speak like that. NIXON: No, but we -- but I understand because you know what, for eight years, I heard that. There was like a big \"not my president\" kind of movement. INGRAHAM: Never would I -- I'd never say that. NIXON: (Inaudible). SCHLAPP: He was my president. INGRAHAM: I would never say that. NIXON: You didn't. INGRAHAM: Someone as prominent as Spike Lee who is such a talented filmmaker. His wife was in my class at UVA Law School. NIXON: But I don't -- INGRAHAM: She's a lovely person, but, you know, I just -- NIXON: I don't think it's new but I think what it does reflects, unfortunately, again, this is not good for the Democratic Party. I can sense (ph) the Democratic Party -- SCHLAPP: It is not good. INGRAHAM: Disrespectful. NIXON: -- one angle is to get your people so angry to try to get them to show up. INGRAHAM: But what are they angry about? NIXON: But I think the other part -- INGRAHAM: What are the Democrats angry about except Pelosi? NIXON: What they need to do is they need to develop a platform that is attractive to the working class and that's what they're not -- they are making an error, and they may have some success in 2018 with what they are doing simply because people are upset, but 2020 is a whole different story and if they don't get a platform together then, then they are toast. INGRAHAM: This is Rashida Tlaib who is one of the two socialists approved candidates who Ocasio-Cortez endorsed, who won the other night, a Michigan congressional candidate. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BERMAN, CNN HOST: When you are elected formally in November, you will have a vote as part of the Democratic caucus as to who will be the next Democratic leader, whether it be the minority leader or Speaker of the House. Will you vote for Nancy Pelosi? RASHIDA TLAIB, FORMER MEMBER OF THE MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: Probably not. BERMAN: Probably not. TLAIB: That's my answer. No, probably not. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, so the party moves kind of hard left. I mean, Nancy Pelosi is no conservative Democrat. SCHLAPP: And she's almost 80-years-old, isn't she. (CROSSTALK) SCHLAPP: If they pick up a lot of seats, there is no question that she's going to have competition. But think about this, Nancy Pelosi is one of the most unpopular politicians we've seen in the modern age. It could be Nancy Pelosi or worse. INGRAHAM: Republicans cleaned house. I mean, Republicans got tired of John Boehner, right, Candace. OWENS: Right. INGRAHAM: The Republicans got tired of Boehner. They were tired of him, god bless him. He is now lobbying for pot. So, they got tired of him and he's gone. So what if the Democrats want to get rid of Pelosi? I mean, that's probably smart in a way. Maybe it's smart. SCHLAPP: They'd be (INAUDIBLE). CANDACE: It definitely is smart, but what I think is actually happening here is we are seeing a split in the Democratic Party. We're seeing the people like Nancy Pelosi, the Maxine Waters, they are just driven by hate and animosity for this president. People like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I don't necessarily think she is driven by hate. I think she actually believes that this platform could work, that socialism could work. So the hard left, they are driven by lack of understanding for mathematics and the utopian concept for how the world might work. And unfortunately, this is going to be problematic for them if they can't figure out and get this party together, just the people that hate Trump versus the people that don't understand math. It's going to be extremely problematic for them heading into the midterms. So I'm interested to see what's going to take place. INGRAHAM: Candace, have you been attacked at breakfast lately? What were you eating? What were you eating Candace that had them all upset? Was it pancake or -- OWENS: You know, I had chicken and waffles. It was a really good meal. What's really funny is the manager said -- it was he said, \"I thought for a moment that outside there were vegan protests to my chicken and waffles. INGRAHAM: Oh my gosh. OWENS: They were not vegans. INGRAHAM: Candace, I think by the looks of those -- most of those protesters, god bless them, you could have taken most of them anyway. No problem. OWENS: I think we could have. INGRAHAM: You're pretty tough. All right, great panel, guys. I love having you all on. Now, it sounds like common sense. Permanently deploy more police -- we're talking about Chicago -- and its most ravaged areas. But that new push sparking a huge uproar in the Windy City. Details after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: As violence flares in Chicago, city officials and residents are yet again locking horns over a solution about how to stop it. One Chicago alderman, Anthony Beale from the far south side is leading the charge on what sounds like a kind of common sense solution. Permanently re-assigning officers to the city's most gang ravaged areas. But the proposal is generating huge blowback. Why? Over fears that it could generate a surge in crime in some of the safer districts of Chicago. But is this just another excuse to avoid badly needed radical solutions to stop this carnage? Joining us now to analyze this Horace Cooper, the co-chair of Project 21, along with Anthony Tall, a criminal defense attorney. Now, neither of you are with me in the studio so, we're going to have to deal with that. I wish you were here with me. But let's start with you, Anthony because something has to be done in Chicago. The residents are crying out for solutions. This is one resident, we will play her first. This is -- excuse me, this is a young man. This is one resident today talking with Charlie Kirk. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got to take good care of certain parts of town as we should. They take care of downtown. They take care of the north side. South and west sides are left. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: He was young to me, but he says look, you take care of these, basically, these rich areas, but our areas aren't getting the help. So we have a lot of police being reassigned today through the weekend to these bad areas, but what about that idea of permanently reassigning officers to the worst of the worst areas? Why is that controversial? Either of you can answer. ANTHONY TALL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, I think it's controversial when -- INGHRAHAM: Yes, go ahead. TALL: Yes, well I think it's controversial, Laura, just because what we have in a lot of high policed areas or areas that are policed particularly communities of African-American and Hispanics, is we have over policing where a lot of the innocent people end up getting tagged or pulled aside or stopped unconstitutionally against their Fourth Amendment right. Remember, I have represented gang members in L.A. I've represented gang members who -- and they have the whole community afraid of them. So what we don't need is police coming in doubling the fear if it's not going to be strategically placed and constitutional provisions are not going to be there. There is nothing wrong with permanent policing, but it needs to be constitutional provisions to protect the 98 percent of the community that is not causing the trouble. And that two to three percent that are repeat offenders. INGRAHAM: Yes, the problem is that a small percentage of people are turning those areas upside down. And the carnage over the weekend was just unacceptable. Horace, you know, there is great concern in the black community about aggressive policing that turns innocent people into feeling like criminals and these comments are heartfelt. They are made. You hear them over and over and over again. Yet residents of the south and west sides of Chicago, on camera over the last several days, saying we need help. So there is two competing views here. Where is your -- where do you come down? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Look, these people are living literally in war zones. It is unbelievable that the conversation is being held that grandma can't go and get her prescription filled, that her granddaughter can't get to school without a drive-by shooting, that jobs won't locate in those communities, perpetuating poverty because investors will not go where there is this elevated level of crime. What you need is a common sense idea. The same thing that happens when you are on the interstate, when the officer puts his car prominently on the side of the road, all of a sudden, everybody slows down. Even people who are law-abiding take notice. What we need to do is have an elevated presence of law enforcement in these communities. And it doesn't need to be for a weekend. It doesn't need to be for a few weeks. It needs to be a year, two or three if necessary. That's the way that you can make it safer, and that's the way that this war zone mentality can go away. INGRAHAM: This is what Donald Trump -- TALL: Let me ask you -- INGRAHAM: Hold on. We are going to play a sound bite from President Trump and then you can react on the other side. This was today addressing issues such as prison reform. They even touched on sentencing reform and he touched on Chicago. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We must strengthen community bonds with law enforcement including cities like Chicago that have been an absolute and total disaster -- 63 incidents last weekend and 12 deaths. That's bad stuff happening and probably, I guess you have to take from the leadership. It's called bad leadership. There is no reason in a million years that something like that should be happening in Chicago. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Anthony, he is obviously dinging Rahm Emanuel's leadership in Chicago. Given your background and counsel representing these former gang bangers and so forth, do you think Rahm Emanuel has done a good job? TALL: No, I don't. I think Rahm Emanuel has done a horrible job, but that's not really the point. The point is -- I want to ask Horace, does he really think that with the statistics that we have, where African-Americans are pulled over more without reasonable cause or without probable cause or where they are arrested more often or where they are sentenced harsher. With all of these harsh statistics, do you really want a permanent police force there that's not strategic and that's not following Fourth Amendment rules? And what are you going to do to make sure that those rules are set? That Fourth Amendment reasonable standard that the founders put in there is being followed? I think that's very important. COOOPER: You can hide behind the Fourth Amendment all you want. Here's the fact. Black Americans, particularly in Chicago, are dying as a result of the failure of law enforcement to be welcomed in and to let them play the role that they are capable of doing. Here's what needs to happen. What the mayor needs to do, what the governor of the state needs to do, is create a joint task force where they immediately allow for the state law-enforcement officers to come in. They also need to work with the Department of Justice and they allow for new prosecution teams to come in. You absolutely are going to have to start sweeps. TALL: OK. OK. INGRAHAM: I mean the goal. The goal guys, yes, hold on. The goal -- TALL: Here's the problem with that. INGRAHAM: Go ahead real quick and then we have to close. TALL: Here's the problem with that. There's white people dying in Appalachia, in Kentucky. Why aren't you so concerned about them? They are dying by numbers. I will tell you why. Because when the police come there, they are not going to be over policed as much as African-American and as much as Hispanics. INGRAHAM: Anthony. Anthony. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. COOPER: That is so false. That is so false. INGRAHAM: Hold on. Hold on. Anthony. TALL: That is not false at all. INGRAHAM: Anthony. TALL: Why aren't you concerned about them, Horace? Why aren't you concerned about them? INGRAHAM: Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, hold on. Anthony, we are concerned about all people here on this show. But the Chicago murder rate is still unacceptably high. TALL: I know you are, Laura. INGRAHAM: It's higher than New York. It's higher than Los Angeles. It has to change. I think we all want that. We differ on how to get there, but we all want it to change. We don't want people pulled over unnecessarily. We don't want people's constitutional rights violated. Sometimes the police will probably pull someone over and it won't be fair. I understand that happens, and that's terrible. But if you can save lives this weekend and every weekend in the summer and beyond with smarter policing, with smarter community involvement, maybe President Trump can offer some solutions with other faith-based leaders, that's a good thing. And I think we all have to get out of our corners and come together and get back to basics in all parts of the country where we are having problems. Whether it's opioids, Chicago, Burlington, Vermont where they have a huge drug trade. We have got to get together as a country and solve it, because otherwise we're just going to keep losing Americans unnecessarily. Anthony. TALL: Yes, I agree with all of that. I don't want the environment of police being there to create more criminals, incarcerate more people, and those people go back into the community and create more crime. That's what I want to safeguard against. There's nothing wrong with that. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Those talking points are killing people. There is a small number of people in these communities that are creating a nightmarish existence. INGRAHAM: Guys. COOPER: These people need to be pulled out of the circle. INGRAHAM: They've got to be taken out of the community, they've got to be incarcerated. And if not, we are going to see kids on bicycles killed again as we did last weekend. All right, guys, great segment. Thanks so much. And Jeff Sessions is taking on one of conservative speech's biggest enemies. We will tell you what it is when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: In an important speech that garnered very little attention, Attorney General Jeff Sessions condemned one of the biggest foes of conservative speech, the Southern Poverty Law Center. The far left organization is notorious for labeling those not aligned with its radical agenda as a hate group. And in a very, very important address to the Alliance Defending Freedom Organization yesterday, the attorney general did not mince words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I spoke to ADF last year, I learned the Southern Poverty Law Center had classified ADF as a hate group. Many in the media simply parroted that is a fact. They've used this designation as a weapon, and they have wielded it against conservative organizations, others than ADF, that refuse to accept their orthodoxy and choose instead to speak for their conscience. I wanted to come back here tonight partially because I wanted to say this. You are not a hate group. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Joining us now with reaction, Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and RNC committeewoman for California, does a lot of civil-rights representation, along with Joe Alioto Veronese. He's a civil rights attorney himself. Great to see both of you. Joe, let's start with you. The Southern Poverty Law Center, cited by the mainstream media as an unbiased organization that's a national treasure because it points out the bad people. And there are a lot of bad people. White nationalist, Nazi groups, that type of person. But then they also label with the hate label people like Ben Carson who was put on an extremist watch list. The Israeli ambassador dinner with Frank Gaffney, they urged the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, not to attend a dinner hosted by this guy Frank Gaffney who has views on Islamism and so forth. Center for Immigration Studies done enormous research on immigration. And of course the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group I have spoken to before, that litigated cases. Most recently I think the wedding cake case at the Supreme Court involving the baker in the gay couple. What's going on here? If you disagree with the Southern Poverty Law Center, you are suddenly a hater? JOE ALIOTO VERONESE: First of all, I wouldn't agree with the fact that they are unbiased. Of course they are biased to their own position, but that's what's so great about the First Amendment is that they are allowed to do that. The problem here is that the attorney general is using the office of the attorney general to suppress First Amendment rights of these organizations in the name of religious freedom, which is yet another constitutional right. So that's a real problem because people look at the attorney general as an office that should instill confidence in the government's allowing you to enjoy your constitutional rights. And in here he's using one constitutional right against the other and basically starting political wildfires. INGRAHAM: I think it is the opposite. I think he is actually saying religious freedom, which is defended by the Alliance Defending Freedom, is a sacrosanct right. And just for defending religious freedom, labeling someone as a hater and a hate group, Harmeet, that probably hurts their fundraising. It probably hurts any corporate association they have. The label is meant to demonetize individuals, corporations, pulling back, and associations. You see it on big tech, what they are doing with the suppression of conservative speech. And this is a different way to do it. Harmeet? HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: Absolutely. I like my friend Joe, but he's upside down. What has been happening in the government is that the government has been using and partnering with Southern Poverty Law Center's list to suppress speech and target groups. So it's only recently that the attorney general called it out, but the FBI is continuing to partner with the National Organization of Women, Southern Poverty Law Center, NAACP, and other groups. And SPLC is about as objective as Antifa. They are a far left organization, and it's a disgrace that the government is using their imprimatur to silence speech. The real effects of this, Laura, are, for example, earlier, a couple years ago the Family Research Council was actually shot up in D.C. by an attacker trying to kill people there because that group was on the SPLC list. INGRAHAM: That's right. I forgot that. DHILLON: And in Silicon Valley, like you mentioned, the effect of this is that matching programs and corporations where corporations will say if you give money to a charity like Alliance Defending Freedom, an outstanding Christian First Amendment law firm, they will not match it if the organization is on that list. And on top of that, Amazon will not match contributions in their Smile program if the SPLC has put it on their hate list. So who made these people, the Soros funded and the far left organization the arbiter of what is correct speech in America and not. So it's fine for them, Joe, to have their viewpoint, but it's also fine for us to fight back. It's not fine for the government to use their false list as a weapon to attack citizens. INGRAHAM: They have a half-a-billion dollar budget. They get a lot of money from a lot of rich people. Joe, my point is they would rather label people haters then have a debate about the underlying subject. I live that every day. People don't want to debate you because they lose on the facts, so they want to label you things. That's not American. Have the debate. Have the debate vigorously. Don't label people haters accept the ones who should be labeled haters like the white nationalists and the Nazis. VERONESE: But labeling people haters is part of their First Amendment right. And there are far right groups who have a have-a-billion dollars as well. The real problem here is that the attorney general is using his office to pit one constitutional right against the other. And where does that end, right? You could look at a lot of religions and make the claim that they have some sort of hate speech. We shouldn't be doing this. The attorney general should be uniting people here in the United States. But the reality is, he's a darling of the confederacy. INGRAHAM: What does that mean? DHILLON: That is not fair. INGRAHAM: I think that is poisonous. Joe. VERONESE: If you look to his voting record, there are views there that are anti-LGBT, that are anti-immigrant. Of course there are. This is known stuff. INGRAHAM: Once again, if you believe in border enforcement and legal immigration reforms, you are anti-immigrant. VERONESE: No. I don't believe that either. INGRAHAM: People rejected that in 2016. They don't like being called that, because when you say that, that means the Trump voters are anti- immigrant, and they are not. They're good people. They're always bad elements in groups, but they're overwhelming good people. So guys, we're out of time. Great segment, as always. And by the way, an Atlanta school is facing an uproar after trying to ditch the Pledge of Allegiance. We have some breaking news on this story. Stay there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROWD: -- to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (END VIDEO CLIP) INGRAHAM: Well, well, an Atlanta charter school is reeling tonight after having announced it was going to ditch the Pledge of Allegiance from their morning agenda. According to the Atlanta neighborhood charter school, it made its decision due to the more and more students and staff choosing not to recite or stand during the pledge in recent years. The announcement sparked a storm of controversy, as you can imagine, and tonight the school announced it is backtracking on its decision. But could be seen more schools across the country trying the same move? Joining us now with reaction, University of Maryland professor Jason Nichols, back by popular demand, along with writer and clinical analyst Carrie Sheffield. Jason, they are backtracking and saying that you can see that pledge or say the school cheer or something like that. but what does it say about us that this is a controversy? I am almost wanting to treat this as something hilarious because I think those kids reciting the pledge is so cute and I remember doing it as a kid. It wasn't controversial. It was what you did. Why are we here? DR. JASON NICHOLS, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: I think it's controversial because they want to unify the kids at the beginning of the morning, and they feel that the pledge, there are many kids that opt out. I can remember when I was a kid, there were kids that were Jehovah's Witnesses and they didn't recite the pledge. Sometimes they would go to a separate room. And they really want to build community, and they think this is getting in the way of that. Of course I have to throw my dig in there and say that if you are against this and if you have a problem with this, then you probably have a problem with Betsy DeVos and our secretary of education who is trying to move more towards charter schools who get to take public funding but make their own rules. INGRAHAM: This is a charter school. NICHOLS: This is a charter school. INGRAHAM: So you find saying the pledge, requiring that, your view is that that's divisive? NICHOLS: I'm not saying that's divisive, but I do think there are many people who opt out. That is their First Amendment rights. INGRAHAM: They can do that. But they can say one nation, and they don't have to say under God. A lot of people don't say under God and they go on. I don't remember this being a controversy. They just say one nation. Indivisible with liberty and justice. Apparently people do still do believe in liberty and justice or is that also controversial? NICHOLS: Because some people just feel it's better if they're not a part of it. And that's their First Amendment right. CARRIE SHEFFIELD, NATIONAL EDITOR, ACCURACY IN MEDIA: I have got to take issue with what you just said about charter schools, because if anything that shows how responsive charter schools are, because imagine if a public school sector, public union backed teachers, when they try to make changes and there's public accountability, public outcry, nothing happens. So this is actually a case in point, showing the agility of charters. And so I applaud that. And yes, I am very pro-charter, and it upsets me to see something that something that was a charter school was antifreedom, because charters to me equals freedom. So I am glad that they have done the right thing. But look, Laura, I think this speaks to the broader issue of trying to turn people against each other, trying to tear at our social fabric against things that represent the United States of America. And no one, including Martin Luther King Jr., would sit here and tell you if he were alive today, but he knew that we were working toward a more perfect union. And when you try to shut down the Pledge of a Allegiance, that's opposite of building a union. INGRAHAM: I think we should just do jumping jacks instead, push-ups. Can we say just drop and give me 50. Wouldn't that be better? Michelle Obama is about let's move. I am all for that. I would like to use the exercise of the beginning of the day. I also wanted your thoughts on this. This is something, I have teachers in my family, private school, and just recently retired public school. And should cell phones be allowed or banned from school classrooms? Countries like France are putting government mandated bans on cell phones for elementary and middle school students on their campuses. But more U.S. cities like Boise, Idaho, are doing the exact opposite and lifting cell phone bans from their students. Jason? NICHOLS: This was a tough one for me. INGRAHAM: Come on, professor. Do you want them to be on their phone? It's annoying. NICHOLS: I definitely don't, I definitely don't'. It is totally annoying, and I know that it can be disruptive sometimes. But at the same time, as we have seen with some of the school shootings and things that have been going on, cell phones have really helped in those situations to call the police in an emergency. So I understand why they would want to have those cell phones there. But also cell phones have encouraged a lot of bullying and fights and things like that. Nobody -- INGRAHAM: How about cheating? Have you caught anybody cheating using a cell phone? NICHOLS: I haven't. I haven't. Maybe I'm just bad at catching people. INGRAHAM: You haven't caught anybody? How many times during average class do you see student looking down at her phone, checking Facebook, how many times? NICHOLS: I can't even count. INGRAHAM: They could be listening to your lecture, following, taking notes. Instead, they are on their phone. It's not good for learning. It's fun, you can play games, but during the class, focus on the professor. NICHOLS: I agree. During class, they shouldn't have it. INGRAHAM: Have it in your locker. Have it in your locker. NICHOLS: Have it in your bag. SHEFFIELD: I am inclined, whatever the French say to do, we should do the opposite. INGRAHAM: Come on. SHEFFIELD: For that fact alone, I say embrace the cell phone. And also in cases of emergency, absolutely. And Laura, you said take notes. I take notes on my cell phone. INGRAHAM: OK, Carrie, you are a young woman. But do you remember or not being 14 and you've got the boys in the first row. They are texting each other. In high school and junior high, do you remember? NICHOLS: I am a little older. INGRAHAM: Do you remember? SHEFFIELD: Laura, isn't the difference that it's just updated, because you would send paper notes. INGRAHAM: I think it's less distracting. Do you like me, check box one. SHEFFIELD: I think it's more distracting. INGRAHAM: It's like, yes, no, I will think about it. NICHOLS: If you have your laptop out, you probably don't need your cell phone as well to take notes. INGRAHAM: Guys, fantastic conversation. But I think it happens more than you are even admitting in your classes. They are all on their phones. NICHOLS: Definitely. I agree. INGRAHAM: Do tell them ever to put them down? NICHOLS: It says in the syllabus to silence your phone, keep it in your bag. INGRAHAM: They are on their laps. You are making important point. It's like in the movies. You're watching a really important, and then the glow. Put them away. SHEFFIELD: That's what I'm more worried about. I'm more worried about teachers not enforcing it, teachers trying to be buddy-buddy with their students rather than enforcing the discipline. That's what I'm more worried about. INGRAHAM: OK, guys, thanks so much. And the media and liberals attempt to understand Trump supporters, it kind of failed a lot. And one professor may have finally discovered why. He joins us next. A lot of professors next, with details. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: No matter how hard they try, liberals and their media brethren still just can't seem to figure out Trump supporters and their loyalty to the president. But Musa Al-Gharbi, a sociology professor at Columbia University, may have figured out why they keep getting it so wrong. He was on radio this morning, and now he joins us with more. Professor, good to see you. Thanks for being on in the morning and at night. You're doing double duty, really appreciate it. So what is going on here with some of the polling and some of the research that you've been able to cull through? PROF. MUSA AL-GHARBI, SOCIOLOGIST, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: So there is a few things that we see in a lot of the studies that are intended to understand the 2016 election. The main problems seem to be things like prejudicial study design. So a survey will ask a question like, what motivated Trump voters? Is it that their more racist or sexist or ignorant rather than any kind of balanced or positive attributes that could have possibly motivated to vote for who they did. And of course there is no surveys about why would someone vote for Hillary Clinton? Is it because they are anti- American? So there's this sort of prejudicial study design is a big problem. And then there are sometimes just glaring errors, like inferential errors, statistical errors that somehow get through by people who know better and by editors who know better. And they are cited by other people who know better. Not on purpose. I don't think it's a cynical thing. I think for the most part it's just an issue where the studies are confirming something, a view of the world, that they strongly believe and want to believe. And so these kinds of errors can creep in and get unnoticed. INGRAHAM: And then once one study is published or one poll, it just gets repeated, paraphrased in another website and another and another and another. I want to show for our viewers what we are talking about specifically. One particular question illustrates your point. And you're not a fan of the president, we should say. You're not a rah-rah Trump supporter. In fact, the opposite. Question, this is a CNN/SSRS poll. Question, which of the following do you think is more important? Imposing tariffs on imports from foreign countries to protect certain U.S. industries, 25 percent, maintaining good relations with countries that have been close allies of the U.S. for many years? Of course people are going to say that 63 percent. Both equally, no opinion. So that's a problem because, professor? AL-GHARBI: Yes, absolutely. That result you got there was probably the result of what we call a framing effect. For instance, if they rephrased the question something like do you support -- like maintaining, like protecting the U.S. economy or U.S., critical service, critical U.S. manufacturing. INGRAHAM: It's a phrasing issue. This is just classic prejudicial framing issue. When you say maintaining good relations countries that have been close, that's just a biased way to frame it. It's so obvious when you read it. Also something we want to get to, just really quickly, the pairing of Donald Trump with racism on the Google searches. Donald Trump-white supremacy, Donald Trump-xenophobia, 10,000 results, 2,300 results, 3,000 results. Why is that a problem in 15 seconds, professor? AL-GHARBI: What's astonishing is it takes a long time to publish anything in an academic journal. Half a year, a year. So the fact that just since 2016 there were these tens of thousands of studies that were published, all of them having the same -- if you survey the abstracts and titles of these works, they all tell the same story. Trump voters were racist, motivated by -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) INGRAHAM: Tomorrow night, we have a fantastic show. The U.S. attorney in Philadelphia will join us, to tell us why the city's sanctuary policies are so dangerous and what he says is also un-American. So you don't want to miss that. Thanks for watching tonight, as always, our loyal viewers. Catch me on the radio tomorrow morning. Until tomorrow night, stay safe. Be sure to check me out on Twitter and Facebook.

            "article_content": "capitol building in washington dc with us flag (iStock) What does Memorial Day bring to mind? Those who have served in the armed forces, for sure \u2013 especially when that hallowed group of people includes men and women we have known and loved. But there's something beyond that \u2013 something that touches every single one of us, regardless of personal ties to our military. And that is the cause that people in the military served: America. As an immigrant to the U.S., I think often about this country that I've joined and what makes it special. I'm constantly trying to learn about it \u2013 to absorb the stories of America's founding, its struggles, its character, its triumphs and its faults. No other country, it seems to me, is at the same time so exuberantly confident and deeply self-critical \u2013 and that's a source of incredible strength. That's how you make a union more perfect over time. If there's one thing that defines America for me, it's the ideal of freedom \u2013 the notion of liberty under the law that underpins everything else. But liberty is not just a question of law. It's a question of behavior too, and it seems as if America today is in danger of losing something incomparably precious: the habit of freedom. I'm talking about the freedom to think and speak your mind. More and more, I meet people who tell me they are frightened to say what they think, frightened to get into conversations about politics or current events. They are frightened to exercise their freedom. There once was a time when the left was the champion of freedom. Think back to the 1960s and the fights for women's liberation and civil rights, the incredible explosion of creativity in music and fashion and art. But we can see now that not all the consequences of these 1960s movements were positive \u2013 especially when you look at the social and economic impacts of the breakdown of the family, Whatever your view of these revolutionary changes, we can all agree that they represented a powerful and heartfelt expression of freedom. And many of those revolutions were driven by young people, who were overwhelmingly on the left. The left was instinctively on the side of freedom. But look where the left is today. Why are more and more people in America frightened to say what they think, frightened to express themselves and exercise their freedom? It's not because of President Trump \u2013 quite the opposite. People aren't exactly holding back when it comes to expressing opinions about our president. It's not conservatives, or libertarians, or Republicans who are clamping down on freedom of thought and expression. It's the left. And it's frightening. Instead of standing for freedom as it once did, the left in America today stands for control. Those on the left are the new Puritans, marching around telling everybody off for the way they behave. You know what it's like \u2013 everyone does. Everyone has experienced it. You can barely say a word about anything remotely contentious these days without some joyless leftist martinet popping off about your words being unsafe, or triggering or culturally appropriated, or whatever the latest Orwellian epithet is about sexism or racism or some other awful ism or phobia. Of course, sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are wrong. But the way you fight those things is through judicious, thoughtful and considered activism. Not the brain-dead mind control tactics of the new Puritans on the left. And the left today is not just puritanical. It's tyrannical. Left-wingers tell you what you're allowed to think, what you're allowed to do, what you're allowed to say. Not just on university campuses, as has been reported for years now. But in the workplace. In our children's schools. Throughout corporate America. We hear the whole time from the left that people on the right \u2013 President Trump or Brexit supporters in particular \u2013 are xenophobic. But I've never heard a Trump or Brexit supporter try to shut down the thought or speech of people who think or speak differently than them \u2013 the way that the left does today. That's what xenophobia means. It's a suspicion of people who are different. The left today cannot countenance anyone or anything that is different. This new puritanism of the left is imposed with utmost brutality, in true authoritarian style \u2013 something I know well from the way my family was treated in Communist Hungary. If you transgress you are shamed, punished and destroyed. The left talks endlessly about diversity and then proceeds to crush the most important diversity of all, the diversity that is the foundation of human progress \u2013 diversity of thought. There is no freedom of thought, of speech, of anything on the left these days \u2013 only conformity. A miserable, joyless conformity as the new Puritans impose their intolerant, bigoted, narrow-minded worldview on everybody else. The left\u2019s new Puritans are making sweeping advances through our culture and institutions. They are in the process of taking over the Democratic establishment and imposing their authoritarian ideology on the party that once proudly stood for freedom. The Puritans will most likely nominate one of their own as their presidential candidate in 2020. And they will deservedly lose. Because Americans love freedom. They hate being told what to do and how to think. That's why America was founded in the first place. It's why America became the greatest nation in the history of the world. It's what the Americans who served in the armed forces fought for. Young people especially cherish freedom. They especially hate being told what to do. That's why I'm confident that at some point there will be a revolt against the new Puritans on the left, and against their authoritarianism and intolerance. So while the Democrats might think their Puritan takeover is good politics today, it will come back and bite them in the end. Because the instinct for freedom is deep and strong in America and the left's authoritarian tide will be turned one day. We'll be debating this on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d with our guests, including Candace Owens. Hope you can join us!",

            "article_content": "House minority leader sarcastically praises the unemployment rate dropping to an 18-year low; reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' Until recently it was possible to discern a policy-based ideology of elitism. It was the establishment consensus around the benefits of globalization, automation, centralization and uncontrolled immigration. Over the past few decades, this elitist policy agenda was implemented regardless of actual election outcomes. Republicans and Democrats alike encouraged trade deals and financial deregulation that replaced corporate America\u2019s primarily local and national economic outlook with a global one. Technology was unleashed on the American workplace with no thought given to the wrenching transition this would cause and the massive scale of retraining needed to enable our workforce to cope with it. Political decision-making slipped from the hands of citizens to distant and unaccountable politicians and bureaucrats, as power was centralized at the federal level. A parallel centralization took place in the economy, as over-permissive antitrust policy allowed businesses to get bigger and bigger, reducing competition in sector after sector. And immigration was allowed to increase without limit, undoubtedly bringing its traditional benefits by adding to America\u2019s rich history of innovation and entrepreneurship \u2013 but now featuring a dark side too, as the mass importing of cheap labor undercut American workers. This elitist ideology brought enormous benefits to the elite themselves: astonishing increases in wealth, booming urban centers, a fabulous quality of life for those fortunate enough to be part of the new \u201cknowledge economy.\u201d But for those outside the elite \u2013 the 80 percent or so of Americans who were the victims of elitism \u2013 the result was less positive. Incomes went down and jobs went away. The social fabric was torn by community disintegration and family breakdown. People lost faith in government, politics \u2013 the whole system. They could see that it was working for those with power, not for everyone. This is what led to the populist revolution that helped elect Donald Trump. And the elite\u2019s reaction has been remarkably instructive. Instead of questioning the components of their ideology, looking for new policies that would help working Americans \u2013 or supporting those of the Trump administration designed to do just that \u2013 establishment Democrats and Republicans have united around a new elitist ideology. This time, the ideology has nothing to do with policy. The new elitist ideology is personal, visceral, emotional. It starts with selfishness. Because they have benefited so tremendously from the status quo, those in the establishment portray any attempt to change the status quo as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdisruptive.\u201d Just look at the hysterical reaction to President Trump\u2019s new trade strategy, or his administration\u2019s tough stance on immigration (not even tough enough for some, by the way). These measures are presented by the elite as unconscionable assaults on the founding principles of America. But in reality these are simply policy changes that favor the interests of working people over the rich. The elitists gussy up defense of their personal financial gain in the garb of morality and principle, but in the end it\u2019s just pure selfishness. The next component of the new elitist ideology is bigotry. How many times have you heard elitists condemn populist movements for their alleged \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201cxenophobia?\u201d Let\u2019s remind ourselves what xenophobia means. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: \u201cfear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty perfect description of the view of Donald Trump\u2019s voters \u2013 around half the country, let\u2019s remember \u2013 that emerges from the texts of senior FBI officials published this week in the report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on the Clinton email investigation. For example, one of the texts says: \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters are all poor to middle class, lazy, uneducated POS (pieces of s---).\u201d And this: \u201cJust went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support.\u201d And of course you don\u2019t need private texts to tell you how the elitists feel about Trump supporters. Hillary Clinton told us loud and proud in her \u201cdeplorables\u201d speech \u2013 and on many occasions since the election as she trundles around the world blaming everyone except herself for her defeat. But perhaps the defining characteristic of the new elitist ideology \u2013 the one that truly brings them all together: from establishment Republicans in Congress, to the intellectually fossilized conservative \u201cintelligentsia,\u201d to the media overlords comfortably ensconced in their affluent hipster enclaves, to the arrogant tech titans of Silicon Valley, to the preposterous and vain Hollywood virtue-signalers like poor old Robert De Niro \u2013 is hatred of President Trump. Their brand is hate. They say that President Trump is undermining democratic norms. But they continue to illegitimize a president duly elected according to the Constitution. They don\u2019t really care about democratic norms, they just hate President Trump. They say that President Trump is mounting an assault on the \u201crule of law.\u201d But they fawn over James Comey, who Inspector General Horowitz reports went rogue when he was director of the FBI, subverting all proper checks and balances and putting himself above the law. The elites don\u2019t really care about the rule of law, they just hate President Trump. The elites condemn the president for his warm treatment of the dictator of a brutal regime \u2013 but they\u2019ve been sucking up to a far worse regime for years. China may not be qualitatively worse than North Korea but quantitatively there is much more cruelty and human rights abuse there. At least in President Trump\u2019s case, the motive was avoiding nuclear war. The elite\u2019s China suck-up was just about greed. Members of the elite don't care about the proper conduct of foreign policy. They just hate President Trump. Look at comedian Bill Maher \u2013 saying out loud what every establishment Democrat and Republican is thinking, hoping for bad news on the economy so President Trump can\u2019t claim credit for turning it round. Look at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finding a way to spin every piece of good news as a negative. Look further afield \u2013 at German Chancellor Angela Merkel trying to spin a positive moment at the G-7 summit into a negative one by tweeting that misleading photo of her and President Trump to make is appear as if they were having an argument. There is nothing \u2013 not more jobs, not higher incomes, not even less risk of nuclear war \u2013 that matters more to these elitists than their unhinged hatred of Donald Trump and everything and everyone he stands for. That is the new and baleful ideology of the elite: selfishness, bigotry and hate. We\u2019ll be debating all this on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d on the Fox News Channel with a fantastic line-up of Kimberly Guilfoyle, Jason Chaffetz and Ann Coulter. Hope you can join us!",

            "article_content": "White House defended the president's tweets, while some Democrats insist Trump is at least partly to blame for the anger and political divisions in the country. John Roberts reports from 'Special Report.' Celebrities, spin and vicious attacks on President Trump and Republicans made for a predictable week in the anti-Trump media as Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections approach. Many journalists blamed President Trump for everything going wrong, but didn\u2019t give him credit for the good economy or any of his other accomplishments. In the past week, the president was depicted as a \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d whipping up \u201cxenophobia\u201d and promoting \u201cthe divisive issue of immigration.\u201d (Notice how immigration is only divisive when you expect people to obey laws.) THE HYPOCRITICAL NEW YORK TIMES HITS A NEW LOW (AND OTHER LIBERAL MEDIA OUTRAGES THIS WEEK) Journalistic extremism was easy to find. \u201cHate is on the Ballot,\u201d warned New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, claiming the GOP \u201chas increasingly become the party of right-wing extremists.\u201d He followed that up by claiming that \u201cgood people can\u2019t be good Republicans.\u201d Civility and all that. Appearing on MSNBC, New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay complained about the \u201creality\u201d that Trump is a \u201cwhite nationalist president who is a threat to American democracy.\u201d The Times wants voters to \u201cput country over party\u201d by doing what the Times always wants voters to do \u2013 go left. Gay\u2019s fellow panelists on MSNBC agreed and went to even greater extremes. Bloomberg Opinion Editor Tim O\u2019Brien repeated Gay\u2019s critique, adding that the president \u201chas been a bigot and a white nationalist for a long time.\u201d Trump even \u201ckept a book of Hitler\u2019s speeches on the nightstand by his bed,\u201d according to O\u2019Brien. Over at CNN, Chris Cuomo blamed Republicans for a \u201ccampaign message\u201d of \u201cfear and loathing.\u201d He went on to blast President Trump for depicting the immigrant caravans as \u201can invading force filled with dealers and murderers\u201d so the president can \u201cwhip up as much xenophobia and conflict as he can.\u201d Cuomo summed it up as a \u201cmidterm hate campaign.\u201d That sounds suspiciously like a description of MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski\u2019s rant about the president. Here\u2019s just one line: \u201cThe rhetoric of this racist, heartless, soulless man will lead to more violence.\u201d It all fit a theme \u2013 scaring the voters about President Trump and Republican candidates up for election. \u201cTrump goes all-in on the fear factor,\u201d warned NBC \u201cToday\u201d co-host Savannah Guthrie. NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd blamed President Trump for setting both the \u201ctone\u201d and the \u201crules\u201d of our divisive politics. Todd acted clueless about the causes for the current state of the nation, saying that \u201cwe have a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play in dealing with it.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the narrative sinking in with voters. According to a Politico poll, 64 percent say that the media have \u201cdone more to divide than unite the country.\u201d That\u2019s 8 percent higher than those who blamed President Trump. So much for journalism\u2019s victim narrative. But there was light at the end of the tunnel \u2013 a shining beacon of hope: Oprah Winfrey. NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt oohed and aahed about Winfrey hitting the campaign trail for Democrats. Holt told viewers: \u201cIt's got a lot of people asking, is Oprah also reconsidering a potential run for president?\u201d The next morning, \u201cToday\u201d show correspondent Peter Alexander continued to hype Democrats\u2019 \u201cstar-powered inspiration.\u201d Left unsaid was how Winfrey\u2019s biggest support comes from the news media. They had to be disappointed when she admitted she doesn\u2019t want to run for president. It\u2019s been a disastrous campaign season and it\u2019s unlikely the news media will learn anything good from it. Maybe ordinary voters understand something journalists don\u2019t \u2013 that they have a right to fair coverage. That journalists should cover all the news, not just the stories that help their friends. Here are a few they skipped (Gosh, I wonder why): Democratic candidate for the Senate in Arizona, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema mocked the people of her state as \u201ccrazy\u201d; and Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana made what The Washington Post called a \u201ccringe-worthy and puzzling\u201d racial statement about his staffers. Count your blessings. Election 2020 will make this look like a checkers tournament. 2. Don\u2019t Leave Out Hollywood: Celebrities hate to miss a party, especially the Democratic Party. An imminent midterm election brought them out in droves, both on TV and in person. They echoed the journalistic call for civility. \u201cBabe\u201d star James Cromwell blasted our \u201cnascent fascism.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop (Trump) now, we will have a revolution for real. Then there will be blood in the streets,\u201d he warned. Apparently, Cromwell has been reading sitcom show credits. \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d ended with one of Chuck Lorre\u2019s signature \"vanity card\" statements calling the president \"a fascist, hate-filled, fear-mongering, demagogic, truth-shattering, autocratic golf cheater.\" Subtle. Using TV shows to push the election was commonplace this past week. The end credits for \u201cThis Is Us\u201d promoted the left-wing, anti-gun group Everytown for Gun Safety, funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Both \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and Sarah Silverman\u2019s \u201cI Love You, America\u201d tried their own tilted get-out-the-vote push. Silverman\u2019s show mocked Christians with a \u201cpansexual Jesus\u201d who was getting ready to vote. He was snidely anti-Trump. \u201cWe live in a nation where they\u2019ll let a Middle Eastern guy into their hearts but not into the country,\u201d he commented, while pointing to himself. 3. Blaming Trump, Conservatives for the Massacre: It didn\u2019t take long for the media to blame President Trump for the horrible attack at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue. It didn\u2019t matter that former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the ambassador of Israel and the former head of the Ant-Defamation League all said not to blame the president. He was still the media\u2019s \u201cmoral monster.\u201d The two most outlandish comments both came from CNN. GQ magazine correspondent Julia Ioffe made an offensive claim, saying that \u201cthis president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did.\u201d She nominally apologized for it at the end of the show, but that was hardly a legitimate excuse. CNN Anchor Don Lemon (he\u2019s \u201cindependent,\u201d in case you hadn\u2019t heard) used a broader brush for his attack. Lemon lashed out against \u201cwhite men\u201d while pretending to urge people not to demonize one another. \u201cSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right, and we have to start doing something about them,\u201d Lemon said. Those were hardly the only examples. CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota accused Trump of \u201cusing some of the same language that the mass murderer at the synagogue used.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-host Norah O\u2019Donnell echoed that attack, charging the president with \u201cspecifically using the word \u2018invader,\u2019 which is also a word that the Pittsburgh shooter used.\u201d ABC\u2019s quasi-former Clintonian anchor George Stephanopoulos rattled off several examples of violence and then placed President Trump \u201cat the center,\u201d \u201cagainst the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times.\u201d But ABC isn\u2019t biased. Or so I\u2019ve heard. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAN GAINOR",

            "article_content": "Ken Graham of the National Hurricane Center updates Hurricane Florence's track, fears higher rainfall totals as Category 2 storm slows down. This is a rush transcript from \"The Five,\" September 13, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SHEPARD SMITH, FOX NEWS: \"The Five\" coming up in a moment. I'm Shepard Smith, live in the Fox News deck, about to get a brand-new update from the National Hurricane Center on Hurricane Florence. The storm now has maximum winds of 100 miles per hour. Maximum storm surge predictions are now 11 feet instead of 13, so that's great. Problem is it's moving very slowly now, just 5 miles an hour. For all of the details, let's get right to the National Hurricane Center for a live update. Here's Ken Graham: KEN GRAHAM, NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER: Well, welcome back to National Hurricane Center. I stand once again here in operations. This is Ken Graham with the 5 p.m. update for Hurricane Florence. The latest information still is at 100 miles per hour, but a 100 miles east-south east of Willington, slowing down as we have advertise, moving north -northwest at 5 miles an hour and still pretty large storm. And I want to point at the radar here as we're trying to not focus necessarily, always on the center of this point, but really try to look at these outer bands with time because that's where you kind of have some of your strongest winds. And I want to take you to the seater island as we see in the radar as this location. We can see the water levels already coming up with that flow coming off of the water, pushing the water in, actually, in this case, across the bay. Look how the steepness of the water already starting to come up, so we're trying to see that storm surge enter into the area, and that's what we've been talking about being safe about because that's a dangerous components of these hurricanes. Take a look at the latest forecast. This is the updated one that we've been working on here, still seeing these winds stretching far away from the center, but with time really slowing down. You know we have 2 p.m. on Friday, 2 a.m. on Saturday, 2 p.m. on Saturday -- look, it's just absolutely amazing how slow this is and is going and that's going to compound some of the issues that we have and that's what we've been talking about the slowness continuing to have these impacts. And speaking of the impacts, we're really look at this -- let's look at the rainfall totals, we've been talking about that all day long, some of these totals, 20 to 30 inches, some isolated areas you could see 40 inches of rain. And even inland, you'll start seeing location 10 to 15 inches of rain, 15 to 20 staggering amounts of rain, well inland. We've get a lot of questions about how far inland this extent could be. Look at Charlotte, places like Charlotte and Raleigh still getting 6 to 10 inches of rain, even up to Virginia, 4 to 6 inches in Ashville. And some of those locally -- could be a lot higher than that, depending on how the system is set up and the movement of the remnants the hurricane continues to make its way in landfall. So we've got to watch that for mudslides. We've got to watch that for flash flooding. You know, this could be a really serious situation in a lot of these areas with flooding. One of the things we always talk about is the storm surge. It's something that we've just updated. This is actually the brand new one that we have. We've been talking about some of these values, especially on the right side of the system where the onshore flow of the storm flow a lot of that water inland. The rise -- the longer we keep the storm around you get a large rise of water inland. And sometimes they can stretch several miles inland. So we've got to watch out for that. But look at some of these values in -- right around South Carolina, 4 to 6 feet, and these are the updated numbers, 7 to 11 feet just a staggering amount of water, very dangerous and even moving. Look how far this is away from the center of the storm. You still see these large values, 6 to 9 feet, getting into areas. You know, looking at Newbern where we already see -- starting to see some of these water levels rise, and eventually -- especially where places where this water gets trapped. The longer we have the winds the further inland some of those storm surge values could get, where the water gets trap. Look how far north we get. You know, we have the center of the storm here. We're looking at the northern part of North Carolina still getting 2 to 4 feet of storm. So we're going to be keeping an eye on this. All of the aspects of this storm right here at the National Hurricane Center. We're getting through it with you, and we've got to be safe from this water. This has been Ken Graham here from the operations area. SMITH: Ken, thanks very much. Let's get straight to the beach now, our Leland Vittert is live, Atlanta Beach, north and east of Wilmington. Leland. LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS: Shepard, the max winds we've gotten here are just about 75 miles an hour. So those outer bands are starting to really make their affects felt here. You're getting that sand blast of -- the beach sand coming across combine with the rain, combine with the wind out on the beach. And you're also starting to see the damage around this island. Roofs are starting to come off. Certainly, shingles starting to come off, power outages everywhere, including in our location, up and down this beach. The winds may have died down some a little bit, but the storm surge has already being felt here. It's starting to loosen some of the pie longs out here on this pier. It has been around now since about the 1950s. They're worried the pier might collapse. Already, just on the other side of this island the flooding has begun. Even homes that were up on stilts and raised up will be no match for the storm surge. And part of what the national weather service was talking about here is that as this storm has come in to these barriers islands, rather than slamming into the side of it like this, head on, it's sort of come around to these barrier islands, they're now acting like a funnel pushing this water up into coastal Carolina here where it will take much, much longer for them, Shepard, to recover here. You can see some of the debris already now down on the beach. And if this storm stalls here the damage will only get worst. Of course, the water damage will also only get worst here, Shepard. SMITH: Leland Vittert, live in Atlantic Beach. Leland, thanks. Down to coast now about 40 miles, Steve Harrigan, live, North Topsail Beach, North Carolina. Steve, how does it look? STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS: Shepard, it's picked up a little bit in the last hour or so here. We're getting some gusts strong enough to knock you a little bit off balance. The waves pretty good as well. And steady rain now for the past three or four hours. There have been people leaving as late as midday today. People packing up and heading north, heading south, or heading inland, and it's really a tough call in either direction. Perhaps inland is the most challenging because we could see some devastating flooding, 30, 40 miles in on the coast. So, they are heading out, and getting out of town, Shepard. SMITH: Steve Harrigan, live on the beach. Breaking news in North Carolina as Governor Roy Cooper giving an update on his state, which is, obviously, feeling the effects already. Let's listen. GOV. ROY COOPER, D-N.C.: The worst of the storm is not yet here. But the common sense and patience. The heavy rains and high winds are likely to spread across North Carolina and linger for days. Right now, tropical storm force winds and even hurricane force winds powerful enough to destroy buildings are at our coast. Conditions will continue to deteriorate with strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant storm surge today and tomorrow. With the extreme storm surge along the coast, rivers will start to over flow because when flowing river waters meet the ocean surge, there's really nowhere else for the water to go. As Florence moves inland we'll see more rain and more flooding from our rivers. And remember that rivers keep on rising even after the rain stops. Already areas of the Northern Cape Fear River and Bog Sound are flooding. And we're watching the Noose River rise. At mid- afternoon, the weather service had issued 43 flash flood warnings. I want to thank you to the people who have evacuated and are prepared. But to anyone still unwilling to take this storm seriously, let me be clear, you need to get yourself to a safe place now and stay there. We, in North Carolina, have to shift from preparation to determination. We will survive this, and we will endure. In order to help speed more federal help I've requested an additional disaster declaration for cleanup and recovery. Here at the state emergency operations center people have been working around the clock and they are ready. Workers are helping more than 12,000 evacuees settle at about 126 shelters across the state. And they are opening more as needed and as we speak. Emergency management and FEMA have strategically positioned supplies and equipment across our state. Food and water is ready to be disbursed to wherever it's needed. Emergency personnel including swift water rescue teams and emergency medical personnel from North Carolina and 19 other states are stage here. Earlier today, I visited with some of the teams who are prepared to help us out as we get through the storm. And, in fact, I talked to teams from Florida and Ohio today, and I've told the team from Ohio we will not going to debate who's first in flight here because they're helping us out tonight. And I'm grateful to each and every one of those people. It's gratifying to drive through central North Carolina and see utility trucks, earth movers, and rescue vehicles sitting there ready to go. Thank you to all of these public servants who put their own lives at risk to protect the people of North Carolina. As the storm hits, remember to call 911, but only in the event of an emergency. Dial 211 if you need shelter, food, or other non-emergency. SMITH: The North Carolina governor updating situations there. For a more detail look at what's expected over the next few days, our chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth live in the Fox News extreme weather center. Hey, Rick. RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS: Hey, Shep. So interesting here now, the storm is moving about 5 miles an hour in this forward progression. Still west-northwest, but it's kind of bit -- a little bit more west for the last number of hours, before one little job off towards the west-northwest there. So, we still don't know, unfortunately, what this turn is going to happen, when it's going to happen, and where it's going to happen. And, unfortunately, it's going to be -- kind of going right in the direction of orientation there of the coastline. So inland would be -- probably be good news because it will lose its moisture source, would weaken just a little bit off the shore. It will remain -- still having a little bit more of that source and keep the winds stronger. So what had been a wind and a storm surge and a rain event is now more a rain and a storm surge event and flooding with that. The winds coming down just a little bit, which is good news. That said, we've got winds right now already into the 70-mile an hour range here just off shore into the 40's along the coast, so we're probably in tropical storm force. We'll get to hurricane a little bit later tonight. I want to show you a couple of our different models here. This is the GFS, we've been pointing out how this run. It came in a few hours ago, shows a 45-inch rainfall total. We've been saying we'll likely see some localized areas here of 45 inch. Just want to compare this here. That is your 45 inch. Now we'll look at the European model and it's just slightly farther to the south. And that has been what that European model has been doing. But you'll notice the bullseye goes a little farther to the south. I point this out because that brings parts of South Carolina into the mix. Either way, we don't know exactly where these numbers are going to set up. We're not saying it's going to be a 45 inches in that exact spot, but some place in here is going to be seeing those kinds of totals, and you go in across a higher elevation out across parts of the west. We're going to be seeing some spots probably over a foot depending where those bands are. All of that water that falls here is going to want to make its way out towards the coast, eventually. So the flooding we see here will be exacerbated by the more rain that's coming off of those mountains coming down to the shore. This is going to be a very long term flooding event. Water that stands for a long time is much more destructive than water that kind of comes in and gets out of there. So a long term event here. Not out of here until about Sunday evening, Shep. SMITH: Rick Reichmuth in the Weather Center. Thanks. And that's your 5 o'clock, Carolina time, update on Hurricane Florence. Much more throughout the night on Fox News Channel. After a quick commercial break, \"The Five\" is in. I'll see you tomorrow. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. Welcome to \"The Five.\" We're keeping an eye on Hurricane Florence as heavy rain and wind is starting to pound the Carolinas, more on the storm ahead. But first, a new video adding growing concerns of anti-conservative bias at Google, Breitbart obtaining the leaked tape showing some of the tech giant top executives at a company meeting distraught over President Trump election victory. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER: I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too. And that it conflicts with many of our values. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Fear, I think, not just in the United States but around the world, is what's fueling concerns, xenophobia, hatred. RUTH PORAT, GOOGLE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER: That was the first moment I really felt like we were going to lose. And it was a massive-like kick in the gut that we were going to lose. And it was really painful. UNINDENTIFIED MALE: That's why we have to work so hard to make sure it doesn't turn into a world war, something catastrophic, but instead it's a blip. It's a hiccup. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATTERS: Google is denying that political bias influences decisions at the company. Why were you laughing at that poor executive who is crying? That is so mean. KENNEDY, GUEST CO-HOST: Jesse, I know I've told this before, if ever I'm in a bad mood all I do is go to YouTube and watch crying Hillary supporters from election night. WATTERS: That is great. KENNEDY: I think to myself trying being a Gary Johnson fan. I don't run around the office blubbering every day. GUTFELD: I was heartbroken over that. WATTERS: It really should. I think one of the most damning thing that they have here is in the end where they say, the executives, we have to make sure that this election of Donald Trump doesn't turn into a big deal. We have to make sure it's just a blip. That sounds like the most serious thing they said to me. GUTFELD: Well, OK. I feel conflicted about this because I -- I am angry at Google for the fact that they're always helping China with their A.I. Yet, they didn't help our military and making our drones more precise in saving lives. So they're actually helping a competitor take over the world while kind of hindering us. But I also -- I'm not a big fan of leaked info from companies having meetings because that could happen to us. And you could have easily found five -- five executives or five of us saying those same things after the election. There were a lot of people that were easily as blown away and surprised and shocked and drinking heavily after the Trump win. So I think that we've got to be careful that we're not hypocrites. Having said that, though, this is -- this is kind of interesting because what -- what's going to change the world of algorithms and you go out -- and the people that create algorithms that's -- these guys. So if they have a liberal bias their algorithms are going to have a liberal bias. WATTERS: Right. GUTFELD: And algorithms are an equation that's best optimizes the best desired outcome. So if there's desired outcome is something that is left wing and progressive that's an issue for us. So that's the problem, I think. KENNEDY: It's like digital redistricting. GUTFELD: Very good. I like the way you think young lady. KENNEDY: I'm just encapsulating your thoughts. WATTERS: You guys want to have your own show? (LAUGHTER) GUTFELD: We've pitched it once. WATTERS: It reminds me of the Peter Strzok, Lisa Page defense because they will say my partisan bias and belief system did not affect my professional decision making. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: That's what judges say, too. WATTERS: Exactly. But in this case, and I think even more than Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they have some power but not as much power. This is probably the most powerful internet company, and this didn't happen in a vacuum. There's other instances of left wing bias as at Google. So it makes people think, wow, these people are powerful and they dislike President Trump. PERINO: And they're a private company so they can say whatever they want. WATTERS: Whatever they want. PERINO: They're not a utility. WATTERS: No. PERINO: . OK. So that's one. So they have the freedom to do that. It's when they say there's no conservative bias at all, but yet they won't. And I don't blame them also for not revealing their algorithm. That is their propriety information. WATTERS: True. PERINO: But at some point they're going to have to realize that them saying that doesn't equate. The other thing that they say is that we're not bias because that would not make any sense from a market standpoint because we want to make money, so why would we alienate more than half the country. WATTERS: Well, they don't seem to care that much because I think half the country is alienated by these people. And they haven't made that much of an effort to reach out. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't think half the country is alienated from Google over this. I mean, look. WATTERS: Well, not necessarily Google, but big social media companies. WILLIAMS: That's not true. Are you kidding? WATTERS: A lot of people are against these companies. WILLIAMS: These companies are making huge money. They're the richest companied in the world. And most Americans, liberal or conservatives, are customers. I hate to inform you. But here's my point on this, Greg is on target when he said there are people here at Fox News who were shocked at the outcome of that election. WATTERS: Not me, I predicted it. (LAUGHTER) WILLIAMS: And the second thing to say is Sergey Brin, if you've watched that video, says that he's an immigrant and a refugee and he's offended by the kind of rhetoric that attended the Trump victory. So, I mean. WATTERS: That's OK for him to say. WILLIAMS: That's exactly my point, it's OK for him to say. WATTERS: Exactly. (CROSSTALK) WILLIAMS: This is un-blanking believable. WATTERS: Go ahead. Go ahead. WILLIAMS: But what I'm trying to say is you've get a situation here where the conservative grievance in industry says, oh, wait, we are under assault. Nobody wants to hear our voices. Like there's no conservative media. But secondly, isn't it interesting, today Reddit did away with QAnon in their comment board. Why? Because they violate policy in terms of hate speech, in terms of going after people. Remember pizza gate? Alex Jones earlier this week. And all of a sudden people are like, oh, they're banning because -- no, they're banning hate speech. They're banning provocateurs. PERINO: OK. (CROSSTALK) WATTERS: Diamond and Silk is not hate speech. (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY: What's most troubling here is it shows these implicit cronies because they wanted Hillary to win because they wanted to be in bed with the President of the United States. WILLIAMS: Oh, get out of here. What cronyism? They are speaking from the heart. KENNEDY: A giant multi-billion dollar corporation wanting to affect the outcome, as Greg pointed out through algorithms with a Democratic status president. And the marriage of a giant corporation with giant government is one of the worst influences. WILLIAMS: We know that the Russians were out there. I saw in the paper today the Russians were even going after our healthcare programs to try to diminish support for that. WATTERS: Maybe the Russians bankrupted the healthcare website that Obama built. WILLIAMS: What we know is that the Russians effectively used Google, twitter, and others to affect our election. WATTERS: We've got to go. Liberal Hollywood loses it after Susan Sarandon appears to say something nice about Trump. Plus, Hurricane Florence starting to slam into the east coast, we'll have the latest later. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Actress Debra Messing going into a twitter tirade telling fellow Hollywood star Susan Sarandon to shut the bleep up. GUTFELD: Wow. WILLIAMS: Apparently saying something positive about President Trump. In an interview with Variety, Sarandon refuses to give the Trump presidency a grade. She mentioned how many more women are running for office. Watch: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: What grade would you give him at this point? SUSAN SARANDON, ACTRESS: Oh, my god. I would tell him to start all over again. I mean, I don't think we can grade him. You never saw that population running, so many women. I think like 40 percent more women are running for office and becoming elected. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: Sarandon telling -- firing back, I should say, at Messing, telling her to actually listen to what she said instead of falling for Variety's click bait headline. So, Kennedy, who's right, who's wrong? KENNEDY: I think it's fantastic because we're watching Debra Messing in the clutches of a slow and fascinating mental breakdown. And so, she's taking out her anger on a fellow leftist. Susan Sarandon, she's not the Jesse Watters. (LAUGHTER) KENNEDY: I mean, she really was saying that the president is so horrible and such an inspiration. The pendulum is swinging so far in the opposite direction which would be beneficial to both of them. But Debra Messing is either sick or completely out of her mind. It is fascinating to watch this sort of leftist cannibalism. WILLIAMS: So, Jesse, what's interesting here is you have a Bernie Sanders supporter versus a Hillary Clinton supporter. So a lot of this has some backdrop to it. WATTERS: Sure. WILLIAMS: Whether they're going after each other and saying, oh, in fact, Hillary Clinton is more dangerous than Donald Trump. Remember that? And now you get Messing saying, oh, look at healthcare, look at abortion rights, look at voter suppression, how can you not admit that you are wrong? WATTERS: Voter suppression. I think the Democrats are leading in the polls. I don't even know what that means. I do agree with Kennedy, it is fun to watch left on left crime in this country. It's enjoyable. And it doesn't happen enough. I think we should showcase this more on The Five. And in the spirit of this discussion, Juan, I'm going to give you a compliment. WILLIAMS: Sure. WATTERS: . because I'm going to say something nice about you. WILLIAMS: That's real. WATTERS: You have raised great conservative sons. WILLIAMS: That's true. WATTERS: And you have found out a way to get rich by being wrong every day. (LAUGHTER) So congratulations. Well done. Well-executed. WILLIAMS: Well done. WATTERS: I would also like to say something nice about Hillary. She has a great nickname, \"Crooked.\" WILLIAMS: Crooked. WATTERS: And she gives us great ratings, because she continues to not leave the stage. And President Obama also, he gave us Donald Trump. So good job, President Obama. I could do this all day. And I think -- I think it's time for someone else to take the lead. WILLIAMS: But I will say that you should read some of my books. They're best-sellers, and they made me rich. WATTERS: Better than \"The Gutfeld Monologues.\" WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't know about that. That's a high standard. WATTERS: OK. WILLIAMS: So what you get here is a situation where I think you could take the light in the pictures. There were pictures that put out, one where I think it was Messing getting arrested and Susan -- KENNEDY: Sarandon. WILLIAMS: Sarandon getting arrested and Messing laying on a beach or porch relaxing. And this was put out as evidence that you're not really part of the resistance. PERINO: You're not really in the resistance? WILLIAMS: Yes. PERINO: I have to say also that I -- one thing I can't stand. And if you're a young journalism student out there, don't ever, ever waste a question by saying, \"What grade would you give\" a president. It is the lamest, laziest question. And I am actually surprised Susan Sarandon didn't fall for it. She was like, \"I'm not going to answer that,\" and she moves on. The backhanded compliment that you have to be pretty aware of. As Jesse was just showing, it's easy to do, and you can get caught very easily. WATTERS: And Trump already gave himself an A-plus. So -- PERINO: Right. WATTERS: That settles it. KENNEDY: As any stable genius would, Jesse. WATTERS: Exactly. WILLIAMS: So Greg, more women are running for Congress -- GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- for governor. So is she wrong? GUTFELD: More power to them, I say. She's a hot Messing. \"Will and Grace,\" more like \"Will and Disgrace,\" America. WATTERS: God. GUTFELD: Once you embrace an ideology, there is no room for nuance or disagreement. Like, you could tell what Susan Sarandon meant, or Sarandon meant. But Messing is the typical late-blooming Hollywood leftist. She spent whatever, four decades chasing the spotlight. Now she feels guilty. So her emotion is inversely proportional to her wisdom. So the more she feels, the less she actually thinks. And then when she goes on social media, this is the worst part about the poor woman, is that she -- social media dehumanizes people. She doesn't see -- like, if she was looking at Susan Sarandon, she could see that it was a backhanded compliment or she could see what she's talking about. But you can't do that on social media. I'll be discussing that further in the E-block. That's what we call a long tease. WILLIAMS: Yes. But it just looks like it's kind of petty -- GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- cat fight. Intense. PERINO: Nothing better for television. WILLIAMS: All right. GUTFELD: Oh, yes? WILLIAMS: Oh, yes? All right. Hurricane Florence closing in on the East Coast, folks. The latest on the nightmare storm. That's up next with us on \"The Five.\" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: This is a Fox News alert. The outer bands of dangerous Hurricane Florence starting to slam into the Carolinas. Although wind speeds have weakened, life-threatening rainfall and a massive storm surge still pose a very serious threat. We have live team Fox coverage with chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth in the weather center and correspondent Leland Vittert on the front lines in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. But let's go first to Rick Reichmuth, who is tracking the monster storm. And Rick, there was an update at 5 p.m.? REICHMUTH: Yes, there was. Winds came down about five miles an hour. You say the winds have gone down. They're still a hundred miles an hour. So incredibly strong winds at the center of this. Hurricane-force winds still extending about 160 miles across from this. We've got winds, the latest wind gusts at Hatteras at 67 miles an hour, so we're getting mighty, mighty close to the hurricane-force winds there. You can see where we have the flood watches in effect. We also have flash flooding going on right now around Morehead City, where we've already seen around six inches of rain. And I would say we're about ten to fifteen percent in the way into this. So a lot more to be had. This is the latest gust. That buoy right there, 76 miles an hour, so you see hurricane-force winds getting mighty close towards the shore. It's really slowed down in this forward progression, going about 5 miles an hour. I think it will probably slow, even, a little bit more over the next couple of hours or so. That's why we think these rainfall totals are going to be so extreme. We'll see some spots here probably around 40 inches. We'll probably see some spots in interior sections up to about 12 inches. There's more mountainous terrain here across the southern Appalachians. All of that water is going to make its way across the state of South Carolina. And we're going to have a world of hurt with all the moisture as that's there. By the way, this is just one model run. I think there's a good chance some of that will be a little bit farther towards the south. So if you're in South Carolina, don't think just because you don't see it here that that's not going to happen. This is just a model run. We don't know exactly where that's going to line up. I just pulled out here to show you the zoomed-out version. A lot of people are saying what happens after this, once we get in towards Sunday and Monday? You kind of get the sense here that's our track. So, we'll eventually see some moisture going across southern parts of Canada, parts of New England. But we're not going to see it right there across that I-95 corridor. I don't think it's going to go primarily around it. There's our official track. This is the next couple of days. Does not move much. By the time we gets towards Saturday, goes into Sunday and Monday and then take a look at that. It moves very, very quickly eventually. But the next few days is the hard part. At least, probably, all the way through Saturday with the very torrential rain falls. And that's why we're going to be seeing so much flooding -- Dana. PERINO: All right, Rick. Thanks for all the hard work. REICHMUTH: Yes. PERINO: We'll be back to you soon. Now to Leland Vittert. He's on the ground in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Leland, I don't think you've dried out all day. VITTERT: No. Won't probably dry out for another couple of days, Dana. And since we talked at about 2:30, the winds have certainly picked. Gusts now somewhere in the 75-mile-an-hour range, which is more than enough to knock you over. We're between bands, so we're getting sustained winds of about 40, 45 miles an hour. So you get that sand blast effect here as we walk up the beach towards you. Interestingly enough, we're walking into the wind, up the beach. And that's one of the reasons that this storm is going to have such deadly and catastrophic effects farther inland here. Because this water is being pushed in like a funnel through the barrier islands. Out here on the beach, certainly enough wind for some fairly serious damage. Mobile homes, certainly some flooding here, especially on the inland side. Even houses that are raised three, four, five feet up on stilts. It's protection, but it's certainly not safety from this water that continues to come in. Power outages already blanketing North Carolina, including where we are. There could be hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people without power by the time this is over. And you combine all the water that is coming down, so all the flooding. All the storm surge that is coming and all the rain. Getting the power back on is going to be a goliath effort over weeks, if not months. So we are in the very beginning hours of this storm. As Rick said, it's going to stall here, which will only increase the misery factor so, so much for all the folks who stayed and then, obviously, for people who are inland who evacuated. All they can do is just watch the destruction here from the wind and from the rising water over the next couple of days, guys. PERINO: Leland, I have a question. So you're heading into the evening and overnight. How do you continue to track things and monitor when it's dark? VITTERT: Great question. We have an incredible crew that we're out here with. So we've got generators, and we've got lights. We're going to actually pull back a little bit from this position here, because it's pretty hard to see all the way out this distance at night. So we've got a location that we sort of scouted out that can give you a sense of the storm throughout the evening, where we can keep our camera crew safe. Under it, we've got a building there that is steel and concrete, reinforced, that they can stay in. We can venture out and news gather a little bit. And also, that's where you've got generators. So you have lights on that can actually sort of go, penetrate out far enough to be able to get a sense of what the wind is going to be like. And also the damage. And also, importantly for us, watch for rising waters in case we ourselves have to get out before getting trapped. PERINO: All right. Well, stay safe, Leland. And thank you. All right. Next, will face-to-face conversations become a thing of the past? Greg's take on a growing trend, and his take on it. Next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: According to new research, teens now prefer texting over talking in person. In other news: Water is wet, puppies are adorable, and I could have been a male model. So why does this matter? Well, while most teens think that social media improves their lives, for those who have poor social wellbeing, it's actually the opposite. Part of this is due to the ease at which anonymous mobs can form and attack online. Because people tend to imitate each other in order to belong, social media is now a constant exercise of swarm and shame. When a large number of people do this simultaneously, it's mob behavior: A pack of hyenas screaming for a scalp. The strong can handle this, but the vulnerable, not so much. Spend five minutes on Twitter, you'll see it. So I'm all for texting, but by removing face-to-face contact, and the vulnerability of eye contact, it's just easier to destroy each other. A generation becomes a mob of cruelty, out to punish someone for their own sins. Think about Christ. The original crucifixion was meant to be the last one, the one to stop the mob. Then came the iPhone and Twitter. Now we crucify daily. So here is my advice for parents of teens, because I am the expert: At every chance, help them see the reality of their anger and the reality of a mob and why it's brave to egg on its failure. Destroying a life online is an act of craven self-scarring and eventually that's how the world will see you, as just another coward yelling, \"crucify him!\" WILLIAMS: Wow, I can't believe this. This is too much. Amen, brother. I can't believe you and I are on the same page on this. But I think human interaction -- GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- is being, actually, derailed by these systems. GUTFELD: I agree, I agree. And I think that's why -- that's why when you see something like the Debra Messing thing, it was easier for her to go after a peer, basically, who agrees with her, because they're not actually -- like, you can't talk to certain people in a face-to-face way the way you do it here. You can destroy somebody. KENNEDY: You also don't have context -- GUTFELD: Yes. KENNEDY: -- in any sort of digital communication. So it's difficult to tell -- GUTFELD: Yes. KENNEDY: -- if someone really is upset or if someone really is being sarcastic. GUTFELD: Right. KENNEDY: If you take that the wrong way, it can ruin a friendship. Both my daughters have devices where they are able to text. And there is a lot of parental control, don't get me wrong. But it's scary, because you don't want your kids to be antisocial and dehumanized. And there's something very human about reading the signals on someone else's face. GUTFELD: Face. Exactly. KENNEDY: I mean, that's how we evolved in order to read those subtleties and modify our behavior accordingly. WILLIAMS: Yes, so human interaction, then is, at the moment it's almost like a fork in the road. Because what it said in the polls is the kids prefer texting -- GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: -- to human contact. But then when they're with each other, a high percentage say, \"Well, my friends are distracted. They're paying attention to phones and not talking to me.\" GUTFELD: Yes. WILLIAMS: But the human interaction, something different is going on. GUTFELD: Yes. All I know is the only times I've had to apologize in my life recently is after e-mails or texts or tweets. Because I get angry at something that I probably wouldn't have been angry if I had been eye contact or something. It's weird. PERINO: Right, because also, if you send an e-mail that sounds mean, we don't know, you may have been laughing -- if you had said it out loud, you probably would have laughed afterwards. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: Because that's how you communicate. WATTERS: That's why you put \"LOL,\" Dana. PERINO: Thank you, thank you. Thank you for that. WATTERS: I'm hip to all this. PERINO: My friend's daughter gave up social media for Lent, and then she loved the freedom that it gave her, and she never went back. KENNEDY: That's great. PERINO: And she was 15. GUTFELD: Wow. KENNEDY: It's here to stay. There's nothing we're going to do about technology and social media. It will continue to evolve. It's just really important as parents that you have to redirect your kid. You have to take them outside and you have to constantly encourage them. But the nice thing about a phone for a 13-year-old is that it is a great discipline device. And the second there's misbehavior -- GUTFELD: Take it away. WATTERS: I thought you were going to say you beat them with the phone. KENNEDY: I'm not Naomi Campbell. WATTERS: She does that? GUTFELD: Well, she did something with a phone. Yes. WATTERS: What's going to happen is eventually, you're going to get a generation of kids with hunchbacks. GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: Because they're going to be like this. PERINO: Definitely posture, absolutely. WATTERS: And blind. They're going to be blind hunchbacks. KENNEDY: Very strong thumbs. WATTERS: Very jittery with no attention span. And they're not going to be married, because they can't score at a bar. GUTFELD: Yes, but the upside is, if they're blind and hunchbacked they can just go to Notre Dame. PERINO: OK, I'm going to leave it there. WILLIAMS: That joke -- that joke rings a bell. GUTFELD: Oh! Nice. PERINO: Excellent. GUTFELD: Should we end it there? PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: We probably should, even though that will give us 12 minutes for \"One More Thing.\" \"One More Thing\" is up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: It's time now for \"One More Thing.\" And now a new edition of -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GRAPHIC: Mom Texts (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Oh, yes! WATTERS: -- \"Mom Texts.\" OK. Here we go. No. 1, \"Stay away from speaking for Trump. Don't be an ass.\" WILLIAMS: Go Mom, go. WATTERS: How about this: \"What happened to the rule of law? Stop this, Jesse. You sound like an immoral crook.\" WILLIAMS: Yes. WATTERS: Next one, \"Where is your moral compass?\" GUTFELD: Wow. They're getting shorter and meaner. WATTERS: Dana asks me that every day. PERINO: No, I don't. WATTERS: Next one, \"Those colleagues of yours are breathtaking at multiple levels, and I am not referencing Diamond and Silk.\" Oh, that's just a cheap shot, Mom. And then lastly, \"STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR HAIR!\" Sorry. GUTFELD: All caps, too. WATTERS: All right, Mom. PERINO: She's the best. WATTERS: I love you. PERINO: Next time we do -- GUTFELD: I notice they're getting shorter. WATTERS: I'm editing. GUTFELD: They're getting angrier. WATTERS: She's got the derangement syndrome. PERINO: Does she do emojis? WATTERS: Yes, but we can't put those on the screen. WILLIAMS: You know what I have from your mom? WATTERS: Yes. WILLIAMS: In my office? PERINO: Juan, wow. WILLIAMS: Expiration clock, courtesy of Jesse's mom. WATTERS: Yes. I think that thing's broken. WILLIAMS: It's working, brother. WATTERS: Yes, but it should end at 2024, not 2020. WILLIAMS: Hopefully, it will end at 2018. PERINO: All right. GUTFELD: Got to move on. WATTERS: Dana. PERINO: OK. I have a sweet one. And this is a community that has come together in the wake of a heartbreaking tragedy. And this is where you get that human interaction, for sure. Ben and Marilyn Keryluke have been raising their 3- and 6-year-old grandchildren since the death of their son and daughter-in-law last May. They recently made the difficult decision to sell their late son's classic car to help cover the costs of raising two children with special needs. What they didn't count on was the amazing response from the community. Check out that car, Greg. GUTFELD: Yes. PERINO: The car sold for $29,000 at auction. Then new owner did the unthinkable. He donated it back to the auction, where it sold for another $30,000 -- WILLIAMS: Wonderful. PERINO: -- and was immediately donated back to the auction again. The car was sold for a third and a final time, fetching $20,000. The new owner then donated the car to the Kerylukes so they could hold onto their prized possession. Through the car and donations, the Kerylukes received over a hundred thousand dollars to help raise two kids. WILLIAMS: Wonderful. PERINO: That is a beautiful story. WATTERS: Beautiful. All right. Mr. Gutfeld. GUTFELD: All right. I'm going to be on \"Tucker\" tonight. We'll be discussing Michael Moore and also Michael Avenatti, who's going to be on Tucker tonight. And I'm going to be on right before him with some pithy questions, I guess. Time for this. GRAPHIC: Greg's Favorite Fan News GUTFELD: \"Greg's Favorite Fan News.\" A lot of people at home don't know this, but there are people that are outside, usually in this area. What do you call this area? WILLIAMS: The plaza, the plaza. GUTFELD: The plaza, who actually watch our show. And sometimes they'll react very strongly to my monologues. Check out this young fellow after my last monologue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (FERRET MAKING LOUD NOISE) (END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: Jess (ph) was so happy. Look at him yelling. He's screaming, \"More, more, more!\" Anyway, he definitely is one of my bigger fans. And you know what? I think we're going to go out and get drinks later. KENNEDY: He's warming up his texting fingers. GUTFELD: Oh, yes. He'll be going home tonight. WATTERS: All right. Juan. GUTFELD: In my pocket. WILLIAMS: All right. Look up in the sky. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Yes. It's Usain Bolt. The world's fastest human went into zero gravity for his latest race. Bolt was inside a modified Airbus zero-G plane in France. These planes are used to train astronauts. They're known as \"vomit comets.\" PERINO: Gee. WILLIAMS: But for Bolt, it was the scene of his latest race. He ran against a French astronaut and a marketing executive. The event put on by a French champagne maker, Maison Mumm to promote a new champagne bottle and serving glass designed for use in zero gravity. GUTFELD: And that's how you run after you drink. WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go. By the way, you should all know Usain Bolt won the race, floating across the finish line to set an out-of-this-world record. GUTFELD: Always about race with you, Juan. WILLIAMS: I tell you. WILLIAMS: Thank God for genius. Where would we be without him? WATTERS: Kennedy. KENNEDY: Oh, my God. You've heard a lot about it, and I'm so excited to be a part of it. It's FOX Nation. You're like, \"What is FOX Nation?\" If you go to FOXnews.com right now, you will see some of your very favorite FOX personalities from FOX News and FOX Business.

I want to see all the people. Can we put that back up? There we go. KENNEDY: Yes. WATTERS: Let me see. Where's Greg? Can we -- there he is. All the way on the right. GUTFELD: As I should be. WATTERS: Below Ainsley and next to Hegseth. And there I am be below Brit and next to -- is that Tomi? And then we have Todd Starnes is going to be on there. PERINO: What about me? What about me?

            "article_content": "Liberals are launching a campaign to recall Scholastic's children's book, \"President Donald Trump\" from their store for being \"dangerous\" and omitting negative information about the commander-in-chief. (Scholastic/istock) A Scholastic children\u2019s book focused on President Trump is angering liberal parents, teachers, and authors who labeled it \u201cdangerous\u201d and claim the commander-in-chief should be described using words like \u201crapist,\u201d \u201cwife-beater,\u201d and \u201cNazi.\u201d The 32-page children\u2019s book, \u201cPresident Donald Trump,\u201d written by Joanne Mattern as part of the Rookie Biographies Series, is aimed at first and second graders between the ages of 6 and 7. It was labeled \u201cpro-Trump propaganda\u201d by\u00a0Think Progress. The children\u2019s biography \u201cignores acts of resistance, and, crucially, excludes any reference to the words and deeds of racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny that have defined Trump\u2019s campaign and presidency,\u201d according to a\u00a0book review titled \u201cScholastic Tells Children: Trump is Great\u201d for Social Justice Books, as part of a\u00a0Teaching for Change. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mattern, a New York resident, said that in her books about Trump she wanted to provide an unbiased portrait of the president, with accurate context. She wrote two children's book about the president. But liberals were particularly incensed with one section of the \"President Donald Trump\" book that said people were \u201chappy\u201d Trump won the presidency. \u201cOn November 8, 2016, Americans voted for president. The race was close, but Trump won. Many people were happy,\u201d she wrote in the book. \u201cThey looked forward to a brand-new government.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the leaked video where Google execs rant about Donald Trump and his 'extreme' voters. Google may not be \"rigged,\" as President Trump recently charged, but its leadership sure as hell is biased. The leaking of a video of a post-election meeting that included co-founder Sergey Brin and other top executives is nothing short of stunning. It is basically one long rant about Donald Trump winning the presidency, how awful this was for the world, and what Google should do in response. There's even a serious discussion, after an initial joke, of helping employees who want to move to Canada. Here's why this is off the charts. In the video, which was sent to Breitbart, the Googlers are acting like Trump's election calls for a national day of mourning \u2014 while the cameras are rolling. Within the confines of their Silicon Valley bubble, there is no sense that maybe they shouldn't say these things because one day this might get out. Just as incredible is the absolute confidence that everyone in the room shares their views. With one brief exception, there is not even a flicker of recognition that some of the people working for this giant company might not be freaked out by Trump in the White House, and might even welcome it. And most appalling of all, the executives assume that all Trump voters are dumb, or extremists, or bored, or something. Brin kicks things off by saying that everyone is feeling sad. \"Myself, as an immigrant, a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive. And I know many of you do too. And I think it's a very stressful time, and that conflicts with many of our values.\" Brin suggests a link between Trump voters and extremists, fascists and communists, attributing this to income disparity and perhaps boredom. \"It sort of sneaks up sometimes, really bad things,\" he says. Senior Vice President Kent Walker doesn't mince words. Taking aim at Trump supporters, he says that \"fear, not just in the United States but around the world, is what's fueling concerns, xenophobia, hatred, and a desire for answers that may or may not be there.\" Vice President Eileen Noughton, who discussed ways for staffers to leave the country, did make a bow to \"diversity of opinion and political persuasion.\" She said she's heard from conservative employees who \"haven't felt entirely comfortable\" coming forward and called for \"tolerance.\" Keep in mind that the company last year fired engineer James Damore for saying in a memo that some employees are discriminated against due to their \"perceived conservative political views by Google,\" \"their male gender by Google,\" and \"due to their Caucasian race by Google.\" (Damore also wrote that women are underrepresented in tech because of inherent psychological differences and \"we need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.\") He later compared being a conservative at Google to being gay in the 1950s. The company said in a statement that \"some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone ...\" I'm sorry, that's a pretty lame response that doesn't go to the core problem of Google's culture. I'm going to be fair and not automatically assume that just because Brin and company are liberal anti-Trumpers they are cooking the virtual books. Google is a machine, and it would be impossible to tilt every search for a desired political outcome even if they wanted to. But humans write the algorithms, and it\u2019s not hard to believe, in light of the video, that sometimes there\u2019s a thumb on the scale, or that some conservatives get pushed down in the all-important rankings. This is just another reason to distrust Big Tech. And until Google's leaders address its left-leaning culture more candidly, those doubts will continue to cloud the company\u2019s reputation.",
