            "article_content": "MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - JULY 2:  Presidential candidate Enrique Pena Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) speaks during a press conference on July 2, 2012 in Mexico City, Mexico. According to reports, a vote count by the independent Federal Electoral Institute (LIFE) has give Pena Nieto and the PRI the win in the presidential election, but it looks unlikely the will have a majority in either house of Congress.  (Photo by Daniel Aguilar/Getty Images) (2012 Getty Images) Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is spending two days in California, where he is meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown, who traveled to Mexico last month. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is visiting California Monday and Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, both the governor and the president are scheduled to speak to hundreds of Mexican and Mexican-American leaders, the governor\u2019s office said last week. And on Tuesday, Brown will host a luncheon in the president\u2019s honor in Sacramento. Pe\u00f1a Nieto will then address the Legislature at the state Capitol. There was no immediate word on what Pe\u00f1a Nieto plans to say, but Mexico and the U.S. share concerns about a host of issues, including immigration and pollution. Mexico also is California\u2019s largest export market. Mexico also ranks first in the number of international visitors coming to L.A. with 1.6 million in 2011. The president\u2019s visit comes as the U.S. is grappling with a border crisis that has seen more than 60,000 children illegally crossing the Mexican border the past year. Though the children are coming from Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2013 they are all crossing through Mexico to arrive in the United States. The U.S. has called on Mexico to help it deal with the growing crisis. In March, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti traveled to Mexico on his first international trade mission and met with President Nieto and other officials and business leaders. \u201cMexico\u2019s economy is rapidly transforming, and I want to make sure we are aggressive about creating opportunities to attract investment into Los Angeles and to develop markets for L.A. exports,\u201d Garcetti said, according to published reports. Meanwhile, a California state assemblyman plans to stage a protest outside the governor\u2019s mansion to demand that Pe\u00f1a Nieto ensure the release of a U.S. Marine held captive in Mexico. Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, who recently lost in a bid to become the Republican nominee in the gubernatorial election in November, declined an invitation to the luncheon and assailed Brown for hosting the luncheon in honor of the Mexican president. \"I am writing to decline your luncheon invitation,\u201d read the letter Donnelly sent Brown, which the assemblyman made public, \u201cand to express my deep disappointment that you would entertain the president of a nation that is holding an active-duty U.S. Marine captive.\" Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi has said that he was headed to dinner in San Ysidro on March 31 when he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing in Tijuana. He said Mexican authorities found three guns inside the pick-up truck he had recently driven to California in a recent move from Florida to San Diego. He was jailed and is being held in a federal penitentiary in Tecate without bail. In his letter to Brown, Donnelly also took issue with the governor\u2019s recent trip to Mexico and what he said was the governor\u2019s failure to raise the issue of Tahmooressi's release.

Unconventional Wisdom: A Republican Wave That May Not Materialize This Fall Media Ratchet Up Pressure on White House As Probe Confirms Cover-up at VA Well, President Obama can no longer say he\u2019s waiting for the results of the investigation. At least one investigation is done, and it\u2019s devastating to the VA. Now even John McCain is calling on Eric Shinseki to resign, and urging the Justice Department to launch a criminal probe. The IG\u2019s investigation confirms what the Arizona Republic and CNN originally reported, that there was lying and a cover-up at the Phoenix facility. Critics say the president follows an increasingly tired playbook: He finds out about some administration malfeasance from the media, expresses outrage, fires no one, asks for an investigation, and by the time the probe is over, the White House can promise reforms and generally treat the matter as old news. But Wednesday\u2019s report could force Obama to speed up that timetable: \u201cThe inspector general for the Department of Veterans Affairs reported on Wednesday that at least 1,700 veterans at the agency\u2019s medical center in Phoenix were not registered on the proper waiting list to see doctors, creating a serious condition that means veterans \u2018continue to be at risk of being forgotten or lost\u2019 in the convoluted scheduling process,\u201d says the New York Times. \u201cIrregularities in how the 1,700 veterans were handled, the report said, mean that \u2018these veterans may never obtain a requested or required clinical appointment.\u2019\u201d The average waiting time for a medical appointment for a group of patients studied was 115 days, but the Phoenix center falsely claimed it was 24 days. Adds Politico: \u201cThe review is intensifying an already simmering scandal engulfing the VA \u2014 and the Obama administration. Republicans on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail are pointing to the issue to bolster their case that the White House is dysfunctional.\u201d Pushing out Shinseki, a decorated war veteran, would, of course, be symbolic. But it\u2019s important for a president to demonstrate that he\u2019s on top of a problem. A resignation would at least allow Shinseki to leave with dignity. The president delivered a major foreign-policy address at West Point yesterday, but that is likely to be overshadowed by the VA furor. The VA mess has touched a nerve because it feels like America has betrayed its promise to those who served. The scandal, and it is a scandal, is not hard to understand. The interviews with grieving relatives of patients, some of whom have died awaiting care, packs a powerful emotional punch. I have gotten plenty of emails from aggravated vets and family members. Yes, the VA has been dysfunctional for decades, and previous administrations share the blame. But that\u2019s no excuse for a president in his sixth year. The national media were slow to react to the initial reports, but this story is not going away, and should not go away, anytime soon. Unconventional Wisdom: A Republican Wave That May Not Materialize This Fall What if 2014 isn\u2019t such a big Republican year after all? The conventional wisdom is that Democrats are going to get clobbered in the midterms, victims of ObamaCare, an anemic economy and the sixth-year presidential blues. But what if there isn\u2019t a wave election in the making? Just a strong current that lifts a few Republican boats? Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor and a onetime GOP strategist, is sounding a cautionary note. The fall contests, he warns, may not play out like the Tea Party election of 2010. Now maybe Kristol is just worried about overconfidence. Here\u2019s his argument: \u201cDemocrats may well feel disillusionment and even dread this year. But we can\u2019t say we\u2019re overwhelmed by any Republican sense of energy and anticipation. Perhaps we\u2019ve just become insensate and jaded. Or perhaps we\u2019ve been reading too much history. Because history suggests you get only one wave election per two-term presidency: 1958 for Ike, 1966 for Kennedy-Johnson, 1974 for Nixon-Ford, 1986 for Reagan, 1994 for Clinton, 2006 for Bush, 2010 for Obama. We rode our wave in 2010. To get to do so again in 2014 would be fun\u2014but unprecedented.\u201d He also notes that Obama\u2019s approval rating, after sinking last year, \u201chas stabilized. Indeed, his rating has ticked up a bit in 2014\u2014it\u2019s now at 44 approval and 51 disapproval. And the generic congressional ballot, which moved in a Republican direction during 2013\u2014from about +7 Democratic to even, has stayed even in 2014.\u201d For Republicans, he concludes, \u201cthe bad news is that momentum has stalled.\u201d I see it differently. The GOP doesn\u2019t need a tidal wave. The party already enjoys a strong working majority in the House. It just needs a pickup of six Senate seats. If it wins those six seats, this will be remembered as a banner Republican year that gave the party complete control of Capitol Hill and forced the president to play defense for the remainder of his term. If the Republicans capture, say, only five seats, the year will be viewed as a disappointment that left Harry Reid in charge. Kristol, for his part, has advice to boost his party\u2019s prospects: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see more energetic action by the Republican leadership in Congress, both in taking on the Obama administration and in advancing a positive, populist conservative policy agenda. We think it would help. But we don\u2019t expect to see it.\u201d He\u2019s right on that last point. The GOP leadership is basically running out the clock in a game that it sees as preordained in its favor. For all of John Boehner\u2019s talk about immigration reform, nothing seems to be happening. A minimum wage hike appears dead. Remember when extended unemployment benefits ran out last December? The House hasn\u2019t lifted a finger since then. A few lawmakers, like Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor, are talking about a more populist agenda that addresses middle-class concerns. But for the most part, that remains in the realm of polite debate. The strategy makes sense: Why risk changing such a favorable environment by working with Democrats to pass compromise legislation? Easier to keep criticizing ObamaCare and hold some more Benghazi hearings. But what if the Republicans are missing a real opportunity to recast their party\u2019s image\u2014not just for the fall elections, but for 2016 as well? Click for more from Media Buzz.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama speaks to the media before a meeting with his cabinet members in the White House Cabinet Room in Washington,  Friday, Nov. 7, 2014.  (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP2014) As Congressional leaders come together at the White House Friday to meet with President Obama there are two questions on everyone\u2019s mind. First, will presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Obama be able to maintain the tone of conciliation and bipartisanship that characterized yesterday\u2019s press conferences? And second, will the president be serving Kentucky bourbon? Drinks aside, there is a tough road ahead for both the Republicans and Democrats. Both McConnell and Obama acknowledged earlier this week that there were areas where they could foresee compromising with one another, and others where there is no common ground to be found. [pullquote] For his part, McConnell suggested that he could work with the president on energy issues and corporate tax reform \u2013 two areas where I do believe we could see progress. However, he also made clear that while he wouldn\u2019t seek to repeal ObamaCare fully, he wants to do away with the medical device tax and the individual mandate. Both of these ideas will be non-starters in the White House \u2013 and McConnell knows it. President Obama was more opaque about where he sees the potential to work with Republican leadership, even though he was clear that it was his priority to make sure that the government keeps working during his final two years in office. I believe we will see a meeting of the minds on the budget \u2013 McConnell also promised there wouldn\u2019t be another government shutdown \u2013 and on energy issues. It remains to be seen whether the president is seriously open to any changes to his signature health care law, or to immigration reform that meets Republican concerns about securing the border and the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country. But more importantly than any specific issue, the legacy of Obama\u2019s presidency is very much tied to whether he will work with Republicans in these next two years. A president is never irrelevant simply due to the power of the office, but Obama does, in many ways, have the opportunity to recreate himself as a pragmatic, conciliatory and compromising president after years of partisan politics and disinterest in governing with the legislature. To be sure, the president has accomplished a great deal on social issues. He will always be remembered for ObamaCare as well as key pieces of legislation like the Equal Pay Act and his support for gay marriage and women\u2019s rights . Despite these accomplishments \u2013 and I do believe them to be serious accomplishments \u2013 his reputation is badly damaged at this point. There is little-to-no faith in his ability or interest in working with others and after the Democrats\u2019 rout on Tuesday, most assume that he will be reaching for his veto pen more often than not. This would be the wrong approach on two levels. First, it would mean that government will continue to get nothing done. That\u2019s a losing scenario for both parties and the American people. Second, it would indicate that Obama has not learned the lesson of this election, namely that Americans don\u2019t feel that he is responsive to their needs and wants, chief among them that Washington legislators work together. In a recent WSJ/NBC News poll, 50% of Americans said they would rather a candidate \u201cwho will make compromises to gain consensus on legislation,\u201d up from 34% at the 2010 midterms. That says it all. And if Obama is to make good on his statement Wednesday to the one third of Americans who voted and the two thirds who didn\u2019t that he \u201cheard them,\u201d then he\u2019s got to take compromising with Republicans very seriously. In many ways, his legacy depends on it.",

Secretary of State John Kerry is to travel to the Middle East this week, with stops in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, to try to line up support for a coalition to take on the extremist Islamic State group. His trip follows Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\u0092s visit on Monday to Turkey to make the same case to Ankara, a regional heavyweight. Kerry will hold talks with officials from Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf nations. (AP Photo/Militant Website, File) (AP) While Twitter and other social media sites were abuzz with rumors that ISIS terrorists would attempt to use the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico to sneak into the country, Department of Homeland Security officials said that there is no credible evidence that members of the Islamic militant group plan to use the border to enter the U.S. Speaking to Congress on Wednesday, the officials said that the administration of President Barack Obama is more concerned with jihadist fighters entering the U.S. legally on commercial airline flights. The Homeland Security testimony cast in doubt the border scenarios cited by lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. \"We don't have any credible information, that we are aware of, of known or suspected terrorists coming across the border,\" said Jennifer Lasley, a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence and analysis office, according to the New York Daily News. Another DHS official speaking to Sen. John McCain during a Senate committee hearing acknowledged that the department had tracked some chatter over social media of ISIS adherents across the globe talking about the possibility of sneaking across the U.S.\u2019s southern, but that the DHS is prepared for this threat. \"Any infiltration across our border would be a threat,\" said Francis Taylor, DHS undersecretary for intelligence, but added that he is \"satisfied we have the intelligence and capability on the border that would prevent that activity.\u201d While Cruz, McCain and other lawmakers in border states have argued for beefing up security along the border in the wake of the ISIS threat, the Obama administration has focused more on suspected terrorists who hold western passports. \"The number of known watch-listed persons we are encountering on the Southwest border is minimal compared to commercial aviation,\" said John Wagner, assistant commissioner in the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's Office of Field Operations. \"We're talking tens versus thousands.\" The testimonies before Congress came only hours before Obama outlined his strategy on dealing with the ISIS threat. In a nationally televised speech Wednesday night, the president said he wants to step up military and diplomatic efforts to counter the extremists in Iraq and Syria by arming Syrian opposition forces and extending U.S. airstrikes into Syria. \"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\" Obama declared. \"That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq.\" The president also said he would send another 475 U.S. troops into Iraq to advise that country's forces, but insists they are not combat troops. The U.S. already has launched about 150 airstrikes on Islamic State targets inside Iraq, at the invitation of the Iraqi government and has also sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents. The Obama administration doesn't think the militants pose any immediate threat of an attack in the U.S. But it believes the group is a threat to the Middle East and could attack U.S. targets overseas. The U.S. also worries about the group training and radicalizing Americans who could later return to attack America. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "July 19, 2014: State Sen. Chris McDaniel speaks to supporters during a tour stop at the Holiday Inn Trustmark Park in Pearl, Miss. (AP) A tea party-backed candidate asked a Mississippi court on Thursday to declare him the winner of the June 24 Republican runoff against incumbent U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran or order a new election. State Sen. Chris McDaniel sued Thursday in state court in his own home of Jones County. The Mississippi Supreme Court will appoint a special judge to handle the case, though it would be unprecedented for a court to order a do-over of a statewide election. Cochran's campaign and the Republicans' national Senate office have said they are already focused on Cochran's bid for re-election in November against Democratic former U.S. Rep. Travis Childers and Reform Party candidate Shawn O'Hara. Certified results of the June 24 runoff show Cochran defeated McDaniel by 7,667 votes. But McDaniel says his campaign found thousands of irregularities, including about 3,500 people who voted in the June 3 Democratic primary and June 24 runoff. Mississippi voters don't register by party, but such crossover voting is prohibited. McDaniel has criticized Cochran for reaching out to black voters who traditionally support Democrats. Turnout increased from the primary to the runoff, and Cochran fared well in many majority-black precincts. McDaniel campaign representatives spent weeks examining ballot boxes and other voting records. McDaniel said they found about 9,500 \"irregular\" votes and 2,275 \"improperly cast\" absentee ballots. McDaniel began his challenge with a complaint to the Mississippi Republican Party executive committee on Aug. 4, asking the group to declare him the winner over Cochran. State GOP chairman Joe Nosef said Aug. 6 that the committee would not consider the challenge because it did not have time to thoroughly examine the information McDaniel provided about alleged voting irregularities. Thursday marked the deadline to file a lawsuit challenging his loss. State law says the general-election sample ballot must be given to local election officials by Sept. 10, which is 55 days before the Nov. 4 general election. While a court could order a new primary even after the general election, McDaniel campaign attorney Mitch Tyner has said he wants the dispute over the primary resolved in time to keep the general election on track.",
