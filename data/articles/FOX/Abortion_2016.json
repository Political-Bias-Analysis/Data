Bush, and former first lady Laura Bush take part in the dedication of the George W. Bush presidential library on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. (AP) The last two Republicans to hold the White House do not plan to endorse the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, this year. Spokesmen for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush told The Texas Tribune Wednesday that the 41st and 43rd presidents will stay on the sideline this time. George W. Bush's personal aide, Freddy Ford, said that\u00a0his boss \"does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign.\" \"At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics,\" Bush 41 spokesman Jim McGrath wrote in an email to the website. \"He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule.\" According to the Tribune, the elder Bush has endorsed every GOP presidential nominee since losing his 1992 re-election bid to Bill Clinton. George W. Bush also campaigned on behalf of Sen. John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. Both Bushes campaigned heavily for Jeb Bush earlier this year, but he dropped out after disappointing results in the first three presidential contests. Neither former president made an endorsement during the rest of the primary season, though George W. Bush was recorded last year telling donors \"I just don't like\" Sen. Ted Cruz. The younger Bush has also taken veiled jabs at Trump, telling a South Carolina audience in February that \"we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.\" \"Strength is not empty rhetoric,\" Bush also said at the time. \"It is not bluster. It is not theatrics. Real strength, strength of purpose, comes from integrity and character. And, in my experience, the strongest person usually isn't the loudest one in the room.\" Trump also attacked George W. Bush during the run-up to the South Carolina primary, blaming the former president for failing to prevent the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. The real estate mogul also said Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq in 2003 was \"a big, fat mistake\" and claimed his administration \"lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none.\" Click for more from The Texas Tribune.",

            "article_content": "Bret Baier weighs in Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Monday evening announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, vowing to be a Washington reformer and telling potential voters that as president he would \u201cfight and win for America.\u201d The two-term governor enters a crowded 2016 field with hopes he can recapture some of his early momentum. \u201cAfter a great deal of thought and a whole lot of prayer, we are so honored to have you join with us today as we officially announce that we are running to serve as your president of the United States of America,\u201d Walker, joined by his wife and two sons, told the crowd in Waukesha, Wis. The 47-year-old Walker wasted little time in his roughly 45-minute speech getting to his successful 2011 battle with labor unions, which included a 2012 recall-election victory and which has become his political calling card. \u201cMy record shows that I know how to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know now, more than ever, that Americans need a president who can fight and win for America.\u201d Although he lacks the foreign-policy experience of others in the GOP field of 15, Walker devoted much of his speech to vowing to fix the global crises that now concern the United States -- from Russian aggression and cyber-hacking to improving strained relations with Israel and the threat of the Islamic State and other terror groups. \u201cThe U.S. needs a foreign policy that will put steel in front of our enemies,\u201d said Walker, who vowed to keep Americans and future generations safe from ISIS. \u201cThe commander in chief has a sacred duty to protect the people,\u201d he said. Speaking to Fox News' Sean Hannity hours before the U.S. and five other world powers concluded a formal nuclear deal with Iran, Walker vowed to \"terminate\" any such agreement \"on my very first day.\" \"I would then put in place crippling economic sanctions against Iran,\" Walker said, \"and I\u2019d convince our allies that this is not a country we should be doing business with.\" Walker also vowed to grow the U.S. economy as well as cut taxes and improve education by eliminating seniority and tenure, just as he did in Wisconsin. \"I think you have to take big chunks of the federal government out of Washington and send it back to the states,\" Walker told Hannity. \"Medicaid, transportation, workforce development, even education ... Think about it. The states are more effective, more efficient, and definitely more accountable to the American people.\" Earlier in the day, Walker announced his bid in an email to supporters, saying in part, \"It\u2019s time to take the successes we have created in Wisconsin and apply them to Washington.\" Walker, first elected governor in 2010, enacted policies weakening the unions' political power and became the first governor in U.S. history to defeat a recall election. He also cut income and corporate taxes by nearly $2 billion, lowered property taxes, legalized the carrying of concealed weapons, made abortions more difficult to obtain, required photo identification when voting and made Wisconsin a right-to-work state. His budget this year, which plugged a $2.2 billion shortfall when he signed it into law Sunday, requires drug screenings for public benefit recipients, expands the private school voucher program, freezes tuition at the University of Wisconsin while cutting funding by $250 million and removing tenure protections from state law. Such achievements may appeal to conservatives who hold outsized sway in Republican primaries, yet some could create challenges in a general election should Walker ultimately become the GOP's nominee. Voter ID laws, abortion restrictions, liberal gun policies and education cuts are not necessarily popular among swing-state independents. Despite his late entry, Walker has been near the top of polls since the start of the election cycle. He has nearly 11 percent of the vote, trailing front-running Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, who has roughly 16 percent, in the most recent averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com. He now travels to Nevada and Georgia and early primary states South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa. He begins the first leg of his official campaign on Tuesday in Nevada with a stop at a Harley-Davidson shop in Las Vegas. Walker has traveled overseas four times this year. His visit to Israel in May was tightly controlled, with no public appearances. He stumbled rhetorically at times during a more public London tour earlier. He faced sharp criticism for a speech in February in which he said his experience taking on thousands of protesters in his state during his battle with unions has prepared him to confront terrorists abroad. He supports Wisconsin's first-in-the-nation school voucher program. Walker extended the program statewide after its start in Milwaukee and Racine and this year proposed eliminating enrollment caps. Walker's position has varied on Common Core academic standards. He never explicitly advocated for them, but in his first state budget in 2011 he called for statewide tests that were tied to the standards. His budget this year prohibits the state superintendent from forcing local school districts to adopt the standards and calls for new standardized tests. Democrats have for months been sharpening their political attack on Walker and his announcement. On Saturday, the Democratic National Committee released an email titled \"Six facts you need to know about Scott Walker\" that included criticism about his record of job-growth in Wisconsin and his comments about how his union-related battles have made him ready to confront international terrorists. Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that Walker \u201cpromised to eliminate the deficit but his state has $2.2 billion in the red, and Walker\u2019s Wisconsin sits at the bottom in his region for job growth.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s that type of divisive, ineffective politics, and mismanagement that middle class Americans don\u2019t need any more of in Washington,\u201d she said. \u201cWalker simply has the wrong priorities for America.\" If elected, Walker would be the first president since Harry Truman, elected nearly 70 years ago, without a college degree. He attended Marquette University in Milwaukee but dropped out 34 credits short of graduation to take a Red Cross job. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ed Rollins goes 'in the ring' to determine who landed the biggest political punches Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Donald Trump has increased to seven points, as more than half of voters say he is not qualified to be president. That\u2019s according to a just-released national Fox News Poll of likely voters. Clinton receives 45 percent to Trump\u2019s 38 percent. \u00a0Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 7 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein gets 3 percent. \u00a0Last week, Clinton was up by two points in the four-way contest (44-42 percent). In the two-way matchup, it\u2019s Clinton over Trump by eight (49-41 percent). \u00a0She had a four-point edge a week ago (48-44 percent, Oct. 3-6). Clinton\u2019s lead is outside the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error in both the two-way and four-way contests. The poll, out Thursday, was conducted Monday-Wednesday. \u00a0The second presidential debate was Sunday. On Friday, The Washington Post made public a hot-mic recording of Trump from Access Hollywood. \u00a0On the same day, WikiLeaks began its release of hacked emails from the Clinton campaign, revealing more on Monday through Wednesday. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS In the four-way race, Clinton is favored among non-whites (+62 points), suburban women (+24), women (+19), and voters under 30 (+16). \u00a0Third party candidates hurt her among younger voters, as about one in four of them go for Johnson or Stein. Trump\u2019s the pick for men (+5 points), whites (+14), and whites without a college degree (+25). Since last week, the largest declines in support for him are among women ages 45 and over (down 12 points), voters ages 65+ (down 11), suburban women (down 10), white women with a college degree (down 7), GOP women (down 6), and white college graduates (down 6). Support for Trump among white evangelical Christians held steady at 68 percent. \u00a0Typically, however, about three-quarters of white evangelicals vote for the GOP nominee. \u00a0Trump\u2019s support among regular church-goers dropped eight points, from 53 to 45 percent. Independents split, giving 35 percent to each Clinton and Trump, with another 21 percent backing Johnson or Stein. \u00a0Trump was up by 12 points among independents in late September. Eighty-one percent of Democrats back Clinton and 80 percent of Republicans support Trump. \"If the Republicans are not at rock-bottom, they can certainly see the bottom from where they are,\" says GOP pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"If Trump got 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and nothing else -- no Democrats and no independents -- he'd be at 32 percent.\u201d Trump\u2019s enthusiasm advantage has evaporated: 70 percent of his backers \u201cstrongly\u201d supported him last week. \u00a0That\u2019s 63 percent now. \u00a0For Clinton, it\u2019s 66 percent, up from 57 percent. Yet the number of Republicans satisfied with Trump as their nominee is mostly unchanged: \u00a048 percent are happy with him at the top of the ticket vs. 52 percent a month ago. Among Democrats, 54 percent are happy with Clinton, while 38 percent still wish it were Bernie Sanders. Overall, 64 percent believe Clinton has the right temperament to serve effectively and 68 percent say she\u2019s qualified to be president. It\u2019s the opposite for Trump, as 63 percent think he lacks the temperament and 56 percent say he isn\u2019t qualified. \u00a0For 49 percent, he is \u201cnot at all\u201d qualified. Are the candidates good role models for children? \u00a0Voters say Clinton is (54 yes vs. 43 no). \u00a0And Trump is not (20 yes vs. 77 no). Thirty-three percent say Clinton is honest and trustworthy. \u00a0For Trump, it\u2019s 32 percent. \u00a0That\u2019s a four-point drop for him since last week. \u201cPut simply, the last week has been a disaster for Trump,\u201d says Anderson. \u00a0\u201cAnd more than ever, voters think he lacks the temperament and qualifications to be president.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal ratings also took a hit, while Clinton\u2019s improved. \u00a0More voters view her negatively than positively by five points (47 favorable vs. 52 unfavorable). \u00a0Last week she was underwater by nine. \u00a0Trump\u2019s rating stands at negative 23 (38 favorable vs. 61 unfavorable). \u00a0That\u2019s eight points more negative today, as he was underwater by 15 a week ago. Among Republicans, his favorable rating dropped 11 points, from 84 percent to 73 percent. Clinton now tops Trump on every issue tested. \u00a0More voters trust her to handle foreign policy (+24 points), health care (+13), terrorism (+11), immigration (+9), and the economy (+3). \u00a0For the past month, Trump had been the choice on the economy, and the two were about evenly matched on terrorism. Clinton is preferred to handle health care despite nearly half wanting to get rid of President Obama\u2019s signature law. \u00a0Forty-nine percent of registered voters want to repeal Obamacare vs. 45 percent who prefer to keep it in place. \u00a0That\u2019s a more positive rating for the law than the last time the Fox News Poll asked in December 2014. \u00a0Then it was 58 percent repeal and 38 percent keep. Meanwhile, a growing number expect another President Clinton. Sixty-five percent think she\u2019ll win in November. \u00a0That\u2019s 10 points higher than last week (55 percent) -- and 19 higher than June (46 percent). \u00a0Some 23 percent think Trump will win. Americans head to the polls in an even worse mood than four years ago. \u00a0In October 2012, 53 percent of registered voters were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. \u00a0Now, 59 percent are dissatisfied. Even so, 56 percent approve of the job Barack Obama is doing as president. \u00a0That\u2019s up from 52 percent a week ago -- and a record high for his second term. \u00a0Moreover, his approval has been 48 percent or better since February. Pollpourri Trump\u2019s video troubles and subsequent attacks on GOP leaders are hurting the party. \u00a0One indication is more registered voters now consider themselves a Democrat than a Republican -- by nine points (44-35 percent), compared to by four points last week (41-37 percent). Democrats usually hold an advantage over Republicans nationally in party identification, and this year self-identified Democrats have outnumbered self-identified Republicans by an average of three percentage points in Fox News polls. The poll asks likely voters to choose between the Democratic and Republican candidates in their Congressional district and finds Democrats up by six points, 48-42 percent. \u00a0Democrats were up by just one at the end of September (44-43 percent). \"The Democrats are now prohibitive favorites to win the presidency, favorites to take the Senate, and it is no longer unthinkable that they could challenge in the House,\" says Shaw. Endorsing Trump is still a net positive for Congressional candidates: 27 percent of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a Congressional candidate who refuses to endorse Trump, yet more -- 39 percent -- say they are less likely to do so. No matter who wins, voters are concerned scandals will have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on the administration: \u00a066 percent are worried about scandals in a Clinton administration and 63 percent if it\u2019s Trump. \u00a0More Democrats (54 percent) are concerned about scandals in a Clinton White House than Republicans are about a Trump administration (41 percent). Forty-eight percent of voters familiar with the video of Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks say it\u2019s a deal breaker for them. \u00a0Fifteen percent of Republicans and 40 percent of independents also feel that way. For comparison, 37 percent of voters familiar with Clinton\u2019s leaked emails say transcripts of her speeches to big Wall Street donors are a deal breaker. \u00a0That includes 11 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Sanders supporters. Trump\u2019s attacks on how Clinton has handled her husband\u2019s past controversies with women aren\u2019t sticking. \u00a0Seventy-two percent think Clinton \u201cstands up\u201d for women. \u00a0Thirty-eight percent say Trump \u201crespects\u201d women. The Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,006 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from October 10-12, 2016. \u00a0The survey includes results among 917 likely voters. \u00a0The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for results among both registered and likely voters.",

            "article_content": "Advocates and lawmakers on both sides used the decision to point to the importance of the fall election; Shannon Bream has the story for 'Special Report' A pro-abortion group that produced a video parody of a popular Jerry Seinfeld show has people on both sides of the issue asking, what is the deal? NARAL Pro-Choice released the Internet video \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Abortions\u201d on Tuesday. The format adopts the name and style of Seinfeld\u2019s popular web show \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\u201d Seinfeld was not involved with the NARAL short and a representative for the comedian declined to comment. \u201cThis may be the best pro-life ad ever made,\u201d said Dr. Grazie Pozo, a policy advisor for The Catholic Association. \u201cNARAL's video shows how radically their ideological commitment to abortion divides them from the rest of Americans. It shows perfectly the dark and joyless worldview that NARAL proposes we all ought to share, as well as their utter contempt for goodhearted people who disagree with them.\u201d Even some pro-choice watchers voiced opposition to the video. \u201cI am pro-choice. This is the most disgusting thing I have ever see,\u201d @bayo0786 wrote on Twitter. @KC_Rounder tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m called a concern troll since I\u2019m pro-choice, but often not pro-choice-organizations. This is how I got there.\u201d The video stars Alice Wetterlund, a cast member of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d and standup comic Nato Green. The pair is filmed as they drive around trying to find a location for Wetterlund to get an abortion. But they often meet \u201cbarriers the anti-choice movement creates,\u201d according to the video\u2019s YouTube description. Early on in the video, Wetterlund is asked why she wants an abortion. \u201cI want an abortion because my body is doing a thing right now, that is not incubating a person, and I would like it to continue doing that thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my choice. Okay?\u201d The pair then spots a child who appears to slap his father in the face. \u201cYea, we don\u2019t need more of this in the world,\u201d Wetterlund says. \u201cThat\u2019s the other thing.\u201d Green replies: \u201cGood point.\u201d Some of the roadblocks the two find themselves up against include a clinic that\u2019s been shut down, and mistaking a crisis pregnancy center for a clinic. A Christian woman behind the desk at the crisis center attempts to talk Wetterlund out of the abortion by saying 8-week-old babies can recognize iPhone passwords and \u201cWho needs doctors when you have the Book of Jeremiah?\u201d \u201cDid you know that if you get an abortion there\u2019s an 18 percent chance that the chance of you getting into heaven is zero percent?\u201d the woman asks as Wetterlund leaves. Mallory Quigley, the communications director for pro-life group the Susan B. Anthony List, told FoxNews.com that NARAL was \u201ctrivializing a life-ending and life-altering decision.\u201d \u201cThis video is an offense to all women: those who have had an abortion and experienced deep pain and suffering after that choice, those who are conflicted on the issue, and even NARAL\u2019s own constituents who they portray as angry and flippant,\u201d Quigley said. Near the end of the video, the pair mocks Seinfeld in yet another nod to the parody\u2019s model. \u201cWhere can a comedian get an abortion anymore?\u201d Green asks in a faux-Seinfeld voice. \u201cAre you doing Seinfeld?\u201d Wetterlund says. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t do Seinfeld.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic lawmaker: 'I represent my own values' The Senate failed Monday to advance a Republican-led measure to halt federal aid to Planned Parenthood, but leaders of the GOP-controlled chamber appear ready to continue the fight, galvanized by a series of unsettling videos about the group. The vote to bring debate on the bill was 53-46, shy of the 60 votes needed to advance. The measure had not been expected to get the 60 votes needed to move it toward a final vote because Republicans needed several \u201cyeas\u201d from Democrats, who largely support Planned Parenthood. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin was among the Democrats who voted to defund the group. Manchin, whose state has increasingly become more Republican leaning, was undecided until a few hours before the vote. \u201cI am very troubled by the callous behavior of Planned Parenthood staff in (the) recently released videos, which casually discuss the sale, possibly for profit, of fetal tissue after an abortion,\u201d he said before voting. \u201cUntil these allegations have been answered and resolved, I do not believe that taxpayer money should be used to fund this organization.\u201d Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly was the only other Democrat to vote yes. The only Republicans to vote no were Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He voted no so he could again bring up the measure. On the GOP side, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said, \"The American taxpayer should not be asked to fund an organization like Planned Parenthood that has shown a sheer disdain for human dignity and complete disregard for women and their babies.\" The first of the videos were released late last month and show group officials negotiating the price of aborted fetal tissue for research. Federal law prohibits the sale of fetal tissue for profit. And whether the officials were indeed negotiating a for-profit price, as critics charge, may never be settled. Planned Parenthood says it only recovers costs of the procedures and gives the tissue to researchers only with a mother's advance consent. However, the videos have sparked renewed efforts by pro-life organizations and others to restrict abortions and undermine Planned Parenthood. The group provides abortions and such health and family-planning services as contraception and sexual-disease treatment to roughly 2.7 million people annually, mostly women. By law, federal funds are already barred from being used for abortions except for cases of incest, rape or when a woman's life is in danger. The White House says it would block legislation to defund the group. Still, Republicans could try to gain leverage for the defund effort when Congress returns from August recess by threating to vote against spending bills to keep the government running after Sept. 30 if they include Planned Parenthood funds. GOP leaders are reluctant to force a shutdown fight that could haunt them in the 2016 elections. In 2013, firebrand Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, now a 2016 presidential candidate, led a showdown against Washington Democrats over funding for ObamaCare that resulted in a partial government shutdown that voters largely blamed on Republicans. Planned Parenthood leader Cecile Richards told Fox News on Monday that a shutdown effort would be \u201cpolitically unpopular\u201d but that her group would be prepared for such a fight. The furtively recorded videos released in July -- with close-ups of aborted fetal organs and Planned Parenthood officials describing how \"I'm not going to crush that part\" -- have forced the group and its Democratic champions into a defensive crouch. Democrats are sounding a theme they have employed in recent elections, characterizing the GOP drive as an assault on health care for women. \"It's our obligation to protect our wives, our sisters, our daughters, our granddaughters\" from the GOP's \"absurd policies,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev, said before the vote. \"The Republican Party has lost its moral compass.\" The videos were made by anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, which has so far released four videos in which people posing as representatives of a company that purchases fetal tissue converse with Planned Parenthood officials. In the longer term, GOP leaders are hoping that three congressional committees' investigations, plus probes in several states and the expected release of additional videos, will produce evidence of PlannedParenthood wrongdoing and make it harder for Democrats to defend the organization. Their measure calls for funneling Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal dollars to other providers of health care to women, including hospitals, state and local agencies and federally financed community health centers. Republicans say that transfer would enable women to continue receiving the health care they need because PlannedParenthood's nearly 700 clinics are far outnumbered by other providers. PlannedParenthood and Democrats contest that. They say many of the organization's centers are in areas with few alternatives for reproductive health care or for other services for the low-income women who comprise a majority of its clients.

            "article_content": "Anti-abortion demonstrators take part in a rally, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2016, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Friday, September 30 marks the 40th anniversary of the Hyde Amendment\u2014the appropriations legislation first introduced in 1976 by Rep. Henry Hyde for fiscal year 1977 that bars states from using federal funds to pay for abortion. The language of the Hyde Amendment, reintroduced for each budget, has changed somewhat over the years, eventually including exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and threats to a mother\u2019s life, but it consistently has stood for the principle that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for abortion on demand. This is a straightforward principle, and polling consistently shows over 60 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion. A Marist poll released this year found 68 percent of respondents oppose public funding for abortion, including 51 percent of those who consider themselves pro-choice. This is understandable. It is inconsistent with the notion of choice for people to be forced to pay for a practice they rightfully consider a grave wrong. Indeed, the Hyde Amendment enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. One might therefore think the amendment would be safe for the foreseeable future. That would be wrong, for two reasons. First, the bipartisan support shown by the political branches of government\u2014the president and Congress\u2014is apparently breaking down. ObamaCare, which passed without a single Republican vote, specifically permits public funding for plans that include abortion as long as the plans employ thinly veiled accounting gimmicks. Even more alarming, this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention adopted for the first time a platform specifically calling for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, a position Hillary Clinton took in January when she addressed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. If only my side of the aisle continues to support the amendment, its survival as a legislative matter is uncertain. Second, even if members of Congress hold firm in their support, it is possible that the popular will could be overridden by an activist Supreme Court. Recent commentary has generally ignored this possibility, but it is real. In 1977, the Court held in Maher v. Roe that Roe v. Wade \u201cimplies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.\u201d The most basic respect for the democratic process should have made it obvious that representative government could respect the people\u2019s preference for life in how it allocates their tax dollars. The vote in that case, however, was 6 to 3, and when a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment came in Harris v. McRae in 1980, the Court upheld the legislation on similar grounds by the narrowest margin of 5 to 4. The change of a single vote would have eviscerated the Hyde Amendment before its fourth anniversary. Its fate may be even more precarious today. The vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia creates the prospect for the most liberal Supreme Court in over 40 years. While none of the justices on either side of the Harris v. McRae decision are still on the Court, today\u2019s Court has shown a penchant for activism in ways that were unthinkable even during the 1970s. Consider that in 1972, a Supreme Court that included three of the four future Harris dissenters summarily rejected without a written opinion the claim of a same-sex couple that the Constitution conferred on them a right to marry. That Court did not consider the question even a close one, yet today\u2019s court has no compunction about redefining marriage for all 50 states. An unprecedentedly activist liberal Court, which could attain a supermajority given the expected retirement of additional justices over the next few years, would have an unbounded sense of what it could do by judicial fiat. We should entertain no illusions about what is at stake in the election of congressmen who vote on bills and presidents who appoint judges. We should stand committed as a country to the respect for life inherent in having our government refrain from subsidizing abortion. This includes taking extra care that we do not allow our elected leaders to staff the courts with judges who would undermine our ability to express this basic respect for life through a democratic process we can no longer take for granted.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Bottom line: in the third and final presidential debate, Trump had his best outing yet. He was calm, informed and reasonable, and managed to again put Hillary on the defensive. He will have shored up support among conservatives by taking strong stances against abortion and in favor of gun rights. But by pressing those positions, and by not addressing family or education issues, he probably gained no ground with women, and that could cost him the election. The drama of the debate, though, was that Donald Trump refused to guarantee that he will accept the outcome of the election. Instead, he said he would \u201clook at it at the time,\u201d suggesting that he might challenge the result should he suspect significant interference in the vote. Hillary Clinton excitedly denounced Trump for \u201cdenigrating democracy\u201d and with breaking with our long-standing tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. Trump\u2019s position is in keeping with recent comments made to supporters that the election might be \u201crigged,\u201d a refrain that concerns some party officials and voters. His running mate Mike Pence and his daughter Ivanka have both agreed to accept the outcome of the vote; why not The Donald? Trump is a very fast learner. The difference between his performance in the first head-to-head encounter with Hillary Clinton and the last was vast. Not only did he stay on message, but he clearly has amassed a great deal of information in a very short time. Trump may be trying to gin up turn-out amongst his supporters. In the face of a barrage of negative publicity and weaker polling, Trump may fear that his backers will be discouraged, and fail to show up at the polls. The release of the new Project Veritas tape identifying actual voter fraud, and the firing of two Democratic operatives engaged in cheating, has given the issue of a rigged election actual substance. Trump has called for people to act as poll watchers, expressly to look out for signs of foul play. What could better whip up his followers than suspicions that the Clinton camp, and the DNC, is trying to fix the vote? It\u2019s not a crazy strategy. The entire country is alert to what has become the most aggressive media onslaught ever waged against a presidential candidate. The incessant reporting of unfavorable news about Trump, much-hyped revelations about his business dealings, the resolute reluctance to report WikiLeaks emails damaging to Hillary, the revelations about cozy relations between reporters and the Clinton camp \u2013 Trump can fairly claim that the media establishment is pitted against him. Add to that recent reports of Democratic operatives inciting violence at Trump rallies \u2013 violence which became central to Hillary\u2019s theme that Trump was \u201cdangerous\u201d and could not be trusted with the nuclear code \u2013 and there are reasons to be skeptical that the political playing field is level. Much of the recent assault on Trump, such as the great attention paid to the video of his lewd remarks about women or the days of coverage given to his contretemps with the former beauty queen, has appeared geared to depressing turnout by Trump voters. Hillary\u2019s operatives are extremely concerned that her voters won\u2019t show up because her unfavorables \u2013 like Trump\u2019s \u2013 are so high. They have sent one emissary after another \u2013 including President and Mrs. Obama \u2013 out to goad African-Americans, Hispanics and other members of the Obama coalition into going to the polls. What\u2019s even more effective? Making sure that Trump backers don\u2019t show up either. So perhaps Trump is engaging in tit for tat. Sadly, because of the media\u2019s very real bias, Trumps\u2019 comments will be portrayed as just more evidence of recklessness. Lost in the coverage will be mention of the Project Veritas recording or the firing of the Democrat apparatchiks. Pundits will be \u201cdismayed\u201d by Trump\u2019s \u201cwhining\u201d as President Obama described it. Lost will be the other real news of debate: Trump is a very fast learner. The difference between his performance in the first head-to-head encounter with Hillary Clinton and the last was vast. Not only did he stay on message, but he clearly has amassed a great deal of information in a very short time. \u00a0He spoke about Aleppo and ObamaCare, the economy and the Supreme Court with confidence. He will never match Hillary\u2019s mastery of policy detail; he doesn\u2019t need to. He just needs to sound competent, and he did. Moreover, Hillary was not in command.\u00a0 She failed to answer a question about apparent pay to play\u00a0 while she was Secretary of State, instead ranting on about the virtues of the Clinton Foundation that was finally interrupted by Chris Wallace. No one was fooled. Republicans cheered; finally, a moderator brought up the unholy history of the Clinton Foundation. Trump went after Hillary on the failures of policies towards Syria, Iraq and Libya. He again noted that she has been near the center of power for thirty years \u2013 time to have made some of the changes she has now promised to undertake. He again accused her and other Democrats of reaching out to blacks and Hispanics only every four years, when they need their votes. And, of course, he hit her over and over on trade, associating her with husband Bill\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d NAFTA deal. For her part, Hillary repeated worn lines denigrating Trump, accusing him of shipping jobs to Mexico and China by buying cheap imports for his projects (at least he created some jobs along the way), of belittling women, minorities and the disabled, of wanting to cut taxes for the wealthy, of suggesting we sunder our relations with staunch allies and of being in league with Putin. Trump was more successful in deflecting such charges than in the past, partly because he is better informed. When Hillary was confronted with WikiLeaked comments about her dream of \u201copen trade and open borders\u201d she immediately revisited her meme about Putin and Trump being in cahoots. Trump noted drily \u201cThat was quite a pivot\u201d, and indeed it was. Will Trump\u2019s better performance close Hillary\u2019s lead in the polls? It may help. Summing up, he said the country \u201ccannot afford four more years of Obama.\u201d That is the truth, and the most powerful message in Trump\u2019s arsenal.",

            "article_content": "June 8, 2016: Opponents of a proposed sugary drink tax demonstrate outside City Hall in Philadelphia. (AP) Local governments are always thirsty for revenue \u2013 and their taste for a soda tax keeps getting stronger, fueling a new battle this fall with America's beverage industry. Boosted in part by anti-soda warrior and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, proponents are trying to get a tax on sugary drinks approved at the ballot box in at least four more municipalities. The initiatives mark a resurgence of sorts for the soda tax crusade. According to the American Beverage Association, voters have rejected 43 such measures in the past eight years. But in a major win for the movement, the Philadelphia City Council approved a 1.5-cents-per-ounce soda tax this past June. Now, three California municipalities \u2013 San Francisco, Oakland and Albany \u2013 are slated to vote on a soda tax of a penny per ounce. Boulder, Colo., could double that, if voters OK a 2-cents-per-ounce tax. The initiatives, which have been approved for the ballot, target sugary drinks. Advocates cite health benefits in pushing the proposals. \u201cThe goal of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages is to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which science has proven to be directly correlated to detrimental health impacts such as diabetes, obesity and heart diseases,\u201d San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Malia Cohen told FoxNews.com. Bloomberg, often ridiculed for his efforts to ban the big gulp in his home city, spent $1.6 million to advocate for the passage of the Philadelphia tax and reportedly will be bankrolling efforts in San Francisco and Oakland as well. But the American Beverage Association is staunchly opposed. ABA spokeswoman Lauren Kane said the Philadelphia tax is highly unpopular and shouldn\u2019t be a model for any other city. \u201cThis is a regressive tax, it raises the price of groceries and it\u2019s discriminatory because it singles out a single product in the grocery cart,\u201d Kane told FoxNews.com. \u201cOnce the government reaches into the grocery cart, everything else is vulnerable.\u201d The beverage association contends that soda consumption is at a 30-year low, yet obesity has continued to climb in recent years. Further, it notes West Virginia, Arkansas and Tennessee all imposed some soda tax, but rank among the most obese states in the nation. \u201cThere is no single product that is responsible for obesity,\u201d Kane said. So far, only Berkeley, Calif., has enacted such a tax with voter approval, OK\u2019ing a 1-cent-per-ounce tax in the 2014 election. If a city the size of San Francisco adopts a tax at the ballot box, it could be a model for others, advocates hope. \u201cSan Francisco has always been a pioneer in landmark legislation and I have no doubt the passage of a sugary beverage tax in San Francisco will encourage other municipalities to seriously consider implementing a similar tax,\u201d said Cohen, who led the effort to have the measure placed on the ballot. San Francisco would appear the most likely to adopt the measure since 56 percent of voters backed a proposed 2 percent tax increase in 2014. It needed a two-thirds majority to pass because the tax revenue was dedicated for a specific purpose. This year, it\u2019s a proposed 1 cent-per-ounce tax that requires only a simple majority, since the revenue would be going to the general fund. If approved, the tax is projected to bring in $14.4 million annually \u2013 money supposedly to be used for health and nutrition programs. Therein lies another concern. Kane said the revenue would be going into the general budget \u201cwith no strings attached\u201d \u2013 so voters wouldn\u2019t even know if the revenue would be used \u201cto fight obesity.\u201d The ABA has a formidable foe in Bloomberg. He telegraphed his plans in a statement issued after the Philadelphia tax victory. \u201cIn November, voters in\u00a0three California cities\u00a0will take up the issue, and it may also come before voters in Boulder, Colorado,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cWhen cities lead the way, solutions that were once considered non-starters can quickly catch fire and spread around the world. It would not be the first revolution Philadelphia has sparked.\u201d The issue even worked its way into presidential politics this year. After eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said she was \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the Philadelphia proposal in April, her opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote an op-ed for Philadelphia Magazine calling it a \u201cregressive grocery tax that would disproportionately affect low-income and middle-class Americans.\u201d Cohen objects to the charge of a regressive tax. \u201cWhat this assumption ignores is the fact Type 2 Diabetes is a\u00a0regressive disease,\u201d Cohen told FoxNews.com. \u201cAt today\u2019s rate, 50 percent of African American youth vs. 25 percent White youth will contract Type II Diabetes in their lifetime. This is not a coincidence and we must do something today to address this crisis.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Insight from Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Hillary Clinton hasn't been the Democratic nominee for even a day, and already the party's newly anointed 2016 ticket is facing questions over flip-flopping on key issues \u2013 immediately drawing fire from Donald Trump, who accused Clinton of betraying her supporters. Clinton and vice presidential pick Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., grappled with claims of flip-flopping on both the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and federal funding of abortion. Longtime Clinton ally and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told Politico late Tuesday that he believes Clinton will ultimately support the TPP, with some tweaks. When asked if Clinton would come around now that she is the nominee, McAuliffe said: \u201cYes. Listen, she was in support of it. There were specific things in it she wants fixed.\u201d Killing the deal has become a rallying cry for supporters of Bernie Sanders, many of whom arrived in Philadelphia carrying signs with the letters \"TPP\" crossed out.\u00a0Sanders claims the deal would benefit big corporations, while sending jobs abroad and lowering wages. Clinton, who once supported the proposal, tried to muffle that outcry during the primary season by reversing her support, in a rare break with the Obama administration. Yet that was before Sanders\u2019 plucky revolution was formally quashed Tuesday night. As McAuliffe's remarks caused a stir overnight, his spokesman later walked them back, and said the governor was merely expressing what he hoped Clinton would do as president and that he has \u201cno expectation\u201d that Clinton would change her position. The Clinton campaign also flatly denied the claim, saying McAuliffe \u201cgot this one flat wrong.\u201d The back-and-forth drew immediate fire from Trump, who has also opposed the deal, accusing Clinton of betraying her supporters. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. \u201cJust like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP,\u201d the billionaire tweeted. The controversy came as her vice presidential pick, Virginia Sen. Kaine, is changing his position on an amendment that restricts the use of federal funds for abortions. An aide confirmed to Fox News Tuesday that Kaine, who is Catholic and says he is personally opposed to abortion, has made a commitment to Clinton that he will support the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. Kaine has a mostly pro-choice record in the Senate, but has made an exception for the Hyde Amendment. Kaine\u2019s change in position comes as a new Knights of Columbus-Marist poll shows 62 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortion. Forty-four percent of Democrats, 84 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of independents oppose the funding, according to the poll. Fox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel and Shannon Bream contributed to this report.",

And, no, not because of their hand gestures. In the final round of \u201cSuper Sloppy Double Dare\u201d that was the GOP nominating process, Kasich argued that he should be the nominee because he handily beat Hillary Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups while now-presumptive nominee Donald Trump consistently lagged. Now, Sanders who is, as Kasich was, out of the running for the nomination is asking his party to throw over the frontrunner for the sake of general election viability. And there\u2019s data to back him up. In this week\u2019s Fox News poll and the most recent NYT/CBS News poll, Sanders outperforms Clinton against Trump. And it had been true for Kasich, too. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. First, any Democrat without her enormous negative ratings would match up better with Trump than Clinton does. Throw Martin O\u2019Malley or even an imaginary candidate (insofar as those are different concepts) in a poll, and you might see a similar result. And that\u2019s because those candidates haven\u2019t been the target of millions of dollars in attack ads or even garnered much in the way of media scrutiny. These are not just hypothetical matchups, they are, in many ways, hypothetical candidates. Head-to-head matchup polls in primaries can be useful if you\u2019re talking about frontrunners and/or candidates who have been substantially defined in the minds of voters. Then there\u2019s the question of how the process shapes the product. Competing for your party\u2019s nomination definitely can damage your reputation. Lordy day, it can. But, there is also a payoff at the end of the line, as the party swings in behind its man or woman. So it\u2019s not just that Sanders\u2019 head-to-head matchups with Trump aren\u2019t reflective of the general-election reality, neither are Clinton\u2019s. The current Trump bump is real. The NYT/CBS News poll tells the tale: Eight in 10 Republicans said that the party should unite behind him, despite their disagreements. And in his battle with Clinton, Trump is getting the same post-victory boost his predecessor, Mitt Romney, got four years ago. After a primary season of unrivaled acrimony, the realities of the binary choice of the general election are setting in. The big question now is what Clinton\u2019s bounce will look like. It will certainly be there. Eighty percent of Democrats in the poll said that party unity was essential to victory and 83 percent said Clinton could do that. For Republicans, just 63 percent said unity was essential to victory and just 64 percent believed Trump could deliver on that task. That discrepancy helps explain Trump\u2019s deficit in this survey. What we must wait to see is how big a boost Clinton will get \u2013 perhaps less than Trump considering that her party is already more united. We also can\u2019t know whether the surge in partisan loyalty we see for Trump today will last, or if the party\u2019s underlying fracture will reassert itself. The answers to both sets of questions will depend on how well Clinton and Trump traverse the eight weeks until convention time.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton waves to the audience as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump puts his notes away after the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/John Locher) (The Associated Press) NEW YORK \u2013 Bitter presidential rivals Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have one more face-to-face showdown before Election Day. And they're supposed to make it funny. The venue Thursday night just 24 hours after their third and final debate is the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, a white-tie gala that every four years becomes a showcase for presidential politics. Tradition dictates that the candidates deliver humorous remarks poking fun at each other and themselves, a jovial custom that seems hard to envision amid such an ugly campaign. Trump regularly calls Clinton, \"Crooked Hillary,\" says he'd put her in jail if he wins the presidency, and declared during Wednesday's debate that she was \"a nasty woman.\" Clinton says Trump lives in his own reality, is running a \"hateful, divisive campaign\" and lacks the temperament to be president. They will sit just one seat apart for the evening, with New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan acting as the only buffer. \"I certainly expect that the dinner will be what it's always been: an opportunity for two candidates to put aside partisan politics for the evening,\" said Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, which hosts the dinner. \"I anticipate that we will have good humor and civility that this dinner has been always been known for.\" The unprecedentedly bitter campaign between Clinton and Trump could threaten the ecumenical goodwill that has defined previous roasts. Since 1960, at least one of the major party nominees has appeared at nearly every election year dinner, which is traditionally the last time the nominees share a stage before voters go to the polls. Four years ago, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney set aside their differences to trade (mostly) warm jokes. Romney, scanning the well-heeled crowd in the gilded Waldorf-Astoria ballroom, joked that the event's white-tie attire finally gave him a chance to publicly don what \"Ann and I wear around the house.\" Obama, meanwhile, used his speech that year to look ahead to an upcoming debate on foreign policy, previewing his argument by saying \"Spoiler alert: we got Bin Laden.\" Trump will speak first Thursday night, then Clinton. Neither campaign opted to preview their candidate's remarks and aides for both declined comment on the evening other than to confirm that each nominee will be there. The evening might feel familiar to Trump, who infamously glowered through Obama's jokes at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner and is not known for being self-deprecating. Last weekend, he tweeted that he did not appreciate Saturday Night Live's portrayal of him in a sendup of the candidates' performances in the second presidential debate. This is the first time that both party's nominees hail from New York State as a crowd of about 1,500 gathers for the distinctly Gotham event, held each October. Attendees pay between $3,000 and $15,000 to attend the dinner, which raises about $5 million to provide services for impoverished children, Zwilling said. Though normally light-hearted, hot-button issues \u2014 most notably abortion \u2014 have occasionally intruded on the night. In 2004, the candidates did not attend after the Catholic Archdiocese of New York agonized over whether Democratic nominee John Kerry, a Catholic who supports abortion rights, should be invited. Abortion rights had been a back-burner issue this election, but Trump and Clinton sparred over it Wednesday. The dinner is named after the former New York governor, who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran in 1928. And fittingly for an event named after a man nicknamed \"The Happy Warrior,\" the occasion has produced dozens of memorable presidential jokes. In 2000, then-Texas Governor George W. Bush gazed upon the glitzy gathering and declared: \"This is an impressive crowd, the haves and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite. I call you my base.\" That same year, Vice President Al Gore touted his campaign trail ability to weave in stories \"of real people in the audience and their everyday challenges.\" \"Like the woman here tonight whose husband is about to lose his job,\" Gore continued. \"She's struggling to get out of public housing and get a job of her own. Hillary Clinton, I want to fight for you.\" And in 2008, John McCain joked about the exalted manner in which the media venerated Obama, noting that \"'Maverick' I can do, but 'Messiah' is above my pay grade.\" But he wound down his remarks with a note of grace that, to this point, has been largely absent from the 2016 campaign. \"I can't wish my opponent luck,\" McCain said, turning toward Obama, \"but I do wish him well.\" ___ Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire ___ Chart the path Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton must take on the Road to 270 to reach the White House with AP's Electoral College interactive map: http://elections.ap.org/content/road-270-0",

            "article_content": "Debate over the undercover footage on 'Hannity' Hidden camera footage shot by a pro-life group and leaked online despite a court order purportedly shows a Michigan abortion provider talking about dumping fetuses in a garbage disposal, giving them back to patients in a \u201cgift bag\u201d and even burning them for heat. U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a restraining order in August barring the Center for Medical Progress from releasing a host of undercover videos shot at National Abortion Federation conferences in 2013, 2014 and 2015. But on Oct. 6 Orrick allowed CMP to send the footage to a House committee investigating Planned Parenthood, and that footage was leaked to blog GotNews.com later in the month. CMP officials deny being the source of the leak. The 11 new videos comprise more than four-and-a-half hours of footage covertly shot during seminars and one-on-one conversations with individuals in the abortion industry. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019ll give it to everybody in a gift bag, they can take it home and figure out what to do with it.'\" Some of the most ghastly moments come from a woman identified as Renee Chelian by non-profit Right to Life Michigan. In footage shot in April 2014, Chelian, who owns a chain of abortion clinics in Michigan and is not affiliated with Planned Parenthood, addresses an audience and discusses her frustrations trying to dispose of five months of backlogged fetal remains. \u201cThe garbage disposal was the completely legal option,\u201d Chelian says. \u201cWhich made me sick to my stomach because there were about 45 clinics in the Detroit metropolitan area and many of them were using garbage disposals, so I was busy contacting everyone that we have to stop, [saying], 'We can\u2019t be on the front page of The New York Times. You shouldn\u2019t be doing this, any of you.' \"They consistently showed me, like, a 40-year-old law in the state of Michigan that said medical waste was fine to go in the sewer system,\" she added. \"I couldn\u2019t really argue with them.\u201d Her efforts to find a solution took her to various funeral homes and pet crematoriums, and she also investigated using \u201cgreen technology\u201d that functioned \u201clike a dishwasher,\u201d in which the operator adds a chemical and the fetal remains are then drained into the sewer system. Eventually, she says in the footage, Chelian paid someone to dispose of 20 bottles of fetal remains \u201cinto my garbage disposal.\u201d \u201cWe were really tempted to give the fetus back, but of course we couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Chelian said. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019ll give it to everybody in a gift bag, they can take it home and figure out what to do with it. It\u2019s their pregnancy and why is this our problem?\u2019\u201d She drew roars of laughter for her \u201cgift bag\u201d idea from the crowd listening and also elicited howls for a sarcastic plot to burn the aborted babies in a \u201cbonfire\u201d in the woods. During a question-and-answer session, a woman from Vancouver, Canada mentions that her abortion facility ships its fetal remains to \u201ca waste energy facility\u201d in Oregon where the tissue is burned to provide energy. \u201cIt seems like a really good solution!\u201d Chelian interjects. Chelian regretfully opines that abortion providers are \u201cafraid to tell the truth\u201d and \u201ceverything is a secret\u201d when it comes to disposing of dead baby parts. The Marion County Waste-to-Energy Facility in Oregon alluded to by the questioner denied in April 2014 that the plant was using fetal remains in its garbage burning operation. \u201cWe\u2019re not burning babies,\u201d Vice President of Marketing and Communications Jill Stueck told the Portland Tribune at the time. But whether that specific example is true or not, the concept is rooted in reality. The Oregon allegations came just a month after multiple British news outlets reported that 10 National Health Service hospital trusts admitted to burning aborted and miscarried fetuses alongside trash to generate power for heating. Ed Rivet, the Legislative Director for Right to Life Michigan, said Chelian\u2019s story is indicative of practices prevalent in the abortion industry. \u201cThey\u2019ve been cutting corners for decades,\u201d Rivet told FoxNews.com. \u201cAnd they\u2019re trying to keep the prices artificially cheap, and the only way to do that it is to lower your standards and not do things the way the rest of the medical world does.\u201d Previous videos shot by CMP have appeared to show Planned Parenthood officials admitting the organization alters abortion procedures to procure fetal tissue, delivers intact fetuses and sells fetal tissue for profit. Each of those practices is against federal law. Planned Parenthood has denied breaking any laws and has said payments discussed in the videos relate to reimbursement costs for procuring the tissue \u2013 which is legal. Earlier this month, Planned Parenthood announced it would stop taking money from researchers for aborted baby parts. The videos have spurred investigations of Planned Parenthood's policies on aborted fetuses by several Republican-led congressional committees including a newly announced select committee.",

After all it\u2019s not like supporting anything called \u2018partial-birth abortion\u2019 is a political winner. The answer is the same as why Republicans resist new gun control laws of any kind, even those that have popular support. Any restriction on abortion that is tied to the humanness of an unborn child is the ultimate in slippery-slopes for the pro-choice crowd. As Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood, arrives on Capitol Hill to testify about a series of shocking videos that depict the business of harvesting and selling the body parts of aborted babies, she and the 60-year-old pro-choice movement are at a crossroads. In some ways, things have never been better. A WSJ/NBC News poll shows 61 percent of respondents opposed ending the half-billion-dollar subsidy Planned Parenthood gets from federal taxpayers, which Republicans are trying to do. And for the first time since 2008, the pro-choice position has a clear lead on the pro-life point of view in Gallup\u2019s polling. [Nerd alert: A pro-choice majority or plurality was the norm for decades until pro-lifers moved into the lead, or parity. This may be a little misleading, however, since \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-choice\u201d are fungible terms. More significant is what restrictions, if any, do voters want to see on elective abortions? There things are pretty stable, which is the plurality position remains that abortion should be \u201clegal in only a few circumstances.\u201d This mirrors the political position shorthanded as \u201cpro-life, with exceptions.\u201d]Despite the national furor over the videos from the Center for Medical Progress Republican efforts to cut off the funding seem not only doomed to fail, but Richards & Co. promise to make the GOP pay a steep political price next year for a \u201crelentless assault\u201d on reproductive healthcare. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, got booed by his colleagues Monday night for a stunt aimed at naming and shaming his fellow Republicans who refused to back his plan to defund Planned Parenthood. Cruz, and some others, want to make the defunding a condition of an emergency provision to keep the government fully operational for 10 weeks beyond Thursday\u2019s fiscal cliff. The boo birds were squawking because they don\u2019t want to be on the record supporting a stop gap spending plan that Cruz and his allies will say \u201cfunds Planned Parenthood,\u201d or in favor of a measure that Planned Parenthood would say \u201cdefunds Planned Parenthood.\u201d So you can see why pro-choice activists are feeling optimistic. They have seemingly survived the video scandals, their Republican detractors are tied in knots, and Democrats are solidly on board. But wait. Hillary Clinton told NBC News that she was \u201copen\u201d to restrictions on late term abortion. That\u2019s not exactly uncharted territory for Clinton, who at times has voiced support for very limited restrictions. However, Clinton\u2019s voting record in the Senate reflects an aggressively pro-choice stance, including opposing a ban on partial-birth abortion. Now remember, what Clinton means by \u201clate-term\u201d is quite different then it\u2019s commonly understood. She\u2019s talking about \u201cthe very end of the third trimester.\u201d It\u2019s not a profile in political courage for a Democrat to say they are okay with limited restrictions on elective abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, but it has meaning in this political moment. Pro-choicers have tormented Democrats to take yucky stances on abortion because they know that an acknowledgment of the humanity of an unborn child leads to disaster for their movement. If Clinton would forbid the abortion of a pregnancy in the ninth month why not the eighth, or the seventh, or the sixth\u2026 That\u2019s what Carly Fiorina knows. And that\u2019s why she is absolutely cudgeling Democrats over the videos. Any acknowledgement of immorality or even moral unpleasantness in the work of America\u2019s largest abortion provider is a gateway to ruin for Planned Parenthood.PRICE LOOKS RIGHT FOR MAJORITY LEADERNational Journal: \u201cMajority Whip Steve Scalise became the House\u2019s third-ranking Republican by touting Southern pride and conservative bona fides.

            "article_content": "The GOP nominee rolled out new policies, while focusing on the improving polls; John Roberts with the Republican roundup for 'Special Report' Donald Trump says he believes women should be able to obtain birth control without a prescription. Speaking on an episode of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" airing Thursday, the Republican nominee suggested that, for many women, obtaining a prescription can be challenging. \"I would say it should not be prescription,\" he told the audience, adding that many women \"just aren't in a position to go get a prescription.\" The GOP's 2016 platform says it opposes the FDA's \"endorsement of over-the-counter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physician's recommendation.\" The comment comes days after Trump unveiled a plan aimed at making childcare more affordable for women and as he works to boost his poll numbers with women. Polls show women favoring Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, though Trump does better than her with men. Trump has sometimes stumbled when it comes to reproductive health issues. During the Republican primary, he was criticized for saying that, if it the abortion were to be outlawed, women should be punished for having them. He later said that providers, not women, should be the ones who face penalties. While Trump was more liberal in his views on social issues when he was younger, he now opposes abortion rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists declared support for nonprescription birth control pills in 2012, but some groups oppose the measure because of the health risks associated with them. Insurance also doesn't cover over-the-counter drugs, which could make the pills far more expensive. Dawn Laguens, the Executive Vice President of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, warned that such a move would \"put access to birth control out of reach for millions of women by making it more expensive.\" \"Women shouldn't have to choose between paying for birth control or buying groceries for the month,\" she added in a statement. NARAL Pro-Choice also voiced opposition, accusing Trump of fighting policies \"that actually help women.\" Spokeswoman Kaylie Hanson Long said in a statement that such a move \"could deny women coverage of birth control altogether.\" \"Out of one side of his mouth, he makes a claim that he's helping women, but out of the other side, he's actively working to dismantle the greatest expansion of contraceptive coverage of our time,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Senior communications adviser Jason Miller: Trump's putting voter fraud on notice **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0Trump couldn\u2019t resist -\u00a0Time Out: Turns out, we knew the whole time\u00a0- Brazile denies getting question ahead of time for March town hall -\u00a0Audible: Missed it by that much -\u00a0Not so tough now, uh? TRUMP COULDN\u2019T RESIST LAS VEGAS \u2013\u00a0Henry Clay\u00a0famously said that he would rather be right than be president. So for at least 160 years people have known that those two things are often mutually exclusive. Somebody should have hipped\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0to Clay\u2019s insight before the Republican nominee took the stage here in his final debate with\u00a0Hillary Clinton. Should the polls hold, we will remember Trump\u2019s response about perhaps not accepting the outcome of the election as one of the final inflection points of the 2016 campaign. If the election were held today, Trump would probably lose by something more than 11 million votes nationally. There wouldn\u2019t be enough vote sheets to steal an election that lopsided if all of America was as crooked as Logan County, W.Va. But still, Trump is litigating the question of whether the election could be stolen from him. Why? Trump\u2019s debate performance was, overall, his best so far. He was helped enormously by the stayed and sobersided moderation (quite so!) of\u00a0Chris Wallace. By keeping the audience under control and focusing on substantive issues from the start, Wallace offered both candidates a chance to elevate their games and be presidential. Trump\u2019s base may have been somewhat disappointed that their man was, at first at least, more measured than the previous two debates. But for a period of time it seemed as if there was a minor miracle in the making: Trump the unruffled. But Clinton knew what to do. She began needling him about his business failures and Trump started to come out of his presidential persona. By the end of the debate, Clinton had him in a full froth, calling her a \u201cnasty woman,\u201d talking over her and, most damagingly, defying good sense. Trump has been trying to keep his supporters onboard by telling them that what they see with their eyes is not real. He is not losing, but rather the polls are rigged. He is not being accused by multiple women of sexual assault, but rather is a victim of a conspiracy between the Clinton campaign and the press. And, in the most significant reimagining of reality, says that even if he does lose when the election is over it will be because of fraud. Even if Trump believed in what he has said is \u201clarge scale\u201d voter fraud, what would possess him to say in a debate that he might not abide by the results of the election? It must be hubris. You could almost feel the collective groan from Republicans as Trump dove headlong into the pool of a contested election. At the very best, the subject was a gift to headline writers looking for a way to sum up the debate and a gift to Democrats eager to portray Trump as a danger to the republic. Today, rather than talking about Trump\u2019s solid responses on abortion and immigration, he and his campaign are instead, trying to say why it is okay meddle with the concept of peaceful and orderly transfer of power. Hearing Trump surrogates explaining that election fraud is real and that Democrats, especially\u00a0Al Gore, have messed with election results too, is a testament to how far afield Trump has taken his campaign with just a couple of sentences. This is not the right space for a candidate in Trump\u2019s position. It reinforces the perfectly prepared response Clinton had in the debate for Trump\u2019s electoral conspiracy, pointing out that Trump has often seen rigged systems, including when he was denied an Emmy for his work as a reality television show host. Vice presidential nominee\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0has said repeatedly that he and Trump will abide by the verdict of the voters, making Trump\u2019s claims even more confounding. The simple answer seems to be that Trump did not want to have to admit that he might lose and that he was wrong about claims that the election would be stolen from him. On Wednesday, we imagined what Trump\u2019s fantasy debate would look like. Today, imagine what the news would look like if Trump had simply said \u201cOf course I will abide by the will of the voters.\u201d That would not in any way deprive Trump of the right of a full and fair counting of the ballots after Election Day or to press any legal remedy in the event of a narrow defeat. And it would have reassured anxious voters. Throughout this campaign Clinton and Trump have been agreed on one issue: that the election should be about Donald Trump. It seemed for a time on Wednesday that he was changing course on that subject, but in the end, could not hold out. THE RULEBOOK: FOR AND BY THE PEOPLE\u201cAnother and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all but the people themselves.\u201d\u2013\u00a0Alexander Hamilton,\u00a0Federalist No. 70 TIME OUT: TURNS OUT, WE KNEW THE WHOLE TIMEThe Independent: \u201cA theory that explains why it gets dark at night \u2013 dismissed by scientists for 200 years \u2013 has been proved right by new\u00a0researchusing images from the\u00a0Hubble Space Telescope. German\u00a0astronomer\u00a0Heinrich Olbersfamously pondered the \u2018dark sky paradox\u2019: if there was an infinite number of stars in the universe, how could it get dark at night as every point in the sky would contain a star. He suggested clouds of\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0could be blocking the light\u2026And Professor\u00a0Christopher Conselice, a Nottingham university astrophysicist, who took part in the Hubble study, said: \u2018The extra factor of 10 or more [times the number of galaxies] is able to fill in the sky with stars.\u00a0But most of that light, or all of the light from the most distant galaxies, is being absorbed by hydrogen gas which is between us and them.\u2019\u201d Flag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questions SCOREBOARD\u00a0 Average of national head-to-head presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump: Clinton +9 points [Polls included:\u00a0Quinnipiac University,\u00a0Bloomberg,\u00a0Fox News,\u00a0Monmouth University\u00a0andCBS News.] Average of national four-way presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump vs. Johnson vs. Stein: Clinton +8.6 points [Polls included:\u00a0Quinnipiac University,\u00a0Bloomberg,\u00a0Fox News,\u00a0Monmouth University\u00a0andCBS News.] BRAZILE DENIES GETTING QUESTION AHEAD OF TIME FOR MARCH TOWN HALLFox News: \u201cInterim Democratic Party Chairwoman\u00a0Donna Brazilevehemently denied receiving a question about the death penalty and tipping off the Hillary Clinton campaign prior to a March town hall hosted by CNN and TV One. The revelation came after WikiLeaks released a batch of emails from Clinton campaign chairman\u00a0John Podesta\u00a0last week. The day after apparently receiving the question it was provided by TV One\u2019s\u00a0Roland Martin\u00a0verbatim to CNN. \u2018I\u2019m not going to try and validate falsified information,\u2019 Brazile told\u00a0Fox News\u2019\u00a0Megyn Kelly\u00a0after the third presidential debate. \u2018I have my documents. I have my files. Thank god I haven\u2019t had my emails ripped off from me and stolen and given to some criminal to come back altered.\u2019 The leaked email showed that Brazile wrote in the subject line \u2018From time to time I get the questions in advance\u2019 and Kelly added that CNN said Martin, or someone at TV One, had given them to Brazile. \u2018As far as I know, CNN has never provided me with questions\u2026ever,\u2019 Brazile responded.\u2019\u201d THE REVIEWS ARE IN Jonah Goldberg: Trump started strong, but couldn\u2019t sustain -\u00a0NRO:\u201cMuch like the first debate \u2014 and grading on the Trump Curve\u00ae \u2014 Trump had a good start. He started more disciplined, and sustained that discipline longer, than in any other debate. He won on many issues, particularly abortion (though most of the credit for that goes to Chris Wallace who actually asked a question about partial birth abortion). But, about 30 minutes in, Trump started interrupting and showboating. It wasn\u2019t much at first, but it got worse and worse.\u201d Jonathan Chait: Trump has proved he\u2019s not fit to serve -\u00a0NY Magazine: \u201cHillary Clinton has used all three presidential debates to make the case that Donald Trump is unfit for office. Trump has proven himself unable to recognize this strategy, or to learn from his failures, or to change his behavior in any way. All three followed the same pattern. Trump began the debate by projecting something approximate to a normal Republican \u2014 which is to say, an angry reactionary within normal bounds. Then Clinton began to prod and bait him, and as the evening unspooled, he progressively lost his composure.\u201d Doug Schoen: Trump\u2019s best debate \u2018by far\u2019 -\u00a0Fox News: \u201cThe evening was by far and away his best performance. Trump hit on all the major themes that his campaign is built upon: economic growth, strong national security, fighting illegal immigration, changing the direction of the country by fighting special interests, corruption and bureaucracy as well as ensuring a Conservative Supreme Court. He had especially good moments in criticizing Clinton\u2019s foreign policy record and her email practices as well as Obama\u2019s failed policies at home and abroad.\u201d THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: LIBERTY NATURAL TO OUR HUMANITYFox News\u2019 Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano\u00a0cautions\u00a0about a government that infringes too much on our personal freedoms and suggests that liberty may be tied to our humanity itself:\u00a0\u201cWhat if all rational people yearn for personal freedom?

[Ed. note: Not only have I not thought about not running for president, I have thought often of the horrors that befall those seeking that office. A broad public misconception is that the presidency is a matter of great privileged. While it is an honor for these men to have served their republic, the vicissitudes of the office are punishing indeed, but even worse than the pain of the presidency is the punishment of running. Millions of Americans this year have wondered about their choices: \u201cCan\u2019t we do better than this?\u201d But given what we subject office seekers to it\u2019s amazing that anybody halfway sane runs at all.] \u201cI know you are paying close attention to all things political right now and likely know much more about these crazy political times we are facing. Your perspective is usually on target and aligned with my own.\u00a0Your\u00a0Scoreboard\u00a0may be right, but lately it confounds me. These days your outlook seems to reflect your total disdain for Trump; to the point of seeming that you would rather Hillary make it to the White House. That most certainly would fracture what is left of our democracy! Your suggestion that Trump \u2018be nice\u2019 in tonight\u2019s debate would actually be refreshing\u2026but that wouldn\u2019t get him anything.\u00a0 Hillary is going to snipe and debase as only she knows how.\u00a0 If he is nice, the world will see him as weak and hopeless.\u00a0 This approach for him would be suicide.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Pat Dwight, Lake Forest, Calif. [Ed. note: Well, now we will never know! I continue to believe that Trump\u2019s problem with voters stems from their anxieties about his demeanor and temperament. Elections are not won by winning arguments. In fact, if you are arguing at all, you are probably losing. The goal in a campaign is to make your point of view known clearly to voters and, more importantly, make yourself known to them as a person who understands their concerns and is worthy of their trust. Trump did not seem to think it was possible for him to elevate the public\u2019s perception of him and instead has focused on trying to bring down public opinion of Clinton. It\u2019s hard to see that working, given the degree to which the press is arrayed against Trump, and his own facility for serving up juicy meatballs of self-destructive behavior.] \u201cLast Sunday on your show you presented a slide that said basically\u00a0single\u00a0women tend to vote Democrat, why do you suppose that is the case?\u00a0\u00a0I really enjoy your data dives and charts!\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of which party wins, the country will continue to be a divided country with neither party capable of bringing us together.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Don Keener, Mason, Texas [Ed. note: Thanks for diving in with us, Mr. Keener! The whole story is that single people are less Republican than married people of both genders. About 60 percent of the electorate is married and Republicans do better with married voters overall. 2012 exit polls show Romney won among all men by 7 points, but among married men by 22 points. So really there is a marriage gap more than there is a gender gap. The challenge for Republicans is that with delayed ages of marriage, voters spend longer as singles and therefore have different sets of concerns. The core Republican issues on national security, economic growth and limited government sell much better to suburban families than they do with urban single professionals.] Share your color commentary:\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0and please make sure to include your name and hometown.

Trump gan\u00f3 las elecciones primarias en Oregon, con lo que se acerca a 76 delegados de asegurar la nominaci\u00f3n del partido. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) I want to address the crisis of conscience that many conservative evangelicals face when wrestling with what to do with Donald Trump. As a pastor, I have been party to countless conversations among fellow Christians about whether to support Mr. Trump, or not. While I do not endorse candidates, I could easily vote for Mr. Trump this November without endorsing him, his behavior, his language or his \u201ctemperament\u201d. Let me explain. To use the now clich\u00e9 line in many faith circles, we are electing a Commander in Chief, not a Theologian in Chief. His words and behavior have left many conservatives thinking, \u201cwe want to support you Mr. Trump, but why must you make it so difficult?\u201d It is true we have some concerns. At the same time, we must face the facts. Mr. Trump has ignited a movement that most of us didn\u2019t see coming. I certainly didn\u2019t. He has been underestimated time and again and despite the establishment\u2019s most ardent efforts to block his nomination, his core appeal resiliently overshadows his flaws. After spending much of my morning yesterday with Mr. Trump in a small meeting in his office and in a larger meeting attended by 1000 of the nation\u2019s most influential Christian leaders, I would vote for Donald Trump because he has convinced me he will fight for the issues that matter most to conservatives.\u00a0 And one thing is certain with Mr. Trump \u2013\u00a0 for better or worse, he\u2019s not afraid of a fight. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s position on three key issues that encourage me. The first - and most important - is that of The Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s campaign recently released a list of potential Supreme Court Nominees, all of which are judges who will uphold the constitution without attempting to legislate from the bench. I cannot overstate the importance of this. Any honest conservative should commend this list of nominees. The second issue is the protection and sanctity of life. Now I know that candidate Trump has changed his position on this particular issue and many question his sincerity. But, I\u2019m a pastor and I love it when someone changes their mind and comes over to the right side of an issue! I choose to believe Mr. Trump has truly converted to support life and will be a protector of the unborn. And what is the alternative? Hillary Clinton is clearly in favor of legalized abortion. There is no choice here for me and millions of evangelical Christians. We will vote life every time. We will vote principle over personality, party, or our pocket books. The last issue is that of Religious Liberty. Trump has brought greater voice to the concerns held by many Americans when it comes to our faith. With a great marketer\u2019s instinct, he sums it up like this, \u201cWhen I\u2019m President, we\u2019ll say Merry Christmas again.\u201d It\u2019s an impressively simplistic - but effective\u00a0 - way of articulating a widely held conviction.\u00a0 As Christians, we believe the left\u2019s agenda is to marginalize Christianity to the sidelines, diminishing our influence and many of the faith traditions we cherish. Mr. Trump, to his credit, has made considerable efforts to include evangelicals in his campaign to lead the nation. He has spoken positively and persuasively of his desire to support Christian faith in America. We know he has stated many times that he is for us and not against us. These are the reasons I could vote for Mr. Trump, and encourage others to do the same. Actually, it\u2019s not that difficult. Donald Trump says he will support those issues that conservative evangelicals care about. Hillary Clinton promises she won\u2019t. I know this as a fact: it is critical that Christian citizens prayerfully vote and participate in the election process. The future of our country depends upon it.",

Mike Pence and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine in Farmville, Va., Monday, Oct. 3, 2016. (AP Photo/AP Photo/Julio Cortez) (The Associated Press) RALEIGH, N.C. \u2013 The morning after Tim Kaine was named the Democratic vice presidential nominee, his first stop wasn't a rally or a swing state meet-and-greet \u2014 it was a church in Richmond, Virginia, where he and his wife have worshipped for 30 years. He prayed, sang a solo and briefly avoided talk of politics. Kaine has long balanced religion and politics, in his private life and his public one as Virginia's governor and senator. At times, his Catholicism has run directly against his governing choices. Kaine is morally opposed to the death penalty but signed off on 11 executions during his four years as governor. After opposing gay marriage in his 2005 gubernatorial run, he later broke with the church to support it. He's personally against abortion but has consistently voted in favor of abortion rights. \"How many of us are in the church and are deeply serious about our faith and agree with 100 percent of church doctrine?\" Kaine told the National Catholic Reporter in August. \"I would argue very few Catholics are in that position. We're all working out our salvation with fear and trembling.\" The campaign didn't make Kaine available for an interview with the Associated Press. Kaine squares off Tuesday against Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence in the only vice presidential debate of the election. Pence is an evangelical Christian who, like Kaine, is open about the influence of his faith on his political life. Pence has been prone to act politically based on his faith, including fighting against Planned Parenthood funding while in Congress and signing a state law that many people saw as allowing discrimination against gay people. Kaine, for his part, ran ads on Christian radio during his 2005 gubernatorial bid. \"I oppose gay marriage, I support restrictions on abortion,\" he said in one. Now as a U.S. senator, he co-chairs the chamber's bipartisan prayer breakfast. Every day while campaigning, he mentions the transformative year he spent as a missionary with the Jesuits in Honduras from 1980 to 1981. \"I would argue he probably has been one of those Democrats who has been the most comfortable in his own skin generally, and particularly when it comes to issues of faith,\" said Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic strategist and former longtime Kaine staffer. His most public test of faith centered on the death penalty. As a Catholic and longtime civil rights lawyer, Kaine staunchly opposes the death penalty and even defended several death row inmates. But Virginia has performed one of the highest numbers of executions. In 2005, Kaine's Republican opponent, Jerry Kilgore, ran an ad featuring the father of a murder victim of one of Kaine's death row clients, saying Kaine couldn't be trusted to uphold the law. In a direct-to-camera appeal, Kaine pushed back. \"My faith teaches life is sacred,\" he said, before adding, \"as governor, I'll carry out death sentences handed down by Virginia juries, because that's the law.\" And he did. As governor, Kaine oversaw 11 executions, granting clemency only once. Wayne Turnage, Kaine's former chief of staff, said the typically upbeat Kaine would retreat to his office to be alone for hours on the days executions occurred. \"You could sense a significant change in his demeanor,\" Turnage said. \"The office was a lot quieter, you could tell he was in a more pensive mood.\" Gay marriage, too, posed tension between Kaine's faith and his political beliefs. In September, Kaine recalled before a dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality, that he opposed gay marriage because of his Catholicism until about a decade ago. Kaine changed his tune when Virginians, in 2006, were voting on a constitutional amendment to keep marriage between one man and one woman. Kaine opposed it, but it passed. Now, he's a strong proponent of furthering LGBT rights. \"I had a difficult time reconciling that equality, which I knew to be true from the experience of my own life, with the teachings of the faith that I had been raised in my entire life,\" he said at the dinner. On abortion, Kaine breaks from Clinton on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal money from covering abortions. Kaine supports it, but Clinton would push for repeal if elected. Some critics charge Kaine highlights his faith when it's most politically helpful. \"We'd see a different Tim Kaine depending on what crowd he was with,\" Kilgore, Kaine's former Republican opponent, said. And some Catholic groups are openly skeptical about Kaine's year in Honduras. There, he learned the teachings of \"liberation theology,\" which advocates the church's political involvement to improve the lives of the poor. Critics charge the movement has Marxist and socialist underpinnings. But to his allies and observers, Kaine's honesty and candidness about his faith is partly what's kept it an asset, not a liability. \"His religious devotion has always been a big part of his public persona,\" said John McGlennon, a government and public policy professor at Virginia's College of William and Mary. \"He does have a very good way of connecting with voters so that they can see something of themselves in him.\" ___ Associated Press writer Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, contributed.",

(AP) The Democratic presidential nominee fell on her way into her van and had to be helped by her security, according to witnesses and video of her leaving. She was \u201cclearly having some type of medical episode,\" a law enforcement source told Fox News. After more than an hour of radio silence, Clinton's campaign issued a statement saying the former Secretary of State \"felt overheated,\" and later Sunday issued another release blaming the episode on pneumonia and dehydration. \"Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies,\" Dr. Lisa R. Bardack said in the statement. \"On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning's event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.\" But a witness told Fox News that Clinton stumbled off the curb, her \"knees buckled\" and she lost a shoe as she was helped into a van during her \"unexpected early departure.\" MORE ON #HILLARY per witness: \"unexpected early departure\"; she stumbled off curb, \"knees buckled\", lost a shoe as she was helped into van The NYPD was sent to retrieve Clinton's shoe,\u00a0NBC\u00a0reported. An unverified video of the episode appeared to show Clinton collapsing as she was helped into the van. Hillary Clinton departs the 9/11 ceremony on Sunday. (AP) The New Jersey resident who took the video, Zdenek Gazda, told Foxnews.com he had been a fireman in the Czech Republic and came to the 9/11 ceremony to pay his respects. \"Everything was fine, everything was good before,\" said Gazda, who snapped several shots of Clinton before taking the video. \"I take a lot of pictures of her. She looked very nice and everything, and I don\u2019t know what happened to her.\" After Clinton left the ceremony, the reporters following her on the campaign trail were prevented from leaving the media area for a period of time. FACT CHECK: At no time did @SecretService personnel violate security protocols during the early departure of one of our protectees. Clinton emerged from Chelsea Clinton's apartment just before noon and said she was \"feeling great.\" \"It's a beautiful day in New York,\" Clinton yelled to press waiting across the street. She bent down to take a photo with a young girl and said \"thanks everybody\" to a nearby crowd cheering her. Asked again about her health, Clinton said she was \"great, feeling great\" and then got into her van.\u00a0A spokesperson said she was headed to her house in Chappaqua, where former President Bill Clinton, who did not attend the 9/11 ceremony, was waiting. She was examined by her doctor after arriving in Chappaqua. \"I am glad to learn that Secretary Clinton is already feeling better and I wish her a speedy recovery,\" said DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile in a statement. \"I look forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory.\" Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said late Sunday that Clinton will not be making the trip to California Monday or Tuesday and will instead be resting in Chappaqua. Asked about Clinton's early exit, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u00a0said\u00a0he didn't know anything about it. But Rep. Peter King told The Washington Post that during the ceremony it was Trump who informed King of Clinton's health issue. \u201cIt was actually Trump who told me what was going on,\" King told a Washington Post reporter. \"He leaned over and told me that 'Hillary wasn\u2019t feeling well.' I said, 'Really?'\" Clinton was in New York for Sunday\u2019s ceremony commemorating 15 years since the 9/11 terror attacks. Clinton and Trump earlier greeted supporters as they entered the downtown Manhattan 9/11 memorial. Both had promised to suspend campaign activities to mark the 15th anniversary of the attacks. Questions surrounding Clinton's health have emerged in recent weeks, and calls for the candidate to release her full medical records may intensify after Sunday's incident. Clinton previously sustained a concussion in December 2012 after fainting, an episode her doctor attributed to a stomach virus and dehydration. Clinton's doctor reported she is fully recovered from the concussion, which led to temporary double vision and discovery of a blood clot in a vein in the space between her brain and skull. Clinton also has experienced deep vein thrombosis, a clot usually in the leg, and takes the blood thinner Coumadin to prevent new clots.

            "article_content": "A member of the media shoots video during setup before the 2016 Democratic Convention, Sunday, July 24, 2016, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/John Locher) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu) PHILADELPHIA \u2013 The sun will come out tomorrow \u2013 that is the feel that organizers of the Democratic National Convention and the Hillary Clinton campaign want to prevail in Philadelphia this week. The idea is to draw a contrast against last week\u2019s Republican National Convention, when speaker after speakers described a country and world in chaos \u2013 police officers being shot, Americans being killed by undocumented immigrants, and the Islamic State spreading its influence and carnage. Democratic National Committee officials say the convention will strive to be uplifting \u2013 recognizing problems that need to be addressed while being hopeful and noting what is uniquely special about the United States. \u201cThe last thing that we need is somebody who is running for president who talks trash about America,\u201d Clinton said at a rally in Tampa on Friday. A leading issue for drawing contrasts between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and, by extension, the Democratic and Republican parties is immigration, several people attending the convention said. \u201cThis week, people will see the difference in diversity between the Democratic convention and the Republican convention,\u201d said Vivian Rodriguez, president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida, in an interview with Fox News Latino on Sunday. \u201cThey will see that Latinos are embraced in this convention.\u201d The Republican convention dove into the immigration issue \u2013 a hallmark of the Trump campaign since he launched it in June 2015 \u2013 on the very first day of last week\u2019s gathering in Cleveland. The convention featured three speakers whose relatives had been killed by undocumented immigrants. The message was that the country needs a tougher crackdown on immigration because killers and potential terrorists lurk among those who live in the shadows. The Democratic convention also is launching itself with a focus on immigration on the first day, when the theme will be \u201cUnited Together,\u201d\u2019 but will show undocumented immigrants in a sympathetic light, as well as in a way that poses a challenge. That challenge will be posed via primetime speaker Astrid Silva, a so-called Dreamer who will represent the millions of undocumented immigrants brought as children and who consider the United States their real homeland. Silva, who is organizing director at the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, came from Mexico when she was 4 years old. She has a reprieve from deportation through the 2012 Obama administration executive action called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Silva is among a growing number of Dreamers, as undocumented youth brought as children are called, who has been a vocal advocate for comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a path to legal status to immigrants like her. The 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. was the first presidential one ever to feature an undocumented immigrant as a speaker. Also on Monday, in keeping with the Democratic position that deportations break up families and ultimately hurt the greater U.S. society, the convention will feature Karla Ortiz, a 10-year-old U.S.-born citizen whose parents are undocumented. Ortiz and her mother, Francisca, will address the audience. They will speak about the impact that the threat of deportation has on families that often include legal immigrants and U.S.-born children. Sen. Robert Menendez said the GOP used immigration last week for \u201cfearmongering,\u201d whereas the Democrats will show immigrants as an asset. \u201cWhat not just Donald Trump is saying, but really Republicans, is that we can\u2019t have any more of \u2018those people,\u2019\u201d said Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. \u201cThey show they are the party of intolerance\u2026Immigrants make America great, better every day. We should use their skills and talents.\u201d The Democratic National Convention organizers laid out their goal for the week on the event website. \u201cAs Donald Trump begins his divisive convention in Cleveland with dangerous ideas that would pose a threat to our economy and national security,\u201d the site said, \u201cDemocrats are preparing to lay out the clear stakes in this election in Philadelphia \u2013 a choice between building walls and tearing people down or an optimistic unifying vision where everyone has a role to play in building our future.\u201d As with all party national conventions, a key goal of the Democratic event in Philadelphia is to show a united party. The Republican one had its moments of disunity \u2013 on public display \u2013 when delegations from several states unsuccessfully demanded roll calls. And of course the most prominent moment of anti-Trump Republicans came through Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s primetime speech, where he mentioned the nominee\u2019s name only once, and almost reluctantly, making that evening awkward for the real estate mogul and the Republican National Committee. Some feared that Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Democrat who was Clinton\u2019s toughest competitor, might threaten to undermine the effort to show a united front. But Sanders, who held out for a long time before dropping out the race and endorsing Clinton, has urged his supporters to vote for the former Secretary of State, and is expected to emphatically root for her in his primetime speech on Monday night. While Latinos were hard to find at the Republican National Convention\u2014both on the stage as speakers and the delegations\u2014Democrats are trotting them out for key speaking roles and the arena is expected to reflect the nation\u2019s diversity. Among prominent Latinos expected to speak are Reps. Joaquin Castro of Texas, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Linda Sanchez of California, and Xavier Becerra, among others. The GOP convention came under fire \u2013 including by some Latino delegates there \u2013 for barely featuring Latinos. Four Latinos addressed the convention \u2013 three of them on the same night. Besides Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio addressed the delegates, but through a very short video. And Kentucky State Sen. Ralph Alvarado made his national debut with a speech that was the most emphatic of the three, praising Trump and describing the United States as the land of opportunity that had opened its arms to his immigrant parents. Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy addressed the Republican National Convention with her husband, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI). \u201cAt the Democratic National Convention,\u201d the event website said, \u201cthe diverse experiences and voices of Americans from across the country will be shared with millions of Americans.\u201d Whereas the GOP convention championed gun ownership and bemoaned what they said was the demonization of police by the Obama administration, and recent spate of killings of law enforcement officials, the Democratic convention will feature people who were shot, or whose relatives were killed, by others who carried guns. Other primetime speakers include First Lady Michele Obama on Monday, former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday and President Barack Obama on Wednesday. Chelsea Clinton will speak Thursday night and introduce her mother. Besides the upbeat approach to immigration, mixed with the sympathetic look at the painful impact of deportations on families, a looming topic this week will arguably be Clinton\u2019s selection of Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate. The selection of the little-known Kaine disappointed many Latinos who had hoped Clinton would pick a Hispanic figure such as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro or Labor Secretary Tom Perez as her running mate. Other Latinos have challenged the view of many in their community that the selection of Kaine signaled a disregard for Latinos, noting that the former Virginia governor, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, feels an affinity for the ethnic group. Kaine is fluent in Spanish, and enjoys giving at least part of speeches in the language. Kaine took a break from Harvard to be a Catholic missionary in Honduras. If Kaine addresses the convention, it\u2019s quite likely he will detour to Spanish for a portion of his talk. If there\u2019s a presidential national convention, there are always protests. Some 50,000 protesters are expected each day. They\u2019ll be demonstrating against abortion, and in favor of Bernie Sanders, among other things.",

            "article_content": "Majority leader says goals achievable without government shutdown The House voted Friday to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood for a year and curb some abortion practices, in the chamber's first legislative response to videos showing the abortion provider's tissue harvesting practices. The Planned Parenthood \"de-fund\" bill passed 241-187, on a nearly party-line vote. Hanging over the debate, though, was the possibility of a government shutdown showdown. Republican leaders brought the legislation to the floor as they try to address lawmakers' outrage over the videos. Some conservatives originally wanted to demand Planned Parenthood be de-funded as part of a must-pass government budget bill; House leaders tried a different tack Friday with the two bills, which are not tied to the overall budget. The stand-alone measures, though, stand little chance of becoming law. The Senate has not yet acted on the issue. And the bills not only face opposition from most Democrats but veto threats from the White House. That means some conservatives could still want to tie the issue to the budget package, as a means of leverage. Congress has until the end of the month to pass a new budget, or else parts of the government could again start to shutter, as happened in 2013. On Friday, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., downplayed the chances of such drama. \"We will pass a bill that funds the government,\" he told Fox News. The bills approved Friday were a reaction to videos showing Planned Parenthood officials casually describing how they provide researchers with tissue from aborted fetuses. The anti-abortion activists who secretly recorded the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from organ sales. The organization says it's broken no laws and is being victimized by deceitfully edited recordings. \"Anyone who watches those videos -- they are horrific,\" McCarthy told Fox News. \"Aborting live babies for profit -- why would anybody want to spend tax dollars for that?\" The first bill would block Planned Parenthood's federal funds for a year. The other would impose criminal penalties on doctors who don't try saving infants born alive during abortions. The latter measure passed\u00a0248-177. But with the overall government funding issue not resolved, Democrats once again have taken to accusing Republicans of playing games with the economy. The White House, in a statement released Thursday evening, said Obama called the shutdown threat \"a game of chicken with our economy that we cannot accept.\" It's a tricky situation for House Speaker John Boehner, who wants to avoid a partial government shutdown while preventing a rebellion in the ranks. \"Our leaders wave the white flag every time there's a confrontation,\" said Rep. Mark Salmon, R-Ariz. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said Boehner wants to \"implement what the lobbyists want, not what the constituents of our district want.\" At a closed meeting Thursday among House Republicans, leaders unveiled internal polling that attendees said showed most people would oppose a government shutdown -- even those who have seen the videos and oppose financing Planned Parenthood. Many Republicans argued that the polling showed a shutdown fight would be damaging and unwinnable, especially since Senate Democrats already derailed a bill erasing Planned Parenthood's funds. \"Pounding on the table doesn't turn 54 into 60 in the Senate,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., referring to the number of GOP senators and the number it would take to end Democratic filibusters. The bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., would transfer Planned Parenthood's federal money to thousands of government-backed community health centers. Supporters say that would keep women's health care intact, but opponents say those centers are overwhelmed and often far from women who need them. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million yearly in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. That's around one-third of the $1.3 billion yearly budget for the organization, which has nearly 700 clinics and provides sexual disease testing, contraceptives and abortions. Conservatives' determination to block Planned Parenthood's money has been partly fueled by the race for the GOP's presidential nomination. Several candidates used their Wednesday night debate to urge lawmakers to turn off that funding spigot. But spotlighting GOP divisions, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., wrote Thursday to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of the presidential hopefuls. Cruz wants Republicans to oppose financing the government unless Planned Parenthood's money is cut off, defending his effort during the debate by saying, \"I'm proud to stand for life.\" Ayotte, who faces her own tough re-election fight next year, wrote that she opposed risking a partial shutdown \"given the challenges and threats we face at home and abroad\" and asked, \"What is your strategy to succeed in actually defunding Planned Parenthood?\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But beneath the endless pot jokes, there is something happening around social issues in this election cycle. For Democrats, pot legalization is fast becoming a litmus-test question for candidates. By the time we get to 2016, Hillary Clinton have to drop by a Boulder smoke shop rather than just lifting beers in bars as she did in 2008. And what will Senate candidates this year have to say about the moves toward pot de-criminalization? Certainly, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Gov.

I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d Obama said that pot use was less dangerous than booze \u201cin terms of its impact on the individual consumer.\u201d More. Abortion still central - While the pot story is beguiling, especially for Baby Boomers who helped bring cannabis into the mainstream, it is a relatively new arrival to the culture wars. The central issue for a decade among liberals was gay marriage. But shifting public opinion on the issue as well as a spate of court decisions have sapped much of the charge from the topic. The most important social issue among Republicans, though, has been and will continue to be abortion. And this week will highlight what remains American\u2019s most contentious social issue. [Democrats have cheered Pope Francis\u2019 laments about income inequality and capitalism, and President Obama is said to be lining up a meeting. But will liberals be so keen on the new pontiff as they are reminded of his stance on abortion and gay marriage? Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream looks at the perils of using religious figures for political aims.] March on - This week, hundreds of thousands of pro-life activists will descend on Washington for Wednesday\u2019s National March for Life. Still ringing in their ears will be comments from Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the \u201cextreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault-weapon, anti-gay\u201d have \u201cno place in the state of New York, because that\u2019s not who New Yorkers are.\u201d Cuomo, a popular incumbent up for re-election this year, may be insulated from the blowback because of the heavily liberal lean of his state. But the remarks highlight the deepening divide between red America and blue America on the issue. Not only will abortion animate general-election voters, but will be a litmus test in an increasing number of Republican primaries. The proliferation of state-level, late-term abortion bans and abortion clinic regulations in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell case will make sure of that.

It was there that she became a heroine to American liberals for her arduous, though ultimately unsuccessful, fight to preserve legal access to late-term, elective abortions in the state. But The Dallas Morning News reports that Davis\u2019 story of hardship and self-reliance omits a key figure: her second husband. \u201cDavis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. She lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter. A single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer 13 years older than her, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, and kept their two daughters while she was in Boston.\u201d Davis even carried the claim of being a teenaged single mother into testimony in a federal lawsuit. She apologized, telling the paper: \u201cMy language should be tighter. I\u2019m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail.\u201d Her ex-husband bears no apparent ill will, saying she would be a \u201cgood governor.\u201d But Jeff Davis counseled against sob stories, \u201cShe got a break. Good things happen, opportunities open up. You take them; you get lucky. That\u2019s a better narrative than what they\u2019re trying to paint.\u201d Get back Honky Cat: Putin celebrates Elton John despite gayness - Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed criticism of his \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law during an interview with Russian and foreign news anchors Friday. \u201cRead the law carefully,\u201d Putin said, \u201cand see what it\u2019s called. The law\u2019s called \u2018On banning the promotion of pedophilia and homosexuality.\u2019\u2019\u2019 The Russian president defended the law because he feels it combats Russia\u2019s demographic decline. In a separate interview with BBC, Putin said he has gay friends [lucky them!], further stating, \u201cIf [gay people] achieve great things, like, for example, Elton John does, he\u2019s a brilliant man, a brilliant musician, and millions of people sincerely love him, despite his [sexual] orientation, it doesn\u2019t have any significance as regards him, especially as a brilliant musician. I think that that very entirely democratic approach to people with non-traditional sexual orientation, with measures to defend our children and our future demographic growth are optimal.\u201d [\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that theres some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president. Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black president.\u201d \u2013President Obama talking to The New Yorker.] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026On the federal holiday commemorating his birth, Martin Luther King\u2019s embrace of Christian values and ideology is still resonant.

James Lankford, R-Okla., will announce his intention today to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., at the end of this year. Lankford, who was first elected in 2010, quickly ascended into the Republican leadership. He is considered a potent potential fundraiser. This sets up a possible showdown with Rep. Jim Bridenstine, a conservative Republican who ousted five-term Republican incumbent Rep. John Sullivan in 2012. Bridenstine is still mulling his run, but if he opts to get in, it would likely be a donnybrook. Gov. Mary Fallin, R-Okla., has called a special election concurrent with November\u2019s regular vote, to choose a new senator to serve out the final two years of Coburn\u2019s term. The primary is set for June 24 and could prove to be another expensive showdown between the GOP leadership and conservative insurgents. Out of the running - The announcement by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt that he will not seek Coburn\u2019s seat would leave the right side of the primary field open to Bridenstine if he opts for a run. And with the announcement from Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who holds two key leadership posts in the House that he will not vie for the Senate seat, Lankford is unlikely to have any difficulties from party higher-ups. The last time there was an open seat in Oklahoma\u2026 - Washington Examiner\u2019s Timothy Carney recalls how Coburn ended up in the Senate: winning as an upstart in the wake of a retirement despite the opposition of the GOP establishment. \u201cConsidering how often Coburn found himself opposing his House GOP elders, especially those on the Appropriations Committee, they were surely happy when he went back to Muskogee to deliver more babies after the 2000 election. But the heartburn returned for the Republican establishment a few years later when Coburn jumped into the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Don Nickles. Among the handful of GOP candidates, the two clear frontrunners were Coburn and Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys. If you wanted to see what Beltway Republicans really thought of Coburn, you could have checked out Humphreys\u2019 campaign coffers\u2026Nickles contributed to Humphreys in the primary, as did Oklahoma's junior senator, Jim Inhofe. Tom Cole was a congressional candidate that year, but he was also the political boss of the Oklahoma GOP, and his campaign contributed to Humphrey in the primary. So did GOP Rep. Wes Watkins of Oklahoma, who had served with Coburn in the House. Coburn\u2019s other Oklahoma colleague in the House, J.C. Watts, endorsed Humphreys. Meanwhile, the entire Senate leadership also backed Humphreys against Coburn. Majority Leader Bill Frist, Majority Whip Mitch McConnell and Republican Policy Committee Chair[man] Jon Kyl all poured money into Humphreys\u2019 campaign.\u201dCHRISTIE BITES THE HANDGov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., is hitting back at MSNBC for being \u201copenly hostile\u201d and \u201calmost gleeful\u201d in their attacks against him.

Christie spokesman Colin Reed has refuted the charge saying the administration has helped Hoboken secure Sandy funds and that, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear partisan politics are at play here, as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television.\u201d Christie was formerly a frequent guest on the liberal cable network\u2019s morning show.

MANDATE, SCHMANDATE: OBAMACARE LACKS CARROTS AND STICKSOn news that the Obama administration is delaying another provision of ObamaCare \u2013 this time one forbidding employers from offering better coverage to executives than to underlings \u2013 James Capretta and Jeffrey Anderson offer their take on the condition of the law\u2019s mandates: \u201cObamaCare\u2019s authors wanted to use both a carrot and a stick to make the law work, but neither one looks effective. The subsidies for coverage are concentrated on the lowest-income households, not the middle class, and the mandate was watered down. So if ObamaCare is to succeed, it will have to do so based on its attractiveness to consumers. That should make the law\u2019s proponents very worried, indeed.\u201dObamaCare site directs callers to pottery shop - As Maryland\u2019s ObamaCare Web site continues to sputter, officials have been directing frustrated consumers to a toll-free number for help. But even that hasn\u2019t gone well. The phone number provided by the Web site directed users to call a pottery supply store in Seattle rather than a help desk.\u00a0 The state\u2019s Republican Senate Minority Leader David Brinkley, told the Baltimore Sun, \u201cYou can't make this stuff up, and I guess if it wasn't so serious, it could be funny.\u201d Officials say they were unaware of the problem until the newspaper contacted them. Fox News has the story. IRAN NUKE DEAL BEGINSThe International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear watchdog group reported Monday that Iran had halted its 20 percent uranium enrichment, which is just steps away from bomb-making capability, and begun diluting its stockpile of uranium enriched to that level.

NO-SELFIES, PLEASE: FIRST LADY\u2019S BIRTHDAY BASH TOP SECRETWashington Examiner\u2019s Byron York explains why you will not be seeing any photos or social media postings from First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Saturday birthday celebration. \u00a0York writes, \u201cIt's not easy to enforce discipline on successful, wealthy, and famous people used to having their own way. But the White House apparently did not want to see photos of the First Lady's glittery gala circulating around the Internet. So it imposed a strict rule: No cell phones. \u2018Guests were told not to bring cellphones with them, and there was a cellphone check-in area for those who did,\u2019 reported the Chicago Tribune. \u2018Signs at the party told guests: No cellphones, no social media.\u2019 People magazine added: \u2018Guests had been greeted by a 'cell phone check' table where they deposited their camera phones on arrival and it was understood that this was not an occasion for Tweeting party photos or Facebooking details.\u2019 The publications cited sources who insisted on anonymity for fear of White House reprisal\u2026maybe, since the president has announced he is devoting the rest of his time in office to an \u2018inequality agenda,\u2019 the White House felt photos of a champagne-soaked, star-studded party would be somewhat off-message. But the Obamas are well-off, accomplished people. They can have a big party if they want (and if they pay for it). Why hide it?\u201d OMAHA!Why does Peyton Manning shout the name of Nebraska\u2019s largest city every time he is about to change up the Denver Bronco\u2019s offensive scheme? Nobody knows but the Broncos and they sure aren\u2019t saying, at least not before the Super Bowl. But Omahans are making it pay for local charity. As Republican Senate candidate Shane Osborn tweeted , local businesses have pledged $800 to Manning\u2019s Peyback Foundation for at-risk kids every time the future Hall-of-Famer shouts it out. \u201cOmaha\u201d rang out 31 times in Denver on Sunday, for a total of $24,800. What will the Super Bowl be worth in \u201cOmaha\u201d shout-outs? Maybe now that Manning knows about the deal, he\u2019ll be more likely to call audibles. NEVERMORESunday marked the 205th anniversary of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s birth, but the celebration in Baltimore was missing something, or someone.

The mysterious visitor was a highlight for the revelers who gathered at the grave, but after a fifth straight year of no-shows, Poe fans are declaring the tradition as vanished as Poe\u2019s unlucky drunkard, Fortunato.

            "article_content": "Dr. Michael Roth's car allegedly had plastic containers of human tissue in its trunk when cops searched it. (FOX2) Police in Michigan raided the home and office of an allegedly rogue abortion doctor Tuesday night, following the discovery of what appeared to be a dozen containers of aborted fetus parts and a powerful anesthetic in the trunk of his car. The grisly discoveries were made after Dr. Michael Roth, an OB/GYN who has been repeatedly sued by patients and sanctioned by health authorities, asked police to retrieve items from his car, which was impounded after Roth allegedly struck a 32-year-old disabled man in West Bloomfield two weeks ago. Roth has not yet been charged in connection with the accident or the aborted remains allegedly found in his car, though local, state and federal authorities are investigating, according to the Detroit Free Press. \"We do have an opinion from the medical examiner's office that this is remnants\u00a0of conception, but there was nothing that was seen\u00a0within the containers that were recognizable,\" West Bloomfield Deputy Chief Curt Lawson told the Detroit Free Press. \u201cI think that abortion should be available on demand...I haven\u2019t turned anybody down\u201d The state Attorney General's Office suspects Roth may be performing illegal abortions, according to Fox2, which cited sources. Roth is listed as the primary doctor at the Novi Laser & Aesthetic Center in Novi, Mich., about 30 miles northwest of Detroit. The clinic's website says that \u201cwith over 30 years of experience, Dr. Roth strives to provide the best possible care for his patients.\u201d Calls placed to the Novi clinic went straight to voicemail, and a listing for Roth's home number was disconnected. Roth's request for items from his car, including a garage door opener, allegedly turned up a drug later identified as Fentanyl, a drug the Drug Enforcement Administration describes as \u201cpotentially lethal, even at very low levels,\u201d and which is frequently used to reduce pain during abortion procedures. That discovery prompted cops to open the trunk, where they allegedly found 14 jars containing suspected fetal parts. On Tuesday night, police executed a search warrant at Roth\u2019s West Bloomfield apartment and were later seen carrying out grocery bags full of evidence, according to Fox2. Roth is well known to pro-life groups in Michigan, including one which has posted at least six malpractice complaints and judgments lodged against Roth from 1988 to 2015, some involving home abortions that led to alleged complications and allegedly botched procedures that later necessitated hysterectomies. \u201cHe has a long and sordid history,\u201d Right to Life of Michigan's legislative director Ed Rivet told FoxNews.com. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just like, \u2018Oh wow, this guy all of a sudden did something off the legal or ethical path.\u2019 This has been a whole career of this stuff.\u201d A state health inspector found during a January 2002 check that Roth\u2019s drug-control license had expired more than 20 years previously and resulted in Roth being placed on professional probation for six months, fined $15,000 and barred from performing abortions outside of a clinical setting. He also has been sanctioned for shoddy record-keeping and improprieties in prescribing medication, and in 2012 was fined $2,000 and sanctioned by a state disciplinary committee for a range of violations. In 2005, Roth's wife\u00a0claimed in an application for a restraining order that she \u201clives locked in the basement\u201d out of fear Roth \u201cwould continue to assault, attack, molest, wound, follow, confront and otherwise injure her as well as continue to prescribe and administer medication to her.\u201d A 1988 New York Times article on sex-selective abortions quoted Roth. \u201cI think that abortion should be available on demand,\" he said, later adding, \u201cI haven\u2019t turned anybody down.\u201d",

President Barack Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton's bid for the White House on Thursday, June 9, 2016, praising his former secretary of state's experience and grit, and urging Democrats to unite behind her in the fight against Republicans in the fall. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The presidential race shifted to the nation's capital on Friday, with Democrats executing a carefully orchestrated plan to unify their party around presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton. Her likely general election rival, Donald Trump, continued his months-long effort to win over the Republican base, with events wooing top donors and evangelical voters. With the primary contests all-but-over, a series of top Democrats formally announced their support for Clinton, headlined by the glowing endorsement of President Barack Obama on Thursday. Within hours, Vice President Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined that effort, both backing Clinton and signaling to many of Sanders' supporters that it's time to unite around the party's presumptive nominee. Clinton and Warren met privately for about an hour Friday morning at Clinton's home in Washington, intensifying speculation that the progressive stalwart may be tapped for the vice presidency. \"If you really want to electrify the base you've got to get somebody who's been speaking to the base and is going to turn the base out,\" said Rep Keith Ellison, D-Minn., one of Sanders' top supporters in Congress. He said he and other progressives would be thrilled if Clinton tapped Warren for her ticket. Democrats in Washington are eager to unite their party against Donald Trump and avoid a lingering intraparty spat. Primary rival Bernie Sanders, who's vowed to take his political revolution to their national Democratic convention in July has been stressing his determination to defeat Trump, perhaps signaling that he may exit the race or at least shift his focus away from Clinton after the final primary election next Tuesday in Washington, D.C. On Friday, he retreated to his home in Burlington, Vt. to plot his next steps. Clinton, meanwhile, delivered her first speech since becoming the presumptive nominee, addressing advocates at Planned Parenthood, a women's health organization and abortion provider. The non-profit was a strong champion of Clinton in the primaries, giving her its first endorsement in their 100 year history. Describing Trump as someone who \"doesn't hold women in high regard,\" Clinton launched into an unabashedly feminist attack on her GOP rival, arguing he would take the country back to \"when abortion was illegal women had far fewer options and life for too many women and girls was limited.\" \"When Donald Trump says let's make America great again that is code for let's take America backward,\" she told the cheering audience. Clinton's campaign believes that they could win over independent and Republican women turned off by Trump's bombastic rhetoric and history of sexist of misogynistic remarks. Later on Friday, she will host a fundraising dinner at her Washington home. Trump addressed a gathering of evangelical voters at the annual Faith & Freedom conference before flying to Richmond for a rally. Reading mostly from a teleprompter, he delivered a sharp rebuke to Clinton, declaring her \"unfit to be president\" while vowing to \"restore faith to its proper mantle in American society.\" As he took the stage, Trump boasted of the support he's received from evangelicals Christians, including a series of endorsements from Christian leaders, including Jerry Falwell Jr., who leads Liberty University. \"I happen to be Presbyterian,\" he also noted. Many evangelical and conservative leaders remain deeply skeptical of Trump's candidacy \u2014 a resistance that was underscored by the speakers who proceeded him on Friday. Former rival Carly Fiorina, who spoke immediately before Trump, failed to mention her party's presumptive nominee's name a single time during her remarks, which heavily criticized Clinton. Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, encouraged skeptics of Trump to consider what's at stake. He cited the issue of abortion rights, noting Clinton's speech at Planned Parenthood, and stressed the Supreme Court, as well as the presidency, are on the ballot this fall. \"You see we understand that perfection is not the measure that should be applied, not only to any political leader, but to any man or woman,\" he said, calling to Christians to \"put away our 'my way or the highway pride.'\" But he nonetheless took an apparent dig at Trump, who has sometimes struggled while discussing religion, after reading read a bible passage about humility \"That by the way, if you're looking it up, is One Corinthians, not two Corinthians,\" he said to laugh. It was a reference to Trump, who once cited \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians.\" Before the rally, Trump will be holding a private fundraiser. A copy of the invitation, obtained by The Associated Press, asks for donations up to $25,000 per couple. Donors wishing for a \"photo opportunity\" with Trump are asked to give $10,000 per person. Meanwhile, in his long-expected endorsement, President Barack Obama pointed to Clinton's grit and determination but also called for \"embracing\" Sanders' economic message, which has galvanized liberals and independents. Obama sought to reassure Democrats that Clinton shares their values and is ready for the job. The president plans to campaign next week with Clinton in Green Bay, Wisconsin, marking his first major foray into the 2016 campaign. \"It was a wonderful, meaning endorsement in every way,\" said Clinton, sipping an iced chai, during a stop at a muffin store in Washington. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman, Ken Thomas, Erica Werner, Laurie Kellman and Sarah Grace Taylor contributed to this report. ___ Reach Lisa Lerer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/llerer and Jill Colvin at https://twitter.com/colvinj",

            "article_content": "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal returns to Iowa on Tuesday to meet with local pastors and again look for support among Christian evangelicals for a possible White House campaign. The stated reason for Jindal's trip is to talk about his headlining appearance later this month at a prayer rally that is expected to draw thousands of people to Baton Rouge, and to discuss ways to mount a similar event in Iowa. \"These are a group of Christian men and women very interested in spiritual revival, very interested in prayer,\" Jindal said in a Monday interview with The Associated Press. But the private meetings with Christian religious leaders in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines also come as Jindal courts religious conservatives across the country ahead of the 2016 campaign. Tuesday's trip to first-to-vote Iowa will be his fifth since June. In recent months, Jindal has also spoken to pastors in New Hampshire, at a gathering of faith leaders and conservative activists in Washington, and in Oklahoma at an event promoting a Bible museum planned by owners of Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby. \"I'm happy to go anywhere, anytime to talk about Jesus,\" Jindal said. That includes headlining a prayer rally later this month called The Response on the campus of Louisiana State University. Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry headlined a similar prayer event in 2011 days before launching his White House bid. Critics have urged the university to scrap the event, arguing the rally is designed to further Jindal's presidential ambitions -- an argument he rejects. \"The Response is a prayer event,\" he said. \"It is a spiritual event. It is not a political event.\" Jindal's push among religious conservatives comes as he tries to define his political brand and stand out in a crowded field of early potential candidates for the Republican nomination. The two-term governor has aggressively promoted religious freedom in recent months, but he also has cast himself as an economic conservative and a pragmatist, famously calling on the GOP to stop acting like \"the stupid party\" after the 2012 election. Yet so far, party leaders and key donors have been slow to embrace his well-known national ambitions. A Catholic convert raised by Hindu parents, Jindal has fostered relationships with religious conservatives since taking office in 2008. He opposes abortion and gay marriage, and pushed for the creation of a voucher program in Louisiana that uses tax dollars to pay for children to attend religious schools. Backing from religious conservatives alone in recent presidential elections hasn't led a candidate to the GOP nomination. Neither former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2008 nor former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum three years ago was able to turn solid bases of support among conservative Christians into ultimately winning campaigns. Jindal said Monday he hasn't decided whether he'll run for president, repeating his oft-used line that he'll make a decision in the next few months after prayer and conversation with his family. He said the number of candidates likely to be seeking support from the Christian conservative base -- Huckabee, Santorum and Perry among them -- won't enter into his decision. \"I think the more choices for the voters, the better,\" he said. \"I've never decided to get in or not get into a race based on who else is running.\" \"If I decide to run,\" he said, \"it's going to be based on whether I think I've got something unique to offer.\"",

            "article_content": "(AP) I hear the lament often from conservative Christians as I travel the country: \u201cHow can I vote for either of these candidates with a clear conscience?\u201d Increasingly, many Christians are choosing the stay-at-home option (or throw away their vote with a write-in candidate option) as a way to maintain their integrity. Frankly, \u00a0I understand the appeal of such a choice. Not voting allows Christians to avoid both having to make a difficult choice\u00a0 or defending\u00a0 an unpopular choice to disapproving friends or family members. And let's face it, playing the \u201cconscience card\u201d\u00a0 allows someone to feel \u00a0holier than other Christians who sully themselves by getting involved in the political process. However, I believe there are three reasons why not voting is not an option for truly conscientious Christians: 1. Voting is a God-given privilege and responsibility. Many times I\u2019m challenged by Christians who wonder why I am involved in politics.\u00a0 \u201cAfter all, didn\u2019t the apostle Paul instruct believers to simply\u00a0 \u2018pray for kings and all those who are in authority\u2019?\u201d\u00a0 But remember, in biblical times citizens of Israel or Rome did not have the option of doing anything about governmental leaders except to pray for them.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t get to vote for the king or for the emperor! But as John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and co-author of The Federalist Papers said, \u201c[God] has given to our people the choice of their rulers . . . of our Christian nation.\u201d Every time we go into the voting booth we are choosing the moral and spiritual direction of our nation. That is a privilege and responsibility that should not be abdicated. 2. Voting Is A Primary Way For Christians To Stop Evil.\u00a0 Imagine you saw an elderly woman being assaulted by a mugger and you had the ability to stop the assault, but walked away.\u00a0 Although you might not be legally culpable for the attack, you would be morally culpable. Every year more the one\u00a0 million of the most defenseless \u00a0\u00a0in our society\u2014the unborn\u2014are being murdered through abortion.\u00a0 Since the legalization of abortion by the\u00a0 Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade (1973)\u00a0 more than 50 million children have been killed. Donald Trump has pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices who will either overturn Roe v. Wade or at least curtail late-time abortions including the horrific practice of partial birth abortion. In the last presidential debate, Trump articulated the clearest defense of the pro-life position of any Republican presidential nominee in history including Romney, McCain, either of the Bushes, or Ronald Reagan. By contrast, Hillary Clinton has pledged to nominate justices who will uphold Roe v. Wade. Additionally, she refuses to place any restrictions on abortion, regardless of reason for or the timing of the abortion. Abortion is not the only issue that should be of concern to conscientious Christians.\u00a0 Over the last eight years, the Obama administration has launched an all-out attack on religious liberty in America by suing the Little Sisters of the Poor Catholic charity, forcing Christians schools to allow men in women\u2019s locker rooms under Title IX requirements for transgender rights, and being a willing accomplice in bankrupting Christians who try to exercise their faith through their businesses. This war against religious liberty will only escalate under Hillary Clinton who is resolved to nominate Supreme Court justices, as well as dozens of federal judges with lifetime appointments, who embrace an expansionist view of the Constitution\u00a0 and will force the secular progressive agenda down the throats of Americans. \u00a0Remember, the next president will serve only 4 or 8 years, but these justices and judges will impact our nation for decades. 3. Voting is about endorsing policies, not personalities. Ronald Reagan was a known womanizer during his days in Hollywood and would be the first divorced president in history. Yet, in 1980 evangelicals overwhelming supported Reagan over a Baptist Sunday School teacher named Jimmy Carter who was faithfully married to one woman. By supporting Reagan, evangelicals were not supporting womanizing or divorce, but they were endorsing Reagan\u2019s policies. I\u2019ve been amazed at the number of conservative Christians who have developed a case of selective amnesia when it comes to their support of\u00a0 previous candidates with imperfect pasts, \u00a0whether it be Reagan, McCain, Bush, Gingrich, or a host of others. There are no perfect politicians\u2014just as there are no perfect pastors or voters. We are all sinners in need of a Savior.\u00a0 But the fallibility of both candidates in this election\u2014as in every election\u2014is no excuse for not voting. I will be the first to admit that the sanctity of life and the preservation of religious freedom are not even among the top ten concerns of most voters. But those issues should be of primary importance to those who call themselves Christians. That is why I\u2019m voting on November 8.\u00a0 My conscience won\u2019t allow me to do otherwise.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidate's campaign defends remarks made to donors in February Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign purportedly compiled a massive \u201chits\u201d file on Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders, calling into question his \u201cprogressive bona fides\u201d on issues ranging from labor to guns to Wall Street, according to a new trove of emails posted by WikiLeaks. The 71-page, nearly 50,000-word document was released Monday as the second installment in WikiLeaks\u2019 dump of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta\u2019s alleged emails. The email, titled \u201cPLS REVIEW: Sanders Hits,\u201d was sent by campaign research director Tony Carrk on Oct. 28, 2015 \u2013 nearly nine months before the liberal Vermont senator would endorse Clinton following their protracted primary battle. \u201cAttached are some hits that could either be written or deployed during the next debate on Sanders,\u201d Carrk writes, noting that the immense opposition research file would eventually be expanded with critiques of Sanders\u2019 plan to provide affordable college education. The document, which was prepared in advance of February\u2019s Iowa caucuses, also notes: \u201cPer HRC\u2019s request,\u201d the research team is \u201cdoing a deeper dive on Sanders\u2019s agriculture record.\u201d The document is broken up into 12 sections, with headings such as \u201cSanders Is Not Straight with People on His Spending\u201d and \u201cSanders Not Straight with People on Taxes.\u201d Subcategories then divide the attacks into specific points. \u201cSanders, often thought of as a champion of labor unions, accepted support from a company while it was involved in a bitter labor dispute -- locking out union employees for nearly 22 months,\u201d the document states in the \u201cLabor/Pay to Play/Sugar\u201d section. Sanders later voted \u201cto protect the sugar program.\u201d The document also criticizes Sanders for a lack of specifics on his tax plan. \u201cSen. Sanders has not told the American people how much he is going to raise taxes and who is going to pay for them,\u201d one section states. \u201cWhen confronted on details of his tax plan, he simply says \u2018it\u2019s coming.\u2019\u201d Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, tweeted out a link to the WikiLeaks files on Monday afternoon with the comment: \"And here...we...go.\" Clinton's campaign quickly rebuked Miller for the tweet and alluded to a popular theory that WikiLeaks has deep ties to Russia. \u201cIt is absolutely disgraceful that the Trump campaign is cheering on a release today engineered by [Russian President] Vladimir Putin to interfere in this election, and this comes after Donald Trump encouraged more espionage over the summer and continued to deny the hack even happened at Sunday's debate,\" Clinton spokesperson Glen Caplin told FoxNews.com in an email. \"The timing shows you that even Putin knows Trump had a bad weekend and a bad debate.\" The research file was compiled between the first two primary debates, which occurred on Oct. 13 and Nov. 14. While Clinton faced four challengers at the first debate, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee dropped out shortly afterward, leaving Sanders and the low-polling ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley as her only opponents moving forward. The alleged Podesta emails also show a former aide to the late Sen. Lloyd Bentsen criticizing Clinton for her \"untrue\" attacks on Sanders. \u201cBeyond this Hillary should stop attacking Bernie, especially when she says things that are untrue, which candidly she often does,\u201d Brent Budowsky wrote to Podesta on March 13. \u201cI am one of the people with credibility to suggest Bernie people support her in November, and she and [pollster Joel] Benenson and others have no idea of the damage she does to herself with these attacks, which she does not gain by making.\u201d During their first rally together on July 12, Clinton praised Sanders as someone who had \u201cenergized and inspired a generation of young people who care deeply about our country,\u201d despite the apparent misgivings her campaign had about Sanders as reflected in the research file. She added: \u201cYou will always have a seat at the table when I am in the White House.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Two stacks of ballots that were found outside Jerry Mosna's home in San Pedro, Calif. (FoxNews.com) Jerry Mosna was gardening outside his San Pedro, Calif., home Saturday when he noticed something odd: Two stacks of 2016 ballots on his mailbox. The 83 ballots, each unused, were addressed to different people, all supposedly living in his elderly neighbor\u2019s two-bedroom apartment. \u201cI think this is spooky,\u201d Mosna said. \u201cAll the different names, none we recognize, all at one address.\u201d His wife, Madalena Mosna, noted their 89-year-old neighbor lives by herself, and, \u201cEighty people can\u2019t fit in that apartment.\u201d They took the ballots to the Los Angeles Police Department, but were\u00a0directed to the post office. They felt little comfort there would be an investigation, and called another neighbor, John Cracchiolo \u2013 who contacted the Los Angeles County Registrar's office. A spokeswoman for the\u00a0Registrar\u00a0said the office will investigate. Both Cracchiolo\u00a0and Jerry Mosna told FoxNews.com they think they stumbled upon a case of fraud. Jerry Mosna, right, and his neighbor John Cracchiolo, left. (FoxNews.com) \u201cYes, there is voter fraud. We saw it with our own eyes,\u201d Cracchiolo said. In a statement, the office of the Registrar said, \u201cWe are carefully reviewing our records and gathering information to fully identify what took place.\u00a0 Our preliminary assessment is that this appears to be an isolated situation related to a system error that occurred causing duplicate ballots to be issued to an address entered for a single voter. We are working directly with the system vendor to ensure the issue is addressed and to identify any similar occurrences.\u201d Further, spokeswoman Brenda Duran said the Postal Service \u201chas indicated that they returned all of the improperly addressed ballots to our office.\u201d Spokesman Richard Maher confirmed the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has offered its assistance. He would not comment on the number of incidents, saying only there are \u201crelatively few.\u201d John Fund, a journalist and co-author with Hans\u00a0von Spakovsky of the book,\u00a0\u201cWho\u2019s Counting: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk,\u201d said someone could easily have voted with these ballots using a variety of fake signatures. \u201cIt is doubtful they would have ever been detected,\u201d Fund said. Von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow and manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, said voter fraud is prevalent enough that it could make the difference in a close election. The Heritage Foundation, he said, has recorded 430 cases of voter fraud -- proven cases where someone was convicted or a judge ordered a new election. A\u00a0former FEC commissioner and counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the U.S. Justice Department,\u00a0von Spakovsky said California is of particular concern because of the rising number of noncitizens illegally registering and voting in elections, as well as the \u201cterrible shape\u201d the voter registration rolls are in. The 89-year-old neighbor to whom the stack of ballots was addressed is hard of hearing, and was unavailable for comment. The Mosnas stressed that the ballots clearly were not for her -- and have not even discussed the issue with her.",

One of the authors of impeachment articles against IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Thursday that he could move to hold a House floor vote on the issue next week, scuppering an agreement among House Republicans to postpone the potentially divisive action. The agreement announced late Wednesday called for the House Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing next week, which would result in an impeachment vote only after the November presidential election, if ever. However, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., told Bloomberg that he was not aware of any pact to put off the vote until November. \"We will wait one more week to have a hearing,\" Huelskamp said. \"I plan on having a vote next week.\" Some Republicans, led by the conservative House Freedom Caucus, accuse Koskinen of obstructing a congressional investigation into the treatment of tea party groups seeking tax exemptions. Koskinen has disputed the allegations against him in private meetings with House Republicans in recent days, while the agency insisted Wednesday that he \"remains focused on the critical work needed for the nation's tax system.\" Huelskamp, a lame duck member of Congress after losing his re-election primary last month, has\u00a0long been a thorn in the side of leadership, to the extent that former Speaker John Boehner stripped him of his seat on the House Agriculture Committee. \"This really shows poor taste,\u201d one Freedom Caucus member told Fox of Huelskamp's threat. \"It would hurt our case tremendously. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.\" Rep. John Fleming, R-La., another ringleader of the impeachment effort, called the agreement a \"win-win for everybody.\" \"Ultimately, we get the hearing, we get the information, and hopefully we'll have more disclosures that tell us it's important to go ahead and end this man's tenure as head of the IRS,\" Fleming said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., welcomed the resolution, telling journalists Thursday that it \"was a good way to work things out.\" Neither Ryan nor other House GOP leaders had embraced the impeachment push, but Ryan, who needs to maintain conservative support, had also avoided publicly criticizing the move.

            "article_content": "Democratic vice presidential nominee challenges the Republican presidential nominee to produce his taxes; Mike Pence says Donald Trump will provide tax returns once audit is over Mike Pence and Tim Kaine scrambled to defend their running mates\u2019 temperament and judgment at their first and only face-off Tuesday night \u2013 an unruly 90-minute session in which the vice presidential candidates routinely talked over each other - and the moderator - as they channeled some of the feistiness from last week\u2019s opening presidential debate. The normally affable candidates sparred on immigration, criminal justice, Social Security, taxes and Russian aggression while accusing each other of running an \u201cinsult-driven\u201d campaign. But they clashed most frequently on two topics: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Pence hammered Clinton over her private email server use as secretary of state and her \u201cfeckless\u201d foreign policy, and pressed Kaine to defend Clinton\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness. He also invoked former President Bill Clinton\u2019s recent criticism of ObamaCare and vowed that Trump would repeal the health care law. Kaine pressured Pence to answer for some of his running mate\u2019s more controversial comments, including praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and\u00a0 calling for a Muslim immigration ban in the United States. He also said Trump needed to make his taxes public, while ripping the GOP presidential nominee over his coarse language and a \u201cselfish me-first style.\u201d \u201cI cannot believe that Governor Pence would defend the insult-driven campaign that [Trump] has run,\u201d Kaine said. Pence countered that Trump\u2019s comments are \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared with Clinton calling half their supporters a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d The exchange was characteristic of the debate, in which the lesser-known, lower-key running mates sparred feistily, leaving moderator Elaine Quijano at times struggling to bring order to the forum. Kaine challenged Pence on Trump\u2019s decision to break with decades of campaign tradition by not releasing his taxes. \"Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show he's prepared to be president, and he's breaking his promise,\" Kaine said. He also hammered Pence over revelations that Trump may been able to avoid paying taxes for up to 18 years by claiming a $900 million loss in 1995. Pence defended Trump's tax handling and said his running mate \u201cused the tax code just the way it\u2019s supposed to be used, and he did it brilliantly.\u201d He also asked Kaine: \u00a0\"Do you not take deductions?\" Though it\u2019s unclear whether Pence and Kaine's performances dramatically changed voters\u2019 minds about the presidential candidates, the nationally televised debate presented them with the opportunity to energize party loyalists and sway undecided voters. Kaine and Pence both accused the other of running an \u201cinsult-driven\u201d campaign with Kaine calling out Pence for not discrediting Trump\u2019s past \u201cbirther\u201d comments about President Obama and saying having Trump in charge \u201cscares us to death.\u201d Pence shot back, telling Kaine that he and Hillary Clinton \u201cwould know a lot about an insult-driven campaign.\u201d Social issues were a bigger part of the conversation than in the first presidential showdown, reflecting both candidates' religious faith. Kaine, a Catholic who personally opposes abortion but has consistently voted in favor of abortion rights, said of the Republican nominee, \"Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\" He also pointed to Trump's assertion that women should face some kind of \"punishment\" for abortion, a comment Trump later walked back. Pence stressed his opposition to abortion and said he was \"proud to be standing with Donald Trump\" on the issue. Both VP hopefuls reportedly held mock debates leading up to the debate. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stood in for Kaine while Washington lawyer Robert Barnett played Pence. Aides to Kaine told Fox News that the former Democratic National Committee chairman is a \u201cpolicy wonk\u201d like Clinton and studied \u201cbig binders\u201d of details to prepare. Pence, who has a decade of congressional experience under his belt, \u00a0had been sharpening his debate skills and preparing for the political showdown since Labor Day. The most watched vice presidential debate to date was the 2008 matchup between then-Sen. Joe Biden and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. That debate, according to Nielsen Ratings, brought in 69.9 million viewers. Coming in second was the 1984 debate between Rep. Geraldine Ferraro and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush.

            "article_content": "May 23, 2016: In this file photo, an Aedes aegypti mosquito sits inside a glass tube at the Fiocruz institute where they have been screening for mosquitos naturally infected with the Zika virus in RIo de Janeiro, Brazil. (AP) Securing funding to combat the Zika virus was supposed to be one issue on Capitol Hill that would be free of the political games that are typical in election years. That's because we have all seen the heartbreaking photos of Zika babies and heard the toll the virus has had on families in affected countries, including right here in the United States. The call for Washington to fund the effort to stop the spread of Zika was swift and bipartisan. Even Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid took to the Senate floor in February to declare, \u201cIt is critical that we approve the funds immediately, and give our government the resources it needs to fight the virus.\u201d It initially appeared that it would happen. In May, every Senate Democrat joined with Senate Republicans to overwhelmingly pass an appropriations bill that included $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus. Since the House passed a different version of the bill, the legislation went through the conference process to reconcile the differences, resulting in a compromise bill that most importantly preserved the $1.1 billion to equip mosquito controllers, doctors, and researchers with the funding needed to combat Zika and develop a vaccine. However, during the legislative process, Harry Reid had a change of heart, determining it would be more politically advantageous to have the funding bill fail so he could turn around and blame Republicans ahead of the November elections. Harry Reid\u2019s Senate Democrats quickly fell in line. They have blocked several attempts to pass the Zika funding and get it to the president\u2019s desk, a flip-flop from supporting funding to opposing it.\u00a0In fact, all but one Senate Democrat who voted for the $1.1 billion to fight Zika in May then voted against it this summer at Reid\u2019s request. To provide cover for such craven politicization of what was originally a slam-dunk bipartisan bill, Reid scripted one-sentence sound bites for his Democratic candidates to repeat on the campaign trail when voters demand an explanation for the flip-flopping filibuster. The factual basis behind Reid\u2019s talking points falls apart upon a quick analysis. First, Democratic leaders have claimed the Zika funding package reduces access to contraceptives, a claim that is flat-out false. The truth is that the bill does not prohibit any birth control services or any health service. What Democrats are really referring to is their newly invented demand for an earmark for abortion providers such as a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. This was a demand that even the President\u2019s supplemental request would not have funded. In doing so, they conveniently ignore the fact that the bill provides funding for health providers at community health centers, public health departments, hospitals, and through any provider on the island that accepts Medicaid. The flow of funding is common sense. In Zika-ravaged Puerto Rico, twenty community health centers served more than 300,000 people last year, compared to 8,000 people served at the island\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliate. These health centers are important because they provide not just reproductive health care for moms, but also prenatal care for pregnant women, and newborn and pediatric care for their at-risk children. Nothing could be more important for a child affected by Zika virus than to have continuity of care, seamlessly from before birth to after birth. Senate Democrats apparently disagree because they would rather see that funding go to groups that offer fewer health services, but do donate to their campaigns. Then there are the environmental smoke and mirrors. In an attempt to appeal to the fringe, left-wing environmental groups that support their campaigns, Democrats are even criticizing an effort to kill Zika-carrying mosquitos. Democrats are protesting a policy rider that would temporarily remove layers of redundant red tape to allow vector control organizations to use public health insecticides to kill mosquitos and fight Zika. These are the very same insecticides that have been approved by the CDC and EPA to combat mosquito-borne diseases. This is the sort of warped logic coming from Washington that the American people are justifiably sick and tired of. To be fair, Harry Reid is not the only person to blame. While President Obama berates Congress to \u201cdo its job\u201d and pass Zika funding that his own party is filibustering, the reality is that right now his administration is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars that can immediately be used to fight Zika. The only rationale behind the president\u2019s refusal to make use of those funds is to double-down on Harry Reid\u2019s strategy to place blame on Congressional Republicans. This is a dangerous game to play.\u00a0While we may have close to sufficient funds to combat the Zika virus for the rest of the year, the long-term consequences of continued Democratic obstructionism of Zika funding will be severe. The National Institutes of Health is currently developing a vaccine for the Zika virus, but is running low on funds. Unless Congress approves the $1.1 billion in funding, the vaccine effort could stall, and Zika will be back next year and emerge as a crisis for many more Americans. Harry Reid\u2019s closing scene in the long drama of his failed tenure as Democrat Leader may very well be his success in killing Zika funding legislation. If his obstructionism succeeds, the consequences will reverberate in communities across America long after he retires next January. People\u2019s lives are literally at stake. Let\u2019s hope that Reid\u2019s Democratic colleagues muster up the political courage to stand up to him and put the welfare of the American people ahead of reckless election-year political games. Regardless of our ideological leanings or partisan affiliations, we should all hope that the end of Harry Reid\u2019s tenure in the Senate will also bring an end to the culture of hyperpartisan brinksmanship that he established in the Senate. It\u2019s a toxic culture that has brought us to the point where Congress can\u2019t even pass a bill to save the lives and health of the most vulnerable among us. Let\u2019s hope, for the sake of our nation, that we can and will do better.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The House on Thursday backed election-year legislation that temporarily would halt the transfer of more detainees from the U.S. naval prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bill, which passed by a 244-174 vote, would bar the federal government from spending money on any Guantanamo prisoner transfers, even those to a foreign country. The ban would last until the end of the calendar year, or until a bill authorizing defense funding is signed into law. The White House has threatened a veto, and the measure has no chance of becoming law. But the bill is an opportunity for Republicans to put Democrats on record on the issue in the weeks before the Nov. 8 election and use their votes against them in campaigns. Within minutes of the vote, the House Republicans' campaign committee sent out a news release with the headline, \"Democrats vote to close GITMO and bring terrorists to U.S. soil (again).\" Republican backers said the transfers could allow some detainees to eventually return to terrorism and could threaten American communities when prisoners are transferred to prisons on U.S. soil. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., said that when these prisoners are held in a U.S. jail or prison, \"you have just put a target on every school, every business, every mall in that community.\" The White House argues Guantanamo weakens national security by draining resources and emboldening violent extremists. About 60 prisoners are being held there, down from hundreds. The administration says transfers occur only after a rigorous review. The Pentagon is still weighing what maximum security facilities could handle the remaining detainees. According to a report released Wednesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 122 of 693 detainees transferred out of the prison, or 17.6 percent, have returned to fighting. That's four more than the 118 recorded as having re-engaged in militant activities, in a report issued in March. The report said an additional 86 detainees are suspected of having returned to fighting. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the report underscored the need for the legislation. Democrats said the legislation would strip Obama of his lawful authority over the prison. \"This bill is un-American and extreme,\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York.",

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) (The Associated Press) ATLANTA \u2013 Republican Donald Trump has told conservative evangelical pastors in Florida that his presidency would preserve \"religious liberty\" and reverse what he insists is a government-enforced muzzling of Christians. The same afternoon, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine praised a more liberal group of black church leaders in Louisiana for their \"progressive values that are the values of Scripture,\" and he urged them to see Hillary Clinton as a kindred spirit. The competing appearances earlier this month highlight an oft-overlooked political reality: The \"religious vote\" is vast and complex, and it extends beyond generalizations about \"social conservatives\" who side with Republicans and black Protestant churches whose pastors and parishioners opt nearly unanimously for Democrats. An overview of how the dynamics among religious voters could help determine the 45th president. ___ HOW RELIGIOUS ARE AMERICAN VOTERS? There's a reason politicians chase steeples. Exit polls from recent elections suggest religiously affiliated Americans and those who attend services regularly are more likely to vote than those who claim no organized faith identity. In 2012 exit polls, almost nine out of 10 voters claimed some religious affiliation and eight out of 10 voters identified as Christian. That's a higher proportion than what surveys typically find in the general population: A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that three out of four people claim a religious affiliation, while seven out of 10 Americans are Christian. Still, there's no absolute count of who believes what, since the government's census doesn't ask. ___ MOST CHRISTIANS ARE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT? White Christians do skew toward Republicans. President Barack Obama won about 40 percent of white Catholics, according to 2012 exit polls. He won less than a third of white non-Catholic Christians. A slice of that group, white evangelical or \"born-again\" Christians, are even more conservative, with a strong opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage, along with strong support for Israel. Obama won just a fifth of them. Yet those groups are just a subset of religious voters, and the Democratic nominee still gets some of that vote. White non-Catholic Christians cast about 40 percent of the 2012 ballots, with white Catholics responsible for less than a fifth. The \"born-again\" white evangelical vote accounted for just a quarter of the overall electorate \u2014 same as the total Catholic vote that includes millions of Hispanics, Asians and African-Americans. Black and Hispanic voters, meanwhile, also form key pieces of the religious vote, and they lean heavily in Democrats' favor. ___ TRUMP AND WHITE EVANGELICALS In Florida, Trump told pastors he's not their \"perfect\" candidate. He's drawn fire for his boasts about sexual exploits and his caustic rhetoric about immigrants. But he's tapped Mike Pence as his running mate, touting the Indiana governor's staunch anti-abortion, anti-gay rights record that appeals to many white religious conservatives. Trump compares himself to Ronald Reagan, another divorced candidate initially questioned and then embraced by conservative religious leaders. Reagan \"knew how to win,\" Trump reminded the pastors in Florida. Arguing that too many evangelicals stayed home for Obama's victories, Trump says he's the movement's best chance for conservative federal court appointments and relaxing the ban on tax-exempt churches participating in blatant political activity. Yet Trump also risks his own oversimplifications. He urged the Florida assembly to \"get your people out to vote,\" pointing specifically at Utah, a GOP-stronghold where he is underperforming. Utah is, in fact, heavily Mormon. ___ CLINTON, THE METHODIST Just as Trump is aiming for traditionally Republican religious sectors, Clinton's is focusing most heavily on a Democratic trove: the black church. The group Kaine addressed in New Orleans was the Progressive National Baptist Convention, an outgrowth of the civil rights movement. Clinton's staff includes a \"national African-American faith outreach director.\" Still, Clinton bets that Trump's atypical GOP profile gives her some opening. She touts her Methodist faith, and some of her arguments about Trump's temperament and his treatment of others are aimed broadly at moderate and even Republican voters who prioritize their faith. ___ IS THERE A BELLWETHER? The winner among Catholics has also won the national popular vote in every presidential election since 1972. But it's really more a function of math: Catholics cast about a quarter of presidential ballots, and the group is ideologically, ethnically, racially and geographically diverse. So it's basically a massive sample size of the complete electorate. For example, Mitt Romney won six out of 10 white Catholics in 2012, about the same proportion he claimed among all whites; Obama dominated among non-white Catholics, just as he did among other non-whites. Together, Obama won a narrow majority of the Catholic vote, not much different than his national popular vote share. ___ WHERE IT MATTERS MOST? Each party's religious anchors \u2014 black Protestants for Democrats, white evangelicals for Republicans \u2014 figure prominently in Southern battlegrounds of Florida, North Carolina and Virginia (and Georgia, assuming that traditionally GOP state stays competitive). They also are important in Ohio, though the Midwestern band of states that Trump will depend on for any chance of victory generally is whiter and more Catholic than the Southern battlegrounds. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP. ___ What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

            "article_content": "Recording from 2005 surfaces A leaked video from 2005 captured Donald Trump using lewd language discussing women with a television host just before he made a cameo appearance on a soap opera. On the tape, Trump bragged about kissing and groping women while chatting with \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush.\u00a0The real estate developer and reality TV star-turned-GOP presidential candidate also used a vulgar anatomical term and discussed trying to have sex with an unidentified, married woman. \"I moved on her and I failed,\" Trump says. \"I\u2019ll admit it ... She was married ... And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\u2019\" \"I\u2019ve gotta use some tic tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump says after seeing the actress Arianne Zucker on the set of the soap opera on which he was to appear. \"You know I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful -- I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait.\" \"And when you're a star they let you do it,\" Trump continued. \"You can do anything.\" Trump subsequently issued an apology that simultaneously took aim at his rival's husband. \"This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,\" Trump said. \"Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.\" The remarks were met with widespread condemnation. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus immediately issued a statement saying, \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was \"beside himself\" and Pence's wife was furious, a person familiar with their thinking told the Associated Press.\u00a0In public, Pence ignored questions shouted by reporters in Rossford, Ohio, where he was campaigning with his daughter. This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\u00a0https://t.co/RwhW7yeFI2 This kind of behavior is disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach.\u00a0https://t.co/mOUKgr6axl House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., with whom Trump was supposed to appear at an event in the Badger State Saturday, said in a statement that he was \"sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.\" Ryan's statement added that \"[Trump] is no longer attending tomorrow's event in Wisconsin.\" Sources told Fox News that Ryan had revoked Trump's invitation to the event. Trump issued a second statement late Friday saying that Pence would attend the Wisconsin event in Trump's place, while the nominee would stay in New York to prep for Sunday's debate. The Washington Post and NBC News obtained the tape,\u00a0which includes audio and some video, and released it Friday afternoon. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is locked in a tough re-election fight and this week reversed herself to say Trump was not a good role model for children, said his comments \"are totally inappropriate and offensive.\" The comments emerged two days before the Republican nominee meets Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for their second presidential debate, and as he confronts a series of past stories about his comments about women and tries to move beyond remarks shaming a former Miss Universe for gaining weight. Trump was talking with Bush moments before they arrived on the set of \"Days of Our Lives\" to tape a segment about Trump\u2019s upcoming cameo on the soap opera, according to the Post. As the bus rolls to a stop, Trump and Bush, apparently looking out at the waiting Zucker, can be heard ogling her. \"Your girl\u2019s hot as s---, in the purple,\" says Bush, who\u2019s now a co-host of NBC\u2019s \"Today\" show. \"Whoa!\" Trump says. \"Whoa!\" In his own statement, Billy Bush said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed.\" \"It's no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago,\" said Bush. \"I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\" Earlier this week, Trump dismissed questions about his history of vulgarity, telling a television station in Nevada that \"a lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment.\" He added: \"And I can tell you this, there's nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 that has more respect for women than I do.\" Trump is slated to travel Saturday to Wisconsin to campaign at an event with House Speaker Paul Ryan, in what would be their first joint campaign appearance. Several aides to Ryan did not respond to inquiries about whether the Wisconsin Republican still planned to appear with the nominee. Trump has a long reported history of making lewd and highly sexual comments toward and about women. The Associated Press reported this week that during his years as a reality TV star on the \"The Apprentice,\" the GOP nominee repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language, rating female contestants by the size of their breasts and talking about which ones he'd like to have sex with. During frequent interviews with shock jock Howard Stern in the 1990s, Trump made a long list of demeaning comments, saying that he could have had sex with Diana, Princess of Wales, who had recently been killed in a car crash, and declaring that \"A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.\" He has repeatedly called the comedian Rosie O'Donnell a \"pig\" and \"slob\" and suggested she'd be less depressed if she stopped looking in the mirror. The Los Angeles Times reported last month that managers at Trump's golf club in southern California knew the New York developer only wanted good-looking women on staff. Trump also bragged in the moments after the first debate and days afterward that he had decided not to bring up Bill Clinton' infidelities, even as he did so. But Thursday night in New Hampshire, Trump said at an event \"let's see what happens\" when asked if he might do so in Sunday's second debate.

            "article_content": "'Clinton Cash' author Peter Schweizer goes inside the campaign contribution probe on 'America's Newsroom' Federal officials are investigating whether Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign accepted illegal campaign contributions, sources familiar with the investigation confirmed Monday to Fox News. The Democratic governor and Clinton ally is the target of a Justice Department investigation into whether he violated campaign finance laws. The probe, first reported by CNN, involves a $120,000 donation from Chinese businessman Wang Wenliang through his U.S. businesses. U.S. election law prohibits foreign nationals to donate to political races. McAuliffe's attorney, Marc Elias, said in a statement his office was not aware of the investigation, but would cooperate if contacted by federal officials. \"We cannot confirm the CNN report. \u00a0Neither the Governor nor his former campaign has knowledge of this matter, but as reported, contributions to the campaign from Mr. Wang were completely lawful,\" Elias said. \"The Governor will certainly cooperate with the government if he is contacted about it.\" A spokesman for Wang told CNN the businessman holds permanent resident status in the U.S. Wang also has been a donor to the Clinton foundation, pledging $2 million, CNN reported. McAuliffe now becomes the second consective Virginia governor to be investigated by the Justice Department. McAuliffe's predecessor in the governor's mansion, Republican Bob McDonnell, was convicted on federal corruption charges but has appealed his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court. Before winning his gubernatorial campaign in 2013 over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, McAuliffe made his name in national Democratic politics as a prolific, well-connected fundraiser with close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Although McAuliffe is close to the Clintons, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press that the investigation of McAuliffe is unconnected to a separate FBI investigation looking at the legality of private email servers that Hillary Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. Last year, McAuliffe's political action committee, Common Good Va., returned a $25,000 donation from a company with ties to Angola's state-owned oil company after The Associated Press raised questions about its legality. Federal law prohibits campaigns at any level from receiving money from outside the U.S. McAuliffe's international business connections also came under scrutiny prior to his gubernatorial campaign. He served as chairman of GreenTech Automotive, a company that hoped to bring supercompact automobiles to the U.S. market. The company attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign investment, in part through a federal program that granted visas to investors who met certain job-creation thresholds. McAuliffe resigned from the company in December 2012. GreenTech, which received millions of dollars in economic incentives from state and local officials to build a plant in Mississippi, faced criticism for falling well below expectations in production and job creation.

            "article_content": "Robert \"Spence\" Jackson, (l.), was found dead Sunday of an apparent suicide, a month after his former boss, Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, (r.), a candidate for governor, is believed to have taken his own life. The spokesman for the Missouri auditor was found dead Sunday from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, just a month after the suicide of his former boss, GOP gubernatorial frontrunner Tom Schweich. Jefferson City police said Monday that Robert \"Spence\" Jackson was found dead Sunday evening at his home in the capital city. A police statement said Jackson's death is being investigated as a suicide. Jackson had been the spokesman for Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, who shot himself to death on Feb. 26 at his home in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton. Jackson had remained as the office spokesman after Schweich's death. The 44-year-old Jackson also had previously served as the spokesman for former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt. Jackson was a strong critic of Schweich's political adversaries, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Schweich killed himself Feb. 26 at his home in Clayton minutes after telling a reporter that Republican state Chairman John Hancock had started an anti-Semitic \"whispering campaign\" against him. Hancock strongly denied the allegation but Jackson -- who had served as Schweich's media director since May 2011 -- subsequently called for his resignation, the newspaper reported. Police said they were asked by a relative to make a well-being call at Jackson's apartment a little after 7 p.m. Sunday. Jackson's mother told police he had been unresponsive to phone calls. A property manager provided a key to police officers, who found Jackson dead in his bedroom from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police. Authorities said there was no physical evidence of a forced entry or struggle, but that an autopsy is planned for Monday and detectives are continuing to investigate the case. Jefferson City Police Captain Doug Shoemaker told reporters Monday that a note was found near Jackson's body but he declined to release the contents at this time. \"There was a revolver at the apartment and one spent round as well,\" he said. Shoemaker declined to comment on whether Jackson's death is related to Schweich's suicide. Blunt released a statement Monday saying he and his wife were saddened by the death of Jackson, whom he described as a \"good friend for many years.\" \"Spence was hard-working, well-liked and quick-witted. he will truly be missed. We mourn his passing and offer our prayers to his family and friends,\" Blunt said. Schweich's death has roiled the Missouri Republican Party as it prepares for an important 2016 election that will feature contests for president, U.S. Senate, governor and most of Missouri's other statewide executive offices. Earlier this month, a prominent Republican donor said Missouri GOP chairman John Hancock had made what he took to be negative religious remarks about Schweich, who was of Jewish ancestry but attended an Episcopal church, according to the Missourian. Businessman David Humphreys said Hancock told him at a meeting last November in Joplin to discuss fundraising that Schweich was Jewish. \"The meaning I took from Mr. Hancock's statement and tone of his comments was clear: He (Tom Schweich) is Jewish \u2014 in case you didn't know \u2014 and that being Jewish is a negative attribute for Tom Schweich's gubernatorial race,\" Humphreys said in an affidavit. Hancock, who Jackson had called on to resign, denied making the remark. Former Republican U.S. Sen. John Danforth, an Episcopal minister who was Schweich's political mentor, delivered the eulogy at Schweich's funeral and suggested his friend had been driven to suicide by an anti-Semitic whispering campaign. Danforth said the state party should oust Hancock. \"The brand of the Republican Party in Missouri has been badly damaged, and it's very important to set the record clear,\" Danforth told the AP. \"I think it's important for Republicans to dissociate themselves from what has happened in the campaign against Tom Schweich.\" Police said last week they have no evidence of an anti-Semitic whispering campaign against Schweich or any political bullying. Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass the investigation into Schweich's death is nearing an end and that Schweich left behind no message explaining his actions. \"I think everybody's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we're not finding anything,\" Bass told the AP last week. He said based on \"the leads and sources that we have heard from, we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign.\" FoxNews.com's Cristina Corbin and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Candidate trailing in latest Fox News Poll, Republican insiders reportedly looking to step in Sixty-one percent of voters think Hillary Clinton is dishonest, yet she\u2019s opened up a big lead over Donald Trump in the latest Fox News Poll. Here\u2019s why: majorities think Clinton is nevertheless qualified to be president, and has the temperament and knowledge to serve effectively. It\u2019s the opposite for Trump: over half feel he is not qualified, and lacks the temperament or knowledge to lead the country. And his 62 percent dishonesty rating tops hers. After the conventions, the Clinton-Kaine ticket leads the Trump-Pence ticket by 10 points (49-39 percent) in the race for the White House. Clinton\u2019s advantage is outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. A month ago, Clinton was up by six points (44-38 percent, June 26-28). This is the first time the Fox News Poll included running mates. Trump announced his vice presidential pick of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence July 15. Clinton told supporters she\u2019d picked Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine July 22. Since last month, Clinton\u2019s position is improved with most groups, as she gained ground among men, women, whites, Democrats, young voters, and seniors. The Democrat is winning among the so-called \u201cObama coalition,\u201d the key voting blocs that secured his re-election. Clinton is favored among women by 23 points (57-34 percent), blacks by 83 (87-4 percent), Hispanics by 48 (68-20 percent), and voters under 30 by 18 (49-31 percent). CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS Those numbers rival Barack Obama\u2019s performance among those groups against Mitt Romney in 2012, when he won among women by 11 points (55-44 percent), blacks by 87 (93-6 percent), Hispanics by 44 (71-27 percent), and voters under 30 by 23 (60-37 percent). Trump is the choice among whites by 10 points (49-39 percent), men by 5 (45-40 percent), white evangelical Christians by 50 (69-19 percent), and whites without a college degree by 16 (52-36 percent). Right now he\u2019s underperforming his 2012 counterpart. Romney won whites by 20 points (59-39 percent), men by 7 (52-45 percent), white evangelicals by 57 (78-21 percent), and whites without a degree by 26 (62-36 percent). Trump bests Clinton among veterans by 53-39 percent. Twelve percent of Republicans back Clinton. That\u2019s more than double the number of Democrats supporting Trump (five percent). And while Clinton garners more support among Democrats (87 percent) than Trump does among Republicans (78 percent), she trails among independents. They go for the Republican by 41-33 percent. In 2012, independents went for Romney by 50-45 percent. More Clinton supporters say their vote is for her rather than against Trump (49-47 percent). Among Trump supporters, a majority says their vote is better described as being against Clinton (52 percent), while less than half are voting because they like him (44 percent). When Libertarians Gary Johnson and Bill Weld are included in the hypothetical vote, they receive 12 percent, while Clinton takes 44 percent to Trump\u2019s 35 percent. They siphon off support about equally from both the Democratic and GOP tickets. Qualified to be president? Sixty-five percent say Clinton is vs. 43 percent Trump. Fifty-eight percent feel he isn\u2019t qualified, including 45 percent who say \u201cnot at all.\u201d On temperament, 64 percent say Clinton has it. Just 37 percent say Trump does. And 72 percent think Clinton has the knowledge to serve effectively, while 40 percent say the same for Trump. The poll finds a couple things that could bode well for the incumbent party, most notably a positive rating for the president. A 52-percent majority approves of the job Barack Obama\u2019s doing as president. Forty-five percent disapprove. Those are his best marks since May 2011, soon after U.S. forces killed Usama bin Laden, when 55 percent approved and 41 percent disapproved. In addition, more voters feel they are getting ahead financially (35 percent) than have felt that way in nearly a decade. There are also findings that could help Trump. Most voters say they are either just able to pay bills (49 percent) or are falling behind (14 percent). In addition, 55 percent remains dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Those unhappy voters prefer Trump by 62-23 percent, which makes sense considering 84 percent of Republicans are dissatisfied with the direction of the country. Poll-pourri After emails published online showed the Democratic National Committee favored Clinton over Bernie Sanders during the nomination process, 37 percent of Democrats think their party\u2019s primary process was rigged in favor of Clinton. That jumps to 56 percent among all voters, and 61 percent among those who preferred Sanders over Clinton as the party\u2019s nominee. Some 37 percent of Sanders supporters think he would have won if the primaries had been fair. Republicans are still divided over their party\u2019s nominee: 50 percent are happy with Trump, while 49 percent would rather have someone else. Finally, 77 percent of voters are familiar with the exchange between Trump and the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died while serving in Iraq. Some 69 percent of them describe Trump\u2019s criticism of the Khan family as \u201cout of bounds.\u201d Among Republicans, 40 percent think his response was \u201cin bounds,\u201d while 41 percent say \u201cout of bounds,\u201d and 19 percent are unsure. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,022 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from July 31-August 2, 2016. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

            "article_content": "Democrats and several Republicans banded together on Thursday to block legislation to keep the government open over a contentious, GOP-led effort to strip Planned Parenthood of its taxpayer funding. The vote was 47-52, falling short of a majority and the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster led by Democrats. Eight Republicans, several of whom support abortion rights, voted with 42 Democrats and two independents to kill the measure. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., hasn't explicitly said what he'll do next to avoid a partial government shutdown at midnight on Wednesday. But he's widely expected to begin debate on a bipartisan stopgap spending bill free of the Planned Parenthood dispute that would pass with Democratic support next week and be signed into law by President Barack Obama. \"I think we all know we're going to have a clean\" continuing resolution, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, using the common congressional term. \"The House is going to figure out what the House is going to do but we can't shut down the government.\" Speaking at the White House, Obama reminded Congress of the need to keep the government open. Honoring public health workers for their efforts to combat Ebola, the president said such organizations \"need support from Congress in order continue to excel in their mission so I hope that Congress chooses to keep our government open and operating so that heroes like this can keep working.\" Planned Parenthood has long been targeted by Republicans, but their efforts have intensified after the release of secretly recorded videos that raised questions about its handling of fetal tissue provided to scientific researchers. The group says it is doing nothing wrong and isn't profiting from such practices in violation of federal law. The vote to block the stopgap spending bill was widely expected. And on Thursday, the White House issued a statement that Obama would veto it anyway, arguing that it \"would limit access to health care for women, men, and families across the nation, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.\" McConnell has long promised there will not be a government shutdown, and allies have telegraphed his next move -- a temporary funding bill through Dec. 11 that's free of provisions opposed by Democratic supporters of Planned Parenthood -- even while he has held his cards close to his vest. The Senate's vote, and the bipartisan measure likely to follow, cranks up the pressure on the GOP-controlled House. There, GOP leaders have been stymied in their hopes to pass a temporary spending bill known as a continuing resolution. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has only shaky control over his fractious caucus, and tea party Republicans adamant about using the must-pass measure to carry provisions to defund Planned Parenthood, even at the risk of a partial government shutdown. GOP leaders like Boehner have counseled privately that it's a doomed strategy and want to avoid a repeat of the 2013 closure, which hurt the party politically. McConnell appears to enjoy support from a majority of the Republican rank and file. \"I'd rather it defund Planned Parenthood, but if the votes aren't there, I don't see the point of having a standoff,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate GOP's campaign committee. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is using his rivalry with GOP leaders in Washington to help define his presidential campaign, responded in an editorial essay in Politico that simply the threat of a shutdown was sending \"Republican leadership running for the hills.\" Sending such a measure to the GOP-controlled House just a day or two before a potential shutdown seems aimed at giving Republican leaders in the House the push needed to roll over recalcitrant tea partyers opposed to a bill that fails to take on Planned Parenthood. Both public and internal GOP polling shows that voters do not favor shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood's practices. Eleven GOP House freshmen -- several facing difficult re-election races next year in Democratic-leaning districts -- say they oppose a shutdown confrontation. A \"Dear Colleague\" letter by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello promises to \"avoid repeating the mistakes of the past,\" a reference to the GOP-sparked 2013 shutdown over implementation of the health care law. Other GOP freshmen from conservative districts, such as Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Jody Hice and Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, have signed on to a more confrontational strategy, along with prominent conservatives like Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. The measure also contains $700 million in emergency funding to fight western wildfires.",

            "article_content": "'The O'Reilly Factor': Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points 7/6 Newly unearthed photos of President Obama in Muslim garb underscore his deep ties to the faith -- and possibly help explain his reluctance to call out radical Islam, Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly said Wednesday. The photos, aired on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d were taken at the wedding of Obama\u2019s half-brother, Malik Obama, in Maryland sometime in the early 1990s, O\u2019Reilly said. They were not offered as evidence that Obama is Muslim, as some of his critics insist, but to show his \u201cdeep emotional ties\u201d to the religion of his father and stepfather, O\u2019Reilly said. O'Reilly said the photos, taken in the 1990s, underscore Obama's deep ties to Islam. (Fox News Channel) \u201cThere is no question the Obama administration's greatest failure is allowing the Islamic terror group ISIS to run wild, murdering thousands of innocent people all over the world, including many Muslims,\u201d said O'Reilly. \u201cMr. Obama has never, never acknowledged that mistake, nor does he define the ISIS threat accurately. \u201cThat group is killing innocent people in order to impose a radical version of Islam on the world,\u201d the newsman added. \u201cThe jihad is solely based on theology, perverted as it may be.\u201d A similar photo emerged in 2008, when Obama was running for the Democratic presidential nomination against Hillary Clinton. In that photo, Obama was seen wearing a white turban and Muslim dress. The photo was sent to the influential Drudge Report, and Obama\u2019s campaign blamed Clinton for the \u201csmear.\u201d This photo shook up the 2008 presidential campaign. (Screengrab) \"On the very day that Senator Clinton is giving a speech about restoring respect for America in the world, her campaign has engaged in the most shameful, offensive fear-mongering we've seen from either party in this election,\" then-Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said. The president reportedly met his older half-brother for the first time in 1985. Malik Obama now lives in a rural Kenyan village near Lake Victoria.",

Aside from the obvious conclusion that a more crowded field helps Trump \u2013 regardless of what those seeking to crowd it may claim \u2013 the answer here is about likely but unwilling voters. Each election cycle, pollsters and campaigns are on the hunt for likely voters: high-propensity ballot casters who will make up the overwhelming majority of the electorate, as they do every election. But as the\u00a0WSJ\u00a0points out today, many of those likely voters don\u2019t like their choices. The share of undecided voters stands at 13 percent in the latest WSJ poll, 5 points more than at this point in the previous cycle. More interesting is how many of those undecided voters are college-educated, white, suburbanites. This ought to be good news for Republicans since those voters are the key bloc of their coalition. Think of undecided voters as a glacier on a mountainside. As the ice melts, it\u2019s bound to run off one way or the other. In this case, the Republicans would seemingly stand to benefit when this glacier gives way. But they aren\u2019t budging so far. And this is the way in which minor-party candidates could deliver the presidency to Trump: Clinton will probably need some of these frustrated typical Republican voters to come her way. If too many stay home or cast protest votes for non-viable candidates, Trump could sneak past her in a close race. As\u00a0David Drucker\u00a0explains, Clinton is aware of this and has been stepping up her courtship of GOP-leaning voters, especially on national security. And if she gets her way, enough of those typical Republicans will, albeit grudgingly, give her their support. But they would be putting limits on her power. In the poll, 48 percent of the undecided voters said they preferred Republicans to keep control of Congress, almost 20 points higher for the group than at this point in 2012. Clinton is deeply mistrusted by voters and Americans have long shown a preference for divided government.\u00a0It may be that as these swing voters make their minds up to vote for Clinton, they are also choosing to make sure to hamstring her with a Republican Congress. In the event of a Clinton victory, we may be seeing ticket splitting at a level not seen since the 1980s\u2026not to mention two years of gridlock after she takes office.THE RULEBOOK: ELEMENTARY\u201cLiberty is to [partisanship] what air is to fire, an [element] without which it instantly expires.

It is so depleted. We will rebuild our military,\u2019 Trump said Wednesday during a speech at the Union League in Philadelphia.

CONGRESSMAN, YOU\u2019VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DODid you hear the one about the Democratic congressman who compared Marco Rubio to Ricky Ricardo? Probably not, unless you were glued to The Weekly Standard\u2019s blog. But that really happened. For any Millennials who are reading, Ricardo was the character played by Desi Arnaz on \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d He was a broad, mostly unflattering ethnic stereotype \u2013 a hot-tempered Cuban bandleader who would become outraged at his wife\u2019s zany antics.\u00a0Arnaz was something of a sex symbol, but certainly played his ethnicity for laughs. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., had nasty lines for nearly everyone in the GOP field, comparing Chris Christie to Jabba the Hutt, etc. Pocan at least knew enough to avoid Ben Carson. But let\u2019s just flip this Rubio bit around and try it on for size. Imagine if a Republican congressman in 2007 had suggested then-Sen.

The president who campaigned on getting the U.S. out of Iraq is getting back in, bit by bit. So what does Hillary Clinton think? Don\u2019t be silly. Clinton doesn\u2019t answer questions. Neither will she be talking much about foreign policy in the vanilla Pudding Pop of a campaign re-launch she has planned for the rest of this month. Clinton, who is raising money behind closed doors this week, is ducking two kinds of questions. The presumptive Democratic nominee\u2019s inbox of unanswered scandal-related questions was already overflowing, but now the real-time policy points that any candidate would be expected to answer is off limits.

            "article_content": "House Democrats protest inaction on gun violence WASHINGTON \u2013 Rebellious Democrats shut down the House's legislative work on Wednesday, staging a sit-in on the House floor and refusing to leave until they secured a vote on gun control measures before lawmakers' weeklong break. Exasperated Republicans were forced to recess while cutting off cameras that showed the protest. But in an unprecedented step, C-SPAN used live video feeds from one lawmaker's Periscope account and another's Facebook page to transmit words and images from the House chamber. More than 200 Democrats led by Georgia Rep. John Lewis demanded a vote on measures to expand background checks and block gun purchases by some suspected terrorists in the aftermath of last week's massacre in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people in a gay nightclub. \"No bill, no break,\" shouted Democrats, who demanded that Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., keep the House in session through its planned break next week to vote on gun legislation. Democrats accused Republicans of political cowardice by failing to schedule a vote. Proud to sit with @RepJoeCourtney and others demanding action. #GoodTrouble #NoBillNoBreak pic.twitter.com/SNMWlQ0ZfZ \"Are they more afraid than the children at Sandy Hook?\" asked Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., referring to the 2012 shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 elementary school children, in Newtown, Connecticut. \"What is so scary about having a vote?\" Lewis, a veteran civil rights leader, asked what Congress has done, then answered his own question: \"Nothing. We have turned a deaf ear to the blood of innocents. We are blind to a crisis. Where is our courage?\" Ryan dismissed the protest as \"nothing more than a publicity stunt,\" and in an interview with CNN, made clear there would be no vote. \"We're not going to take away a citizen's constitutional rights without due process,\" he said. Republicans emerging from a closed-door meeting said they would hold votes on other legislation, but not the gun votes demanded by the Democrats. \"We are going to go about our business starting tonight,\" said Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo. Democrats were certain to challenge any move. The protest began around 11:30 a.m., interrupted briefly when Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, tried to start the House's work at noon. The customary prayer and Pledge of Allegiance went ahead, but Poe was forced to recess the House when dozens of Democrats refused to leave the well. By evening, more than nine hours later, 168 House Democrats \u2014 out of 188 \u2014 and 34 Senate Democrats joined the protest, according to the House minority leader's office. One after another, they spoke of the need for gun control and talked of constituents who had been killed. Scattered around the House floor were signs reading \"Disarm Hate.\" Visitors watched from the galleries. A crowd of several hundred gun control advocates gathered outside the Capitol and cheered as Democrats addressed them. Congress remains gridlocked over gun control, a divide even more pronounced in a presidential election year. The sit-in had the feel of a 1960s-style protest, as some lawmakers sat on the floor, others in their seats. Republicans had staged a similar protest in 2008. Democrats controlling the House at the time turned off the cameras amid a GOP push for a vote to expand oil and gas drilling. Republicans occupied the floor, delivering speeches after then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the House on its August recess. Pelosi ordered the cameras turned off. Republicans ultimately forced the drilling provision to be attached to a stopgap spending bill. C-SPAN, a cable and satellite network that provides continual coverage of House and Senate floor proceedings, does not control the cameras. They're run on authorization by legislative leaders. Although the cameras were turned off Wednesday, lawmakers relied on social media to transmit video, using Facebook, Twitter and Periscope. C-SPAN broadcast live video streamed on Periscope and Facebook from lawmakers' accounts. Democrats posted the Capitol's main telephone number, which was overwhelmed, and urged constituents to call and request a vote. They also encouraged tweeting under the hashtag #NoBillNoBreak. Democratic senators joining the protest included Minority Leader Harry Reid, Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who had waged a nearly 15-hour filibuster last week to force votes in the Senate on gun legislation. Those votes failed Monday night. Democrats cited polls showing broad public support for expanding background checks for firearms purchases and blocking suspected terrorists from buying guns. Pelosi, now the minority leader, said the House needs to act on gun legislation, rather than continually hold moments of silence in memory of victims of gun violence. \"We truly believe that if there were a vote that we would win the vote, because 85 to 90 percent of the American people ... support responsible background checks legislation,\" Pelosi said.",

            "article_content": "Newsmax founder Christopher Ruddy says his $1 million donation to Bill and Hillary Clinton's foundation is not an endorsement of a Hillary presidential candidacy. (Fox Business Network) He once wrote a book linking Bill and Hillary Clinton to an alleged cover up in the death of a White House lawyer, but judging by conservative newsman Christopher Ruddy\u2019s recent pledge of $1 million to the once and potentially future first couple\u2019s foundation, his opinion seems to have softened. Ruddy, the founder of the conservative website Newsmax, and author of the 1997 book, \u201cThe Strange Death of Vincent Foster,\u201d pledged the seven-figure sum over a five-year period, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that Ruddy has been friends with the Clintons since 2007. A political analyst told FoxNews.com that the relationship between Ruddy, who considers himself a Reagan Republican, and the Clintons, may have improved because of the Clintons\u2019 friendship with the late Richard Mellon Scaife, a billionaire who invested in Newsmax.com. The former president spoke at the memorial service for Scaife, 82, in 2014, according to NewsMax.com, saying he had developed a \u2018counterintuitive friendship\u2019 with Scaife that proved to be an \u201cinvaluable experience.\u201d \"[Hillary Clinton would] make a great presidential candidate.\u201d The online news source quoted Bill Clinton\u2019s eulogy to about 150 people at the private memorial service in southwestern Pennsylvania: \"Our political differences, our philosophical differences, our religious differences, our racial and ethnic differences, they're important. They help us to define who we are. But they don't have to keep us at arm's length from others.\" Last year, Ruddy launched \u201cNewsmaxTV,\" a 24-hour cable news channel that had previously streamed online. The former president and possible future candidate have raised $2 billion for their The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, including a $1 million pledge from an unlikely source. (AP) Public records show Ruddy already donated $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation. According to The Washington Post, Ruddy traveled with the former president to Africa, and in an interview, \u201chailed Clinton\u2019s work as \u201cgood for the world and America.\u201d Ruddy did not return an email to FoxNews.com seeking comment. The Clinton Foundation did not return requests for comment on the donation. Ruddy told The Wall Street Journal through a spokesman that, although he felt Hillary Clinton would \u201cmake a great presidential candidate,\u201d the donation to The Clinton Foundation was not a political endorsement. According to the campaign contribution records filed with the Federal Election Commission, Ruddy did not donate funds to any of the Clintons\u2019 political campaigns. However, Ruddy has made 142 personal contributions to politicians in recent years for a total of $483,010. Of the 142 records, 120 are identified as contributions to Republicans, 15 contributions to PACs, and 7 contributions to Democrats. The $1 million from NewsMax.com is just a tiny fraction of the $2 billion the foundation has raised since its inception in 2001. The Clintons were in the news Feb. 18 after The Wall Street Journal highlighted some of those donations as being from foreign sources including donors in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and Canada\u2019s foreign affairs department, despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s pledged the practice would end. The Journal reported the Foundation \u201cdefended its practice of accepting donations from overseas governments, amid concerns from some ethics experts that such contributions are inappropriate at a time when\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0is preparing to run for president.\u201d",

The NYT was first to report the sit-down, and as Fox News heard from aides to both men, the meeting was initially scheduled as a friendly get-together before Romney announced he was exploring the possibility of a third White House bid. The session remained on the calendar as Bush and Romney have turned into rivals. Bush\u2019s purpose when he first asked for the meeting was presumably to get the blessing of the party\u2019s 2012 nominee \u2013 the kind of courtesy calls that Romney himself paid to party elders in 2008 and 2012. But as a contender rather than a influencer, Romney will be a very different host for Bush. [\u201c\u2026 Romney will deliver the keynote address and receive an honorary degree at Jacksonville University\u2019s Spring Commencement on April 25, the University announced.\u201d]Mitt-ness protection - The chances for the GOP establishment to keep alive its three-decade streak of picking the party\u2019s nominee would be seriously jeopardized if Romney and Bush wage a civil war against each other. While there have been reports of friction between Romney and Bushworld, the two men certainly represent a similar ideological and socioeconomic swath of the party. If Bush could somehow convince Romney to lay aside his challenge and help him raise money and solidify support, it would be a huge advantage. The fact that Bush is even willing to go to Salt Lake City to kiss Romney\u2019s ring suggests he understands the seriousness of the situation. Remember that Bush, who hasn\u2019t run for office since 2002, is starting a campaign from scratch and can ill-afford to play an elimination round against Romney. If Bush can promise to focus on Romney\u2019s issues and rely on his advice, might Romney be mollified? [Iowa GOP boss: Jeb will play - WSJ:\u201c\u2018I just got off the phone with Jeb Bush,\u2019 Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann began a conversation Wednesday afternoon. \u2018I can certainly tell you that he\u2019s coming to Iowa to campaign and play in the caucus.\u2019\u201d]Bush bounce out? - Romney\u2019s posture on the potential third run has been that he did not wish to do so, but worried that the GOP field was not ready to face down a $2 billion campaign by Hillary Clinton. If Bush can\u2019t convince Romney that he\u2019s up to the job, could Romney convince Bush to step aside for him? Not likely. The Bush family is going deep on this bid and Jeb has been hustling to build an organization. It seems unlikely that he would be cowed by the threat of a Romney run. However, if Romney could convince Bush that he has changed his hardline stance on the issue of immigration, near to the former Florida governor\u2019s heart, it could plant the seeds for a future accord. Of course, party elders would like that truce to come before the two men spend tens of millions of dollars and several months battling each other. The longer they fight, the better for the insurgent candidates trying to break into the game.Romney pushes action on global warming in Salt Lake speech - AP: \u201cWhile hitting familiar Republican points criticizing the size of the federal debt, Romney at times sounded like a Democrat, calling for President Barack Obama and other leaders in Washington to act on common liberal priorities such as climate change, poverty and education. \u2018I'm one of those Republicans who thinks we are getting warmer and that we contribute to that,\" he said of climate change, charging that federal leaders have failed to enact global agreements needed to tackle the problem.\u2019 [The Hill: \u201cThe Senate on Wednesday voted that \u2018climate change is real and is not a hoax\u2019. \u2026 In a surprise, the Senate\u2019s leading skeptic of climate science, Sen. James Inhofe [R-Okla.], voted in favor of the amendment, but made clear he doesn\u2019t believe humans are the primary driver of climate change. The GOP \u2018yes\u2019 votes also included three of the GOP\u2019s leading contenders for the White House: Sens. Ted Cruz [Texas], Rand Paul [Ky.] and Marco Rubio [Fla.]\u2026\u201d]Rand to battle GOP on infrastructure - The Hill: \u201cSen. Rand Paul [R-Ky.] told a GOP group Wednesday that he will battle with fellow Republicans to pass tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending via a bipartisan tax repatriation bill. He estimates that allowing corporations to bring overseas profits back into the country at a reduced tax rate of 5 percent could generate between $30 billion and $60 billion in the first year alone. Paul believes he can work out a deal with Sen. Barbara Boxer [D-Calif.], the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, that would give corporations a five-year window to bring their profits back\u2026\u2018My biggest opposition right now is actually Republicans,\u2019 he said. \u2018They want repatriation, lowering that tax, to be part of overall permanent tax reform. Good luck getting the president to sign it and good luck getting enough Democrats to do a tax reform that\u2019s of any value,\u2019 he said.\u201dHILLARY READY TO DEPLOY FUNDRAISING \u2018LIKE NOTHING YOU\u2019VE SEEN\u2019The Hill: \u201cMajor donors are ready to announce huge financial commitments to Hillary Clinton as soon as she announces a second run for the White House, according to Clinton allies and Democratic fundraisers. The Clinton team wants to build excitement about her campaign launch, which is expected in March or April. The money blitz would be a show of Clinton\u2019s strength meant to scare away potential primary rivals. \u2018The floodgates are going to open immediately, and there\u2019s going to be a rush to get on the team,\u2019 said Don Peebles, the real estate mogul who served on President Obama\u2019s national finance committee\u2026\u2018It\u2019s going to be like nothing you\u2019ve seen,\u2019 added one top Democratic donor, who supported both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and plans to throw big support behind Clinton. \u2018The numbers will be astounding.\u2019\u201dHillary warns: \u2018Dangerous strain of extremism within the Muslim world\u2019 - The Globe and Mail: \u201cHillary Clinton faced a boisterous crowd in Saskatchewan\u2019s largest city and called on global leaders to do more to face a \u2018generational challenge\u2019 of extremism spreading around the world\u2026Earlier in the day, she toured the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, citing the Winnipeg museum as a symbol of the tolerance and values that Canada and the U.S. should champion\u2026\u2018We can\u2019t close our eyes to the fact that at this time in our world\u2019s history there is a distorted and dangerous strain of extremism within the Muslim world which continues to spread,\u2019 she said during a luncheon in Winnipeg. \u2018We are confronting an ideology of hate.\u2019\u201dHillary backers fudge on transparency - National Journal: \u201cThe Center for American Progress, the liberal think tank whose founder, John Podesta, is a key adviser to President Obama and will likely take a top post in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, made a big show Wednesday of releasing its 2014 donor list in response to complaints about a lack of transparency.\u00a0 But the list is anything but complete.\u00a0 At least three donors gave $1 million or more, but they are shown only as \u2018Anonymous.\u2019\u201d [The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama is tapping Brian Deese, the deputy director of his budget office, to replace veteran aide John Podesta when he departs the White House next month.]Trouble - WashEx: \u201c\u2026a potential problem for Clinton, CAP and Podesta \u2014 the latter's association with \u2018Hansjorg Wyss, a reclusive Swiss billionaire whose company conducted illegal human experiments that resulted in the deaths of three elderly patients.\u2019\u201d Biden: Dem primary \u2018wide open\u2019 - National Journal: \u201c[Vice President Joe Biden] said on ABC: \u2018I don't think you have to make up your mind until the summer,\u2019 adding that the presidential race is \u2018wide open on both sides.\u2019\u201dHOUSE GOP FUMBLES ON LATE-TERM ABORTION BANThe national consensus has come down sharply against allowing elective abortions after the start of the sixth month of pregnancy. That conclusion has been one of the great success stories for any political movement in recent decades. Pro-life groups, in Washington today to march on the Supreme Court on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, have managed to redefine the debate on abortion, moving away from absolutist language and onto areas where there is broad public agreement. (Gallup found that just 14 percent of Americans supported keeping third-trimester elective abortions legal.) And today was going to be a crowning moment as the House voted for such a ban, setting up passage by the new Republican-led Senate and an eventual veto fight with the president. But Rep. Renee Ellmers, a North Carolina Republican who voted for an identical measure last year, and a handful of other lawmakers flipped on the bill Wednesday, forcing House leaders to yank the measure. The bill will come back around and undoubtedly pass eventually, so the play by Ellmers & Co. has ensured more attention will be paid to the topic, which is reportedly exactly what the defectors claimed they wanted to avoid. [Watch Fox: Fox News Correspondent Shannon Bream reports from the 42nd annual March for Life rally on the National Mall.] New on Fox News Opinion: Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., makes the case for her bill to provide full religious exemption from Obamacare\u2019s abortion-pill mandate and ensure protections for health care professionals who refuse to perform abortions because of their deeply held beliefs.WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...It was on this day in 1981 that the final photo of John Lennon and Yoko Ono was published on the cover of Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone\u2019s tribute issue hit newsstands featuring the iconic Annie Liebowitz portrait of a nude Lennon curled beside a fully clothed Ono. It was a picture that Liebowitz never intended to get, recalling that the magazine\u2019s editor Jann Wenner specifically asked for photos without Ono. But Lennon wouldn\u2019t hear of it asking to be photographed with his wife. While this is the most notable photo in Lennon\u2019s final days, it was not the final photo of the singer before his death. That occurred outside his apartment building when Lennon signed an autograph for Mark David Chapman, the same man who would end the singer\u2019s life just six hours later.

Bob Menendez [D-N.J.] blasted the Obama administration for their recent talk on Iran\u2026\u2018I have to be honest with you,\u2019 Menendez said, \u2018the more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran. It feeds to the Iranian narrative of victimization when they are the ones with original sin. An illicit nuclear weapons program going back of the course of 20 years that they are unwilling to come clean on.\u2019 The Obama administration and Senate Democrats are currently battling over increased sanctions for the Iranian regime. Senate Democrats, led by Menendez, are keen to weigh in on the Iranian nuclear program. Meanwhile, the White House has said that any statement from Congress could put at risk any deal with Iran to dismantle its nuclear capabilities.\u201dDem congresswoman says \u2018great concern\u2019 over Obama\u2019s refusal to say \u2018Islamic extremism\u2019 -\u00a0 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, told Fox News that President Obama\u2019s refusal to describe jihadist attacks as \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d is a \u201cgreat concern\u201d that is shared by lawmakers from both parties. \u201cBy his not using this term \u2018Islamic extremism\u2019 and clearly identifying our enemies, it raised a whole host of questions in exactly what Congress will be authorizing? Who will we be targeting? Who is our enemy? Gabbard said on \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto,\u201d \u201cUnless you understand who your enemy is, unless you clearly identify your enemy, then you cannot come up with a very effective strategy to defeat that enemy.\u201dBoehner invites Bibi to brief Congress on Iran \u2013 Fox News: \u201cHouse Speaker John Boehner announced Wednesday he is inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress [Feb 11] about the threat from Iran, in a sharp rebuke to President Obama. Such invitations typically are coordinated with the White House and State Department, but this one was not\u2026.\u00a0Obama vowed Tuesday during his State of the Union address to veto any [Iran sanctions] legislation. But Boehner signaled he wants Netanyahu to explain the stakes of the debate, as he pledged to press ahead with the legislation\u2026. \u2018In this time of challenge, I am asking the prime minister to address Congress on the grave threats radical Islam and Iran pose to our security and way of life.\u2019\u00a0[Boehner said in a statement]. Asked about the invite, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest described it as a breach of typical protocol since the White House wasn\u2019t involved. But he said the administration would reserve judgment until they speak with the Israelis.\u201d [WaPo does a deep-dive fact check on President Obama\u2019s State of the Union claim that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been \u201chalted\u201d and its nuclear stockpile \u201creduced.\u201d The result: Obama earns Three Pinocchios.] \u201cThe president warned us not to move ahead with sanctions on Iran, a state sponsor of terror. His exact message to us was: \u2018Hold your fire.\u2019 He expects us to stand idly by and do nothing while he cuts a bad deal with Iran.\u00a0Two words: \u2018Hell no\u2019.\u201d \u2013 Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio to the Republican Conf. Wednesday.Israeli spies don\u2019t see eye-to-eye with Netanyahu - Bloomberg: \u201cThe Israeli intelligence agency Mossad\u00a0has broken ranks with Prime Minister Benjamin\u00a0Netanyahu, telling U.S. officials and lawmakers that a new Iran sanctions bill in the U.S. Congress would tank the Iran nuclear negotiations\u2026. Israeli intelligence officials have been briefing both Obama administration officials and visiting U.S. senators about their concerns on the Kirk-Menendez bill, which would increase sanctions on Iran only if the Iranian government can\u2019t\u00a0strike a deal with the so-called P5+1 countries by a June 30\u00a0deadline or fails to live up to its commitments.\u201d [More talks - U.S. and Iranian negotiators will hold talks about Iran\u2019s nuclear program in Switzerland on Friday and Saturday.

In a statement released Wednesday night by the American Center for Law and Justice, Naghmeh Abedini said she met with Obama for about 10 minutes in Boise, Idaho, before he addressed an audience at Boise State University about education.\u201dThe Judge\u2019s Ruling - With new revelations of phone call monitoring and technology that enables law enforcement agencies to see through walls, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks who will protect personal privacy: \u201cIf you peered into your neighbor\u2019s bedroom with a high-tech device, you\u2019d be prosecuted or sued.

After the incident, which occurred during a cleaning, museum staffers say they were ordered to quickly remedy the situation, to get the mask back on display ASAP. But in their haste, someone goofed and used hard-drying epoxy to get the job done, which has now caused lasting damage to the famed mask. D\u2019oh! When bosses found out, a new panic ensued: \u201cAnother museum conservator, who was present at the time of the repair, said that epoxy had dried on the face of the boy king's mask and that a colleague used a spatula to remove it, leaving scratches. The first conservator, who inspects the artifact regularly, confirmed the scratches and said it was clear that they had been made by a tool used to scrape off the epoxy.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201c[President Obama] said we're going to do this for six months, then we will reimpose sanctions if Iran hasn't done that. They didn't. What does he do, he doesn't impose sanctions. He extends talks. That deadline runs out again, what does he do\u00a0- extends them seven months again for a second time.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this month revealed that it is proposing to put\u00a0the ban\u00a0on 5.56 mm ammo on a fast track, immediately driving up the price of the bullets and prompting retailers, including the\u00a0huge outdoors company Cabela\u2019s, to urge sportsmen to urge Congress to stop the president.\u201d#mediabuzz: Howie gets the Axe - This week Howard Kurtz welcomes President Obama\u2019s former top political adviser David Axelrod joins the conversation to discuss the contentious relationship between President Obama and the media.

Anyone who goes online does so through an ISP, and increasingly these companies are lobbying to provide services on their own terms. Without net neutrality rules, companies like Comcast and Verizon could cherry pick which content is easy to access. And that means that consumer access to specific online content could slow down or speed up noticeably.\u201d404 - The Hill: \u201cPartisan tensions over the drafting of new net neutrality rules might not fade so quickly on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Thursday\u2019s\u00a03-2 vote\u00a0on the rules came after months of accusations of misconduct and antipathy from the commission\u2019s two Republicans, and they don\u2019t appear entirely confident that everything can be smoothed over.\u201dBOEHNER PUTS PRESSURE BACK ON SENATE IN DHS FUNDING FIGHTNational Journal: \u201cSpeaker John Boehner on Thursday night finally laid out a plan to avert a partial shutdown of the Homeland Security Department: kick the can a little farther down the road. Yet even that may fail. With just one day left until funding runs dry for DHS, Boehner urged his conference to pass a three-week extension of current funding and try to force Senate Democrats into a conference committee to resolve their differences. The only alternatives, he told his members behind closed doors, would be to let the department shut down or capitulate to the Senate by passing a clean full-year funding bill. But passing the measure in the House will not be easy. Boehner\u2019s partial solution comes after a weeks-long deadlock, and he is stuck between angry conservatives adamant about blocking President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration and moderates concerned about the politics of a shutdown.\u201dTsk-tsk - WaPo: \u201cAs Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) discussed the scheduling of Friday\u2019s votes, Hoyer criticized Republicans for leaving the department \u2018twisting in the wind\u2019 -- prompting groans from the GOP side of the aisle and prompting McCarthy, who had the floor, to reclaim his time. Hoyer\u2019s retort? \u2018You coward,\u2019 he said, captured on a\u00a0C-SPAN broadcast.\u201dNuts and bolts - Despite heated rhetoric, if Congress cannot come to an agreement on funding, DHS would still function normally since most of their employees are deemed \u201cessential.\u201d But employees would not be paid and hiring would slow until funding resumed. The disruptions, though, wouldn\u2019t likely commence until next week, because of bureaucratic lag time. Possible outcomes: shutdown, agreement, or temporary agreement to prolong debate.REID AGREES TO MEET WITH BIBIThe Hill: \u201cSenate leaders from both parties will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to Washington, D.C., next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will meet with Netanyahu on Tuesday afternoon, after his address to a joint session of Congress on the Iranian nuclear threat. On Wednesday, Netanyahu\u00a0declined an invitation\u00a0to meet only with Senate Democrats, fearing it would \u2018compound the misperception of partisanship\u2019 surrounding his visit. The bipartisan invite comes amid rising tension between the Obama administration and Netanyahu.\u201dTHAT NAME DOESN\u2019T CLICKResidents of L\u00fcderitz, a quaint town on a lovely spot of\u00a0 the coast of Namibia, are in the middle of identity crisis. AP reports that local officials have proposed changing the town\u2019s name to better reflect the Nama ethnic group. The proposed name is !Nami#nus. No, those aren\u2019t typos. That\u2019s the approximate written form for the click-like sounds found in the native Nama language. Incorporating the symbols is bound to cause issues especially on computers and websites, resident Crispin Clay said, \u201cNobody\u2019s quite certain how to pronounce or how to spell it. We'll never get the clicks right.\u201d Clay adds that such a unique name will hurt the town\u2019s popularity as an international tourist destination. The history behind the name L\u00fcderitz is freighted for locals, having been bestowed by German colonists, who also operated a prison camp on nearby Shark Island a century ago.\u00a0 Mayor Suzan Ndjaleka says no final decision has been made.AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cI think [President Obama] truly believes that this is a tranquil era, that we are overhyping, putting emphasis on terrorism which is out of proportion, that in the end compared to the strategic threats of Nazism or communism, it\u2019s a minor issue.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

Dr. Robert Santella, who runs the abortion clinic, walked outside with a coffee cup in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other. When an activist -- who at one point refers to himself as Zephaniah -- called out to Dr. Santella to repent for his sins, the abortionist snapped, darting toward the man. Santella menacingly growled and then said, \"Stinky breath!\" as he breathed in the pro-lifer's face. As the exchange continued, the activist calmly said he hoped that Santella would turn to Jesus Christ. \"Oh, I never go to Christ,\" Santella shot back. \"I don't listen to Christ!\" Then he muttered, \"I do have a darkened heart. Very, very much so.\" The disturbing video has many people wondering about the doctor's mental state. Then the activist told the doctor sarcastically, \"Keep tearing the babies apart,\" to which Santella responded, \"I will ... I love it. I love it!\" The disturbing minute-long video has many people wondering about the mental state of the doctor involved -- and the toll that performing abortions might have on the human psyche. As the security guard then told him he had a phone call, the abortion doctor walked away as if nothing at all had happened. Santella, 72, has worked as an abortion doctor for several decades, according to reports. Public records identify him as an OB/GYN in San Diego who received his medical degree from New York Medical College and is affiliated with several San Diego-area hospitals.",

            "article_content": "FILE - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in Albuquerque, N.M. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) This election has two distinctly different directions for America. My heart is heavy! I, like so many Americans, am concerned for the future of this land that I love. We are at a crossroads.\u00a0 Every vote matters. Never, in my lifetime has there been so much division, so much hostility, so much frustration, so much blatant bias and so much lingering confusion. As a college educated woman, I represent the demographic that is supposedly the swing vote in this election. As a pro-life Christian conservative, the choice for me is very clear but I realize the choice is not as clear to those who remain undecided. So it is to the undecided, particularly women and people of faith, I offer the following as guideposts to better discern how to make a wise and thoughtful decision. There is no perfect candidate, and the media magnifies their flaws. For some, the choice is for the lesser of two evils, because of their personalities instead of their vision. Supporting Mr. Trump for president does not mean I have ignored his past or indefensible comments, but I do accept his apologies. I completely understand why some women would still be undecided. Each candidate has a distinctly different philosophy of the role of government and the issues we face. Secretary Clinton is a liberal- leaning Democrat and a refined career politician representing the political establishment. Mr. Trump is a successful business man, an outsider who speaks his mind and who often wears his emotions on his sleeve. Supporting Mr. Trump for president does not mean I have ignored his past or indefensible comments, but I do accept his apologies. I completely understand why some women would still be undecided. These issues are personal to me. I survived childhood sexual abuse and a date rape at age 22. As President of Enough Is Enough for the last 23 years, I have been on the frontlines fighting to prevent the sexual exploitation of children and women, fighting to stop the pornification of our culture, and fighting to curb sexual predation. However when I met Mr. Trump two years ago at CPAC, he was a kind and gracious gentlemen. He applauded me in front of a crowd of people for taking the high road during the 1987 presidential scandal. He had not yet announced his presidency, but he told me that he had to run. I immediately saw his passion for America, the conviction in his eyes, and a fire in his belly that was driving him to run in spite of the cost. God is in the business of using flawed people who He humbled and molded into great leaders. Our country is framed by our Constitution as one nation, under God. I believe the philosophy of Mr. Trump and Governor Pence most closely mirrors a government for the people and by the people. President Reagan said it best over 50 years ago, 'The issue of this election is whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we\u00a0abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan\u00a0our lives for us better than we can plan them for ourselves.\u201d\u00a0 Our parties themselves represent two distinctive worldviews. We as Christians must closely examine each party platform to discover which position best line up with our Judeo-Christian worldview and the Word of God. One of the most important and unavoidable issues is the issue of life. Abortion on demand is one of the great scourges on our nation. I strongly believe that our Founders\u2019 intent when writing the Declaration of Independence that all of humankind are endowed by their Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, meant from womb to\u00a0 tomb. The Trump/Pence ticket stands strong on so many of these issues that truly matter, from Israel to a prosperous thriving economy. I believe that they will lead America forward, and best solve the challenges of a failed economy, inexcusable unemployment, a broken immigration system, an unfair tax system, corruption in politics, unfavorable trade deals, shaky foreign policy, failed Obamacare, out of control national debt and a diminished military which must be strengthened in order to defend against radical Islamists terrorists and terrorist nations who have declared war on America and our ally Israel. As CEO of Enough Is Enough (EIE), I also view Internet safety as a key issue since it\u2019s the 4th ranked health concern for U.S. children. This summer, as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, Donald Trump signed The Children\u2019s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge, developed by EIE. The Pledge was sent to all Presidential Candidates, calling upon them, if elected President to make a pledge\u00a0to defend the innocence and dignity of America\u2019s children by enforcing the existing federal laws and advancing public policies designed to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online and to make the Internet safer for all. In all fairness to Secretary Clinton, she sent a letter supporting the goals of the Pledge which is encouraging. In addition, I am encouraged that Mr. Trump has chosen a solid group of conservative, principled and talented leaders to serve by his side during his campaign. He has assembled an evangelical advisory council of top Christian leaders who are advising him on key issues; and, he is listening. Most of these people are not part of the political elite. We are not only voting for President and VP but we are in effect voting for over 7000 political appointees and individuals who will serve in his administration. In a recent article, Mariam Bell wrote: \u201cWe vote\u00a0FOR\u00a0the 4,000+ political appointees who will run all the agencies, departments and programs. We vote FOR\u00a0the 3,000+ appointments to boards and commissions the next president will make. We\u00a0FOR\u00a0all those 300+ who will be appointed to the judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 whose rulings will impact our country for the next fifty years, not just four. The next president will appoint a cabinet and has already selected a vice president.\u201d Finally it is perhaps the most crucial of all considerations for the voter. The President serves for only 4-8 years, a Supreme Court Justice serves for life with the average term being 30 years. Our next President will likely appoint at least 3 justices, who will determine the trajectory of our Nation for generations to come. Mr. Trump has committed to appoint pro-life constitutionalist judges like Antonin Scalia. Secretary Clinton on the other hand said she would appoint pro-abortion judges, claiming, \u201cI will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.\u201d Code for I will not defend the sanctity of life for unborn Americans. Former Attorney General Ed Meese said in a speech to the Federalist Society that \u201cAn activist jurisprudence, one which anchors the Constitution only in the consciences of jurists\u2026. is a chameleon jurisprudence, changing color and form in each era.\u201d He also said that a true approach \u201cmust respect the Constitution in all its parts and be faithful to the Constitution in its entirety.\u201d Trump and Pence agree, and so do I. Responsible citizens must vote. Every vote matters. It cannot be wasted. In the famous words of John F. Kennedy, ask not, what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\u201d Start by voting!",

            "article_content": "FILE -- Indiana Governor Mike Pence and Donald Trump (AP) Well Donald Trump has passed his first big test as a presidential nominee with flying colors. The choice of Mike Pence of Indiana to be his running mate should all but erase any remaining doubts among conservatives about Donald Trump\u2019s political leanings. The Indiana governor and former U.S. House Republican leader has nearly impeccable free market and social conservative credentials. He is not just a champion of the cause of liberty \u2013 from pro-life to supply side tax cuts \u2013 he\u2019s proven to be a warrior. Who better to be one heartbeat away from the Oval Office? Now will the \u201cnever-Trumpers\u201d on the right please shut up? Pence softens Trump\u2019s rough edges. He is a policy wizard who will fill the Trump cupboard with solutions to immigration, college tuition costs, government debt, terrorism, declining incomes, social unrest and the panoply of things that have gone wrong in America in the age of Obama. It\u2019s a gutsy pick. Mr. Pence is an unflinching conservative who will be cannon fire for the left media. The Washington Post already sneered that Pence is a \"conservative ideaologue.\" When is the last time the media refered to a liberal as a \"leftwing ideologue?\" Well, bring it on. Pence has been a stellar governor. He has balanced budgets, cut taxes, slimmed government and made it more customer friendly. Along with fellow economist Arthur Laffer, I do an annual rating of the states on their economic/fiscal policies. No state has improved more on the index over the last four years than Indiana. That\u2019s a great tribute to Pence\u2019s values and leadership skills. If the theme of this contest is jobs and growth, Pence\u2019s performance in Indianapolis is a case study in how free market ideas and tax cuts work. Here is another example of his spine of steel. Mike Pence led the Republican fight against the Bush Medicare prescription drug bill and almost successfully killed that budget buster. He did it even though he was told this was destroy his political career. (That was clearly wrong!) He did it even though he was bribed with all sorts of favors and career boosters if he would only toss aside his principles and toe the party line. He didn\u2019t cut and run \u2013 as many of his colleagues did. He had a near-100 percent rating with American Conservative Union. He\u2019s a budget hawk, tax cutter, strong on defense Reaganite. He used to love to say: \u201cWhat we really need from government is less of it.\u201d His ferocious attacks against ObamaCare and the massive $800 billion debt \u201cstimulus\u201d bomb that Obama dropped in his first months in office helped launch the Tea Party movement in America. He is the perfect alter-ego for Donald Trump. Trump is bluster and showmanship and the classic New York street fighter and counter-puncher. It is what so many voters love about him:\u00a0 toughness. Pence is the ultimate gentleman politician. He exudes Midwestern Hoosier values. Sincerity. Kindness. Honesty. Fair play. Say what you mean, and mean what you say. All of the virtues, by the way, that Hillary Clinton lacks. When I started Club for Growth many years ago, the second candidate we backed was Mike Pence in 1998 when he ran for Congress. He won and has won every election since then. Sometimes Republicans \u201cgrow in office\u201d and become more liberal over time. Unlike most politicians, Pence has his feet on the ground and not his head in the clouds. He\u2019s a good person with a heart of a lion. I\u2019ve always been proud to call him a friend. This will be one of the most consequential elections of modern times. The stakes are seismic with Hillary Clinton promising four more dismal years of Obamanomics. She has not a single new idea, and, as even the Washington Post has put it, she is the ultimate \u201cstatus quo candidate.\u201d She has tried to exploit Trump\u2019s rough edges. She says he\u2019s not fit for office, which is an amazing claim coming from a women who has spent her whole career sprinting ahead one half step ahead of the law. Pence softens Trump\u2019s rough edges. He is a policy wizard who will fill the Trump cupboard with solutions to immigration, college tuition costs, government debt, terrorism, declining incomes, social unrest and the panoply of things that have gone wrong in America in the age of Obama. Trump-Pence. Now that\u2019s a ticket that really can make America great again.",

Perkins is one of the key conservative leaders spearheading the gathering \u2013 set for June 21 in New York City.\u00a0 As many as 500 conservative leaders from around the nation are expected to attend the invitation-only event, as first reported by Time.com. The meeting was convened by a who\u2019s who among Evangelicals \u2013 including Southern Baptist Convention President Ronnie Floyd, James Dobson, Ralph Reed, Penny Nance, Bob McEwen, Tim Wildmon of the American Family Association, Kelly Shackleford of First Liberty, and mega-church pastors Jack Graham and Ed Young. \u201cI want to be actively supportive of a candidate who can help turn this nation around,\u201d Perkins told me. \u201cWith Trump \u2013 I\u2019m not there yet.

There will be no endorsement from the conservative leaders. \u201cThere is no preconceived outcome here,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can have a conversation that could lead to helping conservative leaders make a decision about what to do in this election.\u201d The meeting comes as a small, but vocal number of Christian leaders is urging people of faith to stay at home on Election Day. And that\u2019s why Tony Perkins is worried. \u201cOur goal is to be able to have a conversation that could lead to a better understanding of what Trump has to offer to the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t try, the outcome is not going to be good.\u201d Specifically, the leaders want to hear detailed plans on potential Supreme Court nominees and the vetting process. They also want to hear about Trump\u2019s policies regarding religious liberty, pro-life issues and possible vice presidential candidates. \u201cA vice presidential pick is going to be very crucial,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cMr. Trump doesn\u2019t have a track record \u2013 so I am going to rely very heavily on who he is going to pick as a running mate.\u201d Floyd, the president of the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, said he just wants to do the right thing. \u201cThe vast majority of Southern Baptists are very much where I am today \u2013 we\u2019re trying to figure this out,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to navigate through these waters that are very uncertain and very difficult.\u201d Floyd had strong words for Christian leaders who are suggesting voters should simply stay home. \u201cWe cannot change what exists or even alter it or adjust it sitting on the sidelines and prognosticating about the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a biblical responsibility, but we also have a responsibility as citizens of the United States to express the privileges afforded to us \u2013 that men and women have died on the battlefield to give us \u2013 and I\u2019m not walking away from that.\u201d Floyd said the conversation with Trump is a way for Christians to share their hearts with him. \u201cNone of us have endorsed Mr. Trump, nor have we condemned Mr. Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about the possibility of being able to appoint the next four Supreme Court justices. This is about the dignity of human life from the womb to the tomb. This is about religious freedom. I\u2019m not about to sit at home and not express something. I\u2019m accountable to God and I believe I\u2019m accountable to my fellow Americans.\u201d But at the same time, he acknowledged that many people of faith are struggling to come to terms with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s past statements \u2013 statements that are contrary to biblical teachings. \u201cCould you vote for him? That\u2019s the question at hand,\u201d Floyd said.",

Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! Pro-lifers chose a man who praised Planned Parenthood and wants to rewrite the Republican Party\u2019s pro-life platform. Talk radio hosts and conservative pundits chose a man who wants to govern the press. They sold their soul for a standing reservation at Mar-A-Lago. Free enterprise chose a man who wants to tell corporations how to run their business. Evangelicals chose a man who has never asked forgiveness. Women voted for a man with a history of objectifying and marginalizing them. But as the campaign assured our Establishment Overlords -- we haven't seen the true Donald Trump. They told us he was evolving -- projecting an image -- moderating. Now back home in the South -- we use words like snookered, two-faced and phony as a three-dollar bill. In other words he may or may not build that wall. He may or may not round up the illegals. He may or may not bring jobs back to America. We\u2019ve already been treated to a sneak peek of how quickly Mr. Trump can evolve and moderate. On Tuesday morning he insinuated that the father of Ted Cruz may have been involved in the JFK assassination plot. But by nightfall, Trump was heaping praise on the senator and his family \u2013 calling him one heck of a guy. Conservatives took a sucker punch yesterday - but let not your heart be troubled, America. The sun still rose today. Lady Liberty\u2019s torch still burns bright. And if we can survive eight years of President Obama, we can certainly survive a charlatan like Donald Trump. But I'm fairly certain we could not survive four years of Hillary Clinton.",

It may be a culinary heresy \u2013 but folks will still eat it. That\u2019s the best case scenario for the Trump campaign as they try to woo wary Evangelical Christians. Many are still not convinced that the man who has had more wives than there are letters to the Corinthians shares their view from the pew. Click here to join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives! It\u2019s not just the #NeverTrump crowd that is causing the campaign to worry. It\u2019s the unknown number of Evangelicals who may stay home on Election Day. A popular quote by the renowned pastor Charles Haddon Spurgeon has been trending on social networking websites. \u201cOf two evils choose none,\u201d Spurgeon once said. But is that really our best and only option \u2013 to throw in the towel? Do Christians get to claim the moral high ground by electing President Hillary Clinton? \u201cThe idea of not voting \u2013 you\u2019re sacrificing your Christian worldview on the altar of political expediency,\u201d said Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. \u201cIt is silly to talk about not voting for either candidate. Every single Christian should vote.\u201d Franklin Graham, the president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said Christians need to take a stand in 2016. \u201cYou don\u2019t just stay home and not vote \u2013 you vote,\u201d Graham told me. \u201cVote for the candidates that best support Biblical truth and Biblical values.\u201d But what if your candidate is not exactly an altar boy in good standing? \u201cIn some races, it may not always be clear,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou may have to hold your nose and choose of the two.\u201d So what are Lutheran church ladies and Baptist deacons and Church of God Sunday school teachers supposed to do? Should Christians vote for Donald Trump? I decided to assemble an all-star panel to address that question. I reached out to Franklin Graham, Samuel Rodriguez, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Richard Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary. \u201cCan a Christian vote for Donald Trump running against Hillary Clinton? I would say yes,\u201d Dr. Land told me. \u201cIs it okay for Christians to vote for Donald Trump? That\u2019s a decision for each individual Christian to make for himself or herself.\u201d Land told me he plans to \u201cvote against Hillary Clinton and I don\u2019t believe in third party candidates.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m perturbed \u2013 deeply perturbed that\u00a0 I\u2019m presented with such a lousy choice but that\u2019s who the American people have selected,\u201d he told me. \u201cI suspect I am not alone among my fellow Americans in saying that I will cast my vote with no joy.\u201d But that\u2019s the key \u2013 actually voting on Election Day. \u201cI will vote my Christian values,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s life, the family ethos, it\u2019s religious liberty, it\u2019s limited government. That\u2019s the person I\u2019m going to vote for.\u201d Rodriquez conceded that the 2016 candidates are not his \u201cdream team\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s only concerned about one issue \u2013 the Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for protecting the Supreme Court from judges that are activists \u2013 that run counter to our Judeo-Christian value system.\u201d Huckabee, who was a preacher before he was a politician, has been a supporter of Trump. And he\u2019s also been mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate. He told me Christians can and should vote for Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try and suggest that Donald Trump is in any way the reincarnation of the Apostle Paul,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cBut he\u2019s been very open to not only dialogue with \u2013 but listen to and understand where many people in the faith community are coming from.\u201d He predicted Trump, if elected, would have a very strong relationship with Evangelicals. \u201cDonald Trump could well be a great president for those of us who are Evangelicals,\u201d Huckabee told me. Besides, Huckabee pointed out, the Republicans have nominated people who are far more contemptuous of the Evangelical community. Anybody remember Sen. John McCain\u2019s infamous \u201cagents of intolerance\u201d rhetoric?\u00a0 In 2000, McCain said parts of the religious right were divisive and even un-American \u2013 in reporting by The New York Times. So what\u2019s a good Christian to do? Pray, Graham said. He\u2019s been leading prayer gatherings outside capitol buildings in all 50 states. Tens of thousands of Americans have attended the \u201cDecision America\u201d events. \u201c\u201dWe aren\u2019t supporting political candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m encouraging Christians to vote. The problem in our country today is that we have allowed the progressive to take God out of our government. We have allowed godless secularism to take control of Washington.\u201d Land suggested Trump could win over Evangelicals by offering a few olive branches \u2013 like naming Sen. Ted Cruz as his pick to the Supreme Court. \u201cThat would help pro-lifers a lot,\u201d Land told me. \u201cTed would be easy to confirm, too. A lot of senators would vote for him just to get him out of the Senate. Mitch McConnell might lead the fight.\u201d That\u2019s true. \u201cIf he picked an Evangelical as his running mate \u2013 that would help, too,\u201d he added. To be honest, though, Donald Trump could walk the aisle at a Billy Graham Crusade, while waving a King James Bible and singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to convince the holier-than-thou club. And for all you folks quoting Spurgeon \u2013 I would offer this rebuttal: not to vote is to vote.",

            "article_content": "Are the candidate's criticisms of judge overseeing Trump University case fair? Reaction on 'America's Newsroom' Donald Trump has made his first congressional endorsement by backing GOP North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers in a hotly contested primary battle. Ellmers is facing fellow GOP Rep. George Holding for the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District seat, after a federal court panel ordered their districts redrawn. The decision has forced Ellmers, Holding, 3rd Congressional District, and Dr. Greg Brannon, a two-time Senate candidate, into a three-way primary contest Tuesday. Ellmers\u2019 campaign released a 40-second robocall Saturday from Trump declaring his support for her re-election. \u201cI need her help in Washington so we can work together to defeat ISIS, secure our border, and bring back jobs and frankly so many other things,\u201d Trump says. \u201cRenee knows how to do it. She gets it, and together we will make America great again.\u201d Ellmers told FoxNews.com in a statement: \u201cI am proud to be the first member of Congress to have received an endorsement from the Republican nominee and soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\u201d Ellmers also said Washington \u201cis in desperate need of leaders who aren't beholden to the establishment 'good ole boys' and who aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves and get to work for the American people -- and I am honored to have Mr. Trump endorse me as one of these conservative leaders.\u201d An aide to Holding argued Trump\u2019s backing won\u2019t change the incumbent\u2019s record on the issues. \u201cEllmers voted for (President) Obama's omnibus budget deal, voted to support Obama's executive amnesty for illegal immigrants and supported John Kasich in a straw poll during the (GOP) presidential primary,\u201d the aide said Sunday. \u201cNow she's trying to fool voters to get reelected.\u201d Brannon could not be reached for comment. Ellmers, elected in 2010, represents about 16 percent of the newly drawn 2nd District, while Holding represents about 60 percent. Most of North Carolina's primaries were held on March 15, but the court decision forced the Legislature to redraw parts of the congressional map and caused the state to\u00a0move the House primaries to early June. Outside groups -- including the pro-life/antiabortion groups the\u00a0National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony List -- argue Holding, elected in 2012, is more conservative than Ellmers. They criticized Ellmers after she temporarily halted and forced changes last year to a House bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks.",

            "article_content": "Bryan Llenas reports The Amish could be trading their buggies for rides in cars Tuesday, as a political action committee is seeking drivers to get them to the polls. A pro-Trump poliitical action committee has been trying to mobilize the reclusive group for the election, and in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, they could form a legitimate voting bloc. Amish PAC is hoping some of the state's 69,000 adherents will cast ballots - if they can get to the polls. \"I wanted to let you know that Amish PAC has 200 (non-Amish) volunteers scheduled to door-knock every single Amish registered voter in Pennsylvania's Amish country (Lancaster) tomorrow and offer rides to polling places,\" said Ben Walters, of the Super PAC. \"That has never been done before.\" Fox News previously reported on the move to get the Amish involved in the presidential race, which has so far featured billboards and newspaper ads. The new wrinkle is a get-out-the-Amish-vote effort, with a call for motorists to help. Amish PAC, has gone the traditional route, raising a modest $100,000 and spending it on billboards and newspaper ads to target Amish voters during a time when most money is being spent on social media and online ads. (Amish PAC) \u201cAmish PAC needs volunteers to help drive Amish voters to the polls in Pennsylvania,\u201d reads the top of the volunteer section of the PAC\u2019s website. \u201cIn addition, if you have any Amish friends or neighbors and would like to give them a ride to the polls on Election Day, Amish PAC will provide you with a prepaid gas card until we run out.\u201d The political action group, which was started by a former fundraiser for a Ben Carson super PAC, has gone the traditional route, raising a modest $100,000 and spending it on billboards and newspaper ads in a time when most money is being spent on social media and online ads. \u201cNewspaper ads and billboards in the middle of farmland don\u2019t cost very much,\u201d Walters recently told USA Today. Many conservative activists believe that the Amish vote is enough to swing the pendulum towards a Trump win. A similar grassroots push to the Amish communities of Pennsylvania and Ohio in 2004 provided a bump in registered Amish voters from 2000. One such example was in Lancaster County, where only 960 Amish and Mennonites were registered and just over 500 voted. Four years later, more than 2,000 were registered and a record number for the county voted with 1,674 ballots casted. March 27, 2012: An Amish buggy along Route 44 in Madison Township near White Hall, Pa. (AP/Bloomsburg Press Enterprise) Amish PAC is hoping that there will be an even bigger bump that will help sway electoral votes in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Many assume that the Amish are not allowed to vote, and while they are exempt from paying some taxes and do not receive government benefits like disability or social security, they can vote. With Clinton and Trump close in the polls in both Pennsylvania and Ohio, Walters believes that the Amish vote is crucial, according to a recent interview with the BBC. \"These two states being the most important, crucial swing states. \u2026 We realize that a couple thousand votes could truly make a difference, especially if we have a situation like we did in 2000 where it comes down to a few polling places in one swing state,\" Walters said to the website, referring to the election recount in Florida back in 2000. \"The Amish could, in theory, swing the presidential election of 2016.\"",

(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) (The Associated Press) Students and faculty watch the Vice Presidential debate during a watch party at Walker's Pub, on the campus of Regis University, a private Jesuit university in Denver, Colo., Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) (The Associated Press) DENVER \u2013 It wasn't the headliners, but some political groupies took time Tuesday to gather and watch the vice presidential candidates debate. The 90-minute showdown is the only time the two will face off: Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. The contest was expected to have a much smaller viewership than the first meeting between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton last week, which drew a record-setting television audience of 84 million people. But some voters said it was well worth their time. \"One of them will be the second most powerful person in the world ... it's very important to hear what they have to say,\" says Carson Clabeaux, 21, a senior at the University of Scranton and president of the school's Republican club. \"I should be studying - but you can always study. There's only one VP debate, so it was important for me to come see this.\" Here are some of the scenes across the U.S. as people watched the event: ___ DENVER, Colorado: A small group of students at Regis University, a Jesuit school, debated whether faith and politics should intersect after the vice presidential debate changed few minds and left most still undecided who they'll vote for. Both vice presidential candidates are deeply religious, Kaine a Catholic who served as a missionary with the Jesuits in Honduras from 1980 to 1981, and Pence an evangelical Christian who fought against Planned Parenthood funding while in Congress and signed a state law that many people saw as allowing discrimination against gay people. \"Tim Kaine tried to keep faith away from our politics,\" said Tim Smith, a freshman focusing on education who plans to vote for the Democratic ticket. \"I think he did that. Mike Pence definitely is not that way. He wasn't really at all about separation of church and state.\" \"Religion does say who we are,\" countered Chad Deline, a sophomore economics major and head of Regis' Republican club. \"Mike Pence is pro-life, and it showed tonight, and I support that.\" Watch party organizer Daniel P. Justin, who teaches philosophy and religious studies, urged students to reflect on where faith's place is in this election \u2014 and politics in general. \"The question is, how does faith animate and influence your political life?\" Justin said. ___ DES MOINES, Iowa: Organizers for a young professionals group had low expectations on turnout for their bipartisan event at a downtown bar. \"I'll be happy if we get 20 people,\" said Josh Strief, 27, civic chair of the Young Professionals Connection group. In the end, roughly 30 showed up to watch Kaine and Pence. Some attendees had higher expectations for this debate and came away a little disappointed. Shelby Doyle, 34, said she thought the vice presidential debate could have been more \"even-toned.\" \"I expected it to be more cordial, but they're interrupting each other,\" said Doyle, a college professor and Clinton supporter. \"They're mostly just talking over each other.\" Stephen Molitor said he watched the presidential debate last week and thought Trump wasn't well received because he kept interrupting Clinton. As he watched Tuesday, he thought it was a repeat, but flipped. \"I'm not sure if Kaine interrupting Paine is working for him. I think it's doing the same thing it did for Trump,\" said Molitor, 33, who works in insurance. He said he was leaning toward voting for Clinton, but he could also end up supporting a third-party candidate. \"If I was scoring this right now, I'd call it a draw,\" said Molitor. ___ SCRANTON, Pennsylvania: About 30 students showed up at the University of Scranton's science building auditorium to watch the debate, though there were plenty of empty seats. Emily Lundeen, a freshman Democrat studying counseling and human services, was both pleased and disappointed with what she saw. \"He seems incredibly personable, and that he really knows what he's talking about,\" Lundeen said of Kaine. \"Unfortunately, we're seeing the same thing as the presidential debate \u2014 they're just attacking each other's candidates, and I really think it should be focused on policy.\" To David Velez, a half-black, half-Hispanic senior studying biochemistry and biology, the most important issue was policing \u2014 and he can't figure out who he likes better after Tuesday's debate. \"Both of them are playing a good card,\" he said. \"They both come from humble backgrounds, and they obviously want to further the American dream.\" ___ GAMBIER, Ohio: Those attending a debate watch party at Kenyon College were handed a \"Vice-presidential Debate Bingo\" card when they entered the venue, a campus art gallery. The card featured terms or topics that could be explored at the debate. They included: \"Benghazi,\" ''Mexico will pay for it\" and \"ISIS.\" The first person who was able to get five across, down or diagonally won a reserved seating to the next debate watch party on campus. Senior political science major Emily Margolin was the winner, matching five terms. The 21-year-old from New York City noted attendance was markedly down compared with the presidential debate party held in the same location a week earlier. \"It's the vice presidential debate \u2014 literally a less important role,\" said Margolin, adding that students have midterms Wednesday before heading out for a four-day fall break that begins on Thursday. Jess Lane, a Kenyon freshman from Raleigh, North Carolina who supports Clinton, said that while Tuesday's debate was not as exciting as the presidential one, \"I think there's a lot more substance there for sure.\" ___ TALLAHASSEE, Florida: Hoping to get more answers, Republicans and Democrats attended separate watch parties in Tallahassee. Will Watson said he supports Trump but went to a Republican-sponsored debate party at a restaurant because it was important for him to hear the views of both sides firsthand. \"You can't just go off of what your friends tell you because if you don't see what actually it is you could be voting for someone you actually don't agree with,\" the 19-year-old said. But Jaylen Smith said even after watching the two vice presidential candidates he had unanswered questions. \"The parties are really talking around the questions,\" the 21-year-old said while at a Democratic-sponsored party at Florida A&M University. \"There really is no clarity.\" ___ Kang reported from Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Remember, these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since Lincoln. But can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trump\u2019s surprising success in overtaking the GOP? Trump had a very good day here Thursday. Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that might\u2019ve helped Sen. Ted Cruz win a floor fight at the convention, delegates and other members of the establishment were very impressed by Trump\u2019s campaign\u2019s effort to start sucking up to them. Promises of Trump\u2019s flexibility when served alongside seafood platters and open bars from his new K Street handlers went a long way toward convincing the GOP elite that Trump is ready to play ball. Little could be more comforting to them than the pledge from Trump\u2019s campaign boss that the wildness of the frontrunner to this point has been a put on. Consultants and party elders are not uncomfortable with the idea of tricking rubes or profit and or patriotism. And for those facing general election oblivion, anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds good. But even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy, the current maneuvers do pose a risk. The most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give up. There are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him. But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do it. When Trump\u2019s new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far, that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than Republican. All Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks. When they wake up it will all be over. But if Trump starts fishtailing in his turn towards conventionality it will reinvigorate the #NeverTrump movement.\u00a0  It\u2019s great to suck up to the party, even belatedly, but doing in such a transparent manner could be hazardous to Trump\u2019s nomination.\u00a0 [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a0845;\u00a0Cruz\u00a0559; Kasich 147 (1,237 needed to win)] Fox News Sunday: Trump\u2019s new man - Mr. Sunday sits down with the Trump campaign\u2019s new boss, Paul Manafort, to discuss the latest campaign news on the heels of the RNC\u2019s spring meeting. \u201cFox News Sunday with\u00a0Chris Wallace\u201d airs at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET on the Fox News Channel.\u00a0Check local listings\u00a0for broadcast times in your area.Indiana shaping up as do or die for Cruz - RCP: \u201cDue to a dearth of public polling in Indiana, however, it\u2019s not clear how large Cruz\u2019s advantage might be, if he indeed has one. One recent private poll not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns showed Cruz leading in two congressional districts, Kasich in one, and Trump dominating in two more. Three other congressional districts, meanwhile, showed Cruz and Kasich essentially tied\u2026Although there are just 57 delegates at stake in Indiana, the contest is one of the few remaining wild cards on the primary map. If Cruz or Kasich do not win, the Republican race could quickly spiral out of their control. If Trump does not win Indiana, however, his delegate math becomes exceedingly difficult to win the nomination before Cleveland.\u201dUnpacking Trump\u2019s health proposal - Health care policy expert, James Capretta, points out the flaws in Trump\u2019s health care plan proposal: \u201cTrump has said he wants to get rid of the entirety of the [Affordable Care Act], including subsidies for health insurance and its expansion of Medicaid.

Vox\u2019s Emmet Rensin takes a deep dive into a concept he dubs \u201csmug style\u201d liberalism in America and how the political concept changed from an ideology of the working class to that of the elite. How did this happen and what has the smug style done to American liberalism? This lengthy piece goes into the origins and results of the shift in American political thought: \u201cThe smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography. Beginning in the middle of the 20th\u00a0century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party\u2026In 1964,\u00a0it was\u00a055 percent of working-class voters. By 1980, it was 35 percent\u2026The smug recognize one another by their mutual\u00a0knowing\u2026It is the smug style\u2019s first premise: a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture\u2026So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further.\u00a0 They will choose the smug style.\u201dPro-Clinton PAC spends $1 million to fight online trolling - Daily Beast: \u201cCiting \u2018lessons learned from online engagement with \u2018Bernie Bros,\u2019 a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to \u2018push back against\u2019 users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.

GOP CANNIBALISM REALLY COOKING NOW Like shipwrecked sailors in a lifeboat, the traditional Republican candidates and their respective super PACs, are down to the point where they are clubbing each other with oars over the last thimbleful of water. And you know what comes after that\u2026 As a fresh New Hampshire poll shows, Republicans hoping for a breakout performance by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have reason to worry. The new survey from WMUR and CNN doesn\u2019t tell us anything different about New Hampshire\u2019s longtime favorite, Donald Trump. Trump ticked up two points, but his position is substantially unchanged since December. And, as is the case nationally, Sen. Ted Cruz has moved into second place. Among the shipwrecked crew beneath them, though, there are some noteworthy changes. Rubio has been dragged down into a tie for third, and within hailing distance of three other candidates who are all dead-enders outside of the state. Rubio is rightly seen by most analysts as the GOP\u2019s best chance for a win in a general election against Hillary Clinton. And he still boasts a good path to the nomination. In one sense, Rubio\u2019s chances have never looked better. As the feud between frontrunners Trump and Cruz intensifies, Rubio can start to see daylight. Trump\u2019s misstep with Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement is further evidence that even if he manages to dispatch Cruz, the GOP frontrunner will suffer substantial damage in this fight. Nationally, things look good for Rubio. While he broadly trails Trump, and somewhat more narrowly lags Cruz, the Real Clear Politics average shows him doubling up his closest plausible competitor. But the other plausible candidates aren\u2019t thinking nationally. They are thinking about ruining Rubio in New Hampshire. In order for Rubio to get in contention for the nomination, he needs to build momentum as the third man in a three man race with Trump and Cruz. Rubio does not need to win in any of the first four primaries, but he must not finish behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is becoming something of a different matter. His polling in New Hampshire is bouncing around like a toddler downing Mountain Dew, but there\u2019s clearly something to his move in the Granite State. Kasich is the favorite Republican of many Democrats and independents, both of whom are welcome to participate in the state\u2019s GOP primary. Fox News First\u2019s hunch is that Kasich will end up like other New Hampshire crossover candidates, like former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, and underperform. But we only have to wait 19 days to find out. Either way, it\u2019s hard to see how Kasich the least popular Republican in the field with his party nationally could convert a second- or third-place finish into anything beyond the Granite State. But if Bush or Christie gets ahead of Rubio in New Hampshire by any notable margin, it might be the end of the line for the senator\u2019s chances to unify the half of the party not backing Trump or Cruz. If either establishmentarian succeeds in jackrocking Rubio in New Hampshire it also probably means the end of chances for a nominee other than Trump or Cruz, and, by extension, a favorable general election matchup. Rubio is certainly giving as good as he is getting, but negative campaigning hurts everyone involved and Rubio does not have much room for error. Given what Bush\u2019s super PAC is doing in its very expensive death throes, he could certainly succeed in scuttling his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s presidential bid. Bush beating Rubio in New Hampshire would set up another Rubio dud in South Carolina and maybe even Bush as the third man, which is exactly what Trump and Cruz are hoping. Christie might fare better than Bush, but he would be a long, long shot, especially given his recent struggles. It\u2019s hardly all gloom for Rubio, though. If he can slip his way to third places finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, he will be able to start to shake off bitter clingers Bush and Christie and start lengthening his strides. But in a year in which the Republican Party has managed to do almost everything wrong, it\u2019s certainly plausible that it could find a way to kill off the last survivor of the establishment shipwreck. WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026National Geographic: \u201cA bizarre\u00a0frog that breeds inside trees and lays eggs for its tadpoles to eat has been rediscovered in\u00a0northeastern\u00a0India\u00a0after\u00a0150 years.\u00a0Last recorded in the wild in 1870,\u00a0Jerdon\u2019s\u00a0tree frog was feared extinct until scientists\u00a0found\u00a0it during a three-year search that\u00a0began in 2007. The\u00a020-inch\u00a0(50-centimeter)\u00a0long\u00a0species was first discovered in the Darjeeling region\u00a0by British zoologist Thomas\u00a0Jerdon, who inspired its name Polypedates jerdonii. But according to a new study, the\u00a0long-lost\u00a0amphibian\u00a0actually represents a completely new genus\u2014earning it the new moniker\u00a0Frankixalus\u00a0jerdonii. Scientists observed\u00a0the\u00a0frog\u00a0hiding in hollow bamboo stems and tree holes, where it carries out its\u00a0remarkable breeding antics.\u00a0Females\u00a0attach\u00a0their eggs to the insides of tree hollows, which hold\u00a0pools of water. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall in the water, where the females feed them unfertilized eggs until they turn\u00a0into\u00a0froglets. Most tadpoles of other frog species\u00a0eat plant material.\u201d Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the 'all-out-war' between Donald Trump and the media Donald Trump is now openly accusing the media of rigging the election, while much of the media accuse him of trafficking in crackpot conspiracy theories. There\u2019s no pretense any more, no fig leaf of honest but aggressive engagement. And that is driving us toward a bizarre finish in the strangest election of modern times. From Trump\u2019s vantage point, the press is pounding him with past allegations of sexual misconduct from nine women, which he vehemently denies. And he is using more dramatic rhetoric, as in this tweet: \u201cPolls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!\u201d From the media\u2019s vantage point, on-the-record allegations from the women accusing Trump are worthy of reporting, as they were in many cases during Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandals during the 1990s. And many journalists fear Trump is laying the groundwork for discrediting the system if he loses the election\u2014and blaming the press. What\u2019s stunning to me is that the Republican nominee is spending so much time building a case to explain a possible loss in three weeks, rather than stressing the issues that could help him win. He is riling up his base, which is good for him, but doing little to expand that base as he trails Hillary Clinton. The media view is perfectly captured in the first paragraph of this Washington Post news story yesterday: \u201cHe is preaching to the converted. He is lashing out at anyone who is not completely loyal. He is detaching himself from and delegitimizing the institutions of American political life. And he is proclaiming conspiracies everywhere \u2014 in polls (rigged), in debate moderators (biased) and in the election itself (soon to be stolen).\u201d The Post goes on to say that Trump is \u201cfully inhabiting his own echo chamber,\u201d that he is \u201cincreasingly isolated from the country\u2019s mainstream and leaders of his own party,\u201d that he is feeding his fiercest fans \u201cdire warnings that their populist movement could fall prey to dark and collusive forces.\u201d And: \u201cThis is a campaign right out of Breitbart.\u201d That, of course, is the conservative website and self-described champion of the alt-right, Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign chairman who is on leave from running the site. Speaking of Breitbart, it\u2019s playing up a Morning Consult/Politico poll in which 73 percent of Republicans and 17 percent of Democrats believe the election could be stolen from Trump. Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, told CNN in a brief interview that her boss has been talking about the media being rigged, not the electoral system. \u201cAnybody who reads the newspaper online or in print or has a remote control probably has recognized that in many ways, the fix is in for Mrs. Clinton when it comes to the mainstream media,\u201d she said. Conway said the campaign would act only if there\u2019s \u201ccompelling evidence of voter fraud,\u201d especially in early voting. But as Mediaite noted, CNN then cited a Trump tweet: \u201cOf course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!\u201d Even such conservative journals as National Review are taking issue with that: \u201cDonald Trump is playing the sore loser, and he hasn\u2019t even lost yet\u2026 \u201cAs a factual matter, this is, of course, bunk. The electoral process, from bottom to top, is managed by citizens and governed by a dense body of election law. Vote-counting is heavily scrutinized by party officials and independent monitors, and irregularities are subject to legal challenge.\u201d But , the magazine adds, \u201cas for the media, there is no doubt that the press hates Donald Trump with a passion, and it shows.\u201d Politico, which days ago accused Trump of joining the \u201cblack helicopter\u201d crowd, now serves up a dark view of the post-election landscape: \u201cDonald Trump is laying the groundwork to lose on Nov. 8, refuse to concede the election, and teeter the country into an unprecedented crisis of faith in government. Republicans and Democrats, in Washington and beyond, fear that the aftermath of the 2016 election will create a festering infection in the already deep and lasting wound that the campaign is leaving on America.\u201d Politico adds that top Clinton and Obama aides, plus congressional leaders, see the Trump strategy as \u201cpart kamikaze mission to take down Clinton, part temper tantrum by a man who has never been embarrassed on either this scale or spotlight.\u201d Even worse, says Politico, they fret about \u201chow his egged-on followers might respond, and the violence \u2014 perhaps against Muslims, Latinos or any of the many other groups he has targeted in his campaign rhetoric \u2014 that might follow.\u201d Now we\u2019re predicting outbreaks of violence? I always think it\u2019s risky business to hold candidates responsible for what nutty followers say or do in their name. At a Trump rally in Ohio, the Wall Street Journal found a guy named Dan Bowman who said: \u201cI feel Hillary needs to be taken out. If she gets in the government, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to take her out of power. If I have to be a patriot, I will.\u201d Rather chilling\u2014but unfair to blame the candidate (even with that flap over what he once said about \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d). Meanwhile, the greatest actual violence of the campaign took place with the firebombing of a Trump campaign office in North Carolina, along with spray-painting about \u201cNazi Republicans.\u201d Obviously, this was done by someone who hates Trump. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for liberal commentators to blame the attack on an atmosphere whipped up by Trump. But I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame \u201canimals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems,\u201d as Trump tweeted, without knowing who was responsible. Bottom line: The media can certainly influence an election, but they can\u2019t steal it. Ronald Reagan and both George Bushes won the White House without much admiration from the mainstream media. Newt Gingrich, on ABC, embraced a blogger\u2019s view that we are seeing a media \u201ccoup d\u2019etat\u201d in which \u201c20 TV executives have decided to destroy him.\u201d But Ed Rollins, the Fox News contributor who runs a pro-Trump Super PAC, told Trish Regan that he disagrees with his candidate\u2019s talk about a rigged election. \u201cIf he loses the election,\u201d said Rollins, \u201cit won\u2019t be because of the media.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. Renee Ellmers and Rep. George Holding are shown in this composite (AP, News & Observer via AP) GOP Rep. George Holding on Tuesday defeated fellow North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers in this year\u2019s only primary between incumbents. Ellmers, competing in a redrawn district that included much of Holding's former territory, becomes the first Republican incumbent to lose this year. She had been endorsed by presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in a final-hour effort to win. The lawmakers were forced to compete after a federal court ordered the state legislature to redraw districts, merging Holding's and Ellmers' into one. The final weeks of the race became a feud on the airwaves over conservative credentials, with heavy spending by the two candidates and more than $1 million from outside groups attacking Ellmers. Holding won by a wide margin over Ellmers and Dr. Greg Brannon, a two-time Senate candidate. The race marked Trump\u2019s only endorsement and the first time since 2012 that two sitting members of Congress ran against each other. Holding is expected to have a strong chance of winning the Republican-leaning district in the November general election. He'll face the winner of a five-way Democratic primary. The race was set up by court-ordered redistricting in February that moved Ellmers' 2nd District to the north and east, absorbing much of Holding's old 13th. After federal judges struck down two North Carolina congressional districts in February as illegally race-based, the legislature redrew the map of 13 districts and split the congressional contest off from the March presidential primary. The Holding and Ellmers campaigns each spent more than $1 million during the election cycle, and a significant influx of money has come from outside groups attacking Ellmers or supporting Holding. The Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity and American Foundations Committee spent more than $1 million combined, accusing Ellmers of not being conservative on fiscal issues and failing to challenge President Obama's administration. Ellmers, once the favorite of Tea Party activists who helped elect her in 2010, has said the outside spending is retribution for not following the groups' agendas closely enough. Holding, a former federal prosecutor, was first elected in 2012. Outside groups -- including the pro-life/antiabortion groups the\u00a0National Right to Life Committee and Susan B. Anthony List -- argue Holding, elected in 2012, is more conservative than Ellmers. The Ellmers campaign on Saturday released a 40-second robocall from Trump declaring his support for her re-election. \u201cI need her help in Washington so we can work together to defeat ISIS, secure our border, and bring back jobs and frankly so many other things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRenee knows how to do it. She gets it, and together we will make America great again.\u201d Ellmers told FoxNews.com in a statement: \u201cI am proud to be the first member of Congress to have received an endorsement from the Republican nominee and soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\u201d An aide to Holding argued Trump\u2019s backing wouldn\u2019t change the incumbent\u2019s record on the issues.

            "article_content": "Family Research Council president weighs in on what he would like to see going forward in the campaign Donald Trump sat down with hundreds of evangelical and social conservative leaders Tuesday, in what was billed as an effort to address \"long-standing concerns\" about his candidacy, including on issues such as abortion and transgender rights. The effort to heal any lingering rifts in the party comes at a pivotal time, just after he ousted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and as a number of polls show him slipping against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Fox News was told the all-day event, called \u201cA Conversation About America\u2019s Future with Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson\u201d at the Marriott Marquis in New York City, was to be attended by the presumptive Republican nominee for about two hours. During his time on the stage, Trump answered pre-selected questions from attendees and talked directly with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rev. Franklin Graham. Other pastors and evangelical leaders in attendance included James Robison, Ralph Reed, President of the Southern Baptist Convention Steve Gaines \u00a0and Family Research Council\u2019s Tony Perkins. Notably, Hillsong Church Pastor Carl Lentz will be in attendance \u2013 representing a millennial voice among the evangelicals present. Former Rep. Michele Bachmann also attended the gathering. Fox News was told the unprecedented gathering was coordinated as evangelical leaders have concerns and questions about Trump\u2019s candidacy, especially to do with his stances on the pro-life movement, transgender issues and the question of religious liberty in the military and armed forces. Some leaders have expressed concern that the meeting was being seen as an endorsement of coronation of Trump, and said this was not the case. Iowa-based evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats, who supported Ted Cruz \u00a0during the Iowa GOP caucuses, sent out a statement to his followers on Tuesday's meeting with Trump. \u201cTo be clear, the meeting is not a fundraiser nor a political rally. It is NOT an endorsement of Donald Trump, nor do I plan to leave the meeting with an endorsement announcement,\u201d Vander Plaats said in the email Monday. \u201cWe'll talk with Mr. Trump about the people he intends to surround himself with, his criteria for Supreme Court nominations, his convictions on life, marriage, religious liberty, and more,\u201d Vander Plaats said. Bill Dallas, head of the faith-based political non-profit United in Purpose, who co-organized the event along with Carson, told Fox News before the meeting that issues to be discussed included jobs, the economy, a strong military and Supreme Court picks. Despite Trump's moderate stance on a number of social issues -- and his past divorces and marital infidelity -- Trump performed well in the primaries with the socially conservative evangelicals. Even against rival Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who explicitly targeted evangelicals with a socially conservative campaign, Trump was carried to victory in states like South Carolina with a significant share of the evangelical vote.

Benacquisto is backed by former Govs. Sarah Palin, R-Alaska, and Mike Huckabee, R-Ark. Clawson, meanwhile, touts his backing from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and tea party groups. An expensive and at times sordid ad war has highlighted divisions in the party.

But why?\u2022 RNC unveils contested contention website\u2022 Sponsors balk at backing Republican convention\u2022 Hillary grabs big lead in home state showdown with Trump \u2022 Clean inside and out TRUMP IS LOSING IN WISCONSIN. BUT WHY? Never underestimate the capacity of those in media and politics to overstate their influence. Like roosters who credit themselves with the sunrise, members of the narrow elite witness any phenomenon and immediately look for evidence of their own influence. For example, Donald Trump\u2019s rise is often attributed to the jaw-dropping imbalances of coverage that he has received compared to other candidates. And the chasm has been embarrassingly deep indeed. But that\u2019s a better explanation for why traditional candidates didn\u2019t catch on than why Trump first captured the support of his most ardent followers. His pre-existing celebrity combined with a message aimed right at the heart of the Americans whose lives have been most disrupted by the changing world economy did that. Trump and his acolytes did that. This would sound obvious everywhere but in Washington, but it still merits saying: If Trump, as expected, becomes the Republican nominee, the media will bear considerable responsibility, but not nearly so much as he and his supporters. Now Trump is stumbling. Predictable, avoidable distractions involving his campaign team and his attacks on a rival are piled on top of a series of three serious policy blunders. Part of this is attributable to intensifying scrutiny, but part of this is because Trump\u2019s ability to clear one controversy by creating another is catching up with him. It was already costing him with voters even before the most recent round of troubles. After months of benefitting from media spasms by doubling down on what seemed like errors, Trump is, at least temporarily, outrunning his supply lines. And as it would happen, there is a pivotal primary in five days. Wisconsin is the only major primary contest in a one-month span and could substantially reset the frame for the race as it goes into the remaining 16 states. Wisconsin\u2019s Republican voters look an awful lot like those in neighboring Illinois and Michigan, states where Trump handily won primaries earlier this month. Fox News First has little doubt that if Wisconsin\u2019s primary had been held three weeks earlier, Trump would have been in a very strong position to win. But April looks different than March and daily we see polls in Wisconsin that show Trump stuck around 30 percent and Sen. Ted Cruz leaping ahead thanks to voters who previously supported other candidates now out of the race. Explaining this ought to be simple. The Republican nominating process is a referendum on Trump and Trump has been stumbling. Cruz has been working hard to woo supporters of his fallen rivals and voters in the Badger State are responding. It\u2019s a fairly simple dynamic, unless, of course, you are part of the narrow elite in the press or politics. In that case, the reason Trump is losing is because the establishment is battling back. Just ask \u2018em. That\u2019s silly. Establishment battling has done nothing but help Trump. Angry denunciations by the very serious people have given prankster Trump perfect straight lines. His voters oftentimes seem to love the destruction of the ruling caste more than they do their own champion. Consider the current confounding claim that if Trump fails to win enough delegates to become the nominee, it will be because of trickery. Many Trump supporters ardently believe this and find efforts by other candidates to win as evidence of pure corruption. Certainly the belated but sustained barrage of negative ads against Trump is taking its toll. And in that way, outside forces are at work in Wisconsin and elsewhere. But as they did in explaining his rise, politicos and pressies continue to overstate their parts and underestimate the role of the candidate and voters in explaining Trump\u2019s stumbles. If Trump breaks down on the back nine, it won\u2019t be the fault of the announcers in the booth or the sponsors of the tournament. It will be just him and his scorecard. Trump backs then immediately opposes women being punished for having abortions - Fox News: \u201cRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump quickly walked back a statement he made earlier Wednesday that if abortion were illegal in the United States, then women who have the procedure should be punished - saying later that only those who performed the procedure should be punished.\u201d [Staunch pro-lifer Molly Hemmingway makes the case for how Trump\u2019s answer on abortion could sabotage the pro-life movement.] Trump tries to change the subject with tax release refusal - The Hill: \u201cThe\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0campaign on Wednesday released what appears to be a\u00a0letter\u00a0from the Republican presidential front-runner\u2019s tax attorneys saying that his tax filings since 2009 are currently being audited. \u2018Your personal tax returns have been under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002, consistent with the IRS\u2019s practice for large and complex businesses,\u2019 reads the letter, signed by tax partners Sheri Dillon and William Nelson of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.

Trump, whose divisive candidacy has alienated many women, blacks and Hispanics. An array of activist groups is organizing a campaign to pressure the companies to refuse to sponsor the gathering, which many of the corporations have done for the Republican and the Democratic Parties for decades. The pressure is emerging as some businesses and trade groups are privately debating whether to scale back their participation, according to interviews with more than a dozen lobbyists, consultants and fund-raisers directly involved in the conversations.\u00a0 Apple, Google and Walmart are among the companies assessing their plans for the convention, which will be held July 18 to 21 in Cleveland.\u201d [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a0736;\u00a0Cruz\u00a0463; Kasich 143 (1,237 needed to win)] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026The Paris Review interviewed linguist Sally Thomason on her study of what she describes as a \u201cstubborn\u201d language, the tribal language called Montana Salish, meaning they have not borrowed from any other language influences in the hundreds of years of existence: \u201cMy family was already spending summers one mountain range [in the Pacific Northwest] to the east of the easternmost Salish language\u2014most of the Salish languages are on the coast\u2026I like consonants, and they have thirty-eight consonants.

The Empire State has been one of the talked about states that might flip in the general election if the matchup was Clinton and Trump due to the number of blue collar white voters. But this poll shows that even in overwhelmingly white areas in the suburban New York City, Upstate and Western regions, Trump still loses to Clinton. But neither of the remaining anti-Trumps fares any better. Clinton also beats Sen. Ted Cruz by a large margin, and edges out Gov. John Kasich by five points. Predictable pitch - Although this year seems like the year of political revolutions in presidential politics, Roll Call columnist Walter Shapiro says Clinton\u2019s predictable platform might offer voters some peace of mind when heading to the polls: \u201c\u2026[I]n these tumultuous times, the underlying message of the Clinton campaign is: \u2018Please be seated. Everything will be okay.\u2019\u201d Bernie not berned by D.C. - Amid reports that Sanders name was left off the District of Columbia\u2019s Democratic primary ballot, WaPo breaks down how the error occurred. Bottom line: D.C. residents will get to vote for Sanders on the June 14 primary. Even Vox\u2026 - The liberal explainers at Vox point out that even those who agree with Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college have a hard time understanding how his plan intends to achieve that: \u201cSpecifically, he is offering a 2-to-1 federal match for states that do this along with meeting a few other criteria like reducing reliance on adjunct faculty. This is a sufficiently attractive offer that some states would probably go for it. But it\u2019s going to cost a\u00a0lot\u00a0of money, and tax-averse Republican governors like [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker pretty clearly aren\u2019t going to do it. Sanders implies that Wisconsin students will just head to blue states like California instead. But his plan doesn\u2019t provide California with any money to cut tuition for out-of-state students. And by increasing in-state enrollment at California universities, Sanders\u2019 plan would almost certainly make it harder for Wisconsinites to get into public schools in California.\u201d The Judge\u2019s Ruling: - With an\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0FBI investigators approaching, \u201cthe investigation\u00a0of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to protect state secrets contained in her emails has entered its penultimate phase,\u201d says\u00a0Senior Judicial Analyst Judge\u00a0Andrew Napolitano, adding\u00a0\u201cit is a dangerous one for her and her aides.\u201d Read it here.

The soap was handed out at the end of a 26-mile race in Qingyuan, in Guangdong province. Around 20,000 people took part in the event and, according to Chinese newspaper\u00a0People\u2019s Daily, some 12,000 of them ended up requiring assistance. It\u2019s not clear how many fell ill after eating the scented bars. \u2018You may take it for granted that the gift package given by marathon organisers should contain some energy reviving food and so did the 20,000 marathon runners,\u2019 reports the People\u2019s Daily of China. \u2018However, the gel-like bars turned out to be soaps.\u2019 The packaging was in English, reports the\u00a0BBC, which may have confused the competitors. Witnesses reported \u2018many bars of soap, all with one bite missing, dumped at the roadside.\u2019\u201d Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

            "article_content": "President blasts Donald Trump, urges Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton Meet Tim Kaine. He's going to be your next\u00a0 vice president. At least I hope he will be. Kaine is hugely capable with a proven track record of results. But I gotta be fair here so you\u2019ll trust what I\u2019m about to write. His speech Wednesday night in Philly wasn\u2019t the most thrilling introduction to the American public. Americans now know that Kaine stands for \u201cfaith, family and work.\u201d That he is a man who has spent his life dedicated to public service and giving all Americans a fair shot. It certainly didn\u2019t feel as electric as Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s emphatic defense of Hillary Clinton\u2019s capabilities, record and love for America. (Note: Biden has never been better and his swan song address was one for the ages). It definitely wasn\u2019t like President Obama\u2019s fiery address that drew chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d over and over. And even former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg thrilled the crowd more. But Virginia Senator Tim Kaine did the job he came to do. Before he took the stage, upwards of 60 percent of Americans had no idea who Tim Kaine was. Donald Trump was one of them. He confused Kaine with former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean, in a press conference this afternoon. After his address Wednesday night, Americans now know that Kaine stands for \u201cfaith, family and work.\u201d \u00a0That he is a man who has spent his life dedicated to public service and giving all Americans a fair shot. Kaine\u2019s strong record is indisputable. Although currently serving his state as a senator Kaine is also a former governor. Virginia is doing well: it\u2019s rated one of the best managed states, the best for business and best for raising a child. He\u2019s been a leader in the fight for common sense gun reform and was the leader Virginia needed after the tragic Virginia Tech shooting that took 32 lives. He also expanded pre-K and higher education while in office. In a brilliant stroke Wednesday night Kaine reached out to Republicans who can\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Donald Trump. He discussed his father-in-law, former Republican Governor of Virginia Linwood Holton, who has recently begun voting for Democrats because the GOP isn\u2019t the \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d any more. In another wise move, he took the time to praise Bernie Sanders for all he\u2019s done for the Democratic Party and progressives. His words drew one of Sanders\u2019s megawatt smiles. Kaine isn\u2019t an Elizabeth Warren level attack dog, but he took on Donald Trump in his speech pointing out that you \u201ccan\u2019t believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth.\u201d He added that Americans who believed him in business got ripped off and pointed to former First Lady Barbara\u2019s Bush\u2019s comment that she didn\u2019t know how any woman could vote for him after his offensive comments. And then there was this winning line: \u201cNo major party nominee in our history has ever known less than Donald Trump.\u201d Still, progressives are not thrilled with Clinton\u2019s choice in picking Kaine. He is personally pro-life, was pro TPP (until recently) and he\u2019s seen as a friend to Wall Street. Progressives were also hoping that Clinton would put a Latino on the ticket and the fact that Kaine speaks fluent Spanish just isn\u2019t the same thing. So what is Kaine? He\u2019s a moderate. There, I said it. And a moderate is just what the Democrats need in an election where upwards of 40 percent of Americans identify as independents and we are seeing record levels of undecideds at this late stage. Independents are also one of the only groups where Trump is leading over Clinton -- along with non-college educated whites. Most crucially, on Wednesday night Kaine showed us what a big fan of Hillary Clinton he is. He discussed her tested passion for putting kids and families first, her accomplishments as a senator who helped New Yorkers after 9/11 and then as secretary of state in implementing tough sanctions against Iran and forcefully arguing for the mission that took out Usama bin Laden. He also reminded us that she will fight tooth and nail to protect Roe v. Wade and work to get women equal pay. Those are the values of Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Joe and Jill Biden and Barack and Michelle Obama. Kaine told us that on Wednesday night. They\u2019re also his values. While Kaine might not seem like the most exciting choice for a running mate, he fits Clinton\u2019s candidacy to a T: he has the judgment and experience for the job just like she does. Plus, she really likes him. When the two of them are together you can see an ease and comfort that will bring out the best in Clinton during her time in office. And that\u2019s what matters most of all.",

Depending on your degree of pessimism, today brings signals either that the Founder\u2019s fall is accelerating or that republicanism shall be reasserted. On the side of collapse: The House of Representatives turned into an all-night pizza party as Democrats physically obstructed legislative business to demand a vote on a gun control bill. It\u2019s the kind of conduct that, in modern times at least, we are only accustomed to seeing in foreign lands \u2013 the kinds of places where members of parliaments occasionally beat the borscht out of each other. On the side of ships righting themselves: The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling blocking President Obama\u2019s granting of amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Obama\u2019s order was an intentionally provocative act meant to stretch the boundaries of presidential power and provoke a fight with Republicans. The judiciary branch gave him a time out. Since before William Marbury was a magistrate, the idea of a judiciary that can constrain the power of a rapacious executive has been a bulwark of the American system. \u00a0Federal judges have lifetime appointments for that very reason. Those concerned about the fiery populism on display in American politics of all flavors these days take some comfort in the idea that these current tumults can be cooled by judges with respect for due process. Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut\u2026 The decision in Obama\u2019s immigration case is more of a non-decision. With the court one justice short, the four-four deadlock means that a lower court\u2019s ruling can stand. If the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s replacement is a believer in expanded executive power, future decisions will give us even more kingly presidents. If Scalia\u2019s successor is a fan of a weaker presidency, the court will keep the next chief executive penned, at least to the current degree. While this certainly casts in sharper relief the consequences of the presidential election and subsequent appointment, or, more likely, appointments to the high court it also gives us pause to consider the heath of the system overall. No fair-minded person could doubt the sincerity of the Democrats who channeled their inner Abbie Hoffmans\u2019 to embarrass House Republicans Wednesday night. Democrats almost uniformly support restrictions on gun purchases and have since Hillary Clinton wore bell bottoms to class at Wellesley. What is different this time is that gun control advocates declared invalid the protocols and procedure in the House of Representatives. There are hundreds of causes that could be deemed important enough to demand immediate action by the federal government, from cancer, to ISIS, to abortion. But those demonstrations have generally been for street corners and rallies, not the floor of the House. But if people believe the system is broken \u2013 perhaps irreparably so \u2013 then why should we respect disrespectable conventions and institutions. If Washington is beyond broken what is the problem with breaking it a little bit more? Like the man said: \u201cI\u2019m out of order? This whole trial is out of order?\u201d When Donald Trump muses on the possibility of America intentionally defaulting on its debts the energy is the same. The whole \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d jazz is insufficient to the time, so pitch it.\u00a0When Bernie Sanders calls for the federal government to subsume the financial sector, the energy is the same. If bankers are basically crooks anyway, why not treat them that way? And certainly when Trump\u2019s opponents visit violence upon his supporters, or those supporters commit violence of their own, this it is still the same: the failure of the system, an urgency of the moment, require and allow actions deemed unthinkable in most of modern history. Which side do you think will win? The crusty, musty old bones of Mr. Madison\u2019s republic rising up to bring order or the fully-frothed ardor of those who believe the time for chaos has come? If you\u2019re hanging your hopes at deadlocked decisions on the Supreme Court you might want to think again.POWER PLAY: IN WAKE OF SENATE SHAKEUP, JOLLY PREPS FOR CRIST BATTLEWith Sen.

There\u2019s a long history of parallelism between America\u2019s politics and those of her mother country \u2013 Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, etc. \u2013 and the similarities today are quite strong. The move for divorce from the Continent has been substantially stoked by the influx of Middle Eastern migrants from the unraveling of Syria and Iraq. While the debates have often centered on regulation, independence and other policy fights, national identity and the threat of Islamist terrorism have predominated. Sound familiar? Trump talks much less these days about the threat of Mexican migrants and much more about the dangers of Islamism in America. A \u201cBrexit\u201d win would be considered a good omen for the de facto GOP nominee. If Britain decides to remain in the EU, it will symbolize a commitment to internationalism and the world-order ideas of Hillary Clinton. By choosing to remain part of this united Western world and make decisions together, Britain would be favoring her platform of foreign policy.

            "article_content": "Republican Warren Davidson won a lopsided victory Tuesday in the special election for the Ohio congressional seat left vacant by former House Speaker John Boehner after nearly 25 years. Davidson had 75 percent of the vote with 48 percent of precincts reporting from the six western Ohio counties, according to unofficial returns. It is Davidson's first election to office, after capturing his party's nomination in March. He topped a 15-candidate primary field in the heavily Republican district Boehner first won in 1990 after ousting a GOP incumbent in the primary. Democrat Corey Foister had 22 percent, and Green Party candidate Jim Condit Jr. had about 3 percent after a day of light voter turnout. Davidson will complete Boehner's term and be in a strong position to win the general election for a full term in the next Congress. Open seats have been rare in Ohio, which has very incumbent-friendly House districts. George Taylor, 74, of Hamilton, said he voted early, casting his ballot for Davidson because he likes his conservative views. \"We can't keep spending like this,\" Taylor said. \"Obamacare is a train wreck, and we've got some jobs back (since the recession), but not enough.\" Davidson, an Army veteran and businessman in Miami County, won the dual March primary for the special and general election nominations with about 32 percent of the vote in each. He ran as a conservative outsider, defeating two incumbent state legislators in the field. Davidson got key support from some former Boehner antagonists, such as Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and the conservative advocacy groups Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. Davidson has said people in the district considered it \"an honor\" to have the speaker from their home area, but that they are ready to have \"our own representative\" in Washington. Boehner defeated a scandal-marred Republican incumbent in the 1990 primary, and then won re-election, often with wide margins, every two years after his first election. Davidson and low-key Democrat Corey Foister, 26, a childhood cancer survivor who says he can do something about issues facing the nation's youth such as the high cost of education, offered contrasts during a recent forum at Miami University's Hamilton event center. Davidson spoke out strongly against abortion and new restrictions on gun ownership. Foister said he supports abortion rights and that more needs to be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Condit is a frequent candidate running this year under the Green Party banner although Green Party members in Ohio have disavowed him. Green Party activists aren't sure whether they will get a candidate onto the November ballot, but Condit would have to run as a write-in because election officials disqualified him from running in the general election for the Green Party after voting in the Republican primary in March. Condit blames 9/11 on a conspiracy involving Israel to keep the United States involved in the Middle East and to take Americans' freedoms away in the name of national security. He also has voiced suspicions about the 2014 accidental death of James Traficant, an Ohio Democrat expelled from Congress after being convicted of taking bribes and kickbacks.",

            "article_content": "Breaking down the candidates' stances Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton made campaign stops Sunday in Kentucky ahead the state\u2019s primary later this week, pitching a pro-jobs agenda and trying to stop rival Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 extended string of victories, as the primary season enters its final stages. \u201cWe just have to get more Americans a chance for better jobs with better incomes so you can believe you\u2019re going to give your children and grandchildren a better life,\u201d Clinton said at a rally in Louisville. \u201cWe can put more Americans to work.\u201d Clinton and Sanders will compete Tuesday in Kentucky and Oregon, while Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump will try to add to his delegate count in Oregon. There are 28 Republican delegates at stake in Oregon toward Trump securing the party nomination with 1,237. He now has 1,134 delegates with 436 still available in the party\u2019s seven remaining state contests. Trump was not on the campaign trail Sunday. Since becoming the nominee in early May, the billionaire businessman has increasingly focused on financing a general election campaign and getting the party to rally around his candidacy. Clinton already has an insurmountable lead in the delegate race, 2,240-to-1,437, toward 2,383 to clinch to party nomination. The 55 at stake in the state\u2019s Democratic primary Tuesday and the 61 in Oregon won\u2019t change the outcome of the party\u2019s primary. However, Sanders has won 10 of the past 12 state contests, which is inspiring the Vermont senator to keep his campaign alive through the remaining nine Democratic contests and the party\u2019s nominating convention in July. \u201cWe are going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent,\u201d Sanders said at a rally Sunday in Paducah, Ky. \u201cWhat we are seeing is massive levels of poverty that should not be taking place in the richest country in the world. \u2026 A handful of wealth families are controlling the political and economic life of this nation.\u201d (The state\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.6 percent is above the national average of 5 percent.) Clinton is expected to do well in Kentucky, which has a Republican governor and two GOP senators. She soundly defeated Barack Obama their 2008 primary contest in the state, and limited polling shows Clinton with a double-digit lead ahead of Tuesday\u2019s contest. As one of the country\u2019s most liberal states, Oregon would appear like Sanders territory. However, the state\u2019s Democratic primary is open only to registered Democrats, a situation that has hurt Sanders in other states with so-called \u201cclosed primaries,\" considering his crossover appeal to independent voters. Polling in the state varies, but a new and frequently cited survey by the Portland-based firm DHM Research shows Clinton leading by double digits. The former secretary of state is also trying to move toward an anticipated general election race, against Trump. Her campaign sent out a fundraising email Saturday highlighting the cost of \u201crunning two races,\u201d under the headline \u201cNuts.\u201d On Sunday, Clinton again turned to Trump, saying as she has before that he\u2019s a \u201cloose cannon\u201d for suggesting that more countries have nuclear weapons and using the United States\u2019 against the Islamic State. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard such reckless, risky talk from somebody about to be a nominee for president than I\u2019ve heard from Donald Trump when it comes to nuclear weapons,\u201d Clinton said in Louisville. \u201cHe says he would use nuclear weapons. This is scary, dangerous talk. This is the talk of a loose cannon.\u201d",

(AP) **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster:\u00a0 Hillary\u2019s hauteur - Power Play: Foundering Foundation - Time Out: Traditions of our imagination - Manafort, nyet - But at least the horse was soberHILLARY\u2019S HAUTEUR There\u2019s hubris and then there\u2019s the Clintons. The news is that former President\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0and daughter Chelsea will stop raising money for the family\u2019s foundation and that the organization would stop accepting foreign contributions if Hillary Clinton gets elected. Think about that one for a second. If Clinton\u2019s critics are right and her family\u2019s foundation was little more than a legalized form of bribing the woman who stands poised to become president of the United States, then what would the significance be of the foundation vowing to stop accepting foreign contributions if Clinton is elected? Why a gold rush of influence buying between now and Election Day, of course! Hurry, hurry everybody, this is a last chance to get in good with the next commander in chief. If Clinton and her supporters were right that the foundation is a unique and essential global charity that does essential work, why would one change course? Would Jonas Salk have ditched the polio vaccine because people complained about his funding? Would Marie Curie have dropped the radium just because she was getting cash from some unsavory sources? The answer from Team Clinton would be that the ban on foreign funds and diminished role for the family would avoid the \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d But if it appears that there might be an impropriety on Nov. 8, why not now? The pressure is growing on Clintons on the left to unwind their massive buckraking efforts. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and the Boston Globe editorial page both added to the weight this week.\u00a0 Rather than swift response though, we get what has been the hallmark of Clinton\u2019s second White House run: caution imbued with arrogance. Clinton\u2019s slow-walked response to her email scandal, her refusal to give press conferences and her tapioca-bland policy positions are all reflective of a candidate who is just kicking the can. Unworried about defeat, Clinton is simply refusing to engage and happy to keep the focus on her foe, Donald Trump. Whether or not that works will depend on whether Trump can ever shift the focus back to her. If he can go even a week without campaign drama or a distracting controversy, scrutiny on Clinton would intensify. If the race does tighten in the home stretch, that could prove to be a problem. If the race doesn\u2019t get more competitive and Clinton doesn\u2019t face additional calls for accountability, one can only imagine how these tendencies would play out to disastrous ends inside her White House.POWER PLAY: FOUNDERING FOUNDATION Hillary Clinton\u2019s family foundation raises questions that won\u2019t go away and now the family has said they would scale back if she\u2019s elected president. Chris Stirewalt asks: Should any president have an active family foundation? Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan and Democratic strategist Douglas Smith weigh in.

Police also have cited 18-year-old Robert Miller, of Punxsutawney, and his four friends who were riding with him with underage drinking. The four ranged in age from 16 to 20. The legal drinking age in Pennsylvania is 21. The charges, announced Wednesday, stem from the police stop July 8 in Canoe Township, Indiana County. Police say all five had been drinking and had alcoholic beverages with them. In Pennsylvania, it\u2019s illegal to drive if one\u2019s blood-alcohol content is 0.08 percent or greater.

How jiggy? Former House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday told a crowd at Stanford University that he was \u201ctexting buddies\u201d with the celebrity businessman and would have no trouble voting for him in the fall. According to the school\u2019s student newspaper, Boehner \u201caccepted Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee,\u201d though he declined to endorse Trump\u2019s specific policies. As for the remaining obstacle to Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP, Boehner sounded rather Trump-like himself. \u201cLucifer in the flesh,\u201d the former speaker said of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, \u201cI have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.\u201d The remarks came on the same day that Cruz tapped Stanford alum Carly Fiorina as his running mate in a bid to stage a comeback win in Indiana for the chance to thwart Trump at the Republican National Convention in July. The viciousness of Boehner\u2019s attack is the clearest signal yet that the Republican establishment is falling in line behind Trump in a big way. Trump is returning the favor. At a rally in Indianapolis on Wednesday, Trump included a defense of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and attacked Cruz for making the \u201ctop man\u201d in the senate look bad. The question for Cruz is whether he can still rally the party\u2019s conservative base against the unexpected new partnership between Trump\u2019s populist backers and the big business wing of the GOP. The question for Trump is whether his initial supporters will stay with him in this new Boehnerized coalition. Trump completes GOP break with Bush foreign policy - WSJ: \u201cStriking a nationalistic and populist tone, Mr. Trump was unambiguous in saying he would demand that allies pay the U.S. part of the bill for defending them or else they would have to defend themselves. Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments contrasted with recent Republican foreign policy. GOP leaders, led by such figures as Mr. [George W] Bush and Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), have often called for muscular U.S. engagement in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere.\u201d Conservatives poised for another defeat - FiveThirtyEight suggests that Cruz is too conservative to defeat Trump, not just for the moderate/liberal wing of the GOP, but also for those who identify as \u201csomewhat conservative.\u201d This essential part of the GOP was carried by George W. Bush back in 2000 despite Sen. John McCain\u2019s dominance with liberal Republicans. Unbound Pennsylvania delegates wary - NYT: \u201c\u2026[I]n the trench warfare fight for the Republican presidential nomination \u2014 the smaller, less understood delegate races that could prove far more pivotal to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 the situation remains fluid. He appeared to have won about 40 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 54 unbound delegates, along with another 17 awarded to him outright as the statewide winner. The remaining 14 delegates have either expressed no preference or said they would not vote for Mr. Trump.\u201d Fiorina waves off collusion talk - On \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Carly Fiorina dismissed claims that there was something strange about a pro-Cruz super PAC giving her presidential campaign money last spring saying, \u201cThe last time I looked what Super PACs do, they\u2019re not coordinating with candidates by law, and most super PACs give to a variety of like-minded candidates.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s been no doubt to anyone who\u2019s been watching this race for a long time that Ted Cruz and I are like-minded.\u201d [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a0987;\u00a0Cruz\u00a0562; Kasich 153 (1,237 needed to win)] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026 Presidents James Monroe and Thomas Jefferson\u2019s neighboring estates in Virginia have long been contrasted as representing the simple and lavish tastes of each, respectively.

It turns out that the home preserved on the estate \u2014 and marketed for years as the residence where the president laid his head \u2014 is in fact a guest quarters. Instead, an archaeological dig on the grounds has revealed a sizable home more than twice the size of the small cottage. In other words, the home of Monroe was more castle than cabin\u2026\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

This is where Trump becomes Clinton\u2019s most dangerous opponent: Even if he loses, his toxicity will linger on to poison Clinton\u2019s administration. She might start her presidential term with a large chunk of the Republican Party believing, for instance, that she is complicit in sexual assault.\u00a0Trump has already shown he\u2019s an ugly winner, denigrating his opponents even when he\u2019s besting them at the polls.

Fox News\u2019 Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano argues that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, or the FISA court, allows our information to be used far beyond the intended purpose of protecting national security. He explains: \u201cCongress has unconstitutionally authorized the FISA court to issue search warrants on the basis of governmental need -- a standard that is no standard at all because the government can always claim that it needs what it wants. The FISA court does not require a showing of probable cause for its warrants, because it accepts the myth that the government is listening to or reading words by foreign people for foreign intelligence purposes only, not for prosecutorial purposes.\u201d [Dem delegate count: Clinton 2164; Sanders1355 (2,383 needed to win)] RIVALRY RESCUEFOX 4: \u201cWe call police when we need help.

An elevator malfunctioned inside the police academy\u2026The KC fire department arrived and freed their brothers in blue. Not one of the 12 officers inside were hurt, and were said to be in good spirits.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump maintains his wide lead over the pack with 32 percent, while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, comes in second at 19 percent and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., within striking distance at 15 percent. No other candidate reached double digits. Cruz\u2019s lead falls just outside the poll\u2019s margin of error leaving Rubio in good position to pull off a second place finish in the first southern primary of the cycle. In the Florida senator\u2019s favor: he tops the field as second choice for voters and ranks among the lowest of candidates who GOP primary voters say they would never support. Cruz does not fare as well, trailing only Trump and Jeb Bush in the \u201cnever support\u201d column. Still, Cruz has built up a lead over Rubio, picking up 4 points since December\u2019s South Carolina poll results, when the two were tied. Time is running short but the poll shows there is still room for significant movement: 25 percent of these GOP likely voters say they could change their mind. National scramble - A CBS News poll out today shows that Trump maintains a commanding lead on the field nationally with a 17-point advantage over second place finisher Ted Cruz. This follows Quinnipiac University\u2019s national poll Wednesday that put Trump in the lead 10 points ahead of Marco Rubio. By contrast, Wednesday evening\u2019s WSJ/NBC News poll found Trump trailing Cruz by two points with Rubio falling into third place\u2026 Why? - WaPo\u2019s Philip Bump explains why the WSJ/NBC News poll shows dramatically different results than other recent national polls: \u201cThe NBC/WSJ poll is the first national poll conducted entirely after the debate.\u00a0Quinnipiac\u2019s poll was in the field from Feb. 10 to 15 -- straddling the debate on Feb. 13. NBC and the Journal talked to voters from Feb. 14 to 16.\u201d Cruz to Trump: \u2018File the lawsuit\u2019 - The (Charleston, S.C.) Post and Courier: \u201cFeuding in the Republican presidential primary kicked up a notch Wednesday when Sen. Ted Cruz responded to a cease-and-desist request from Donald Trump\u2019s camp asking him to stop airing a TV ad with a blunt call of \u2018file the lawsuit.\u2019 Cruz told reporters the letter accused his campaign of misleading the public in a commercial that includes older footage of Trump saying he is \u2018very pro-choice.\u2019\u2026Cruz said the letter threatened to sue him if the campaign doesn\u2019t remove the ad. \u2018I have to say, that, Mr. Trump, you have been threatening frivolous lawsuits for your entire adult life,\u2019 Cruz said. \u2018Even in the annals of frivolous lawsuits, this takes the cake. So, Donald, I would encourage you if you want to file a lawsuit challenging this ad, claiming it as defamation, file the lawsuit.\u2019\u201d [In a new ad in South Carolina, Cruz slams Rubio on amnesty by comparing him to President Obama.] Trump says he\u2019d find out who \u2018really knocked down the World Trade Center\u2019 - RCP: \u201cAt a Wednesday morning campaign event in Bluffton, SC, Donald Trump takes his\u00a0relitigation of the Bush administration\u2019s record on 9/11 and Iraq\u00a0to the next level, seeming to imply that we don\u2019t currently know who \u2018really\u2019 committed the 9/11 attacks.\u00a0Trump says if he is elected: \u2018you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018It wasn\u2019t the Iraqis,\u2019 he explained. \u2018You may find it\u2019s the Saudis.\u2019\u00a0 \u2018They have papers in there that are very secret,\u2019 he also said, referencing the 28 still-classified pages of the 9/11 commission report. \u2018But you will find out.\u2019\u201d Rubio snags prized endorsement from S.C. governor - NYT: \u201cSenator\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0of Florida on Wednesday won the coveted backing of South Carolina\u2019s governor,\u00a0Nikki R. Haley, bringing together two of the youngest Republican rising stars at a moment when their party is facing difficult questions about whether instead to look to its past or to political outsiders for leadership. Coming just three days before the South Carolina presidential primary, Ms. Haley\u2019s endorsement could provide Mr. Rubio with a crucial lift on Saturday. But it may also help him beyond, by associating him with a widely admired leader who, as a woman and a minority figure, shatters traditional perceptions of a Republican politician.\u201d [Team Rubio is out with a new ad featuring Haley. The ad is set to air in South Carolina today.] Jeb, Rubio tie for most spent on television ads - Tampa Bay Times: \u201cJeb Bush has spent nearly $81 million on TV ads, by far the leader in either nomination fight, according to new figures. And Marco Rubio is second with $50 million. In South Carolina, Bush and Rubio are even closer. All told, $262 million has been spent on ads, according to ad-spending tracker SMG Delta released Wednesday by NBC News.\u201d [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a017;\u00a0Cruz\u00a011;\u00a0Rubio\u00a010;\u00a0Kasich 5; Bush 4; Carson\u00a03 (1,237 needed to win)] WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Science News brings us the story of one scientist\u2019s journey to Pluto\u2019s atmosphere: \u201cPluto\u2019s shadow raced across the Pacific Ocean at more than 85,000 kilometers per hour. Planetary scientist Michael Person was on a 747 chasing the shadow, which formed as Pluto passed in front of a distant star. Until last summer, everything researchers knew about Pluto\u2019s atmosphere came from stellar eclipses like this one. But for this June 2015 run, the analysis would get a reality check from the New Horizons spacecraft, which was speeding through the Kuiper belt toward the dwarf planet\u2026The rendezvous with Pluto\u2019s shadow required precision: The remote world would block the star for just a couple of minutes. And while the entire shadow is as wide as Pluto \u2014 2,374 kilometers \u2014 SOFIA was aiming for a 50-kilometer-wide spot at the shadow\u2019s center. At that spot, known as the \u2018central flash,\u2019 researchers can get the fullest sense of Pluto\u2019s skies.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The general election matchups show Clinton losing to every GOP candidate except Donald Trump, while her opponent socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., beats them all handily. This comes ahead of what looks to be an increasingly close contest in Nevada this weekend, where Clinton was hoping to bring Sanders\u2019 early state momentum to an end with support from the state\u2019s minority voters. Despite Clinton\u2019s early ground game in the Battle Born State, younger, first-time voters are gravitating to Sanders, and could give him the push he needs to narrow Clinton\u2019s lead, or even beat her. The Clinton team has already begun to downplay expectations for Nevada and next week\u2019s Democratic South Carolina primary as they brace for a longer battle than originally expected. [Sanders is out with a pair of new ads in Nevada on how to caucus and urging them to caucus for him.] But she\u2019s good for the party\u2019s purse - AP: \u201cHillary Clinton isn\u2019t yet the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee, but she\u2019s already good for its bottom line. The Democratic National Committee began the presidential election year almost $1 million in the hole - a bad situation that would have been even worse without the millions of dollars in fundraising that Clinton's campaign sent its way. That kind of assistance makes Clinton unique in the 2016 presidential field. No one else, Republican or Democrat, is raising money for his or her party at this early stage, including her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u201d Hillary donors worry over Bernie attacks - The Hill: \u201cKey Democratic players are worried that Hillary Clinton\u2019s super-PAC ally David Brock could be hurting her image and hampering her chances of winning the presidency.\u00a0 In interviews over the past month, Clinton donors, fundraisers and operatives have told The Hill that the concerns about Brock\u2019s comments, particularly some of his attacks on Bernie Sanders, stretch all the way to the top of Clinton\u2019s political machinery. A leading figure in the Democracy Alliance, the liberal equivalent\u00a0of the conservative\u00a0Koch brothers\u2019 donor network, said donors he associates with would like to put Brock \u2018back in the can.\u2019\u201d [Watch Fox: A new Fox News poll on the Democratic race in South Carolina as well as a national poll of both Democrat and Republican fields will be released tonight on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d at 6 p.m. ET] Hillary\u2019s emails detail Afghan national\u2019s ties to CIA - Fox News: \u201cOne of the classified email chains discovered on Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal unsecured server discussed an Afghan national\u2019s ties to the CIA and a report that he was on the agency\u2019s payroll, a U.S. government official with knowledge of the document told Fox News. The discussion of a foreign national working with the U.S. government raises security implications \u2013 an executive order signed by President Obama said such unauthorized disclosures are \u2018presumed to cause damage to the national security.\u2019 The U.S. government official said the Clinton email exchange, which referred to a New York Times report, was among 29 classified emails recently provided to congressional committees with specific clearances to review them. In that batch were 22 \u2018top secret\u2019 exchanges deemed too damaging to national security to release.\u201d [Democratic delegate count\u00a0- Clinton 394; Sanders 44\u00a0(2,382 needed to win)] The Judge\u2019s Ruling: A tribute to friend, scholar Scalia - Fox News\u2019 Senior Judicial Analyst Andrew Napolitano pays tribute to his friend and fellow legal scholar Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Noting that Scalia was a strict interpreter of the Constitution and a champion of judicial restraint, Napolitano describes an exchange he had with Scalia that encapsulates the justice\u2019s view of the Supreme Court: \u201cI once asked him if he felt he belonged to the Court. His reply was short and blunt. He told me he belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, he belonged to his family, and he belonged to the Constitution. The Court, he said, was just one creature intended to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution is the Court\u2019s creator. No creature can be greater than its creator. He liked the Court. He loved the Constitution.\u201d Read here. Senate Republicans will stick with McConnell - WashEx\u2019s David Drucker reports that Republicans will stick with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on his early decision not to appoint a successor to Justice Antonin Scalia until after the election this November: \u201cRepublican operatives familiar with McConnell\u2019s thinking and closely aligned with GOP senators said they expect the blockade to hold. The stakes of letting the now-evenly divided nine-member high court swing liberal with the confirmation of what would be Obama\u2019s third nominee, and the political repercussions for doing so, are enough to keep most Republicans on board with McConnell\u2019s plan.\u201d NOT SO GRATEFUL MOOSEUPI: \u201cA British Columbia man who saw a moose get its back leg caught in a fence freed the animal and was kicked and chased around his yard by the ungrateful beast. Marc Schoene was in his West Kelona yard with his wife when the large moose calf tried to jump a fence and ended up with one of its back legs caught in the wires. Schoene, who posted video of the incident\u00a0to YouTube, used wire cutters to free the moose, thinking it would leave the yard, but the confused and ungrateful moose kicked him in the back and shoulder before chasing him around the yard. Schoene was not seriously injured and the moose eventuality left by jumping over a few neighboring fences to reach an open area.\u201d AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cWe were talking about the polls.

Today, the display would read: \u201c10 percent complete.\u201d According to AP\u00a0data, more than 13.4 million votes have already been cast in 37 states, far more than at this point four years ago. The trend suggests that perhaps 40 percent of all ballots will be in before Nov. 8. For race watchers, this is a bonanza. It means we get a lot more tea leaves to read. Sometimes we can know at least the party affiliations the voters requesting early ballots. In other cases, we have to guess based on the demographic makeup of the counties and their electoral histories. So let\u2019s get reading, starting with the must-win states for Republican\u00a0Donald Trump.North Carolina: In-person early voting started here last week and Democrats are running ahead of Republicans in ballots submitted 46 percent to 29 percent. The pace is actually somewhat slower than in 2012, but probably due to new restrictions on poll hours. The rate is expected to increase as the polls remain open longer.Florida: With more than 2 million ballots already returned \u2013 perhaps a quarter of the total expected \u2013 Republicans find themselves in trouble in the Sunshine State. After failing to deliver their normally dominant mail-in voting performance, the GOP is getting swamped in the early in-person vote. It took Democrats far longer in 2012 and 2008 to catch up when\u00a0President Obama\u00a0won here, but they have already pulled even this year at about 41 percent.Ohio: There\u2019s good news for Trump in the Buckeye State. Democratic strongholds of Cuyahoga and Franklin counties continue to show deep declines in ballot requests compared to 2012. And, Democratic data firm\u00a0Catalist\u00a0found the white share of Ohio ballot requests was up to 91 percent from 87 percent. The black share declined to 7 percent from 10 percent.Georgia: Another bright spot for the GOP. Like Ohio, Georgia doesn\u2019t report party affiliation on early votes, but participation is up markedly and, again, mostly among white voters. Catalist found that the white share of ballots rose a percentage point to 66 percent. The black share fell to 31 percent from 34 percent.Utah: In the most Republican state in the union, the GOP finds itself essentially tied with independents on early voting. That\u2019s good news for Utahan independent candidate\u00a0Evan McMullin, who has polled well there. Also good for McMullin: Catalist found faster gains among voters ages 22 to 49, the toughest group for Trump.Texas: Yuuuuuge early turnout in Texas, with almost a million ballots cast in the first two days of voting \u2013 a 46 percent increase from four years ago. There\u2019s no party breakdown here but Democrats are crediting some of the surge to a massive early-vote outreach with Hispanic voters. Or, maybe it\u2019s just that Texas Republicans really like Trump.Arizona: Another state seeing eye-popping increases in early voting. Last cycle, the GOP was up by 7 points in ballots cast. This time, it\u2019s essentially a tie.Iowa: Democrats are dragging here. They\u2019re up 8 points on Republicans in early-ballot requests, but that pales compared to a 14-point advantage in 2012.Nevada: The early returns are actually down in the Silver State, but that seems to be a mostly Republican problem. Democrats lead in returned ballots, 46 percent to 35 percent.Colorado: It looks like the same story in Centennial State as its Western neighbors: Democrats lead 40 percent to 34 percent among the 416,000 ballots already returned by mail. In 2012, Democrats trailed Republicans at this point by 10 points. So, while there\u2019s good news for the GOP in Ohio, Iowa and Georgia, most of the auguries are ominous for the red team. We ought to bear in mind that Democrats have traditionally made better use of early voting and that Republicans could close these deficits on the last day. But right now, the enthusiasm gap seems to favor Democrats, as does the party\u2019s turnout operation.THE RULEBOOK: CAN\u2019T GO IT ALONE\u201cIn this respect, therefore, there is no comparison between the intended power of the President and the actual power of the British sovereign.

Look at the comical end to which \u201cfact-check\u201d journalism has come. But that falls apart usually on subjective claims about how a policy would or would not work and on the definitional terms use by the fact checkers. This time though, we have what amount to criminal allegations against both major party nominees. Trump is accused of sexually assaulting women. Clinton is accused of obstruction of justice. For most people, the credulity with which these claims are met is a question of partisan loyalty. For those looking for the actual truth, it may take months or even years before we really know, if we ever do.] \u201cChris, right after I read that\u00a0Marco Rubio\u00a0had a 10 point lead, and the Dems were making a push, I got yet another dire email from the Rubio campaign asking if I was with him in this fight.

I live in California\u2026I donated to Rubio\u2019s Presidential campaign, and since, I have been bombarded daily from his campaign,\u00a0Trey Gowdy, Trump, even\u00a0Ted Cruz. Each email was a dramatically written End-Of-Times prediction where my donation was the difference. I get the need for the party to get as many donations as possible, but is this onslaught common practice? It seems intrusive, as well as not very smartly targeted.\u201d \u2013\u00a0Matthew Freitas, Modesto, Calif.[Ed. note:\u00a0RIP your inbox! I can commiserate since many campaigns over the years have found my email address and filled my account to the brim with panicky alerts. Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign was arguably the worst offender, with a constant bombardment of spammy submissions, and I have never made a political contribution in my life. These campaigns just dump this stuff on journalists in hopes that they will catch a mention or two to amplify their money pleas. The calculation here is that it\u2019s worth annoying you and other rational donors in exchange for the contributions they get for triggering an emotional response in others. It is the same model politicians and consultants used with direct mail in the 1990s and the aughts: just keep sending. As you might imagine, the consultants like this idea very much, since it\u2019s not their name that goes on it and they get paid by the contribution.

            "article_content": "President responds to Republican presidential nominee's accusations of voter fraud, media bias President Obama accused Donald Trump of \u201cwhining\u201d Tuesday with his claims about the election being \u201crigged\u201d against him, saying during a Rose Garden press conference that \u201cit\u2019s unprecedented\u201d for a presidential candidate to try and discredit an election before the votes are cast. \u201cI\u2019d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining\u201d and make his case to voters, Obama said. The Republican nominee and running mate Mike Pence both have been stepping up warnings that the election could be rigged \u2013 though the statements pertain not just to potential voter fraud but media coverage they claim is biased. \u201cThey have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories,\u201d Trump said in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about rigged elections out there today,\u201d Pence said at an Ohio rally Monday, claiming the media are \u201ctrying to rig this election with their biased coverage in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor.\u201d But speaking outside the White House alongside visiting Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Obama said the rigging claim \u201cdoesn\u2019t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you\u2019d want out of a president -- if you start whining before the game\u2019s even over.\u201d Obama argued that elections are so \u201cde-centralized\u201d that they couldn\u2019t be rigged in the first place. Further, he said that if Trump wins, he\u2019d expect rival Hillary Clinton to offer a \u201cgracious\u201d concession speech and work with him \u2013 and he personally would welcome Trump for a \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what Americans do,\u201d Obama said. Obama, during the joint press conference, also took a swipe at Trump\u2019s \u201cflattery\u201d of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. He called that and other comments from Trump \u201cunprecedented in American politics.\u201d Meanwhile, Obama responded Tuesday to claims in newly released FBI documents that a senior State Department official offered a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to the FBI in a bid to strip the classification on a particular Clinton email. Obama said some of the \"more sensational implications or appearances\" related to the report \"are not based on actual events.\" He said those types of interactions \"happen a lot.\" According to the FBI file, though, senior department official Patrick Kennedy offered additional slots for the bureau overseas if they would de-classify a particular email from Clinton\u2019s server marked \u201cSECRET.\u201d This effort was unsuccessful. Trump has said the FBI records show a \"criminal act.\" The Rose Garden press conference was held following an arrival ceremony earlier on the South Lawn for Renzi. Obama will play host to Renzi at the final state dinner of his presidency. Obama described the 41-year-old Italian leader as young and handsome and credited him with challenging the status quo in Italy with bold reforms. \"He's put forth a vision of progress that's not rooted in people's fears but rather in their hopes,\" Obama said. Renzi, in turn, told Obama that many people think politics is about screaming, fighting and creating division, but that Obama was different: \"We think history will be kind with you, Mr. President.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

OBAMACARE CREATES NERVOUS CONDITION - In the wake an ObamaCare scare in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election, President Obama summoned all of the Senate Democrats facing re-election in 2014 to the White House in a bid to calm their growing anxieties about the problems with his law. The group, which included struggling red state Democrats like Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Mark Begich, D-Alaska, and Mark Pryor, D-Ark., shared what one Democratic source told Fox News was \u201ca lot of pent-up frustration.\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who leads the Democratic Senatorial Committee, also attended. Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry learned that senators floated the idea of a one-year delay in the fines and enrollment mandates under the law, pushing some political pain until after midterm elections. The president is said to have rejected the idea. Fox News has more. [\u201cYou said recently that you expect the Web site to be running smoothly for a majority of users by late November.

Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., publicly reiterated his call for a delay in penalties under the law. The president may be trying to avoid further rate hikes and cancellations for those already insured that would ensue if, as expected, there are too many welfare recipients in the program and not enough paying customers. But the president\u2019s decision to continue to publicly make his \u201cif you like it\u201d promise after he decided not to keep it has left him in a pickle with members of his own party. He was able to say what he needed to in order to win in 2012, and now Obama is asking his fellow Democrats to take one for the team. Not cool. [Daniel Henninger: \u201cUnless Mr. Obama's approval numbers submerge completely, Democrats won't leave the ship (though at-risk 2014 Senate Democrats Landrieu, Pryor and Begich have been seen rummaging for life vests).] White House caves on union plan pressure - With unrest growing about ObamaCare problems on the left, the administration is moving ahead with a long-sought exemption from new health insurance taxes for unions. From Washington Examiner: \u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services quietly released a final rule last week that includes an intention to exempt some union insurance plans from a substantial new tax known as the reinsurance fee. As part of Obamacare, the tax was supposed to be levied against all insurance plans to share the risk for insurers taking on the sickest patients next year.\u201d Delay is de thing - Obama understandably wants to avoid any delay. Not only would it likely worsen the more violent disruptions expected in the private insurance market next year, it would also set a precedent. But even so, he might not be able to resist. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has a bill in the works for delaying the fines for individuals and Landrieu is pushing a bill to force Obama to keep his \u201cif you like it\u201d pledge. The administration, having caved to allies in big business and big labor on the law, can hardly refuse members of the president\u2019s party in need of some political salve.

SO, UM, CONGRATULATIONS, MR. SPEAKER-ELECT?If you have to be a little bit crazy to run for president, you have to be pretty well certifiable to want to be speaker of the House of Representatives. And yet, three seemingly sane humans will today stand for election among their fellow members of the Republican House majority. There are certainly reasons to do it. Aside from patriotism and duty, there is the prestige of being only the 54nd speaker in 226 years \u2013 to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Henry Clay and Sam Rayburn and be two heartbeats away from the presidency. Plus, you get a very swank office and a whole cyclone of staff, security and various upkissers swirling around you at all times. And when you\u2019re done, even if you finish in disgrace, you can go get good and rich. But the job itself hardly seems worth it, especially these days. It\u2019s so bad that John Boehner, like another famous German Catholic, took a surprise retirement. Boehner may have only been a few steps ahead of the lynch mob in his caucus when he left, but he will still be the first speaker since Tip O\u2019Neill to leave under his own steam and not be forced out by voters or by scandal. So what\u2019s the deal with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who has an actual risk of contracting the speaker-itis ailment? The others running today can do so content in the knowledge that they are all but certain to fail, making a candidacy an appealing way to either make oneself more famous or make an ideological point. McCarthy, though, is actually likely to end up with the job after an election ordeal that is only the amuse-bouche before the feast of degradation and frustration that lies ahead. The election this afternoon will go like this: McCarthy is all but certain to win a majority of the 247 Republican House members, but not get the 218 votes he needs at the end of the month to be elected speaker by the whole House. With enough GOP members having vowed to not vote with their party\u2019s pick, they can deny McCarthy a win on the first ballot, and, they hope, force the vote into chaos and allow other options \u2013 ranging from intriguing to absolutely batty \u2013 to come to the fore. To prevent this from happening, McCarthy will spend the rest of the month making impossible promises to mistrusting adversaries. Those promises will make his eventual job so much more miserable. Unable to deliver in office the unicorns of conservative excellence and purity promised by his foes, McCarthy will be called a traitor and a failure and the same folks who have reviled Boehner will threaten and thunder over McCarthy. And the same Washington elites who deplored Boehner for not being able to simultaneously ignore and lead his own members will still be tweeting away in their just-so Capitol Hill mews or their paneled study in Great Falls. So, um, congratulations, Mr. Speaker-elect?JEB ESCALATES ATTACKS ON RUBIOUSA Today: \u201c[Jeb Bush] repeatedly, and not subtly,\u00a0attacked those rivals\u00a0\u2014 particularly fellow Floridian\u00a0Marco Rubio, the senator who\u2019s competing for the same segment of the party's primary electorate. \u2018If you\u2019ve been in\u00a0Washington, D.C., the last six years as a\u00a0United States senator, what have you done?\u2019 Bush asked the crowd at a coffee shop in\u00a0Muscatine\u00a0on Wednesday morning. \u2018You\u2019ve pushed back against\u00a0President Obama, and I admire that, but there\u2019s been no change in the culture.

But some were able to survive this environmental catastrophe. How did they do it? WaPo brings us the story of two scientists who uncovered a theory about the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d writing: \u201cThe key to survival seems to lie in food webs, the complicated interactions you probably mapped out in middle school that illustrate\u00a0how species in an ecosystem get food \u2014 and avoid getting turned into food. A stable food web can isolate a community from environmental disasters, even the loss of\u00a0some\u00a0species, and the best food webs are like a well-built building: individual bricks may\u00a0crumble or be removed, but the overall structure remains sound.\u201d Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The outline of Clinton\u2019s plan, which was provided to Reuters for review, also includes strengthening the \u2018Volcker rule\u2019 in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and imposing a new tax on high-frequency trading. Clinton's push to get tough on Wall Street comes as she is fending off a challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, her main rival for the Democratic nomination for the November 2016 election.\u201dCompletes full reversal on trade deal - Vox: \u201cAfter months of hinting she might oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u00a0Hillary Clinton made it official this week.

Maggie Hassan\u2019s announcement that she\u2019ll challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte turns the spotlight to a key race for control of the Senate. Democrats see Hassan as their best chance to oust Ayotte and pick up one of five seats they need to wrest control from Republicans. In the latest episode of \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt\u201d The Weekly Standard\u2019s Daniel Halper dissects the matchup and his top five Senate picks. Halper ranks Illinois and Wisconsin as the most competitive races this cycle, followed by Florida, Ohio, and yes, New Hampshire. While Ayotte has a slight edge in early polling, Halper points to Hassan\u2019s having won state-wide and the slightly leftward lean of Granite State voters in her favor. But Ayotte\u2019s strategy of tying Hassan to the gridlock in the state capitol may take its toll.

            "article_content": "Government spending bill, funding for Zika research await Congress Lawmakers return Tuesday to Capitol Hill for a short election-season session in which their main -- though politically daunting -- objective will be providing money to keep the government running, with outside hopes of providing funding to fight the growing, mosquito-borne Zika virus. The House and Senate will have less than four weeks to passing a temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the entire federal government operating past October 1. Democrats and Republicans, after a seven-week summer recess, are indeed eager to pass such a bill to avoid being blamed for a government shutdown like the one in 2013 -- with control of the White House and Senate at stake, as well as all 435 House seats on the ballot. However, disagreement between the parties and within the GOP will, as in years past, likely result in political wrangling until the deadline. Conservatives, and even Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, want a package that lasts until next March, which would prevent such negotiations in a so-called \u201clame duck\u201d congressional session in November with a newly-elected president and Congress. However, the consensus among leaders in both parties appears to be a temporary measure through December. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said last week that he and fellow Democrats in the chamber won\u2019t support a spending plan that runs beyond Christmas. \"We are not doing anything into next year, and every Republican should be aware of that right now,\" the Nevada Democrat said. Because the shutdown-prevention measure simply has to pass, it's a tempting target for lawmakers seeking to use it as a vehicle for their preferences. For instance, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., is pressing for emergency grants to help communities in his flood-ravaged state to recover. \"I hope we can accomplish that in September,\" Cassidy said. Lawmakers left Washington in July without resolving a dispute over money for Zika. The virus can cause severe birth defects and is linked to a host of other maladies. The Senate is making the issue its first order of business -- holding a procedural vote on Tuesday. Obama asked Congress in February for $1.9 billion in emergency money, but legislation to partially pay for his proposal collapsed in July amid various fights. Among them was a Republican provision to deny money to Puerto Rican affiliates of Planned Parenthood. Voters in Florida, where the virus is spreading from Puerto Rico, meanwhile, are blaming Republicans for the lack of additional funding and for taking such a long break amid such a major health concern. GOP leaders probably will try to keep the spending bill as free of unrelated additions as possible, especially now. If GOP leaders were to grant Cassidy's request, it would make it more difficult to say no to others, such as Democrats seeking money for fixing the lead-tainted water system of Flint, Michigan. House conservatives also are looking to press ahead with impeaching IRS Commissioner John Koskinen over the destruction of agency emails and misleading testimony on whether the tax agency, before his arrival, improperly scrutinized conservative groups seeking nonprofit status. The impeachment drive is a headache for Republicans who believe that Koskinen's conduct isn't serious enough to warrant impeachment, but who may be reluctant to support the Democratic appointee in such a politically charged environment. In a recent memo, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said lawmakers will take up legislation regarding the Obama administration's $400 million payment to Iran in January, made immediately after four U.S. prisoners were released. The payment, for undelivered arms to the shah of Iran, was made on the same day of the prisoner release, and Republicans call it \"ransom.\" The as-yet-unreleased legislation is designed to prevent a repeat, but seems like an election-season messaging effort. In addition, House Republican leaders recently conducted a half-hour conference call with their rank-and-file member about a September game plan. However, sources familiar with the call said the leaders offered few specifics on their strategy on such big issues as Zika, funding the government and the possible Koskinen impeachment effort. \u201cIt was the least informative call I\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d groused one Republican lawmaker. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also wants to advance a popular water-projects measure. But the priority is to simply adjourn the chamber to allow embattled incumbents such as Sens. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Richard Burr, R-NC, to get back home and campaign for re-election against the political headwinds created by Trump. The abbreviated session should give GOP-run committees a final pre-election chance to hold hearings on the Obama administration and other targets such as EpiPen manufacturer Mylan, N.V. That company has come under withering criticism for steep price increases for its life-saving injector, which can stop potentially fatal allergic reactions to insect bites and stings, and foods such as peanuts and eggs. House Republicans are promising hearings on Hillary Clinton's emails. FBI Director James Comey criticized Clinton's use of a homebrew email server to handle sensitive work-related emails as \"extremely careless,\" but said his agency's yearlong investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Republicans now are demanding that the Justice Department open a new investigation into whether Clinton lied during testimony last year before the House Benghazi committee. They claim the FBI note may show Clinton provided inconsistent answers to questions about her handling of emails containing classified information.

Poll after poll has steadily reinforced the negative view of the now presumptive nominees throughout the 2016 cycle, and the winner may well be determined by whichever party is most successful at turning out voters who cast ballots against their opponent, rather than who tops their ticket. So what\u2019s driving this distaste for the top choices offered to the electorate? One factor might well be called a tendency for the soon to be ticket-toppers to engage in \u201cevolutionary\u201d viewpoints.Donald Trump\u2019s changing policy positions have been well documented throughout the primary cycle, and one he acknowledges somewhat readily. In a Fox News interview in February, Trump declared: \u201cI will be changing very rapidly. I\u2019m capable of changing to anything I want to change to.\u201d And he certainly seems to be keeping to that. Over the weekend, Trump gave a vague answer that appeared to put him on opposite sides concerning guns in the classroom. When asked on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d if he believes teachers should have firearms in the classroom Trump responded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms\u201d before continuing, \u201cI\u2019m not advocating guns in classrooms\u2026 In some cases \u2014 and a lot of people have made this case \u2014 teachers should be able to have guns, trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\u201d But Trump isn\u2019t the only one switching long-held beliefs in the face of a changing electorate. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has also taken a lot of heat for her changing stances on issues, and is a large part of why she is still in a primary. In addition to calling out Clinton for personally benefitting from Wall Street while also calling for reform, challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders has also made Clinton\u2019s reversal or ambiguous stances on the Iraq war, gay marriage and lack of transparency with paid speeches, staples of his own campaign platform. And indeed Clinton has made a lot of policy changes in this cycle. Among the most recent and obvious examples is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she called the \u201cgold standard\u201d for trade in 2012, only to come out in opposition three years later when it was apparent that the pact didn\u2019t sit well with her populist base. Similar to past cycles, however, both Clinton and Trump have made claims that their changing positions aren\u2019t contradictions, but rather a result of their evolutionary thinking on issues. But for two well-known commodities, each with a clearly defined public profile, claims of evolution will be harder to sell to the voting public. Where being well known in party primaries can benefit candidates immensely, saving the time and resources usually required for candidates to introduce themselves, it can be a detriment when trying to pitch to the general election electorate. Often such changes are seen more as pandering for votes than personally held beliefs that have evolved over time. With less than six months to go and both sides looking to bring voters into their tent, Clinton and Trump will likely ratchet up the game of who can convince voters their policy changes are the most sincere.WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026The New Yorker: \u201cThe demonstration began on the afternoon of May 21, 1946, at a secret laboratory tucked into a canyon some three miles from Los Alamos, New Mexico, the birthplace of the atom bomb.

The cause was recorded as acute radiation syndrome, also known as radiation sickness.\u201dGot\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Mrs. Clinton leads the New York businessman, 46% to 43%, in a test matchup between the two likely nominees, the poll finds. That represents a much tighter margin than her 11-percentage-point lead in April and marks the first time in Journal/NBC News polling this year that her support has dropped below 50% in a contest with Mr. Trump.\u201dCan Bernie turn campaign into a liberal movement? - NYT: \u201cFar from laying the foundation to transform his campaign into a movement, Mr. Sanders is wrapped up in the race itself, sharpening his attacks on Hillary Clinton\u00a0and demanding she debate him before the June 7 primary in California. And many of his supporters are following his cue\u2026Thus far, Mr. Sanders has offered little support for a broader progressive movement\u2026Even if he does try to redirect the energy behind his candidacy into a new liberal organization, the task may not be easy\u2026His regular diatribes against the influence of big money in politics could make it awkward, if not impossible, for him to raise money from wealthy liberals.\u201dDemocrats divided on green, blue issue - Conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal magazine delves into the long-standing divide in the Democratic Party between blue-collar labor unions and environmentalists that seem to be coming to a head explaining: \u201c\u2026[T]rade unions and environmentalists have long been at odds. The real news [with the formation of a new PAC from the Democratic Party partnered with environmentalist Tom Steyer] was that much of the rest of the labor movement\u2014led by public-sector unions\u2014had agreed to work with Steyer, highlighting the ever-widening divide between blue-collar labor groups and their public-union counterparts. That split has already driven some trade unions into the arms of Republican candidates, and may account for some of the support Donald Trump gets in polls from working-class voters.\u201dWASHINGTON STATE SELECTS PRO-CRUZ DELEGATESThe Week: \u201cWashington State holds its Republican primary on Tuesday, and with one candidate left in the race, there\u2019s not too much drama about the outcome.

From The Daily Beast: \u201cThe State Department under Hillary Clinton fought hard against placing the al Qaeda-linked militant group Boko Haram on its official list of foreign terrorist organizations for two years. And now, lawmakers and former U.S. officials are saying that the decision may have hurt the American government\u2019s ability to confront the Nigerian group that shocked the world by abducting hundreds of innocent girls\u2026.On Wednesday, Clinton said that the abduction of the girls by Boko Haram was \u2018abominable, it\u2019s criminal, it\u2019s an act of terrorism and it really merits the fullest response possible, first and foremost from the government of Nigeria.\u2019 Clinton said that as Secretary of State she had numerous meetings with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and had urged the Nigerian government to do more on counterterrorism. What Clinton didn\u2019t mention was that her own State Department refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011, after the group bombed the UN headquarters in Abuja. The refusal came despite the urging of the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen.\u201d He did it - Clinton\u2019s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry designated Boko Haram as a terrorist organization in November, 2013. Hillary: No reason to continue Benghazi probe - WaPo: \u201cDuring a Q&A session held at the Ford Foundation in New York City, ABC News' Robin Roberts asked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton about the Benghazi attacks: \u2018Were you satisfied with the answers and are you content with what you know what happened?\u2019 \u2018Absolutely,\u2019 she said. \u2018I mean, of course there are a lot of reasons why, despite all of the hearings, all of the information that\u2019s been provided, some choose not to be satisfied and choose to continue to move forward. That\u2019s their choice and I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way, but they get to call the shots in Congress.\u2019\u201d [The Judge\u2019s Ruling - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks \u201cA new 'Watergate'?

Rather than attacking the individual mandate or the so-called contraceptive mandate, this lawsuit challenges a legislative maneuver used by Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada to pass the bill five years ago. The little-noticed legal battle is being waged by a conservative public interest law group, the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF). It seeks to enforce a constitutional command: \u201cAll bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\u201d Lawyers for the group charge that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was first passed by the Senate and only later approved by the House in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause. The Obama administration rejects the challenge. \u201cThe Supreme Court has never invalidated an Act of Congress on the basis of the Origination Clause, and this suit presents no reason to break new ground,\u201d Justice Department Attorney Alisa Klein wrote in her brief.\u201d On religious liberty - Allegations that ObamaCare\u2019s infringes on religious freedom will be put under the microscope yet again today.

[Watch Fox: Fox News Correspondent Shannon Bream will be at the U.S. Court of Appeals with the latest] In search of amiable atheists \u2013 In his column today, George Will dives into the recent Supreme Court ruling that upheld the practice of opening government meetings with prayers: \u201cThe United States would be a more congenial place if it had more amiable atheists who say, as one such did, that \u2018it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are 20 gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.\u2019 Some will say Thomas Jefferson was a deist, not an atheist. Atheism, however, simply involves having no theism, and deism \u2014 belief that a celestial Clockmaker wound up the universe and set it ticking \u2014 is too watery a theism to count. Any religion worthy of the name explains, enjoins and consoles; undemanding deism merely explains, and does this minimally. Deism purports to explain the universe; so does the big bang theory, which is not a religion.\u201d HEALTH NOMINEE HAS INITIAL HEARING President Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Health Department, Sylvia Burwell, will appear today before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Burwell, who currently serves as the director of the president\u2019s budget office, will answer question about the troubled health law and its implementation.

You\u2019re actually yawning because your brain is too hot. A group of researchers at the University of Vienna tested subjects in Austria and Arizona and tracked their activity, finding that that the only significant predicator of yawning was temperature: subjects were much more likely to yawn at higher temperatures. Other factors like sex, season, age, humidity, time spent outside, and hours of sleep the night before did not have a significant effect on the likelihood of a subject\u2019s yawning.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Federal authorities filed charges against three Eastern Kentucky residents this week in a massive cockfighting ring run out of the Big Blue Sportsman\u2019s Club in McDowell, Ky. Walter Dale Stumbo, 51, Sonya Stumbo, 51, and Joshua Stumbo, 25, are accused of running one of the country\u2019s largest cockfighting operations, generating an estimated $1 million in revenue\u2026.The three operators of Big Blue are \u2018distant cousins\u2019 of Democratic state House Speaker Greg Stumbo, according to the speaker\u2019s office\u2026Federal investigators also found those at the center of the cockfighting ring believed likely Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes was a silent supporter of their legalization effort. In an affidavit, U.S. Department of Agriculture agent Stan Wojtkonski says Walter Dale Stumbo addressed a crowd attending a fowl contest on April 4. According to Wojtkonski\u2019s written oath, Walter Dale Stumbo said there \u2018were people in Kentucky government that were changing the federal law.\u2019 Those individuals couldn\u2019t publicly favor such a proposal, said Walter Stumbo.

WEHBY LOOKS PAST PRIMARY, ATTACKS DEMOCRATIC SENATOROregonian: \u201cRepublican Senate candidate Monica Wehby launched a television ad Wednesday attacking Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, whom she hopes to run against this fall.

            "article_content": "This undated image provided by the Orlando Police Department shows Omar Mateen, the shooting suspect at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., Sunday, June 12, 2016. The gunman opened fire inside the crowded gay nightclub early Sunday before dying in a gunfight with SWAT officers, police said. (Orlando Police Department via AP) (The Associated Press) FORT PIERCE, Fla. \u2013 He was a body builder and a security guard, a religious man who attended the local mosque and wanted to become a police officer. Early Sunday, 29-year-old Omar Mateen opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, leaving 50 people dead and 53 wounded, police said. Mateen was the son of an Afghan immigrant who had a talk show in the United States, the nature of which was not entirely clear: A former Afghan official said the program was pro-Taliban and a former colleague said it was enthusiastically pro-American. He attended evening prayer services at the city's Islamic Center three to four times a week, most recently with his young son, said Imam Syed Shafeeq Rahman. Although he was not very social, he also showed no signs of violence, Rahman said. He said he last saw Mateen on Friday. \"When he finished prayer he would just leave,\" Rahman told The Associated Press. \"He would not socialize with anybody. He would be quiet. He would be very peaceful.\" He was also bipolar, Mateen's ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, told reporters in Boulder, Colorado. \"He was mentally unstable and mentally ill,\" Yusufiy said. Although records show the couple didn't divorce for two years after the marriage, Yusiufiy said she was actually only with Mateen for four months because he was abusive. She said he would not let her speak to her family and that family members had to come and literally pull her out of his arms. Authorities immediately began investigating whether Sunday's attack was an act of terrorism. A law enforcement official said the gunman made a 911 call from the nightclub professing allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The law enforcement official is familiar with the investigation but was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Yusufiy said she was \"devastated, shocked, started shaking and crying\" when she heard about the shooting, but she attributed the violence to Mateen's mental illness, not any alliance with terrorist groups. Rahman agreed. \"My personal opinion is that this has nothing to do with ISIS,\" he said. Seddique Mir Mateen, the father of the alleged shooter, is a life insurance salesman who started a group in 2010 called Durand Jirga, Inc., according to Qasim Tarin, a businessman from California who was a Durand Jirga board member. The name refers to the Durand line, the long disputed border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Tarin said Seddique Mir Mateen had a television show on which they discussed issues facing Afghanistan. \"It's shocking,\" he said about the shooting. \"(Omar Mateen's) father loves this country.\" Some of Seddique Mir Mateen's shows were taped and later posted on YouTube. During one episode, a sign in the background read: \"Long live the U.S.A! Long live Afghanistan. ... Afghans are the best friends to the U.S.A.\" But a former Afghan official said the \"Durand Jirga Show\" appears on Payam-e-Afghan, a California-based channel that supports ethnic solidarity with the Afghan Taliban, which are mostly Pashtun. Viewers from Pashtun communities in the United States regularly call in to the channel to espouse support for Pashtun domination of Afghanistan over the nation's minorities, including Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks, the official said. The \"Durand Jirga Show\" expresses support for the Taliban, has an anti-Pakistan slant, complains about foreigners in Afghanistan and criticizes U.S. actions there, the official said. Seddique Mir Mateen lavished praise on current Afghan President Ashraf Ghani when he appeared on the show in January 2014, but he has since denounced the Ghani government, according to the official, who said that on Saturday, Seddique Mateen appeared on the show dressed in military fatigues and used his program to criticize the current Afghan government. He also announced on that show that he would run in the next Afghan presidential election, said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting. In 2013, Omar Mateen made inflammatory comments to co-workers, and he was interviewed twice, FBI agent Ronald Hopper said. He called those interviews inconclusive. In 2014, Hopper said, officials found that Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber. He described the contact as minimal, saying it did not constitute a threat at the time. Mateen purchased at least two firearms legally within the last week or so, according to Trevor Velinor of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Mateen had no criminal record. Yusufiy said he wanted to be a police officer and had applied to the police academy. Mateen was a security guard at the G4S company, which identifies itself on its website as \"the leading global integrated security company.\" Rahman said he knew Mateen and his family since the shooter was a young boy. Playful as a child, he became more serious as an adult, Rahman said. He spoke both English and Farsi, and was into body building. He was not, as far as the imam could see, someone who would ever commit such a gruesome act of mass violence. \"It was totally unexpected,\" Rahman said. ___ Weiss reported from Charlotte, North Carolina.",

            "article_content": "Jerry Parr is credited for saving Reagan's life during assassination attempt Jerry Parr, the dedicated Secret Service agent whose quick actions helped save the life of President Ronald Reagan after a 1981 assassination attempt, died Friday at a hospice near his home in Washington. Parr was 85 and the cause of his death was congestive heart failure, according to his wife, Carolyn. Parr was in charge of Reagan's detail on March 30, 1981, when a mentally-troubled young man, John Hinckley Jr., shot the president outside the Washington Hilton. When the shots rang out, Parr pushed Reagan inside the presidential limousine and it sped towards the White House. \u201cWhen he was about probably six or seven feet from the car, I heard these shots,\u201d Parr said in a 2013 interview promoting a memoir he wrote with his wife, according to the New York Times. \u201cI sort of knew what they were, and I\u2019d been waiting for them all of my career, in a way. That\u2019s what every agent waits for, is that.\u201d In the limo, Parr took decisive control of the situation. \u201cTake off,\u201d he shouted to the driver. \u201cSomehow intuitively I just looked out the back window as we were moving , and I saw three bodies on the sidewalk,\u201d referring to White House Press Secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty who were wounded. In the limo, Parr radioed, \u201cRawhide is OK,\u201d using Reagan's Secret Service code name. Initially, he was unaware that Reagan had been shot. \u201cI thought, \u2018We\u2019re clear,\u2019 and then he started spitting up blood,\u201d Parr said in the interview, according to the Times. \u201cI looked at him and I said, \u2018I\u2019m taking you to the hospital.\u2019\u201d Parr redirected the limousine to George Washington Hospital. As it turned out, Reagan had been hit in the chest and was bleeding internally. Doctors later said that any delay would have cost the president his life. In a statement Friday, former first lady Nancy Reagan called Parr \"one of my true heroes.\" Parr was born on Sept. 16, 1930, in Birmingham, Alabama. An Air Force veteran, he joined the Secret Service in 1962. He retired in 1985 and became an ordained minister. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters.",

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Team Obama tells Dems to attack, not apologize \u2022 Every Democrat for himself \u2022 Clinton Library readies docu-dump \u2022 His message is simple: Vote for Pedro \u2022 Polly beaks the case TEAM OBAMA TELLS DEMS TO ATTACK, NOT APOLOGIZEVice President Joe Biden\u2019s message about ObamaCare to anxious Democrats gathered for the party\u2019s winter meeting in Washington: \u201cMy central message to you is look: I think we should not apologize for a single thing.\u201d Nothing? Not even a crashed Web site? Millions of cancelled policies? The \u201clie of the year\u201d award? Skyrocketing premiums? Nope. On the contrary, Biden said Democrats should instead be heralding their accomplishments, chief among which is the health law that polls show dragging the party down in midterm elections and opening wide the door for Republicans to take over the Senate. \u201cWe are too shy,\u201d Biden improbably said. \u201cWe are not talking about it enough, in my opinion.\u201d This is part of a new motif from Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Whether they believe it themselves or not, the message is that problems with the law are not real. Biden, Reid, et al are telling Democrats to blow off deepening ObamaCare concerns, including the horror stories of actual Americans, and talk about the good things. Problems? What problems? - Democrats may be better at controlling the media narrative than Republicans, but not even their usual home-field advantage with the press will let them do so this time. As Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., recently learned, the party is in desperate need of an answer to the question of how to fix what\u2019s wrong with ObamaCare. Hillary Clinton sent up a flare this week, tacitly urging her fellows to start talking about repairing the law. Team Obama, though, is focused on staying chipper and attacking the GOP. It\u2019s understandable that the president and his men would want to protect his legacy, but that\u2019s not going to feed the bulldog in red states and swing states. [Noonan: \u201cImagine that \u2013 you have real problems caused by a bad law, and Mr. Reid tells you that what you are experiencing in your own life is a lie made up by propagandists. He sounded like Lenin. There is no cholera in the new Russia.\u201d] Obama to urge Dems to play base notes - According to White House talking points provided to Politico, President Obama\u2019s remarks to the Democratic National Committee this afternoon will encourage embattled members of the blue team to attack income inequality and cast Republicans as tools of the rich and powerful. (**Koch brothers, cough, cough**) Politico says the remarks will also remind worried Democrats of the Obama organization\u2019s remaining power with the party\u2019s activist core: \u201cLeveraging the President\u2019s grassroots network that made him the first person since President Eisenhower to get 51 percent of the vote twice - all of the data and technology will be available to 2014 candidates. ... Turnout - midterms are about getting the base out and no one is better at that than President Obama.\u201d [Ed note: Why would a Democrat running for re-election in a state the president lost by, let\u2019s say 24 points, believe that the boss had anything to offer but trouble? Not a lot of OFA volunteers in Arkadelphia. This sounds like self-serving rhetoric for a national audience by the president, not an offer of practical assistance.] ObamaCare hikes could cost seniors $900 a year - The Hill: \u201cThe health insurance industry fighting proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage payments argued they will raise seniors' out-of-pocket costs next year. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade group, blasted the reductions with a report Thursday finding that beneficiaries could pay as much as $900 more in 2015 if the cuts take effect.\u201d Insurers dig for data on enrollees - WSJ: \u201c\u2026Insurers still generally have only early signals, including age and gender, on the four million people who federal regulators say have signed up so far for marketplace coverage. Those details don't paint a full picture of the insurers' potential risk and may even be misleading. That's partly because the young people who sign up for health coverage may be those more likely to have serious medical needs, insurance-industry officials say. To fill in the blanks, insurers are calling, emailing and writing letters to new enrollees, urging them to divulge information about their conditions, prescriptions and even personal habits, often through online forms called health-risk assessments that have long been used in employer-sponsored wellness programs.\u201d A side order of ObamaCare - WTVT: \u201c\u2026The Gators Dockside restaurant in Lakeland [Fla.], along with eight others in the chain, posted signs on the front doors and the restrooms. The servers carry laminated signs to the tables. And when people call in, servers have a phone script: \u2018We\u2019ve implemented a one-percent surcharge on all food and beverage purchases due to the substantial costs of Obamacare\u2019\u2026 the surcharge is covering extra accounting and HR work needed in advance. The benefits will cost much more \u2026 benefits for 250 full-time workers to cost around $500,000, far more than the $150,000 the surcharge is expected to bring in.\u201d EVERY DEMOCRAT FOR HIMSELFThe Hill: \u201cSen. Kay Hagan (N.C.), a vulnerable Democratic incumbent, plans to co-sponsor legislation raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, according to her office\u2026 Other vulnerable Democrats, however, have held back from co-sponsoring the bill, which Republicans say would cost jobs. Sens. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) have not co-sponsored it. Pryor has told reporters he opposes it. Sen. Mark Begich (D), who faces a tough race in Alaska, co-sponsored the measure in May.\u201d NEED TO KNOW: EXPLAINING THE UKRAINE CONFLICTAuthor Michael Burleigh puts the current crisis in Ukraine into perspective for The Telegraph: \u201cIn the past 48 hours, the Crimean peninsula has become a flashpoint in the wider struggle between Russia and the West over the future fate of Ukraine.

Automobile ownership stopped rising, stabilizing at about 800 cars per 1,000 people, according to the World Bank.

ROMNEY RISES ABOVE OLD CHRISTIE SLIGHTSWhile Mitt Romney would have every excuse for kicking Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., while he is down, Romney instead lent the embattled New Jerseyan a hand. Christie famously shafted Romney at the end of the 2012 election cycle, lavishing praise on president Obama but waving off the Republican nominee. A gossipy campaign book later revealed the mutual disdain between members of the Romney and Christie organizations and Christie\u2019s unhelpful approach to campaign surrogacy. But Romney pitched in Thursday, helping Christie raise $1 million for the Republican Governors Association at a Boston fundraiser. It\u2019s a crucial moment as Christie aims to show he can still make it rain as RGA chairman despite being under white-hot media scrutiny. Boston Globe has more. [Politico is touting the release this morning by pro-Democratic group American Bridge of 911 calls made during the days when Christie\u2019s underlings had closed lanes on the busy George Washington Bridge as punishment for a mayor who refused to endorse Christie\u2019s re-election bid last year.] RUBIO SEEKS KEMP\u2019S MANTLEWashington Examiner: \u201cWith his eyes on 2016, [Sen.

The move undercuts educators, parents and some 700 students at four schools, including Harlem Success 4, one of the public charter school movement\u2019s top success stories, and two set to open in the fall. While agreements at those schools were rescinded, expansion of a fourth school was also blocked. The schools were to operate rent-free in city-owned facilities under deals backed by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an ardent supporter of charter schools.\u201d POLLY BEAKS THE CASEA feathered Inspector Jacques Clouseau helped Indian police to crack open a murder mystery. The International Business Times reports on how police in the city of Agra had been baffled by the killing earlier this month of a 45-year-old woman and her dog. The case seemed to be going cold until the victim\u2019s husband got the sense that the family\u2019s parrot had something to say. Every time the man\u2019s nephew, Ashutosh , turned up, the bird would get agitated. \u201c\u2018During discussions too, whenever Ashutosh\u2019s name was mentioned, the parrot would start screeching. This raised my suspicion and I informed the police,\u2019 the victim\u2019s husband told the Times of India. Police interrogated Ashutosh and he confessed to the crime, according to the city\u2019s senior superintendent of police Shalabh Mathur.\u201d AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening.

The ruthless Vladimir Putin, like his predecessor Josef Stalin, may be a useful ally against an even greater evil, but a \u201chighly respected\u201d leader? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. But Donald Trump\u2019s admiration for and defense of Putin isn\u2019t wacky or ill-informed. It is evidence of how American politics is becoming increasingly European in nature. Trump often sounds like European \u201cfar-right\u201d leaders with his focus restoring nationalistic vigor and the dangers of foreign migrants. But never more so than with his recent Putin praise. That\u2019s a longstanding trait of Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful far right parties. They admire Putin. He helps them disrupt the political order in their home countries. And that helps him gain the upper hand in his effort to make Russia the world\u2019s dominant power. That\u2019s not to say that the admiration isn\u2019t sincere. The European nationalists and Trump admire Putin\u2019s strength, his explicit targeting of Islamism and his championing of traditional values. And it is all made possible by the failure of the European system. And never has it looked so obviously failed as of late. Aside from decades of economic stagnation and bureaucratic paralysis, the European Union is now forcing unwilling citizens to accept the arrival of millions of Syrian refugees. \u201cFar right\u201d can be confusing for Americans. It\u2019s not in the traditional American understanding of the left/liberal-right/conservative political spectrum. The European right tends to be fiscally liberal and in favor of activist government. Its defining issues have been about national sovereignty and immigration, which are issues about which American conservatives care, but formerly, many liberals did too. The idea of the American system in which there is basically a government party and an anti-government party seems just as odd to Europeans as the idea of a big-government right is to most Americans. But this is what happens to failing systems. And the Republican/Democrat duopoly has failed for sure. A secure border and functioning internal immigration controls are popular with voters of both parties. But to satisfy open-borders hardliners and to maintain the issue as a way to drive deeper the wedge between Hispanics and Republicans, Democrats have refused to act. Even to enforce existing laws. Even in the era of metastasizing Islamist militancy. Republicans, meanwhile, know that if they were to help President Obama to pass the tax overhaul he has long sought, it would be a boon to the economy and help kick off a period of economic growth. GOP leaders say they don\u2019t trust Obama enough to make a deal, but the truth is that it\u2019s that their voters who don\u2019t trust them. Any Republican caught negotiating with Obama on anything of substance would face total rebellion. In this fashion, America is evolving something more like a parliamentary system in which policy advances only occur when one party has total control of both governing branches. The problem is made worse here by the fact that those moments are harder to come by in a system of divided government. And when the tumblers all align, as they did in 2008, parties jam and cram through all of the measures their most ardent constituencies demand. The result is gridlock occasional punctuated by ideological veering and lurching and an increasingly frustrated electorate. No segment \u2013 left, right or center \u2013 gets what it wants and people increasingly lose faith in the system and its institutions. And that\u2019s the time when politicians like Trump can find purchase. If the current dysfunction becomes the norm for America, Trump will be just the first of many, increasingly successful candidates of the European mold. GRAHAM OUTNYT: \u201cSenator Lindsey Graham suspended his presidential campaign on Monday, saying that he has concluded \u201cthis is not my time\u201d despite making a difference in the race. The South Carolina Republican made the comments in a YouTube video. \u2018Since launching my campaign for president on June 1, I have offered a path to saving the American dream and working together on bold solutions to solve big problems,\u2019 said Mr. Graham, one of the most hawkish foreign policy voices in the race who has nonetheless been stuck in the low single digits in polls.\u201d 2016 GOP POWER INDEX:\u00a0JEB AGAIN?It\u2019s bad to be without a clear path to the nomination. But, as a political saying goes, it can be \u201cliberating.\u201d Like his stablemate John Kasich, Jeb Bush is devoting himself almost exclusively to hammering away at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Hitting the guy at the top of the polls has always been a good way for back-of-the-pack candidates to get attention. While that\u2019s true this time, there\u2019s the added motivation that Bush and others believe that if Trump is toppled, the race will be wholly remade. The last shall be made first, etc. Bush is succeeding with the former. By talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Bush has gotten a boost in coverage from a Trumpcentric political press. And, Bush has seemed relieved to finally be able to say that he thinks Trump is \u201ca jerk.\u201d But will this help Bush more or Trump more? Given the fact that so few are willing to tackle Trump head-on and that Power Index frontrunner Ted Cruz is Trump\u2019s ablest enabler, Bush has little choice but to weaponize his candidacy. But at the same time, Bush is one of the least popular figures in his party and has always made the best foil for Trump. In the long run, a Bush resurgence most likely helps Trump. But in the short term, Bush is playing the card he has left. And given the devastating efficiency in which Cruz and Rubio are slashing each other to ribbons right now, every other non-Trump has a bit more reason to hope that the front of the pack might crack open. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush\u00a0[+1]; 5)\u00a0Carly Fiorina\u00a0[-1]; 6) Chris Christie On the radar -\u00a0Ben Carson,\u00a0John Kasich,\u00a0Rand Paul and\u00a0Mike Huckabee[Watch Fox: Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

History.com: \u201cThe movie also made a star out of Benjamin Braddock\u2019s graduation present: a bright-red Alfa Romeo Duetto Spider. Alfa Romeo had been making racecars for decades\u2026But the 1967 Duetto Spider, a two-seat convertible roadster, was a real beauty: It had a sharp nose and a rounded, tapered rear end, glass-covered headlights, and what designers called a \u2018classic scallop\u2019 running down the side. It handled well, could go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 10 seconds, and got 23 miles per gallon of gas. Though the Duetto Spider was a great car and a pop-culture icon, Americans still weren\u2019t interested in buying it. The model\u2014with new names like the Spider Veloce, the Quadrifoglio and even the Graduate\u2014stayed on the market until 1994, without much sales success.\u201d Got\u00a0a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Even if she\u2019s not lucky enough to draw him in a head-to-head matchup, Clinton will work to make her opponent little more than Trump-lite. That\u2019s what Justin Barasky of the Clinton-backing powerhouse super PAC Priorities USA sees ahead once she\u2019s head to head with the Republican nominee, whoever it may be. In the latest edition of Power Play, Barasky tells Chris Stirewalt that Republicans are \u201cpainting themselves\u201d as Trump-like and the result will be terrifying to key groups of the Obama coalition that Clinton is looking to reconstitute and ride to the White House. WATCH HERE. Tale of the tape - David Drucker says Dems aren\u2019t scared of Trump and the data backs them up: \u201cIn the latest\u00a0Fox News poll, conducted Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton was losing to Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, 45 percent to 43 percent, and was tied with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, at 45 percent each. But she beat Trump like a drum, 49 percent to 38 percent, and came close to the important 50 percent mark\u2026 \u201cClinton beat Trump among women by 26 points and only trailed him by 5 points among men. She beat him among voters with college degrees and without; she demolished him with black voters and was only 5 points behind in the battle for whites. Clinton trailed Trump by a single point among independents. But she picked up 15 percent of Republicans, holding Trump to just 72 percent among voters in his own party.\u201d Clinton campaign fudges Trump in ISIS videos claim - Yahoo: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s communications director defended her candidate\u2019s claim that ISIS is using videos of Donald Trump\u00a0to recruit members, but could not point to specific evidence of this happening\u2026 \u2018She\u2019s not referring to a specific video, but he is being used in social media by ISIS as propaganda,\u2019 [Jennifer Palmieri told ABC News.]\u201d Debate not all roses for Hillary - Fox New contributor Doug Schoen called Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate \u201cHillary\u2019s night\u201d but also pointed to Clinton\u2019s vulnerability on foreign policy: \u201cMartin O\u2019Malley] noted how Ambassador Chris Stevens was not provided the proper support and tools to help Libya transition into a thriving democracy \u2013 a clear reminder of his untimely death. No doubt this foreshadows what will be in all likelihood a major line of attack from the Republicans and stands to really hurt her going forward.\u201d Obama blames media for stoking ISIS fears - The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama said in an [NPR] interview broadcast early Monday that he understands why Americans are worried about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), adding that it is important \u2018to keep things in perspective.\u2019 Obama blamed the media in part, for fears, saying that in the past month, \u2018all you have been seeing, all you have been hearing about is these guys with masks or black flags who are potentially coming to get you.\u2019\u201d ALWAYS SIGNAL BEFORE EXECUTING YOUR TURNThe Telegraph: \u201cThe government in the Netherlands has clarified that it is legal for driving instructors to offer lessons in return for sex, as long as the students are over the age of 18. However, it is illegal to offer sex in return for lessons. Transport minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen and Justice minister Ard van der Steur addressed the issue in response to a question tabled in parliament by Gert-Jan Segers of the socially conservative Christian Union party, noting that, although 'undesirable', offering driving lessons with sex as payment is not illegal. In a letter to parliament the ministers said: \u2018It\u2019s not about offering sexual activities for remuneration, but offering a driving lesson. It is important that the initiative lies with the driving instructor, and focuses on offering a driving lesson, with the payment provided in sexual acts. When a sexual act offered in lieu of financial payment, that is prostitution.\u2019\u201d Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.

Sign up\u00a0here.** On the roster: Independents Day: Trump needs nonpartisan landslide - Ohio voter purge gets green light - Audible: Canadian cross check - Dem election commissioners blocked in bid to punish Fox News - Nothing basic about his cable packageINDEPENDENTS DAY: TRUMP NEEDS NONPARTISAN LANDSLIDEThere are more Democrats in America than there are Republicans. And that\u2019s a longstanding fact. It was a difference of 6 points in the last cycle and will probably be at least that much this time. But as partisan identification has slipped under the weight of cultural and geographical dislocation, both parties have shrunk. The rise of the independents has been one of the dominant political stories of this generation. Less than a quarter of the electorate 20 years ago, this year independents may approach one third of the total vote. Put simply, either party needs lots of independent voters to win, but Republicans need more. The latest Fox News poll shows de facto Republican nominee Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by 6 points overall. Much of that can be attributed to losses among his fellow Republicans, with whom he is down 5 points since early June to an abysmal 74 percent of the GOP vote while Clinton edged up 4 points with Democrats to 83 percent of the blue team vote. But Trump\u2019s problem with Republicans wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if he were getting crossover support from so-called \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d and, most importantly, supermajority support with independents. Trump is winning with independent voters in the Fox News poll with 39 percent to Clinton\u2019s 31 percent. But it\u2019s not nearly enough. First, a word about independents: They are not more moderate than Republicans or Democrats, they\u2019re just not members of either party. Bernie Sanders is an independent and so too is George Will. Not exactly a lot of commonality there\u2026 Think of independents existing in a parallel ideological spectrum to the traditional Democrat-Republican, left-right spectrum. Many independents hold seemingly incongruent ideological views \u2013 pro-choice, gun rights backers, or environmentalist, tax cutters \u2013 but never think of independents as synonymous with \u201cmoderate.\u201d In order to win, Trump will need at least 55 percent of the independent vote. Mitt Romney did 50 percent with independents in 2012 while taking 93 percent of the GOP vote. There will be more independents and Trump will have fewer Republicans than Romney did. The pressure is on for Trump with the indys. Trump can point to online polls and polls that can\u2019t call cell phones that show him doing better, like the Rasmussen Reports survey out today, but in the universe of sound polling, the trend is clear: Trump is running behind Clinton and faring worse at this point than Romney did four years ago. The Fox News poll shows 40 percent so far backing neither Trump nor Clinton. Trump will need more than half of these voters to break his way for this race to be competitive in the fall. Trump is doing only about as well so far with independents as Bob Dole did in in 1996, and the electorate will be less Republican and more independent this year, perhaps by wide margins. Instead of trying to dun his party into submission, Trump needs to keep his focus on independent voters and, where possible, crossover Democrats. TIME OUT D.W.

But such declarations are at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s long history as a businessman, in which he has been heavily \u2014 and proudly \u2014 reliant on foreign labor in the name of putting profits, rather than America, first.

This week\u2019s installment of The Edge from the New Analytics Company repeats a refrain from the samples following the previous debates. Sen Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was the winner in terms of whose media profile increased the most following the debate. Rubio saw the biggest increase in media mentions following the previous two debates, and this time was no different. The only two candidates who saw their share of the discussion shrink were Trump and Carson. Others who prospered, at least in terms of media mentions post-debate, were former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J. Compare that to last week when Donald Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States so dominated the media discussion that he had 25 times more media mentions than the rest of the field combined. But the New Year will bring a new pace for debates, with five debates set for January and February, the same number held so far. While coverage does not guarantee success with voters, it is the essential element for success. And debates will help other candidates level the field against Trump. The Edge \u201cscrubs\u201d television, radio, print, internet and social media for mentions of the 2016 candidates.

So news that she will be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church comes no surprise. What may be surprising, however, is that a woman of seemingly unshakable faith had doubts about her ability to fulfill what she felt was her calling. As she once described: \u201cThe change was extremely difficult. In the convent I had lived without knowing what difficulties were. I had lacked nothing. Now everything was different. I slept where I happened to be, on the ground, often in hovels infested by rats. I ate what the people I was serving ate, and only when there was a little food.\u201d Mother Teresa contemplated leaving Calcutta and returning to a convent life, but her faith in her mission compelled her to continue on, as she describes: \u201cAmong the poorest of the poor of Calcutta, I loved Jesus. When I love like that, I don\u2019t feel suffering or fatigue.\u201d Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The 316-113 vote exceeded expectations and sent the legislation to the Senate for action later Friday. Senators planned to vote on the spending measure in combination with a year-end tax plan that would give breaks to working families and a wide variety of business interests. With the series of votes, lawmakers were on track to conclude a surprisingly productive, bipartisan burst of late-session legislation in a divided Congress. Obama has promised to sign the legislation, which includes many of the spending increases he has demanded all year.

            "article_content": "Experts weigh in Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wanted a strong debate performance Sunday night against Democrat rival Hillary Clinton to reignite his campaign, but the emergence of a damaging audiotape this week is adding to his now uphill challenge. Trump was already struggling through a tough couple of weeks, after the first debate with Clinton, in which she argued Trump was verbally abusive to a 1996 Miss Universe winner. And Trump appeared to make matters worse with a flurry of pre-dawn tweets that attempted to further assail the woman's character. On Friday, the 2005 audiotape and an accompanying video captured Trump making lewd comments about women. \u201cI really don\u2019t know how he can dig out of this,\u201d Douglas Smith, a Democratic strategist and partner at Kent Strategies, said Saturday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s News Headquarters.\u201d Following their Sept. 26 debate, Clinton leads Trump -- a first-time candidate, wealth businessman and former reality TV star -- by 4.6 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics national polls average. The nominees' second debate is a town hall-style event Sunday night hosted by CNN at Washington University, in St. Louis, Mo. \u201cIf he could make the degree of difficulty go up at a town hall-style debate, which is already difficult \u2026 he just did,\u201d Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan also said on \u201cAmerica\u2019s News Headquarters.\u201d Sheridan, who was House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s spokesman when the Wisconsin Republican was the 2012 GOP vice-presidential nominee, further argued that Trump has never participated in a town hall-style debate, which he says are more difficult than other debate formats. He also argued the tape has overshadowed WikiLeaks on Friday releasing a trove of purportedly hacked Clinton campaign emails that include the candidate saying during a Wall Street speech that she has become \u201cfar removed\u201d from middle-class life and seemed to suggest support for open U.S. borders. \u201cShe\u2019s also going to have to answer for that,\u201d Sheridan said. The 2005 audio tape, and an accompanying video tape, released by The Washington Post and NBC on Friday, recorded a conversation between Trump and \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush in which Trump described an attempt to have sex with a married woman. Trump also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. Trump has apologized twice, including in a video statement in which he said: \u201cI said it, I was wrong and I apologize.\u201d However, amid fellow party members\u2019 admonishments and calls for him to end his campaign, Trump repeatedly said Saturday in newspaper interviews and on Twitter that he\u2019ll \u201cnever drop out of the race.\u201d Beyond the WikiLeaks release and the tape scandal, Clinton and Trump, respectively, will have challenges talking about policy and politics in the town hall format, if past is indeed prologue. President Bush conspicuously checked his watch. Al Gore got too close for comfort. Mitt Romney strode across stage to confront President Barack Obama face to face. On Sunday night, Clinton and Trump also will be fielding questions from undecided voters seated nearby with the added dose of unpredictability associated with the candidates being allowed to move around the stage, putting them in unusually close proximity. \"There's a lot more interaction, physical interaction,\" says Judd Gregg, the former New Hampshire senator who helped President George W. Bush prepare for debates. AP (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) He said a candidate who is too aggressive in a town hall, either with the voters or a rival, \"can come across looking really chippy, not looking presidential.\" After an uneven showing in his first debate, Trump's candidacy may rise or fall on his ability to avoid falling into that trap. Beyond the Miss Universe issue, which emerged late in the debate, Trump also repeatedly interrupted Clinton in their opening contest and grew defensive as she challenged his business record. He has reportedly reviewed video of the debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not let Clinton attacks get under his skin in the second of three contests. The final debate is Oct. 19 and will be hosted by the Fox News Channel at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Both candidates are off the campaign trail Saturday to prepare for Sunday\u2019s contest. Trump, who prefers drawing big crowds to rallies, indeed has done only sporadic town halls and has rarely been challenged by voters face to face, except when his rallies are interrupted by protesters. In a nod to the challenge posed by Sunday's format, he agreed to advisers' suggestion that he get in some practice at a real town hall Thursday night in New Hampshire -- but then publicly pushed back on the idea that he needed to rehearse. \"This isn't practice, this has nothing to do with Sunday -- this isn't practice, we just wanted to be here,\" Trump told a small, invitation-only crowd in Sandown. He was joined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who excelled at the town hall format during his failed presidential run and is helping coach Trump. While the event had some of the trappings of what Trump will face Sunday, including a two-minute countdown clock on answers, it was hardly a rigorous rehearsal. Trump didn't actually interact with the audience, instead only conversing with a friendly moderator who read the questions -- which were nearly all softballs. Presidential town hall debates, meanwhile, are typically serious affairs and lack the liveliness of campaign trail events. Clinton is far more practiced in the format and prefers smaller events with more direct voter engagement, as Smith argued Saturday. Aides said she won't shy away from raising recent revelations about Trump's tax history or reminding voters of his pre-dawn Twitter attacks on a Miss Universe winner, but will aim to keep her focus more on the voters sitting on stage. Seeking to raise the bar for the businessman, Clinton advisers said they do expect Trump to be more measured than in the last debate. \"But even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don't think he'll get a second chance to make a first impression,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said of the town hall format. The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election and featured incumbent President George H.W. Bush and challenger Bill Clinton, along with third-party candidate Ross Perot. As a voter stood to ask Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch -- a fleeting moment but one that seemed to reinforce criticism that he didn't have empathy for Americans. The wild card in the town hall debate is the physical choreography on stage. Candidates are seated but with no lectern or table to hide behind. They're given hand-held microphones and are free to roam the stage to answer questions or challenge each other. Four years ago, Obama and Romney circled each other on stage throughout the night. During one particularly heated exchange, Romney kept moving toward the standing president until they were arguing with just a few feet between them. During the 2000 election, George W. Bush was answering a question on leadership when Vice President Gore stood up from his chair and walked unnaturally close to his Republican rival. Bush turned to Gore, and with a slightly puzzled look on his face, gave him a nod and smile. The audience broke into laughter. That seemingly natural Bush reaction? It was well-rehearsed, according to Gregg, who played the role of Gore in Bush's debate prep. Gregg said he'd expected Gore would try to intimidate the Texas governor, so he practiced walking close to him during their mock debates. \"His reaction was the exact same with Al Gore as it was with me -- to look at me with a bemused smile and move on to his answer,\" Gregg said. \"We practiced.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, speaks at the DNC. In every election cycle since Jimmy Carter introduced \"born again\" into the political lexicon, a politician's faith has been an object of curiosity and contention. At an appearance in Iowa in January, Hillary Clinton responded to a question about her faith, saying she is a Christian and a Methodist and that to her \"the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself.\" She is correct, but the challenge comes in how that commandment and Scripture are applied in the political arena. The same Scripture in which Hillary Clinton says she believes also teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman and that human life begins at conception. Hillary Clinton is pro-choice and favors same-sex marriage and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funds being used for abortion. This brings us to Tuesday's debate between the two candidates for vice president. Gov. Mike Pence (R-IN) is a pro-life evangelical Christian who believes in traditional marriage. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA.) is a Roman Catholic who takes the opposite view. Most evangelicals believe \"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness...\" (2 Timothy 3:16). Many Roman Catholics accept the authority of Scripture, but also place tradition and the teachings of the Pope on par with it. Why does this matter? If candidates for high office claim inspiration, even instruction, from an Authority higher than themselves, they should be asked about it. If they deviate from their faith's teachings, they should be required to explain. Tim Kaine often refers to his Catholic faith and to what he calls \"a turning point in my life,\" which came in 1980 while on a \"mission trip\" to Honduras. Left out of his narrative is the liberation theology taught by radical Catholic priests in the region at the time, a theology which closely tracked with Marxists committed to the violent overthrow of Latin American governments. We have been down this road before with Catholic politicians, including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the late Gov. Mario Cuomo, all of whom have taken political positions diametrically opposed to Catholic teaching. About his departure from Catholic instruction and statements from the current and previous popes, especially on social issues, Kaine has said: \"I think it's going to change. ... Who am I to challenge God for the beautiful diversity of the human family? I think we're supposed to celebrate it, not challenge it.\" That attitude might legitimize a multitude of sins. Writing about church teachings on same-sex marriage, Maureen Ferguson of The Catholic Association says, \"If Sen. Kaine wants to go beyond politics to opine on the theology of the Catholic Church, he should at least consult Pope Francis' most recent exhortation, Amoris Laetitia, in which Francis states, 'There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God's plan for marriage and family.'\" The same can be said of consistent Catholic teaching about human life. In another statement from the Catholic Association, Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie writes: \"Senator Kaine's attempt to cloak his political pandering as theological speculation exposes the Clinton campaign's profoundly anti-Catholic ideological agenda. Hillary Clinton has previously stated that pro-life people of faith will simply have to change their religious views. ... Now her running mate suggests the Church needs to do the same on the issue of marriage and family...\" These issues of faith and public policy should be raised during the one vice presidential debate Tuesday night.",

Liberal Democrats are saying the president should have just leveled with voters about the need to destroy the policies in order to drive consumers into ObamaCare. But the technological disaster of the Web site has made it impossible for the president to tell anxious policyholders that it\u2019s for their own good. How bad is it? In 2012 exit polls, Obama led with women voters by 11 points. In the WaPo poll, it\u2019s one point.

On this date 150 years ago in a Pennsylvania field Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address. The speech was panned by critics for its brevity and ordinary language.

If you sneeze, he calls up and announces, 'Isn't that a terrible thing?' So look, I don't want his support, I don't care about his support.\" In a series of tweets Tuesday morning, Trump referred to Ryan as \"our very weak and ineffective leader\" and accused the Speaker of \"disloyalty.\" For his part, Ryan told lawmakers on the conference call that he would no longer defend or campaign with Trump and said he would focus his efforts on helping Republicans hold the House this fall. However, unlike other top GOP figures, Ryan did not specifically withdraw his endorsement of Trump. Trump also told O'Reilly that he should not have endorsed Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. in the veteran senator's August primary. McCain withdrew his endorsement of Trump after the recording of the real estate mogul emerged. \"He was desperate to get my endorsement,\" Trump said. \"I gave him the endorsement ... and frankly, he ran against a very good woman [former state Sen. Kelli Ward], I feel very badly I gave the endorsement.\" Trump, who also described McCain as having \"probably the dirtiest mouth in all the Senate,\" added that he \"wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with these people, including Ryan. Especially Ryan.\" The billionaire also downplayed the comments themselves, which he uttered during a conversation with then-\"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush in 2005 prior to a guest appearance on \"Days of Our Lives.\" As he did during Sunday's debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump described the remarks as \"locker room talk.\" \"Most people have heard it before,\" Trump said, \"and I've had women come up to me and say, 'Boy, I've heard that and I've heard a lot worse than that over my life.' \"And if that's why i'm going to lose an election to get rid of ISIS and to create strong borders and rebuild our military and do all the things we're gonna do ... if that's what it's gonna take to lose an election, that would be pretty sad.\"",

An amazing 44 percent of all respondents said they didn\u2019t often feel proud to be American. Only 28 percent said that America was the greatest nation on earth. So how do you unite people to save the country if they\u2019re not invested in its success? And how do you reverse a belief that is searing in its self-fulfillment? We talk a lot in America about economic, demographic and other \u201ctipping points,\u201d but the patriotism gap is arguably the most important of all. Liberals care less - Pew divided their sample into different categories across the left-right political spectrum. When asked if respondents \u201coften feel proud to be American,\u201d a majority of strong liberals, 60 percent, said no. The only group that solidly agreed with the statement was conservatives, ranging from 72 percent to 81 percent.\u00a0 About half of the respondents in the middle of the spectrum \u2013 essentially libertarians to socially conservative fiscal liberals \u2013 said they were proud to be American. Taking exception with exceptionalism - When asked if the United States ranks above other countries, fewer than three in 10 overall said the U.S \u201cstands above all other counties\u201d while 58 percent said the U.S. \u201cis one of the greatest countries, along with some others.\u201d And 12 percent of respondents definitively said \u201cthere are other countries that are better than the U.S.\u201d When broken down into groups, conservatives are tops on exceptionalism at 46 percent. Close behind are members of the ethnically diverse ranks of socially conservative, fiscally liberal Americans who formerly made up the Democratic base before the Obama era at 39 percent Strong liberals and libertarian-leaning young adults were least likely to see America as the greatest, 11 percent and 16 percent respectively. And 19 percent of strong liberals, the leader in this ranking, said other countries were better. Why it matters - If the individuals in a disagreement don\u2019t at least agree that they are trying to preserve a common endeavor, spirited debate turns into acrimony. Splitsville, man. If America is just another country with a soccer team, the extraordinary doses of patriotic grace, forbearance and sacrifice that have been required of citizens since our country\u2019s founding don\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not that the 44 percent who aren\u2019t proud are all moving to Costa Rica, it\u2019s that they feel less obliged to do the hard work necessary to make a system this demanding work. Politicians and public figures who intentionally exploit and deepen divisions and resentments are doing more than just creating gridlock, they\u2019re undercutting the very idea that has lit the lamp of America\u2019s greatness for nearly three centuries.

Although slightly more than half of his appearances were in the United States, the majority of his speaking income, $56.3 million, came from foreign speeches, many of them in China, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom, the Post review found.

Jeb Bush of Florida is planning to headline a fundraiser for at least four Republican Senate candidates, seeking to make an impact on the 2014 election while exploring the possibility of his own presidential bid in 2016. The fundraiser is scheduled for Sept. 23 in Tampa, Fla. The chosen candidates are crucial to a Republican takeover of the Senate, including Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Monica Wehby in Oregon and Tom Cotton in Arkansas. The event may also benefit the winner of the Aug. 26 Republican primary in Alaska. Allies of Mr. Bush said an event of this magnitude will test the organizational skills of his team and allow him to connect with donors who could form the nucleus of his presidential fundraising network.\u201dSCOTT WALKER \u2018WAS NOT THE TARGET OF THE INVESTIGATION\u2019Wisconsin State Journal: \u201cGov. Scott Walker[, R-Wis.] is not a target of the John Doe investigation into possibly illegal campaign finance coordination during the 2011 and 2012 recall elections, an attorney for the special prosecutor overseeing the probe said Thursday. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Walker has been exonerated in the eyes of prosecutors, and he could continue to be a subject of the investigation if it is allowed to continue, legal experts said Thursday. Randall Crocker, the lawyer for special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, said that at the time the investigation was halted in early May, \u2018Governor Walker was not a target of the investigation. At no time has he been served with a subpoena.\u2019\u201dFIRST IN FOX NEWS FIRST: CROSSROADS HITS GRIMES ON WARREN VISITAhead of a Sunday Kentucky campaign stop by Sen.

Grimes, who has tried to distance herself from the carbon controversy, is trying to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in November. The new ad opens with multiple comments from Warren saying, \u201cI applaud President Obama\u2026 The EPA proposal is a powerful step.\u201d The ad concludes saying, \u201cElizabeth Warren: Campaigning for Obama\u2019s Liberal Agenda\u2026Now campaigning for Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201d MCDANIEL\u2019S ELECTION INQUEST CONTINUESMississippi state Sen.

So we\u2019re talking about widespread irregularities of ineligible voters that should not have been there in the first place.\u201d McDaniel lost his primary runoff to Cochran by some 6,000 votes. Asked whether he would support Cochran in November \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d McDaniel said he hadn\u2019t made up his mind.

The poll, conducted by GOP pollster Wilson Perkins Allen and sent to top Perdue supporters, shows him leading Kingston by 45 percent-44 percent\u2026Internal polls should always be viewed skeptically, and this poll seems designed to show that Perdue is still well-positioned for a win after a handful of public polls and an internal one from Kingston found the congressman with a lead in the race.\u201d PICK SIXThe status quo will change dramatically in Washington if Republicans are able to gain an additional six Senate seats.

This viewing data will allow SMG to match specific voter segments with households from FourthWall Media\u2019s household level television viewing data. This data will better identify the viewing habits of each desired political segment, leading to more efficient advertising spending and better targeted creative. \u2018What our relationship with FourthWall Media allows is access to a large stream of near real time set top box data,\u2019 said Kyle Roberts, CEO, Smart Media Group.\u00a0 \u2018This data stream can be matched with individual voter information allowing\u00a0 Smart Media to know what specific programs voters prefer to view and when.\u2019\u201dTALK ABOUT AN EXPERT WITNESS(Florida) Sun Sentinel: \u201cThe last time that Jeffrey Groover gave sworn testimony, he got a day pass from federal prison to lecture a U.S. Senate committee on how to stop convicted identity thieves like him from committing crimes. But the South Florida man apparently paid no heed to his own crime prevention tips that he shared with politicians on Capitol Hill in 2004. Groover testified again this week \u2013 this time in his own defense in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, trying to persuade jurors to find him not guilty of stealing identities and committing bank fraud in Broward and Palm Beach counties. The jurors obviously found his bizarre testimony less compelling than the senators once did \u2014 they took just 40 minutes Wednesday to find him guilty of all six federal charges.\u201dAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\u201cThis is a stinging rebuke to [President Obama\u2019s] overreach in general and I think it will have implications for other cases. Remember, the argument Democrats have made up till now with [House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s] lawsuit that is going to challenge overreach: \u2018This is simply a partisan attack on the president.\u2019 But the court is saying this is a constitutional travesty what happened in this case.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Watch here.

Apparently believing that commitment and sincerity can be measured in decibels, Hillary Clinton turned up the volume in Sunday night\u2019s showdown with rival Bernie Sanders. She also matched her louder volume with sharper attacks on Sanders. But the Vermont socialist came ready to fight, counterpunching and even landing a few blows. You\u2019d have to give him the win, if only narrowly, on the grounds that not only did he dominate the discussion but that she was strangely treating him as the frontrunner. Or maybe it was just that she was trying to fight on Sanders\u2019 turf. He\u2019s been shouting since before it was cool. Clinton seems to be abandoning the mantra of her campaign \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a fighter\u201d \u2013 for an effort to approximate the anger that candidates on both sides of the aisle have been trying, with varying degrees of success, to ape. But it\u2019s hard to believe that Clinton is angry, or at least that she is angry about something other than the fact that her party seems to delight in spurning her. Life has been very good to the Clintons over the past 16 years, to say the least. Except for the politics part. Clinton and her crew could assuage themselves after her 2008 primary loss that they were victims of history \u2013 the sudden ascendance of a gifted, African-American candidate was more of a force of nature than a reflection of her political weakness. But what if she were struggling with a guy who was deeply white and five years older than her? What if the guy this time was not a gifted speechmaker but one who gave shout-y campaign boilerplate in a Brooklyn honk? What if he had been honking around Washington for 25 years and was generally written off as a crank? It has apparently all been enough to rattle Clinton, whose onetime indulgence of Sanders has turned into attacks and who seems to be on the verge of yet another campaign reboot. Tied or trailing Sanders in the first two nominating contests, it\u2019s hard to say she\u2019s wrong. A huge lead in South Carolina and what, last month at least, was a wide advantage in Nevada still suggest that Clinton isn\u2019t yet in danger of being toppled a second time \u2013 and that her strategy of aggressively pursuing black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition is paying off. But would those leads look so stout if Clinton were to lose the first two contests? Certainly not. Just ask South Carolina Democratic powerbroker Rep. Jim Clyburn, who told the NYT, \u201cThe reality is, if Mrs. Clinton loses Iowa and New Hampshire, that could create new and real problems for her here.\u201d As of now, you can still call Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee, but we are now seeing a scenario in which she might have to waste several damaging months on a fight that will harm her general election chances and distract public attention from the bazooka blasts on the GOP side.

Montesquieu led something of a dissipated life as a young nobleman at court in Paris, but became increasingly serious about his political writing and philosophizing. A visit to England would open his mind further and give birth to a riot of political thought. But perhaps chief among his insights was the value of divided government.\u00a0Britannica explains: \u201cDividing\u00a0political authority\u00a0into the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, [Montesquieu] asserted that, in the state that most effectively promotes liberty, these three powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies, acting independently\u2026 Though its accuracy has in more recent times been disputed, in its own century it was admired and held authoritative, even in England; it inspired the\u00a0Declaration of the Rights of Man\u00a0and the\u00a0Constitution of the United States.\u201d Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

One might assume that establishment support would flow to Cruz, a lifelong Republican and sitting senator. Not necessarily, says Molly Ball in a dispatch from the trail: \u201cSome Republicans who have moved through the stages of grief from denial to bargaining, if not yet acceptance, have begun to suggest that Trump might be preferable to Cruz. Trump is, if you squint, a sort of moderate Republican; he\u2019s a dealmaker; and surely he\u2019s craven enough to reverse his most alienating positions and say what people want to hear if he gets to the general election. Cruz, on the other hand, is an ideologue. The scariest prospect of all is that he really means what he says, and might, if elected, take it upon himself to actually upend the establishment\u2019s cherished status quo.\u201d GOP POWER INDEX: CHRISTIE FADESNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has painted himself a straight-talker since he was elected to the governorship in 2009, and has made it a cornerstone of his presidential campaign\u2019s \u201cTelling It Like It Is\u201d slogan. Town hall videos of his early days as governor hit the Internet, and people around the country were drawn to this frank, no nonsense guy. When he took on the teacher\u2019s unions, and was asked about his own children\u2019s private education, he responded, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d which resonated with people tired of hearing exhaustive explanations from politicians. But his straight-talk attitude hasn\u2019t quite delivered on is message of late. As Christie tries to find a path from the middle of the pack in New Hampshire to national viability, he\u2019s come under increasing scrutiny. And voters are hearing a lot more run-on sentences than they were used to from Christie. In the Fox Business Network Debate last week, Christie claimed that he never supported Justice Sonya Sotomayor\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, but his statement at the time reads: \u201cI support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bi-partisan support.\u201d It\u2019s been the same of gun control. Although he has vetoed limits on clip-size and photo IDs for gun owners, Christie\u2019s record on guns is scattered. National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty points out that in a 1993 race for New Jersey Senate, Christie issued a statement asserting that\u00a0\u201cwe already have too many firearms in our communities. The issue which has energized me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal New Jersey\u2019s ban on assault weapons. In today\u2019s society, no one needs a semi-automatic assault weapon.\u201d In November 2015, Christie told Bret Baier in an interview for \u201cSpecial Report\u201d that he didn\u2019t remember making that statement. 1)\u00a0Ted Cruz; 2)\u00a0Marco Rubio; 3)\u00a0Donald Trump; 4)\u00a0Jeb Bush; 5)\u00a0John Kasich [+1]; 6)\u00a0Chris Christie [-1] On the radar - Carly Fiorina,\u00a0Ben Carson\u00a0and\u00a0Rand Paul[Watch Fox:\u00a0Chris\u00a0Stirewalt\u00a0joins \u201cThe Real Story with\u00a0Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.] What would you say? -\u00a0Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

Houck headed to Atlanta to join the movement and was surprised at being picked up by Dr. King and his wife Coretta Scott King, with the reverend at the wheel. After lunch that day, she asked Houck if he might drive the children to school the following day: \u201c[J]ust like that, Houck began his stint as the Kings' family driver. For nine months, Houck drove Martin Luther King Jr. around Atlanta, though King liked to drive himself often, too. \u2018But he was a terrible driver,\u2019 Houck says. \u2018And he turned WAOK radio in Atlanta on full blast.\u2019 That wasn't the only puzzle presented to Houck. There were also the cigarettes. \u2018Dr. King was a chain smoker, all right? But Coretta did not like the cigarettes,\u2019 Houck says. \u2018So when we would come back to the house, first thing Coretta would do, she would check Dr. King's pockets. So he started giving me his cigarettes.\u2019 In the midst of the struggle, Houck found himself a co-conspirator in King\u2019s vice. And with good reason: Houck idolized the reverend for his virtues.\u201d Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.",

Since Klain, who rose to fame as the chief Democratic lawyer in the 2000 Florida recount, is a political fixer and not an expert in epidemiology or public safety, we can assume that President Obama sees a political problem that needs to be fixed. The White House says that it is possible and perhaps \u201clikely\u201d that more Americans will be diagnosed with the virus, which we can assume means that more cases are almost certainly out there. But we are told that because the government has learned from its mistakes is now being aggressive with quarantines (or not), everything will be okay. The effort to get Americans to calm down and relax about the disease that dissolves human organs and carries a 70 percent mortality rate has somehow not worked out. So now, in response to all the alarm, the administration is trying to match the public tone. And as was the case two months ago on Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria, the only circumstance that seems to be different is public opinion. [\u201cA CBS News Poll has found that positive assessment of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declined dramatically, with only 37 percent of respondents saying the CDC is doing an excellent or good job -- down from 60 percent in a May 2013 Gallup poll.\u201d]Czared or Shinsekied? \u2013 The selection of Klain as \u201cEbola czar\u201d (aside from squandering what might have been the best alt-rock band name ever) is in part to get a handle on the bureaucracy in the person of a party loyalist, but mostly window dressing. The government already has someone whom might be called an Ebola czar. It has, in fact, no shortage of people who are in positions to take the lead role. The real problem here is political: A lack of confidence in the existing team. The appointment of a \u201cczar\u201d is a way to put a new face on outreach, and an acknowledgement of the missteps by the administration. It spares a symbolic sacking of the frustrated and mistrusted Centers for Disease Control boss Dr. Thomas Frieden. Better to be czared than Shinsekied, one supposes. [Weekly Standard: \u201cNorth Carolina Senator Kay Hagan said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is \u2018giving us great guidance\u2019 on how to deal with Ebola virus infections here in the United States.]A plan based on a ban - But the big issue is, of course, the travel ban. The calls for a ban on travel to the U.S. by those from West African nations in the hot zone predates the arrival of the first infected visitor, but accelerated after his death and the subsequent infections and travels of his caregivers. Both the president and Frieden were defensive Thursday about a travel ban, and you could certainly see cracks in the fa\u00e7ade. The rationale subtly shifted from the previously stated claim that a ban would do harm because of isolating and destabilizing the affected nations. The president claimed Thursday that a ban wouldn\u2019t work because people would sneak through by breaking up their travel, going first to non-afflicted regions and then heading to the U.S. Maybe, but ask Steve Hayes how aggressive our travel ban systems are. Also telling is that Obama claimed he was opposed to those who favor a ban \u201cinstead of the protocols that we've put in place now.\u201d The calls actually are for a travel ban, plus screenings, plus anything else anyone can think of. This straw man suggests Obama is preparing to offer his own \u201ccompromise\u201d position. [The Hill lists the lawmakers who are calling for a travel ban.]Crawfishing again - So we start to get a pretty clear sense of where the president is going. Obama has a habit of taking audaciously inactive positions, like not bombing ISIS, only to crawfish backwards when public outrage intensifies. A travel ban of some kind is on its way, just as a war of some kind is now underway against ISIS. A president who prides himself on defying his critics has, this midterm year, turned into a public opinion appeaser. But positions obtained through backpedaling, particularly on national security, are unlikely to reassure. Having opted for another crawfish maneuver, Obama will struggle to stay ahead of the public panic that is driving his actions.WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Paying ransom for hostages, media blackouts and insurance take center stage in\u00a0Outside Magazine\u2019s riveting story of Michael Scott Moore, a journalist released last month after being held hostage for two years by Somali pirates: \u201cMoore\u2019s release has cast fresh scrutiny on the media blackouts that often follow the kidnapping of high-profile Western hostages\u2014most of the press remained silent about Moore throughout his captivity\u2026.

            "article_content": "Eric Shawn reports on federal investigation Michael Grimm, a former New York congressman and FBI agent who once investigated white-collar crime, was sentenced Friday to eight months in prison for tax evasion by a judge who said his \"moral compass\" needed adjustment. Grimm, 45, pleaded guilty late last year to aiding in filing a false tax return -- a charge that stemmed from an investigation into the Staten Island Republican's campaign financing. U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen said the crime included exploiting immigrant laborers, including some who were paid as little as $4.60 an hour. \"He knew what he was doing was illegal, wrong and criminally punishable,\" she said. Grimm, \"of all people, knew better.\" \"Your moral compass, Mr. Grimm, needs some reorientation,\" the judge told him. \"I want to apologize to the court for even being here,\" said Grimm, adding that he had cheated on taxes to keep a business afloat. \"I didn't want to fail and I made bad decisions that I'll regret for the rest of my life,\" he said, prompting the judge to criticize his \"belated remorse.\" Prosecutors had sought at least two years behind bars. Prosecutors said the tax fraud began in 2007 after Grimm retired from the FBI and began investing in a Manhattan eatery called Healthalicious. An indictment accused him of underreporting more than $1 million in wages and receipts to evade payroll, income and sales taxes, in part by paying immigrant workers, some of them in the country illegally, in cash. Grimm got to Congress by scoring an upset win over first-term Democratic Rep. Michael McMahon in 2010. He won re-election in November while fighting the charges but later resigned. In court papers asking for a sentence of probation, defense lawyers called Grimm's offense \"an aberration in an otherwise remarkable life in selfless service of his country,\" including a stint in the Marine Corps. They also argued that losing his career in Congress was punishment enough. Grimm \"is anguished over his wrongdoing and will live with the shame of it the rest of his life,\" the defense said. The government cited a news conference last year outside the Brooklyn courthouse where Grimm called the case \"a political witch hunt.\" It also referred to an episode in which Grimm threatened to throw a local cable TV news reporter off the balcony of the capitol for asking about the campaign financing inquiry.",

Joe Carr could be the next Dave Brat. Like Brat, the upstart who overcame massive funding and name-recognition disadvantages to knock off sitting House majority leader Eric Cantor, Carr is running in an open primary against a moderate Republican who has long angered conservative activists. And like it was for Brat in June, immigration has been a hot topic on the trail and drawn national support to his cause. But unlike Brat, Carr\u2019s opponent, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., saw him coming. [Polls close in Tennessee at 8 p.m. ET. You can track the results with the Tennessee Secretary of State and watch Fox for coverage of tonight\u2019s key primary contests, online at FoxNews.com] Big turnout - There are early signs of a big turnout boost in the Volunteer State, where Alexander, a former governor, a former U.S. secretary of Education and onetime presidential candidate, is seeking a third term at the age of 74. Carr, a state senator from the conservative stronghold of Rutherford County south of Nashville, has been running long and hard but only recently caught the attention of national conservatives drawn to his emphasis on opposing the Alexander-backed immigration compromise legislation of 2013. Both Carr and\u00a0Alexander have been running full tilt and getting lots of media attention in what is the last realistic hope for GOP insurgents to unseat a sitting senator this cycle. Alexander has been highlighting his opposition to ObamaCare and touting his ties to the rebirth of Republicanism in the longtime Democratic bastion, while Carr has stayed hard after the immigration issue. [The Tennessean: \u201c[State Rep. Joe Carr] added that the record turnout in early voting, during which more than 550,000 ballots were cast, could be an encouraging sign. \u2018We think that\u2019s because we have a very competitive ballot at the top,\u2019 he said.\u201d]Flinn is still in and that\u2019s trouble for Alexander in Memphis - Memphis doctor and regional media mogul George Shea Flinn has spent about $1 million on his long-shot Senate bid and continued a low-intensity but steady campaign schedule. Flinn, who owns seven radio stations and three television stations in the state, has persisted in the race despite meagre showings in pre-primary polls. But if Carr catches fire, Flinn could play a significant role. Flinn\u2019s presence will cost incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander votes among more moderate Republicans in Memphis and the rest of Shelby County. Metro Memphis is a Democratic stronghold and has a low concentration of Republicans, but Shelby County is the largest, by far, of any county in the state and will deliver the biggest cache of votes today \u2013 perhaps 100,000 of 800,000 cast. If Flinn gets some favorite-son status there, Alexander may have to make up the difference among more conservative voters elsewhere in the state.

Obama ducked a question about the controversial plan, but said that he would \u201cscour over\u201d laws and regulations to see what authority he has to address the \u201cunder-resourced\u201d immigration system. But the proposal would cross over from the selective enforcement that has allowed Obama to grant an indefinite amnesty to some 500,000 immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as minors. While Obama\u2019s decision caused plenty of outrage on the right, the administration has been able to claim that Obama is simply prioritizing enforcement in the face of insufficient resources. But granting visas to those previously deemed ineligible would not be shifting resources, it would be expending resources in pursuit of a policy goal. It\u2019s a move that would please his political base but also cause widespread anxiety about Obama\u2019s increasing tendency toward regency. Obama is expected to roll out his immigration plan after Labor Day.IRS extends scandal soaked tax program for illegals - Daily Caller: \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) quietly changed regulations to allow more undocumented immigrants to keep their taxpayer status through a program that is rife with fraud and abuse, and to delay deactivation of immigrant taxpayer status until 2016.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has risen as a progressive darling for railing against Wall Street and big banks, apparently has no qualms about Democrats taking their cash. A review by the Boston Herald that finds many of the candidates Warren\u2019s political action committee has fundraised for have benefited from the same lobbyists, corporate bundlers and big banks she has decried. In a recent fundraising e-mail, Warren boasts about the $3 million she has helped to raise directly and through her Level Playing Field PAC for several vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. The Herald\u2019s review found Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H, Mark Warner, D-Va., have netted big bucks from banking lobbyists. Additionally, the review found Sen.

(Benjie Sanders/Arizona Daily Star via AP) The sister of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was killed in a car accident Saturday in Arizona. Pima County sheriff\u2019s spokesman Ryan Inglett said Ann Day, 77, suffered fatal injuries after her vehicle was struck by two other cars near Tucson. Day was a former Arizona Republican state senator and Pima County supervisor. Day was driving eastbound on Ina Road around 7:40 a.m. when an oncoming car crossed the median. Day\u2019s vehicle was struck head-on, Inglett said. A truck traveling behind Day then rear-ended her. She was alone in the vehicle. Paramedics transported Day to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The other two drivers, both male, were hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Inglett said the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner will determine the official cause of death. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the 23-year-old driver of the car that hit Day head-on is suspected of impaired driving. Nanos said he was seen driving erratically at excessive speeds. Meanwhile, condolences began to pour in from Arizona political figures. \"With Ann's tragic death, our state has lost a tireless advocate who dedicated her life to public service \u2014 as a teacher, state senator and Pima County supervisor,\" U.S. Sen. John McCain said in a statement. \"Cindy and my prayers are with Ann's family and loved ones, as well as the entire Arizona community, during this difficult time.\" Day was the younger sister of O'Connor. She was often described herself as a \"cowgirl from the Lazy B,\" referring to the southeastern Arizona ranch her grandfather established. She served in the Arizona Senate for a decade and as a Pima County supervisor for 12 years, the Arizona Daily Star reported. Day was known for being moderate politically and for advocating for cancer patients' rights to clinical trials and reforms in the HMO industry. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sign up here.** Buzz Cut: \u2022 Dems demand Shinseki scapegoat, but will Obama oblige? \u2022 Clinton campaign seeks control of Benghazi narrative \u2022 Landrieu still backs Reid \u2022 Break-in at DeMaio HQ \u2022 It\u2019s what you do when no one is watching DEMS DEMAND SHINSEKI SCAPEGOAT, BUT WILL OBAMA OBLIGE?Remember why President Obama chose Eric Shinseki as his secretary of Veterans Affairs, way back on Dec. 7, 2008? Obama\u2019s fellow Hawaiian is a decorated, combat-wounded Vietnam veteran, a former Army chief of staff and certainly qualified for the post. But at the time, Shinseki was also a symbol of the movement that brought Obama to power and made the retired general a hero to Democrats everywhere. Shinseki rose to fame in the weeks prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq for publicly disputing the Bush administration\u2019s estimates for the cost of the invasion and the number of troops that would be required. Shinseki\u2019s testimony provoked a backlash from civilian leaders at the Pentagon, and, Democrats alleged, Shinseki being forced from his position sooner than scheduled. But Shinseki\u2019s public contradiction of official policy would later be a central part of the calls to oust then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2006 when the war effort was failing. President George W. Bush didn\u2019t oblige the bipartisan demands for Rumsfeld\u2019s resignation in the midst of a difficult midterm election cycle for Republicans \u2013 even though it would have helped their party. Eight years later, it is Shinseki who is the scapegoat and Democrats who are baying for blood. Will Obama oblige them? [The first report from the Veterans Affairs inspector general investigating the abuses inside the agency, particularly the practice of using secret waiting lists to hide the rationing of health care to veterans, describes the problem as \u201csystemic.\u201d] Divided loyalties - Shinseki certainly doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s ready to be a martyr to the Democratic midterm cause, penning an OpEd for USA Today that vigorously defends his tenure and argues that he is best suited to remedy the problems: \u201cThe findings \u2026 are reprehensible to me and to this department, and we are not waiting to set things straight.\u201d It would be more than a little unseemly for Obama to dump the man he praised, whose selection was heralded as \u201ckarmic justice\u201d and provoked \u201cwonderment at the Obama team\u2019s deftness in the symbolism and substance of this choice.\u201d After all, Obama abided with former Secretary of Health Kathleen Sebelius for more than half a year after she failed spectacularly in the rollout of Obama\u2019s most important initiative. It made political sense, too. By stonewalling and waiting for Democrats to get in line, Obama prevented the perception of continuing chaos and was able to eventually claim some version of success for his troubled initiative before giving Sebelius the boot. But endangered Senate Democrats need a quicker resolution this time. Election Day is just 22 weeks away. They need a symbolic firing, the appointment of a blue ribbon commission and a quick pivot away from an issue that could cost additional seats. Obama needs the perception of calm to prevent this from engulfing his administration. Senate Democrats need to show they can get results in response to public outrage. So what to do? [Pergram-atic detail - Senior Capitol Hill Producer Chad Pergram offers the blow-by-blow account of Wednesday\u2019s late-night standoff between Veterans Affairs official Dr. Thomas Lynch and outraged committee members.] Will Obama cave? - The president has a famously poor relationship with Senate Democrats, so it might be possible that last night\u2019s sudden shift to Shinseki scapegoating by five vulnerable Democratic senators \u2013 Colorado\u2019s Mark Udall, Montana\u2019s John Walsh, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Al Franken of Minnesota and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire \u2013 wasn\u2019t coordinated with the White House. Such a mass defection would usually signify that a president was going to dump a troublesome staffer anyway and wanted vulnerable members to get some mileage out of the move. But if that\u2019s not the case, and Obama is going to try to ride this out, there\u2019s big trouble ahead. The Democratic narrative for 2014 is that the party\u2019s Senate candidates are independent-minded members who hold the unpopular president to account and get results. If this, like the Keystone Pipeline and global-warming regulations, proves another example of meaningless opposition, that narrative will be badly damaged. But worse for Democrats, if Obama is seen as insufficiently responsive amid allegations of wrongdoing that led to the deaths of veterans, the desire among voters to further constrain his power with an all-Republican-controlled Congress will be even more attractive. Will Obama bow to political expediency and fire a onetime Democratic hero? [Watch Fox: Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., discusses the Veteran\u2019s Affairs scandal in the 9 a.m. ET hour] Uh\u2026 -Tampa Bay Times: \u201cRep.

Her comfort level caught the attention of the GOP opposition group America Rising, \u2026particularly since the VA in Gainesville has come under question for having a secret waiting lists such as the ones at the Phoenix facility. Three supervisors in Gainesville have been put on paid leave. But local officials \u2014 and Sen. Bill Nelson [D-Fla.] who visited the hospital on Friday \u2014 contend the list was not like the one in Phoenix.\u201dWITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Today is the 26th anniversary of then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first visit to Moscow. The 1988 summit was the fourth between Reagan and his Russian counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, and produced little in the way of new treaties. But it gave Reagan the chance to speak directly to the Soviet people (including this very familiar-looking \u201ctourist\u201d in Red Square.) While hardliners in the United States were unhappy that Reagan was rewarding the still-oppressive Soviet regime with an official visit, Regan used his platform to launch a frontal assault on communist ideologies. Reagan\u2019s now-famous speech at Moscow State University tantalized students with the promise of an \u201cinformation revolution\u201d that he said would \u201calter our world, shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives.\u201d That development, he said, would depend on people being free to experiment and free to fail instead of central economic planning. But he also explained that the freedom had to be built on a strong spiritual foundation. \u2018Reason and experience\u2019 - From Reagan\u2019s speech: \u201cFreedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic, but Americans are one of the most religious peoples on Earth. Because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is not earned but a gift from God, they seek to share that gift with the world. \u2018Reason and experience,\u2019 said George Washington in his Farewell Address, \u2018both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. And it is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.\u2019 Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited, un-intrusive; a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life, the true sources of value found only in family and faith.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

They see an opportunity to wrest control of a narrative that some allies fear could be damaging to Clinton if she moves ahead with a 2016 presidential campaign. A major milestone in the effort will take place this Friday, when a coalition of Democratic-leaning groups and influentials converges at the headquarters of the centrist think tank Third Way for a briefing that includes top Clinton adviser Philippe Reines.\u201d But is she likable enough? - She has been on the national stage for decades, but what does the American public really think of 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton? A study\u00a0from the conservative American Enterprise Institute, reviewing nearly 5,000 poll questions analyzing nearly every aspect of her career found that Americans believe her to be competent, but not necessarily trustworthy: \u201cDuring Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Hillary Clinton received consistently high marks for handling her job as first lady\u2026. In 1992, only 19 percent said she had what it takes to be president\u2026Nationally, Americans were not especially enthusiastic about her senatorial candidacy, though they viewed her as competent and up to the job. According to several polls of New Yorkers during her Senate career, her ratings were higher at the end of her term than when she began. In Fox News polls throughout her service as secretary of state, more people approved than disapproved. \u2026 As far as personal characteristics are concerned, Hillary Clinton is seen as intelligent, experienced, and competent. Her perceived weaknesses concern her lack of honesty and saying what she believes rather than what people want to hear\u201d Loyalty rewards program - WaPo: \u201cReady for Hillary, a super PAC mobilizing support for a potential presidential bid by Hillary Rodham Clinton, filed paperwork Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission that will allow it to make direct candidate donations. The move lets the group set up a separate fund to provide direct but limited support to campaigns. As a super PAC, it can spend unlimited sums on independent activity that is not coordinated with candidates. By restructuring as a so-called hybrid super PAC, Ready for Hillary could serve as a flanking political operation for Clinton by contributing to Democratic candidates she endorses, much in the way that leadership PACs operate. Its support for 2014 candidates could also help assuage concerns that the super PAC and other pro-Clinton groups are too focused on the 2016 elections.\u201d WARREN RIDES TO RESCUESeattle Times: \u201c[Sen.

Hassan for Senate 2016. Payback's a bitch.\u2019 The reference was clearly to speculation that Gov. Maggie Hassan [D-N.H.] may challenge Ayotte in 2016, when Ayotte is up for reelection, and that Ayotte\u2019s endorsement of Brown will hurt Ayotte\u2019s chances in such a match-up.\u201d Shaheen talks job record, Brown touts ties to N.H. in new ads - In her latest ad, Shaheen boasts her record of job creation and improving infrastructure in the Granite State.

No way. \u201cCornell says when he found the cash his first concern was for others who could be hit with a loss. \u2018Deposits from businesses and stuff, so that could have trickled down to a lot of people\u2019s jobs, who knows what so I just figured it was the right thing to do.\u2019\u201d he told KMPH. Cornell, scheduled to complete the program in July, said his next task is to find a job.

Sign up\u00a0here.** THE GREAT DIVORCE, REPUBLICAN STYLE Most party nominations are like marriages. Sometimes they are shotgun affairs or entered into out of convenience or desperation on the parts of the betrothed. Occasionally they are even love matches. But what is happening now in the Republican Party seems far more akin to a divorce. In 2008, many expected the enmity of the Democratic nominating process to produce an unhappy union. But in the end, Barack Obama\u2019s courtship was successful and Democrats united behind him. In the same year, the warring wings of the GOP entered into a marriage of convenience to pick John McCain. Perhaps no Republican could have won that year, given the condition of the Iraq war and the U.S. economy. But the loveless union between McCain\u2019s wing of the party and conservatives hardly helped \u2013 especially compared to the unity and enthusiasm of the Democrats. It was \u201cYes we can!\u201d versus \u201cWe think you probably shouldn\u2019t, but whatever\u2026\u201d A love match proved stronger than a marriage of convenience. And while there are many factors that determine which side wins a presidential election, party unity is high on the list. Obama was the exception to the rule that primary-season rancor bodes ill for general election success. A CNN poll out today shows GOP frontrunner Donald Trump with the support of 49 percent of his party\u2019s primary voters. Now, we always ought to remember that CNN\u2019s national polling has been consistently bullish on Trump compared to other outlets. Plus, the survey was mostly taken before Trump\u2019s Sunday stumble over the support of white nationalist David Duke and lots of reporting on Trump\u2019s various business difficulties, including the torch-job in today\u2019s WaPo about Trump\u2019s failed mortgage company. But let\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that at 16-points better for Trump than the previous day\u2019s Real Clear Politics Average of polls, CNN\u2019s poll today is ahead of the curve instead of an outlier. The poll says that like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, many Republicans have gone from viewing Trump as temperamentally unfit for the White House to believing the New York billionaire is the best choice to \u201ckeep America safe.\u201d If the CNN poll is accurate, then under normal circumstances, it would be good news for Republicans. Party elders designed this year\u2019s process with a compressed schedule and few debates for the very purpose of pushing a frontrunner quickly over the top. Mitt Romney didn\u2019t poll above 50 percent in his party until nearly four months after voting began. That was too long to wait to wed, especially for a marriage of desperation. So this is better, right? Well, not really\u2026 The same CNN poll that shows Trump on the cusp of locking up the nomination as soon as March 15 includes something which Fox News First has never seen before: While 49 percent of GOP respondents said they picked Trump, 48 percent said that they would probably or certainly not support Trump in the general election. That compares to 29 percent for second place Sen. Marco Rubio, 31 percent third-place Sen. Ted Cruz and 33 percent among Democrats for their presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton. Those numbers, as well as Trump\u2019s, would be expected to fade as the rancor of the primaries faded. But there\u2019s something else at work with a number so high. If the poll, again, taken with copious servings of salt, were right, it would mean that Trump would not win the general election. But no earthquake there. That\u2019s what polls have consistently shown. However, that nearly half of Republicans would be prepared to repudiate their party\u2019s nominee is truly the sign that the GOP may finally be at the breaking point forecast by the press in the past two cycles and tirelessly encouraged by President Obama and his party. There\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest that given Trump\u2019s stances on issues and his approach to government power that there are many conservatives who would hope to see a Trump nomination result in a humiliating general election defeat. That sentiment was present in the previous two cycles for some of those who now support Trump, but this seems different. Not only is the revolt against the frontrunner seemingly more widespread, but it includes in its number those willing to suffer consequences for their refusal. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., vowed in a Facebook post on Sunday to refuse to support Trump and spoke for many in the #NeverTrump wing of the GOP when he wrote: \u201c\u2026parties are just tools to enact the things that we believe. Political parties are not families; they are not religions; they are not nations \u2013 they are often not even on the level of sports loyalties. They are just tools. I was not born Republican. I chose this party, for as long as it is useful.\u201d This means more from someone whose career and future hang in the balance than from a pundit who can simply zig back if their position comes a cropper. We certainly saw nothing of the kind from a sitting senator in 2012 or 2008. But one doubts Sasse will be the last one to take such a risk. Do you believe that these sentiments will be more prevalent or less prevalent two weeks from now? How about by the time of the GOP convention in July? Factor in what will surely be Hillary Clinton\u2019s centrist sprint after she locks up the nomination and many weeks of the kind of brutal media coverage of Trump we are only just now starting to see. It would seem that the acrimony that is dominating the GOP primary process is actually going to get worse, something that wouldn\u2019t have seemed possible even three weeks ago. And the once risible claims of the coming crackup in the party could result in the Great Republican Divorce.

But can we do away with having that extra day and instead have an extra week? Christian Science Monitor brings us the proposal: \u201cSteve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, says having an even number of days in a quarter would simplify financial calculations.\u00a0Dr. Hanke and his colleague Richard Henry have proposed their own new calendar: The\u00a0Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar. In that calendar, every year would have 364 days and a leap week would be tacked on every five or six years to make up for the missing parts of a solar year.\u00a0One advantage of this calendar, Hanke tells the Monitor, is that the date would fall on the same day every year.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, stands with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton before the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, in Hempstead, N.Y. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) Prior to Tuesday\u2019s offering in Farmville, the last such national candidates\u2019 debate in the Commonwealth of Virginia was in 1992 \u2013 well before Blackberries, back taxes and beauty queens drove the presidential narrative. That debate, on the campus of the University of Richmond, holds two dubious distinctions. It marked the first time that the two parties\u2019 candidates met in a \u201ctown-hall\u201d format, with questions posed by undecided voters. Prior to the night of Oct. 15, 1992, and dating all the back to the 1960 election, journalist panels had handled the honors. Second, you might remember then-President George H.W. Bush looking down at his watch, no doubt wondering if and when the night would end (\u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap,\u201d Bush would later say he was thinking at the time). As you might deduce, I\u2019m no fan of this style of presidential debating \u2013 and not just because, at the time, I was working for the President for whom time stood still. One complaint: these events place too high of a premium on shallow stagecraft (\u201cDo I get off my stool and walk around? Should I go over and hug that voter?\u201d) Second, the questions can be a little too flaky. For example, right after President Bush checked his watch: a fuzzy question about how the national debt had personally affected his life; whether he could \u201chonestly find a cure for the common people if you have no experience in what\u2019s ailing them\u201d. If you\u2019re more interested on political forensics than pro football, here are three things to be on the lookout for, on Sunday night. Can Trump Reverse His Fortune? On paper, it\u2019s a bad setup for Trump. He draws energy off large-scale rallies rather than more intimate gatherings (one reason why he struggled in the first debate). And he doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly. Then again, maybe there\u2019s an advantage in having such a low bar to clear. Trump\u2019s debate prep \u2013 or a lack thereof \u2013 was a big storyline coming out of Round One in Hofstra. He denied a connection, but Trump did participate in a town hall setting in New Hampshire on Thursday. It was a good walk-through for Sunday, even if Trump insisted it wasn\u2019t a dress rehearsal. Trump reportedly has spent more time with his campaign\u2019s inner circle preparing for Round Two. Perhaps he\u2019ll be better in command of his talking points and more eloquent in defense of his record. That leaves the question of temperament. Asking Trump to be like Mike (Pence): calm, dignified, polished? Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, Trump gotta be Trump. Problem is: not enough Republicans are lovin\u2019 dat man. Does Clinton Sit On Her Wealth? She was the consensus winner in the first debate, received a slight poll bounce and now leads this race. So what does Hillary Clinton do on Sunday night? Play defense again by making the 90 minutes all about Trump\u2019s foibles \u2013 what she did in Round One and her running mate, Tim Kaine, continued in his debate turn? Or does Clinton be sold bold as to talk policy beyond her usual clich\u00e9s and hackneyed rhetoric? According to the latest YouGov/Economist survey, Clinton made up a 13-point enthusiasm gap among her Democratic base. Others numbers that bode well for her: Clinton\u2019s favorable/unfavorable has improved (it\u2019s now 45%/53%); a majority of voters see her as the more presidential of the two and more likely to win in November. Now, a problem: it\u2019s still only a three-point lead (43%-40%). The vaunted gender gap that worked so well in 2012 for President Obama \u2013 he won the women\u2019s vote by 12% but lost the male vote by 8% \u2013 is smaller in the same YouGov sample. Trump\u2019s winning the male vote by 5% but losing women by 11%/ It\u2019s a 16-point gap versus the 20-point margin in 2012. And that\u2019s remarkable, considering the Clinton campaign relentless effort to market Trump as a chauvinist and beyond. One other consideration for Clinton: avoiding smugness. She\u2019s been cocky on the campaign trail since the first debate. It worked for Barack Obama in his meteoric rise to the presidency \u2013 Clinton isn\u2019t so blessed. Will The Moderators Provide An Embarrassment Of Riches? This is the only of the four national debates to feature two moderators: on Sunday, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. Here\u2019s a story claiming the two weren\u2019t getting along in their debate \u2013 fighting over who got to ask what (why do I get the sense it to do with Trump?). Raddatz was not popular in GOP circles in 2012 after moderating a vice presidential debate in which Vice President Joe Biden was at times over the top. Republicans have cared much for Cooper, the embodiment of journalistic metrosexual cool. In theory, this is the one debate where the moderators can\u2019t play as outsized of a role since it\u2019s the voters get to ask half of the questions. Still, Raddatz and Cooper will have their say. At all times, they\u2019ll control the follow-up and the flow \u2013 i.e., deciding how long Trump twists in the wind over women, or Clinton has to dwell about her past transgressions. Slanted journalism and partisan sermonizing? If America\u2019s lucky, it doesn\u2019t find its way past the Sunday morning shows, into primetime. Enjoy the debate.",

As the latest Fox News poll shows, it\u2019s been a rough week for Carson. And he can blame both his tormenter-in-chief, Donald Trump, and also the shift in voters\u2019 focus to Islamist terrorism. The single largest shift in the poll is Carson\u2019s 5-point slide. The reason is no mystery. Just as Carson was weathering an intense round of character attacks from Trump, who rails against the well-liked Carson as dishonest and unstable, a more intense round of the commander-in-chief test was initiated by the Paris attacks. Thinking about a mild-mannered physician as president is one thing in the summertime when the headlines are dominated by presidential horserace coverage. But when winter is coming on and voters are made to confront the possibility of a large-scale attack on our shores, the conversation changes. Trump bumps up 2 points in the poll and two spots in the Power Index for his successful attacks on Carson. It may not much widen his path to the nomination, but Trump\u2019s scorched-earth personal attacks achieved their goal here: the diminution of Ben Carson. The big winners in this poll, as well as last week\u2019s Bloomberg survey, are the two rising stars of the GOP field who have been atop the Power Index for several weeks: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Both have made foreign policy major parts of their appeals to voters and both take a hard line on ISIS & Co. The senators each gained 3 points to move into a tie for third.

The Atlantic describes how such a simple concept changed so many young lives: \u201cRogers told kids they mattered, that they were worthy of love, and that emotions were to be embraced, not buried. He spoke to children like grown-ups, and helped them tackle topics such as anger, trust, honesty, courage, and sadness\u2026Later in Rogers\u2019s life, he\u00a0recounted\u00a0the story of a child who was being abused by his biological parents\u2026Through encountering \u2018Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood,\u2019 the child began to hope that there were kind people in the world and became convinced that he too should be treated with respect.

            "article_content": "The fallen firebrand was an outspoken advocate of Israel, and a target of jihadists. This day marks the first jihad terrorist attack on American soil. Eleven years before Al Qaeda flew airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11, 23 years before the pressure cooker bombs exploded at the Boston Marathon and long before the nation was ever aware of the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism, the first strike inside the U.S. opened with the deadly pull of a trigger in a meeting room of a Manhattan hotel. \"I heard the sound of a cannon -- one shot, and all of a sudden there was a second shot and I feared the worst,\" recalled Shannon Taylor, who remembers it vividly. \"The 1990 Kahane murder was clearly the first strike in the United States by the Sunni jihadist terror network that eventually evolved into global Al Qaeda.\" It was Nov. 5, 1990. Extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane was giving a speech in the Marriott hotel on Lexington Ave. and 49th St. in Manhattan. Taylor was standing just feet from him. Kahane had long been a controversial Jewish activist and firebrand. Born in Brooklyn, he went on to found the Jewish Defense League and served four years as a member of the Israeli Knesset before being barred from running for re-election for his views espousing the expulsion of Arabs from Israel. He also served a one-year prison term in 1975 in New York for violating his probation stemming from a plot to make bombs. But on that night 25 years ago, after speaking to a group in the hotel conference room, he was shot point-blank by an Egyptian-born man who worked in the New York City Criminal Court system as an air-conditioning repairman, 36-year-old El Sayyid Nosair. Nosair, (l.), claims to have renounced terrorism. Kahane, (r.), still has a following in Israel. \"The 1990 Kahane murder was clearly the first strike in the United States by the Sunni jihadist terror network that eventually evolved into global Al Qaeda,\" said Andrew McCarthy, the former federal prosecutor who went on to try Nosair and others on terrorism charges and wrote the book \"Willful Blindness, Memoir of the Jihad,\" about the cases and the connection to a much larger conspiracy. \"It was probably not recognized as such because the target was not distinctly American,\" noted McCarthy. \"Rabbi Kahane was the founder of the JDL. Because we were unfamiliar with Islamic-supremacist ideology, we would not have comprehended at the time that jihadists regard America, Israel and the West as one and the same -- the enemy.\" Blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman led a terror cell that had ties to Nosair, according to McCarthy. (Associated Press) At the time, the New York City police and local prosecutors declared that Nosair \"was acting alone.\" But Taylor, one of Kahane's lawyers and a photographer who documented the shooting, never had any doubt that the assassination was part of a broader plot by a terrorist that targeted the United States. He said he warned law enforcement and local prosecutors that the killing had all the earmarks of a long planned, wider terrorist conspiracy, that he says they refused to acknowledge at the time. And as Taylor predicted, it turned out that Nosair was anything but a lone gunman. He was tried as the sole defendant in New York State court and acquitted of the murder in 1991. But in the wake of the bombing of the World Trade Center two years later in 1993, federal authorities, with McCarthy as the Assistant United States Attorney, began to investigate and were able to uncover the truth. It was discovered that Nosair was indeed part of a New York and New Jersey-based terrorist cell, headed by the blind Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, that had existed for years without detection. Nosair, along with Abdel-Rahman and other followers, was eventually convicted of conspiracy in the first World Trade Center attack that killed six people and injured more than 1,000, as well as the plot to bomb New York City landmarks in 1995. Nosair was also given a life sentence for the Kahane killing, convicted of a host of federal charges including murder in aid of racketeering and the use of a firearm in the commission of murder. But the unraveling of a wider plot, and the existence of a network of jihadi terrorists here on our soil, was a remote concept in the first years after Kahane's assassination, until McCarthy tried the bombing case. \"The killing was also the first big indicator of the willful blindness that still burdens our interaction with radical Islam,\" McCarthy said. \"The New York State investigators went out of their way not to acknowledge that Nosair was a member of a jihadist network --- something that would have been obvious to anyone who did a competent analysis of the seizures from his home, work locker, and abandoned get-away car. The day after the shooting, before any real investigation could have been done, the NYPD chief of detectives pronounced that the murder was the work of a lone, crazed gunman.\" \"If the proper attention had been paid, and the writings of Nosair had been read and analyzed, I think you would have prevented the first attack on the World Trade Center and possibly the second,\" insisted Taylor. \"It was their test of fire,\" he said of Rahman and his followers. \"They had nothing but contempt for American law and American law enforcement and it served as their rallying cry. It took years for authorities to acknowledge that this was a terrorist act. It was all the same thinking. Not enough was done until the attack on the World Trade Center, and as a result of a miscarriage of justice, we have nothing but wars, chaos and endless cost in lives and resources due to unchecked terrorism.\" McCarthy said the evidence was there, but was ignored. \"The World Trade Center was bombed about 27 months after the homicide. It turned out that between the Kahane murder and some surveillance the FBI had done in 1989, the authorities already had evidence tying Nosair to the major World Trade Center bombers, as well as other major conspirators.\u00a0But they did not put that evidence together and did not recognize the threat of radical Islam that was before their eyes.\" Today, Nosair is said to condemn jihad. In 2013, Los Angeles Times correspondent Robert Serrano reported that Nosair claims, \"Young men are throwing their lives away, killing innocents...the families of the jihadists suffer for years.\" But Nosair, wrote Serrano, said that Kahane's killing \"was justified because the rabbi had called for war against Muslims. Kahane...openly advocated genocide and ethnic cleansing.\" Nosair's son is not so sure that his father has really changed. \"My father was the first known Islamic jihadist to take a life on American soil. He worked with the support of a terror cell overseas that would ultimately call itself Al Qaeda,\" wrote 32 year old Zak Ebrahim.\u00a0 His book, published last year, \"The Terrorist's Son, A Story of Choice,\" is about his upbringing. He says he has neither seen nor spoken to his father in years. \"Kahane's assassination was not just hateful, but a failure as anything other than simple murder,\" Ebrahim wrote. \"My father intended to shut the rabbi up and bring glory unto Allah. What he actually did was to bring shame and suspicion onto all Muslims, and to inspire more pointless and cowardly acts of violence.\" He acknowledges that when his father, alone, was first convicted\u00a0of a gun charge in 1990, \"the NYPD can't fathom the concept of a global terror cell --- virtually no one can --- and they have no interest in trying to prosecute one.\" He also wrote that after his father went to prison on the gun charge from the Kahane case in 1991, \"he is fantasizing about bringing down the Twin Towers.\" After 9/11, he says his father \"must have regarded the destruction of the Twin Towers as a great victory for Islam -- maybe even as the cumulating of the work he and the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef began years earlier with the Ryder truck,\" a reference to the explosive-packed van driven into the building's garage eight years earlier. And the legacy of violence has also continued. One of Kahane's sons, 34 year old Binyamin, was shot to death by Palestinian gunmen as he was driving with five of his children from Jerusalem to the West Bank on Dec. 31, 2000. His wife, 31-year-old Talya, was also killed. Last month it was reported that one of Kahane's grandsons, 23-year-old activist Meir Ettinger, went on a hunger strike in Israel after authorities placed him on six-month administrative detention. He has been accused of \"organizing extremist Jewish activities\" in the settlements, though his lawyer denies that Ettinger has been involved in any violence and claims he is being prosecuted for his blog writings. And the fears of more possible terrorist attacks here at home, echoes of the Kahane shooting, are now a part of our lives. \"The legacy of the homicide should alarm us. It showed that there is an active, ideologically-inspired terrorist threat that plots, recruits and raises funds within mosques and Islamic community centers,\" warned McCarthy. \"Islamists and their sympathizers working outside and inside of government have sullied pro-active policing that is essential to gathering intelligence and identifying potential threats before they become active plots. That is why, increasingly, we are just as vulnerable today as we were before the attacks of the '90s that led to 9/11,\" he says. \"It all started with those shots on that night,\" added Taylor. \"It was the tunnel vision, cover-up and inadequate response that has given us the consequences that we suffer from today.\" Follow Eric Shawn on Twitter: @EricShawnonFox",

A senior administration official told Fox News that the remaining stops on the tour will continue to be evaluated.

The big banks and investment firms still hold considerable clout with many in the Republican establishment, so pressure will certainly increase on Majority Leader Eric Cantor and other Wall Street allies to shut down the shutdown. Obama is scheduled to hit the campaign trail Thursday to publicly repeat his refusal to negotiate with Republicans over his health law or to offset increases to the federal borrowing limit. The White House is working hard to get ahead of the coming clash over borrowing, where the stakes for the economy are much greater. [Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders Tuesday, warning the U.S. will still reach its debt limit Oct. 17 despite the partial shutdown.] The end is near. Look busy. - House Republicans today will keep up efforts to shift the pressure for the shutdown to Obama and the Democratic Senate. Speaker John Boehner came up short last night in trying to fast-track legislation that would keep key agencies and services open, with Democrats blocking bids to fund the District of Columbia, the Department of Veterans Affairs and national parks. The blue team could kill the bills because Boehner sought rapid passage, which requires supermajorities. Today, House Republicans are expected to pass with simple majorities bills funding those agencies and others, perhaps including National Guard units and the National Institutes of Health. Senate Majority leader Harry Reid wants it all or nothing, vowing to block the emergency spending bills and demanding that Republicans drop any conditions for full federal funding.

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker that he was nearly ready to abandon the ObamaCare gambit, saying Republicans still demanding large-scale changes to the law as a condition of funding the government were \u201clemmings.\u201d But if Republicans walk away from the shutdown circus empty handed, the political damage would be twofold: an irate political base and disgusted general election voters. That\u2019s certainly how Obama wants this to end.

            "article_content": "South Carolina Republican questions the FBI director over the Clinton email investigation FBI Director James Comey is facing growing Republican calls to launch a perjury probe into whether Hillary Clinton lied under oath about her email use when she testified last year before the House Benghazi committee \u2013 even as the Justice Department closes the case on the former secretary of state\u2019s private server. House Overnight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz first urged such a probe during Thursday\u2019s hearing with Comey before his committee. He wants the agency to investigate whether Clinton lied when she told lawmakers \u201cthere was nothing marked classified on my emails\u201d \u2013 a claim Comey repeatedly contradicted this week. Comey told Chaffetz a referral from Congress would be needed for an investigation. \u201cYou\u2019ll have one in the next few hours,\u201d Chaffetz said. When FoxNews.com contacted Chaffetz\u2019s office on Friday, a referral had not yet been sent. But Chaffetz is vowing to kick-start the process, and his Republican colleagues are voicing support. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News\u00a0a day earlier\u00a0that Clinton \u201cmade statements that [were] directly contradicted by what Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation covered.\u201d \u201cThere are a number of things that she said that are just false based on the investigation Mr. Comey conducted relative to her testimony under oath to us last October,\u201d Jordan said, adding he thinks it would be \u201cappropriate\u201d to look into perjury claims but the decision is ultimately up to Chaffetz and Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs the Benghazi committee. It was during an exchange with Gowdy that Comey on Thursday countered several statements Clinton had made, both in public and before the Benghazi committee. Notably, he said her statement that nothing she sent or received was marked classified was not true. To the contrary, Comey confirmed the FBI's investigation found at least three emails with classified markings on Clinton's server. The State Department says human error was responsible for those markings. In a statement after Thursday\u2019s hearing, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon claimed Comey\u2019s testimony \u201cclearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton's public statements.\u201d Yet the stepped-up calls to dig deeper into Clinton\u2019s statements signal the investigations concerning Clinton\u2019s conduct in office are not over \u2013 even as lawmakers on Friday approved a final report on the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The two-year inquiry, among many other details, had revealed she used a private email server for government business, setting off intense scrutiny that continues to dog Clinton's presidential campaign. The 7-4 vote to approve the 800-page report was split along party lines, reflecting partisanship that emerged after the panel's creation in May 2014 and escalated in this election year. Democrats have submitted their own report on the attacks, which killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Gowdy, R-S.C., echoing Chaffetz, also said lawmakers may seek a federal investigation into whether Clinton lied to the committee in testimony last year. \"Our committee has an obligation\" to report any untruthful testimony to the FBI, Gowdy said. Asked if he was referring to Clinton, Gowdy said, \"She's one of 100 witnesses.\" Under oath, Clinton testified last October that she never sent or received emails marked as classified when she served as secretary of state. She also said she only used one mobile device for emails and turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department, claims Comey also contradicted on Thursday. Separately, the State Department is reopening its internal investigation of possible mishandling of classified information by Clinton and top aides. The internal review was suspended in April to avoid interfering with the FBI inquiry. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi dismissed the latest GOP move as purely political. \"So let's get this straight: This is going to be an investigation of the decision that is an investigation of the emails that was part of the investigation of Benghazi,\" she told reporters. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on both the Benghazi and Oversight panels, said an FBI referral was \"unwarranted,\" since Comey said only three emails out of more than 30,000 sent or received by Clinton contained classified markings. Comey said Thursday that his team found no evidence that Clinton lied under oath to the FBI or broke the law by discussing classified information in an unclassified setting. Under an onslaught of Republican criticism, Comey vigorously defended the government's decision and rejected GOP accusations that the presidential candidate was given special treatment. To criminally charge Clinton based on the facts his agency's yearlong probe had found would have been unwarranted and mere \"celebrity-hunting,\" Comey said.

            "article_content": "Defcon 3: KT McFarland and Van Hipp discuss the situation in Turkey, NATO and how a President Donald Trump will change America's foreign policy The Obama administration\u2019s relative silence on Turkey\u2019s alarming crackdown following last week\u2019s failed coup attempt is tantamount to a green light for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to continue his assault on democracy in the NATO nation, experts said. Questioned about Erdogan\u2019s ongoing roundup of some 50,000 academics, judges, teachers, soldiers and civil servants, and the declaration Wednesday of a state of emergency, a State Department official earlier this week meekly warned against \u201coverreach.\u201d \u201cI cannot overstate the sense of the Turkish government and the Turkish people right now that they truly felt and truly feel under threat,\u201d State Department spokesman Mark Toner told an Associated Press reporter at a department briefing. \u201cWe support completely the efforts to bring the perpetrators of the coup to justice. We just also caution against any kind of overreach that goes beyond that.\u201d Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks after an emergency meeting of the government in Ankara. (Associated Press) But when pressed, Toner declined to characterize the arrest, firing or suspension of the tens of thousands of Turkish government workers as \u201coverreach.\u201d Erdogan\u2019s government, which blames U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for inciting the coup attempt, in which more than 200 people were killed and members of the military briefly commandeered tanks, aircraft and communications channels, has reacted with a vengeance. Gulen, who lives in a Pennsylvaniua compound, could be extradited to Turkey. (File photo) The state of emergency gives Erdogan and his cabinet new powers to implement laws without parliamentary approval. It also allows Ankara to censor media broadcasts, search citizens, impose curfews and restrict gatherings both public and private. Erdogan has simultaneously demanded the U.S. hand over Gulen, a onetime Erdogan ally who lives in a Pennsylvania mountain compound and runs a profitable chain of Islamic charter schools. Secretary of State John Kerry has said the department is considering the request, but it remains unclear what evidence Erdogan\u2019s administration has provided. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said the crackdown shows Erdogan is taking advantage of the failed coup to further strengthen his grip on power. The strongman, who has ruled Turkey as either president or prime minister since 2001, has been steadily stripping the long proudly secular nation of its constitutional freedoms and increasingly adopted Islamist rhetoric. \u201cWhen he was mayor of Istanbul 20 years ago, he said democracy is like a street car \u2014 you ride it to the stop you want and then you get off,\u201d Bolton said of Erdogan. \u201cThis will enable him to pursue his objective of Islamisizing the Turkish government and overturning the secular constitution. That\u2019s what\u2019s underway. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much question about it.\u201d Bolton said that the Obama administration appears to have done \u201cvery little\u201d to pressure Turkey to ease up on its people, either publicly or behind the scenes. That gives Erdogan all the encouragement he needs, Bolton said. \u201cThe situation will continue to deteriorate as Erdogan arrests more people and puts them in jail,\u201d he said. The European Union has more aggressively sought to rein in the crackdown, with two EU officials warning Thursday that Turkey\u2019s declaration of a state of emergency had led to \u201cunacceptable decisions on the education system, judiciary and the media.\u201d \u201cWe call on Turkish authorities to respect under any circumstances the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right of all individuals concerned to a fair trial,\u201d EU high representative Federica Mogherini and commissioner Johannes Hahn said in a statement. Ahmet Yayla, who was chairman of the sociology department at Harran University and a former police chief in Turkey, said many of those being rounded up in Turkey include the Muslim nation\u2019s bulwark against terrorism.\u00a0 Police, soldiers and judges deemed disloyal to Erdogan have been detained, leaving a diminished human infrastructure to deal with security threats, he said. \u201cThose are the people who were fighting against terrorism in Turkey,\u201d said Yayla, who fled to the U.S.\u00a0 eight months ago when ISIS threatened his life for interrogating terrorist defectors. Yayla said Erdogan\u2019s dangerous dance with ISIS \u2013 tacitly supporting the terror group and allowing foreign fighters to pass through Turkey on their way to the terrorist army\u2019s caliphate \u2013 could combine with the post-coup unrest to threaten the nation\u2019s stability. \u201cIn the near future, Turkey will face a lot of danger coming from terrorism because the newly appointed officers in the military and police are not going to be able to fight or deal with terrorism threats that exist in the country, especially by Erdogan\u2019s allowing the terrorists inside the country,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Alan Colmes vs: The Liberty Counsel's Mat Staver on the idea that gays are borrowing the concept of a 'jizya' tax Richie Clendenen, a pastor at the Christian Fellowship Church in Marshall County, Kentucky, used a recent Sunday sermon to announce to his congregation that the most hated people in the nation at this time are Christians. \"I believe that the voice of Christians is trying to be silenced,\" Clendenen said, as WKYT reported. \"[W]e are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.\" Approximately 75 percent of the U.S. population identify as Christians, according to a December 2015 Gallup Poll. This percentage has decreased by five points since 2008. Although the majority of the nation is still Christian, Pastor Clendenen asserted they have the smallest voice in our culture -- and their opinions are often spat upon. Clendenen is not the only person who thinks this; many have argued the same. Some 63 percent of Americans agree that Christians are increasingly confronted with intolerance in America, according to a LifeWay Research study conducted via phone surveys in 2015. The issue of hate is becoming an increasingly dominant theme in our country today, as political mudslinging has reached a new high -- with right now front-and-center. Issues such as abortion, gay marriage, civil rights and gun control continue to divide and distance individuals, particularly in a contentious election year. Recently, many rulings from the Supreme Court have disappointed the Christian majority. Last year, Obergefell v. Hodges legalized gay marriage, while two weeks ago, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt disappointed pro-life advocates by striking down tough abortion laws in Texas. These decisions didn't align with Christian beliefs and have since led followers to feel forced to act on things they don't believe in. \"[W]e are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity,\" said former GOP candidate Mike Huckabee, according to the Huffington Post. Huckabee is one of the many who feel the effects of the changing face of Christianity in America. Many millennials are turning away from organized faith, and the percentage of Christians is certainly lowest amongst young Americans, according to the Gallup Poll. Billy Graham, one of this country's most prominent and influential pastors, spoke out in 2015 for Christians to prepare themselves for persecution, and to be ready to stand up for their faith. \"Since we have experienced little religious persecution in this country, it is likely that under pressure many would deny Christ. Those who shout the loudest about their faith may surrender soonest,\" Graham said, as The Christian Post and others reported. LifeWay also found that 6 out of 10 Americans believe religious liberty in the United States is declining. As courts wrestle with taking the words \"under God\" from the pledge of allegiance and phrases such as \"Merry Christmas\" have been substituted for \"Happy Holidays\" -- Christians ideology are becoming increasingly silenced in the public sphere. These sentiments in America are particularly interesting in light of the terrible genocide against Christians that is occurring worldwide. Christians are on the watchlist for severe persecution in countries such as North Korea, Iraq, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Syria, according to a list from Open Doors, a non-profit that aims to serve persecuted Christians worldwide. Approximately 322 Christians are killed for their faith each month, according to reports. Christian intolerance is real in the 21st century -- and many are warning it's coming to a town near you.",

But given the fact that Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., is willing to meet with Obama in private at the White House tonight but not in appear in public with him in her home state today, how credible are the president\u2019s increasing claims of not being a lame duck? Quack, quack. Hagan faces increasingly long odds in winning a second term thanks to upset in her state over Obama policies, particularly the unpopular health law. Once upon a time, Obama nearly won North Carolina in 2008 and picked Charlotte for his re-election kickoff in 2012, but now the state is looking redder and redder. Obama is there to sell a jobs training program, but the visit is doing far more to expose the vulnerabilities of Obama-backing Democrats in midterm elections. [On the agenda - Sources say that topic for tonight\u2019s White House huddle between Obama and Senate Democrats is laying out Obama\u2019s income inequality message ahead of the Jan. 28 State of the Union address.] THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOWThe National Republican Senatorial Committee blasts Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., for not joining President Obama for his visit today to the Tar Heel state. In a release the NRSC says, \u201cIn 2011 when Obama visited North Carolina, Hagan jumped at the opportunity to campaign alongside the president. Now, as President Obama's approval rating tanks, as folks in North Carolina and across the country continue to disapprove of the way that he has handled the economy and ObamaCare, the only time Hagan will likely appear side by side with Obama is behind closed doors in Washington.\u201d BAIER TRACKS: BAILOUT SQUEEZE PLAY\u201cThe New York Times details major worries by Democrats about a series of attack ads dealing with the health law, suggesting that vulnerable Democrats still do not believe they are anywhere near out of the woods on the issue. Which brings up the question: If the House passed legislation banning a bailout of insurance companies (as appears increasingly likely) then would the pressure on red state Democrats be too intense on the Senate side? It was the plan of Republicans who wanted to put the squeeze on the same Democrats during the government shutdown - which failed. \u00a0 Could the equation work this time? \u00a0 We'll see.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.

National Journal\u2019s Sam Baker points out Team Obama is moving the goalposts again after revealing that only 24 percent of those who have enrolled are in the target demographic.\u201cNow that standard is down to about 30 percent. Or maybe even 24 percent\u2014where the mix stands now\u2026. once again, administration officials are lowering their own standards for success\u2014ditching targets they set or embraced, and redefining success as anything that's good enough to avoid a total collapse. It was the White House that set the initial target of 38 percent enrollment for young adults. But officials wouldn't stand by that figure this week.\u201d Another deadline delay - As insurers are still determining who is actually enrolled under ObamaCare, the administration has announced the delay of another deadline.

SPENDING BILL SET TO ADVANCE TODAYFrom Fox News Capitol Hill hardy Chad Pergram: \u201cThe House is expected to debate and vote on a $1.012 trillion omnibus spending bill today. The measure would put to bed the spending fights in Congress until the fall. It funds the government through October 1, the start of the next fiscal year\u2026 probably sometime after 2:30 or so, the House will begin debate on the actual omnibus with a final vote by 4:30 pm ET at the latest. These times are subject to change. Yesterday, the House okayed a stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown tonight. The agreement which re-opened the government in October funded federal programs through tonight. But there wasn\u2019t sufficient time for both the House and Senate to process the omnibus in time. So they approved the emergency spending measure which runs through Saturday night. The Senate is expected to vote on the interim spending bill around 12:15 pm ET today. The Senate can't tackle the omnibus until Friday. It will have one procedural hurdle to jump through (possibly) to end debate. That vote would need 60 yeas. But final passage in the Senate only needs a simple majority.\u201d REID\u2019S REFUSAL PUTS JOBLESS BENNIES IN A FIXSenate Republicans are standing their ground against Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s efforts to prevent them from adding amendments to his jobless benefits measure.

Unfortunately,\u2019 he told reporters at a news conference \u2026\u201d With new concerns about Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton \u2013 revelations from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates about her political calculations on Iraq, liberal concerns about her hawkishness and a new book exploring the vendettas and enemies lists of the Clinton organization \u2013 populist and liberal Democrats are running out of options. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., bowed to Hillary and promised not to run. Now longtime Clinton rival Brown is out. The only remaining contender for the dovish, populist base of the party seems to be former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, but he is still being coy about his potential candidacy. With the Clintons\u2019 vast fundraising apparatus already humming and Wall Street and K Street ready for a coronation, have the grassroots already been mowed down? CHRISTIE MARCHES ONGov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., used his State of the State address to continue what he started in last week\u2019s nearly two-hour press conference on his aides tormenting a politically uncooperative mayor with traffic jams. \u201cWhat has occurred does not define us or our state,\u201d Christie said. The Garden State governor warned he would not let current investigations \u2013 there are several into the traffic mischief and another into a federal probe into his decision to use federal storm relief dollars for election-year TV commercials featuring himself \u2013 bog down his administration. Christie did pledge to \u201ccooperate with all appropriate inquiries.\u201d Fox News has more Weathering the storm - A Quinnipiac University poll of New Jerseyans released this morning shows 54 percent of respondents feel Christie is more of a leader than bully, tying his best-ever measure in that category. The poll shows overall high approval for Christie and his administration, but most significantly, that 66 percent of respondents felt that he was being honest in saying that he didn\u2019t know about the traffic scheme. MORAN, OWENS JOIN GROWING LIST OF RETIRING DEMSAfter 23 years in the House of Representatives, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., is calling it quits. The senior member of the House Appropriations Committee is expected to make the announcement this morning. Moran, who represents Alexandria, joins Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y, who announced his retirement Tuesday, as the latest Democrat who will not seek re-election in November. Owens\u2019 swing district in Upstate New York will be tough for Democrats to defend. The retirement of the scandal-singed Moran probably makes it a little easier for the Blue Team to hold that seat, which represents a bevy of federal workers and government contractors. JOLLY TIME IN FLORIDATampa-area Republicans have chosen a former aide the late Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., to seek to serve out Young\u2019s term through the end of this year. Lobbyist David Jolly will face off with failed 2010 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink.\u00a0 Jolly took Tuesday\u2019s crowded GOP primary with 45 percent of the vote, with a wide lead over the next closest contender.\u00a0The March 11 special election pits Jolly against Sink and Libertarian Lucas Overby.

The event is the NRCC\u2019s largest annual fundraising event. The group is hoping Rice will provide a boost as it trails its Democratic counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in fundraising this cycle by $8 million. The Hill has details. \u2018LAND\u2019ING IN THE MONEYFormer Michigan Secretary of State and Republican Senate hopeful Terri Lynn Land raised $1.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2013.

PICK SIX: UDALL GETS CANCELLATION NOTICEThe stakes are high for Democrats come November as they need to limit Republican gains in the Senate to five or fewer in order to retain control of the upper chamber. If the GOP can flip six seats from blue to red this year, the dynamics in Washington will change in a big way. Fox News First wants to know which six Democratic-held seats are most vulnerable. The current consensus among readers: (in order of times selected): Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, West Virginia, South Dakota and North Carolina. But wait! Reader Kelly Thomas notes Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., could be at risk after his office was caught pressuring Colorado\u2019s Division of Insurance to downplay the number of insurance cancellations under ObamaCare in the state.\u00a0 Duly noted, Kelly.

Davis, who rose to fame for her ultimately unsuccessful fight to preserve access to elective late-term abortions in the state, leads Abbott, the GOP frontrunner, with $12 million to his $11.5 million raised during the last half of 2013. Davis has been showered with cash by abortion activists and pro-choice groups from around the country. Abbot\u2019s campaign said it has $27 million cash on hand, touting that 97 percent of donors were from Texas. The Democrat\u2019s campaign has yet to release those figures.

ABORTION CLINIC \u2018BUFFER ZONES\u2019 HIT HIGH COURTSupreme Court justices will hear arguments today over a Massachusetts\u2019 law creating a 35-foot buffer zone around the entrances to facilities where abortions are performed. Pro-life protesters argue their right to free speech is being unconstitutionally infringed. The court previously upheld a more restrictive law, but the makeup of the court has changed since then. Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream considers the implications of buffer zones on free speech and has the latest from the Supreme Court. CRIST AND CRUZ GET GRIDIRONFlorida Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will share the spotlight at the most prestigious gathering of Washington journalists. Crist, who bolted the GOP after getting upended in a Senate primary by Marco Rubio in 2010 and is now seeking to return to office as a Democrat, will offer punch lines at the Gridiron Club\u2019s annual white-tie fundraiser on March 8. Cruz, who is better known for his filibuster than his funnies, will don fancy dress and do the same for the Red Team. As Bloomberg points out, a pot-legalization referendum being bankrolled by Crist\u2019s top political patron and aimed at helping turnout for the Blue Team this fall, could provide some material for Cruz. DC AREA \u2018FARMERS\u2019 HARVEST FARM SUBSIDIESThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded over $178 billion in farm subsidies between 1995 and 2012 with another $39 billion going to conservation subsidies. Among the beneficiaries: thousands of residents of the farm-less Washington D.C., metro area. Washington Examiner\u2019s Susan Ferrechio reports, \u201c\u2026thousands of residents in and around the nation's capital receive millions of dollars every year in federal farm subsidies, including working-class residents in Southeast, wealthy lobbyists on K Street and well-connected lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\u201d MAYBE SHE WAS AN OBAMACARE NAVIGATOR\u2026Was the newly-married LeBron James playing a pick-up game during his visit to the White House Tuesday?

A source familiar with the investigation told Fox that the FBI contacted Connecticut-based Datto, Inc. in September and asked them to preserve all data they had which may be connected to Clinton. Datto was hired to help back up data in May 2013 by Platte River Networks, the Colorado-based tech company that managed Clinton\u2019s server and has already been cooperating with the FBI investigation.\u201dWhat\u2019s so shady, lady? - McClatchy: [Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc.] offered the first public confirmation that Clinton or her representatives had arranged for a backup of her email server after she left office in early 2013. His letter also cited internal emails recounting requests in late 2014 and early 2015 from Clinton representatives for Colorado-based Platte River Networks, the firm managing Clinton\u2019s primary server, to direct Datto to reduce the amount of her emails it was backing up. These communications led a Platte River employee to air suspicions that \u2018this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy (sic) shit,\u2019 according to an excerpt of an email cited by Johnson.\u201dPower Play: Hillary\u2019s bid to beat the rap - Hillary Clinton is using an attack ad to paint Republicans investigating her scandals as politically-motivated bad guys. What\u2019s behind her strategy and will it work? Chris Stirewalt has the lowdown, in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.Pro-Biden PAC launches ads ahead of Dem debate - Fox News: \u201cThe super PAC urging Vice President Joe Biden to run for president is launching its first television ad. Draft Biden says it's spending upward of $100,000 to air the 90-second ad on national cable networks. The ad uses audio from a speech Biden gave in May at Yale University. Biden recalls the car crash that killed his wife and daughter just after he was first elected senator in 1972. Biden says he found redemption by focusing on his sons\u2026The ad ends with white lettering that reads: \u2018Joe, run.\u2019\u201dHillary hedging on trade deal - WSJ: \u201cDemocratic front-runner\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state but now finds it abhorrent to some inside her party and rejected by her closest challenger, Vermont Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders.\u00a0She is undecided now. Campaigning Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton said she would be \u2018diving into that [Tuesday night]\u2019 and discussing the agreement with advisers.\u201dHILLARY, TRUMP UP IN PRIMARIES, BUT SWING STATE VOTERS NOT IMPRESSEDFirst, the good news for the GOP and Democratic frontrunners: A new Quinnipiac University swing state poll finds Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton expanding or maintaining their leads among primary voters. Now the bad news: Both Trump and Clinton are slipping with general election voters in the key states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In every state polled, Trump maintains at least a 5 point lead over his next closest competitor Ben Carson. Trump blows away former home-state favorites Gov. John Kasich in Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida. Bush now runs fourth in Florida and Kasich has slipped to third place in Ohio. Similarly, Clinton has expanded her leads over closest competitor, Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and potential candidate Vice President Joe Biden. But assuming the two ended up the winners of their respective parties\u2019 nominations, how would things go? Both are broadly disliked among the general electorate, but Clinton (as well as Sanders and Biden) would have the edge on Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The top-tier GOP candidates that would fare best against Clinton appear to be Carson and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. And while Trump fares worse than the rest of the GOP pack against Clinton, It\u2019s Joe Biden who the GOP might really want to worry about. Biden crushes the GOP frontrunner Trump by more than 10 points in all three states. As with Clinton, Carson and Rubio do best of the GOPers tested in a Biden matchup. And it\u2019s no wonder. Voters in all three states have strongly unfavorable views on the two party frontrunners. Only Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie approach Clinton and Trump\u2019s sky-high negative scores. Oh, there\u2019s one other category in which Clinton and Trump are alike: They are seen as the least honest and trustworthy candidates in the field, though she\u2019s got the edge on her Republican rival. In Ohio, only one third of voters said they trusted Clinton, while Trump was closer to 40 percent.WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026It was on this day 14 years ago that then-President George W. Bush announced the beginning of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan with a midday speech from the White House. His famous lines from those remarks \u2013 \u201cWe will not waiver. We will not falter. We will not tire. We will not fail.\u201d \u2013 sound different these days. On Tuesday, the new U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Campbell, painted a grim picture in testimony about the state of the Afghan military and the future of the country after the end of the U.S. military presence there. But for a brief time in an otherwise brutal and chaotic history, Afghanistan saw a hopeful mirage of a modern future before plunging back into the darkness. Look at this Atlantic collection of photos of Midcentury Afghanistan and you\u2019ll better understand the scope of that national tragedy.

Republican Ken Cuccinelli had been written off two weeks ago, trailing by double digits, woefully outspent and shackled with an unpopular government shutdown. But as Democrat Terry McAuliffe was brushing up his victory speech, the ObamaCare crash slammed right into his poll numbers. McAuliffe went from prohibitive favorite to flailing frontrunner last week, and closes with a lead down to 6 points in the Real Clear Politics average. Cuccinelli\u2019s bumpy road - It\u2019s never been easy for Ken Cuccinelli. A split that began with the decision by the state Republican Party to hold a nominating convention rather than a primary left Cuccinelli in a lurch. Moderate Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who was expected to win if the primary had been held, nearly launched a third-party candidacy in protest. Meanwhile, scandals swirling around Gov. Bob McDonnell denied Cuccinelli the chance to run as successor to the formerly popular social conservative. While dealing with divisions and scandals, Cuccinelli was unable to pounce on the many ethical woes of Democrat Terry McAuliffe. By the time the brutal and costly contest of personal attacks had begun, Cuccinelli was already behind. Democrats and moderate Republicans were preemptively gloating about the demise of the social-issue crusader\u2019s candidacy\u2026 and then came ObamaCare. The disastrous rollout of the president\u2019s unpopular health law, against which Cuccinelli had long led the charge, has provided a late-game opportunity for the attorney general. If the race is a low-turnout affair and motivated Republicans can deliver, Cuccinelli could still author what would be a spectacular comeback. McAuliffe the showman - Democrat Terry McAuliffe whose portfolio consists mainly of his career as the top moneyman for the Clinton political machine, came to the race already branded a carpetbagger. (He did once publicly consider a run for governor of his native New York.) Backed by megabuck financing and with the help of the Clinton team, McAuliffe set out to defeat his demons: namely scandals connected to his failed stimulus-backed GreenTech car venture and its links to a federal investigation into allegations that the company was running a visa mill. The strategy that proved effective until ObamaCare flopped: massive spending (a 3-to-1 advantage) to paint Ken Cuccinelli as a zealot and finance an Obamaesque focus on minorities, youth and women. McAuliffe no doubt hopes the Old Dominion will reverse its long held trend of electing a governor from the opposite party of the current president. Campaign Carl Cameron\u2019s scorecard -\u00a0Can Ken Cuccinelli pull off a stunning upset? He needs to do at least two of these three things: 1) Blow away turnout models. 2) Get enough bounce from appearances by Rand and Ron Paul to undercut Republican-turned-Libertarian, third-party potential spoiler Robert Sarvis. 3) Get the equivalent of a referendum vote on ObamaCare, and not the referendum on Tea Party shutdown and women\u2019s health issues that Dems counter with. Misleading robocalls in VA?\u00a0- Republican State Delegate Scott Lingamfelter tells the Washington Free Beacon he received a call Sunday night, reportedly from the Democratic Party of Virginia, stating Republican Ken Cuccinelli supported ObamaCare and tax-payer funded abortions. Cuccinelli is an ardent foe of ObamaCare and a champion of pro-life causes. [Watch Fox: Virginia polls close at 7 p.m. ET Fox News will have the results and all of the latest political angles.

Voters in 11 counties in rural, eastern Colorado will get to decide whether they want to secede from the increasingly urban, increasingly liberal state. It\u2019s a long shot, but reflective of the divide in purple Colorado. Fracking restrictions will be up for a vote in Boulder, Broomfield, Fort Collins, and Lafayette counties. In New York, voters will decide on a state-backed plan to open casinos. In New Jersey, voters look poised to enshrine a state minimum wage, indexed to the cost of living, in their constitution.

C\u2019mon, guess \u2022 It\u2019s a Cinderella story, really DEMS\u2019 MAJORITY CHANCES: SLIM AND NUNNDemocrats need a miracle to hold the Senate, and they think they may have found one in Georgia. After shucking off the effort to help a flailing candidate in Kentucky, national Democrats are moving resources and pinning their hopes for keeping the majority to The Peach State. Polls show the race tightening as Democrat Michelle Nunn intensifies her Obama-style attacks on GOP candidate David Perdue. Perdue is standing in for Mitt Romney, the cancer-causing vampire of Democratic 2012 ads, as the Nunn campaign chomps down on his career as a corporate turnaround artist who ordered layoffs. There\u2019s a 50-percent threshold in Georgia and both sides are preparing for a potential runoff that could push the final decision until Jan. 6. With the polls close and a Libertarian candidate polling in the mid-single digits, a runoff looks more and more likely.

Watch \u201cPower Play with Chris Stirewalt\u201d to find out in just 90 seconds.]Now it\u2019s getting crowded - Democrats first need to deny Perdue and outright win, which explains why the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has decided to pump an addition $1 million into the Peach State, rolling out new ads today. That\u2019s to offset the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s additional $1.45 million spending on the contest that was announced Friday. The conservative Ending Spending Action Fund is putting $2 million towards an ad hammering Nunn for supporting the president\u2019s agenda. The ad features clips of President Obama saying his policies are on the ballot. [Ending Spending Action Fund is also: touting the Denver Post\u2019s endorsement of Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., as it hits Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., in a $2 million ad buy.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is the target of the group\u2019s $700,000 ad buy, slamming her for not hosting Town Hall meetings in over two years. In Louisiana, the group is pledging $2 million dollars to the GOP candidate in the likely runoff against Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.]Smoking Hopium or change we can believe in? - But could Democrats actually win a runoff in Georgia? A recent WaPo article looked at how runoffs in the Peach State have been almost guaranteed GOP wins for two decades. Democrats, though, say times have changed and if the Senate hangs in the balance on a Georgia runoff, the much-vaunted Democratic ground game can turn out voters at huge levels. Republicans, however, are just as quick to point out that the GOP base would be on high alert themselves and need very little prodding to get out the vote to deny Harry Reid another turn as majority leader.Duck of the living dead - President Obama will be, as expected, adding the controversial nomination of a successor to Attorney General Eric Holder to the mother of all lame-duck sessions of Congress after the election. Bill Whalen helpfully totes up what could be at stake when there are \u201czombies on Capitol Hill\u201d and reminds us that it all could be happening against the backdrop of unresolved runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana.KENTUCKY WOMAN, SHE\u2019S GOING TO OWN YOUThe Obama Democrats are jumping out of the Kentucky Senate race, but the 2016 Democratic frontrunner is jumping in. Just a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, led by Obama stalwart Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., ditched the agonizing race to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes welcomes Hillary Clinton for a Louisville visit. Grimes, who remains within striking distance in the polls but has steadily trailed, earned the ire of national Democrats by her sudden and seemingly devout adoption of a code of absolute secrecy about her 2012 vote preference. Former top Obama adviser David Axelrod told MSNBC that he wasn\u2019t \u201cterribly surprised\u201d that the DSCC dropped their ads. \u201cTo effectively take the Fifth on whether you voted for the president or not doesn\u2019t seem like an effective strategy to me,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Former Bush adviser says Democrats' 'more of the same' message hurts the nominee PHILADELPHIA \u2013 President Obama invoked his\u00a0\u201cYes we can\u201d\u00a02008 campaign slogan\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0night at the Democratic National Convention, leaving little doubt that his declaration that Hillary Clinton was\u00a0\u201cfit\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cready\u201d\u00a0to be commander-in-chief was a\u00a0baton-passing of his eight years in office\u00a0\u2014 a legacy that Republican nominee Donald Trump immediately attacked as \u201cOwning the 3rd Term.\u201d Capping another night of Trump bashing\u00a0\u2014 briefly interrupted by the official nomination of Tim Kaine to be Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate \u2014 Obama declared, \u201cThere has never been a man or a woman \u2013 not me, not Bill, nobody \u2013 more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America,\u201d at the same time accusing Trump of\u00a0peddling \"fear\" and a pessimistic vision of the country. \u200eRepublicans immediately fired back, with party Chairman Reince Priebus issuing a statement saying, \u201cTonight reinforced that the Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine ticket is nothing more than two career DC insiders who want nothing more than to continue the failed Democrat status quo.\u201d He pointed to what he called the president\u2019s \u201cfailed legacy in the Middle East\u201d and said, \u201cOur\u00a0country cannot afford four more years like the last eight, which have left us less prosperous, less safe, and less free.\u201d Without question, the sitting president depends on his former secretary of state to help preserve his legacy, and fend off recurring Republican attempts to repeal ObamaCare, upend environmental regulations and more. But Republicans point to the other side of the picture \u2013 a debt nearing $20 trillion, tensions growing in America\u2019s cities and an Islamic State threat that even top security officials suggest is growing in its reach and unpredictability. \u201cOur country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday night. Obama, though,\u00a0tried to frame the election as a choice between pessimism and optimism, as he set the stage for Clinton to accept the nomination Thursday night. \u201cAmerica is already great. America is already strong,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I promise you, our strength, our greatness, does not depend on Donald Trump.\u201d Clinton surprised the crowd by showing up onstage with Obama at the end of his speech, the two of them hugging and waving to delegates who were holding up \"thank you\" signs. Obama\u2019s address was delivered shortly after delegates finalized the party\u2019s 2016 ticket. In an overwhelming voice vote, they nominated Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine for vice president. Kaine himself, after starting off talking family and faith, shifted gears in the second half and shelved his nice-guy persona to deliver a broadside against Trump, as he accepted the VP nomination from his party. \u201cHillary has a passion for kids and families. \u2026 Donald Trump has a passion too: It's himself,\u201d Kaine said. The senator was merciless after that. He went on to mock Trump, imitating his Queens accent when he says, \u201cBelieve me.\u201d \u201cWe're gonna destroy ISIS so fast -- believe me! There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns -- believe me!\u201d Kaine bellowed, as the crowd roared with laughter. \u201cHere's the thing. Most people, when they run for president, they don't just say \u2018believe me.\u2019 They respect you enough to tell you how they will get things done. \u2026 You cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.\u201d While he was speaking, the Trump campaign was firing out press releases ripping Kaine as a \u201cjob killer\u201d and part of the Washington establishment. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had considered an independent presidential run before ruling it out, made a late appearance Wednesday \u2013 with an endorsement that could help Clinton reach out to vital independents whom Trump also is courting, and a bagful of zingers aimed squarely at his fellow billionaire. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us!\u201d Bloomberg said, calling him a \u201cdangerous demagogue\u201d and claiming it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d to elect Clinton. The focus of the third convention night was heavy on gun control, global warming and even national security, an issue largely absent from the first two nights. Together, the speakers Wednesday set the stage for Clinton to deliver her nomination acceptance speech and close out the convention Thursday night, after becoming Tuesday the first woman in U.S. history nominated for president by a major party.",

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee posted the news on Twitter, adding, \"Details to follow.\" Trump, his adult children and key staffers have been meeting with vice presidential prospects all week. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said his campaign still has three or four potential vice-presidential candidates \u201cbut in my own mind,\u00a0I probably am\u00a0thinking about two.\u201d Trump discussed his finalists on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d in a wide-ranging interview that included questions about his dustup with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Hillary Clinton and the GOP\u2019s nominating convention next week. Trump said Ginsberg recently calling him a \u201cfaker\u201d and suggesting that a Trump presidency would be bad for America is an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d to the high court and that she should apologize to the entire country. \u201cThere\u2019s almost something wrong with her,\u201d Trump said about the 83-year-old justice. \u201cI think I am questioning her mental capacity.\u201d Trump made the comments during an interview conducted in Indianapolis, which has become ground-zero for his vice presidential vetting and where has met with GOP Gov. Mike Pence three times in the past two days. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said a breakfast with Pence and the Trump family \u201cwent really well.\u201d \u201cHigh quality person,\u201d Trump said about Pence, who now appears high on Trump\u2019s VP shortlist. \u201cWonderful guy. We had a great meeting.\u201d Trump appeared Tuesday in Indiana at a campaign event and fundraiser with Pence, then talked again Wednesday with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, another potential pick. He dismissed assumptions that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is off the list, saying he\u2019s \u201csomebody I've liked a long time. He's a total professional. He's a good guy. \u2026 \u00a0A lot of people don't understand that.\u201d Trump said the \u201cgreatest accomplishment\u201d for Clinton, the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee, will be \u201cgetting out of her email scandal\u201d -- referring to her using a private Internet server system while secretary of state to send and receive government information. \u201cHow she\u2019s been able to get away from the lies, the deceit, the destruction of 33,000 emails. To me, that\u2019s her single greatest accomplishment,\u201d Trump said of his likely general election rival. The Clinton campaign declined to directly respond to Trump\u2019s comments, instead referring to earlier responses in which they called Republicans\u2019 comments about the emails \u201canother partisan witch hunt.\u201d Trump also argued that he\u2019s not looking for a vice president to play the traditional role of attacking a general election rival. \u201cI just want to pick somebody that\u2019s solid, who\u2019s smart. I\u2019m not looking for an attack dog. Frankly, I\u2019m looking for somebody that really understands what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would rather be talking about policy \u2026 not talking about \u2018Crooked Hillary.\u2019 \u201d He also expressed optimism about how Republicans are putting together the draft party platform for the convention that\u00a0 includes his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cA few people have said it\u2019s like a Donald Trump speech,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut nobody has ever agreed\u201d with an entire platform. Trump also downplayed concerns about the party\u2019s Rules Committee perhaps drafting convention procedures for delegates that might help the so-called \u201cNever Trump\u201d effort, saying he\u2019s never been worried about such efforts. He\u00a0 said that he plans to give a \u201claw-and-order\u201d speech at the convention, similar to those he\u2019s recently given.",

            "article_content": "NRA endorsed Trump as Clinton prepares to meet with the parents of Trayvon Martin; John Roberts with the Republican roundup for 'Special Report' Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of pandering to the gun lobby in a speech to a conference Saturday, organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation to help families of gun violence victims, warning the audience about a Trump presidency that would put more children \u201cat risk of violence and bigotry.\u201d Clinton spoke one day after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that she \u201cwants to abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d Donald Trump's gun policies are \"not just way out there\" but \"dangerous\" and would make America less safe, Hillary Clinton said Saturday. \"This is someone running to be president of the United States of America \u2014 a country facing a gun violence epidemic \u2014 and he's talking about more guns in our schools, he's talking about more hatred and division in our streets,\" the likely Democratic presidential nominee said of her presumptive Republican rival. \"That's no way to keep us safe.\" Clinton's criticism of the Trump came the day after he slammed her as \"Heartless Hillary\" for backing restrictions on gun ownership in a speech before the National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, Kentucky. Clinton and Trump are likely to meet in the general election. The conference was led by Sybrina Fulton, whose 17-year-old son, Trayvon Martin, was fatally shot by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012. She has campaigned with Clinton during the Democratic presidential primaries. \"The reason why I stand with her is because she first stood with me,\" Fulton said before introducing Clinton to more than 200 people packed inside a hotel banquet room. Queen Thompson Brown, a Miami mother whose son was the victim of gun violence in 2006 and who has mentored Fulton, said she and others do not want to take away guns from Americans but hope to \"promote common sense gun laws.\" Clinton praised the courage of Fulton and others who had suffered the loss of loved ones to gun violence or while in police custody. \"We have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in,\" she said. \"If you want to imagine what Trump's America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear,\" she said. Clinton repeated her pledge to fight the powerful National Rifle Association lobby, saying \"we will not be silenced, we will not be intimidated.\" The gun rights organization endorsed Trump, even though he had previously supported measures like an assault weapons ban that the NRA vigorously opposes. The group applauded Trump's call for ending \"gun-free zones\" across the country. Speaking at a National Rifle Association forum Friday in Louisville, Ky., Trump vowed to preserve Americans\u2019 gun-ownership rights and warned that Clinton, if elected, could curtail such rights with her Supreme Court nominations. \u201cI would like for Hillary Clinton to put a list together also,\u201d Trump, who recently announced his list of potential nominees, said at the NRA Institute for Legislative Action forum. \u201cI want to see what the list consists of. \u2026 It will be day and night. It won\u2019t be good for the people in this room and the country.\u201d Trump also won the endorsement of the NRA-ILA and said he has a permit to carry a concealed weapon. \u201cCrooked Hillary is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate,\u201d he also said. \u201cShe wants to take your guns away from you, just remember that.\u201d NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, who announced the Trump endorsement said in a written statement: \"The stakes in this year's presidential election could not be higher for gun owners. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton gets the opportunity to replace Antonin Scalia with an anti-gun Supreme Court justice, we will lose the individual right to keep a gun in the home for self-defense. \u2026\u00a0 So the choice for gun owners in this election is clear. And that choice is Donald Trump.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bret Baier sits down with the presumptive GOP vice presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate brought a smile to my face. And not for the reason you may think. When I heard Pence described as a Tea Party acolyte, a \u201cmovement conservative\u201d and \u201cevangelical favorite\u201d intended to shore up Trump\u2019s Republican base, I recalled that Pence had not always faithfully towed his party\u2019s line. When I went to jail for three months in the summer of 2005 to protect the First Amendment by refusing to identity my sources in a case involving the leak of a CIA official\u2019s name, few senators or Members of Congress defended me. \u00a0The government was able to hold me in contempt of court for refusing to name names because there was no Federal law that specifically protected reporters from being hauled before grand juries in Federal investigations and being forced to testify in court. After emerging from jail, I was surprised when Rep. Pence called me to discuss the case at his office on Capitol Hill. Though we had never met, Rep. Pence told me that he had followed the case closely. He thought it was an outrage that I had been jailed for protecting my sources despite the fact that I had never written a word about Valerie Plame, the CIA official whose identity was compromised (though not, as critics of the Iraq war charged, because her husband had criticized President Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq). Forcing reporters to reveal their sources, Pence told me, \u201cchills reporting of the news and restricts the free flow of information to the public.\u201d Intimidating reporters, he said, would limit the ability of the reporters to act as independent watchdogs on government waste, fraud and abuse. He said that he was particularly interested in guaranteeing the independence of a free, unfettered press because before his election he had hosted a syndicated radio talk show and a political TV show on Sunday mornings in Indianapolis. He promised to do what he could to ensure that other reporters were not jailed or subjected to unwarranted government investigations into their reporting sources and methods unless grave issues of national security were at stake. After emerging from jail, I was surprised when Rep. Pence called me to discuss the case at his office on Capitol Hill. True to his word, Mr. Pence introduced the \u201cFree Flow of Information Act\u201d with Democratic Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia. \u201cAs a conservative who believes in limited government,\u201d he said after reintroducing the legislation which failed the first time he proposed it, \u201cI believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.\u201d Pence\u2019s bill was far from perfect. The language describing when reporters would be forced to reveal sources on national security grounds was far broader than I would have liked. First Amendment purists attacked it then and now as being too loose, noting that most politically sensitive cases ensnaring reporters and classified information involve \u201cnational security\u201d information. Yet writing in The New Yorker, even Steve Coll, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University who is no fan of Mr. Pence\u2019s, called the legislation \u201cpolitically plausible\u2026\u201d and \u201cmuch, much better than the status quo.\u201d The bill was also endorsed by the Society of Professional Journalists. Though 49 states and the District of Columbia have taken steps to reinforce the right of journalists to protect confidential sources by specifying when journalists can withhold the identity of sensitive sources from court or government scrutiny, there is still no comparable protection at the Federal level. The Bush administration staunchly opposed the Pence bill. Nor did the situation improve under President Obama, who vowed to run the most \u201ctransparent\u201d administration in history but wound up ignoring or intimidating reporters and opposing Pence\u2019s bill and similar measures. \u00a0While promising to support a media shield bill before his election, Obama objected to bills that would have provided that protection. His Justice Department, moreover, used the Espionage Act of 1917 to punish government whistleblowers who leaked to journalists more than all previous presidential administrations combined. James Risen, my former colleague at New York Times, who risked jail rather than cooperate with the government, called Obama\u2019s administration \u201cthe greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation.\u201d Former Attorney General Eric Holder supported a media shield law only after his Justice Department was caught violating the civil and reporting rights of James Rosen, my Fox colleague. While Mike Pence did not succeed in providing the shield that reporters still need, he never stopped trying. So I found it doubly ironic that he has now agreed to share a ticket with a presidential candidate who considers reporters \u201cthe most dishonest people\" he's ever met. While I continue to oppose Pence's religious liberty bill and almost every other part of what I consider an extreme domestic social agenda, he and I managed to find common ground on this fundamental guarantor of democracy: a free press.",

            "article_content": "Karl Rove and Joe Trippi offer fair and balanced analysis Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump warned his supporters Monday to keep a close eye on the polls so the \"election is not stolen from us,\" while Hillary Clinton hit her opponent with allegations he uses Chinese steel in his construction projects the day after a raucous second presidential debate. Trump told supporters at a rally in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pa., that he wanted every vote \"counted 100 percent\" on Nov. 8, adding that they had to be vigilant so the White House is \"not taken away from us.\" He repeated his claims that the \"system is rigged,\" adding that there was \"no way\" he is down in the polls in Pennsylvania. The celebrity businessman also told supporters that as the election draws closer, he'll make \"three to four\" campaign stops a day, and in his final week may do up to six campaign events. \"I may be limping across that finish line, but we're going to get across that finish line,\" he said. The Wilkes-Barre event was the second stop of a self-declared victory lap across the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Monday. \"Hillary Clinton is highly over-rated,\" he told a crowd at an earlier campaign event in Ambridge, Pa.. \"All crooked Hillary could do was talk about small, petty things last night. ... She wants to divide America. I want to bring us together.\" Trump also continued to repeat claims he made the night before that former president Bill Clinton was a sexual predator whose wife attacked the victims, insisting his own words in a 2005 audiotape in which he is heard bragging about being able to kiss and grope women because he is a celebrity did not match the Clinton's alleged actions two decades ago. \"I was getting beaten up for 72 hours for inappropriate words, locker room talk, whatever you want to call it,\" Trump told supporters. \"But Bill Clinton has sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton was attacking those women viciously.\" Clinton spent her first day on the campaign trail after the town-hall style debate in the battleground state of Ohio going after Trump with allegations he uses Chinese steel in his construction projects. The Democratic nominee raised the charged with campaigning on the campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, where she urged students to register to vote before Tuesday's deadline. Clinton said \"for his talk of putting America first,\" Trump doesn't support American industry with his products and projects. \"When China floods our market with steel below price and people like Trump buy, that kills jobs,\" she said. She also hit Trump over the comments he made the 2005 tape about women. \"I just happen to think that our athletes and coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald trump does,\" Clinton told supporters. Earlier on Monday, Trump clashed with House Speaker Paul Ryan after the top congressional Republican told rank-and-file lawmakers he will not campaign with the party\u2019s presidential nominee or defend him \u2013 and even suggested he\u2019s preparing for a Clinton presidency. The details of Ryan\u2019s comments came from sources on a conference call late Monday morning for GOP House leaders and rank-and-file members. Trump has apologized repeatedly for the comments \u2013 but despite an aggressive debate performance Sunday where he sought to turn the tables on Clinton, Ryan said on the call he won\u2019t campaign with Trump. According to sources, Ryan and other House GOP leaders also told those on the call to \u201cdo what\u2019s best for you in your district\u201d \u2013 advice that speaks to their concern about the impact Trump\u2019s controversies could have down the ballot. Ryan even appeared to signal the White House race might be a lost cause when he suggested in the call that the party should focus on ensuring that Clinton \u201cdoes not get a blank check with a Democrat-controlled Congress.\u201d Ryan\u2019s office later said he was not conceding the election's outcome and made clear he wasn\u2019t walking back his endorsement either. But Trump responded after the call by tweeting: \u201cPaul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.\u201d Trump however still retained the backing of the Republican National Committee, which has overseen crucial field efforts for the candidate in battleground states. On a conference call with RNC members Monday afternoon, chairman Reince Priebus said the party remains in full coordination with Trump. \"Everything is on course,\" Priebus said, according to a participant in the call.

Valerie Jarrett, Obama\u2019s chief adviser, reportedly is among those who want Comey gone. \u201cValerie argued that Comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped,\u201d a source told The New York Post. The same source said Obama, though, is \u201cworried about the consequences of taking such an action \u2013 the tsunami of outrage that would come his way, and possibly become a major footnote, or worse, in the history of the presidency.\u201d The outrage from Democrats in recent days has been matched by applause from Republicans, in a reversal from the summer -- when GOP lawmakers were grumbling about Comey's decision not to pursue charges in the Clinton case and Democrats praised Comey's professionalism. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, called Comey a \"hero\" and ripped Jarrett. \u201cI don\u2019t think Valerie Jarrett has any credibility here,\u201d he told Fox News. Comey notified Congress last Friday that during an investigation of Clinton confidant Huma Abedin\u2019s estranged husband Anthony Weiner, FBI agents found indications that a laptop used by the disgraced congressman contained some emails related to the FBI\u2019s earlier probe of Clinton\u2019s private computer server. The disclosure, coming 11 days before the election, roiled the presidential campaign as top Democrats sprung into damage control. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not in the right job.\u201d She added, \u201cI think that we have to just get through this election and just see what the casualties are along the way.\u201d New York Sen. Chuck Schumer called Comey\u2019s actions \u201cappalling,\u201d adding that he has lost \u201cconfidence\u201d in the director. Schumer\u2019s comments come on the heels of outgoing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid accusing Comey of possibly violating federal law. In an Oct. 30 letter to Comey, Reid said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits government officials from using their positon of power to influence an election. Republicans blasted Reid for the letter. Meanwhile, as Democrats pile on the criticism, a new report in The Guardian seems to indicate many FBI agents are backing Donald Tump. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d one agent told the paper. The unnamed agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel\u201d and is the reason why so many leaks about the investigation have been anti-Clinton and pro-Trump. FoxNews.com has not independently verified the claims made by the FBI agent.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic nominee is piling up research in a bid to needle the Republican candidate The race for the White House has narrowed. \u00a0A new Fox News Poll finds Donald Trump gaining ground in the head-to-head matchup, despite improvements from Hillary Clinton on top issues. In addition, this is the first time the poll offers a four-way presidential ballot (it preceded the two-way ballot). The poll finds Clinton garners 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 39 percent, while Libertarian Gary Johnson receives 9 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein gets 4 percent. The third-party candidates take more from Clinton than Trump, as she holds a six-point lead in the two-way matchup: 48-42 percent. \u00a0That\u2019s at the edge of the poll\u2019s margin of error. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS She had a 10-point head-to-head advantage earlier this month (49-39 percent), in the wake of the Democratic convention and Trump\u2019s clash with the parents of a Gold Star soldier. Clinton does well in the four-way ballot among blacks (+68 points), women (+15), and Hispanics (+19). Trump is favored by whites (+13 points), men (+13), whites without a college degree (+23), and white evangelical Christians (+55). Independents go for Trump (38 percent) over Clinton (26 percent) and Johnson (20 percent), with Stein trailing (7 percent). Party unity remains a problem for Trump, as only 74 percent of self-identified Republicans back him, while 81 percent of self-identified Democrats support Clinton. The four-way contest is also tight among just those who are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d interested in the presidential race: Clinton 43 percent vs. Trump 42 percent, with Johnson at 7 percent and Stein at 3 percent. \u00a0That\u2019s driven by the fact that Democrats (79 percent) and Republicans (80 percent) are about equally likely to say they are at least \u201cvery\u201d interested. The poll finds pros and cons for Trump. \u00a0His favorable rating hit a new high-water mark (42 percent). \u00a0Plus, the narrowing of Clinton\u2019s lead in the head-to-head matchup is mostly due to Trump gaining ground rather than her losing support. \u00a0Yet he\u2019s lost his advantage on handling top issues. More voters trust Clinton than Trump on terrorism by a three-point margin (49-46 percent) and the two candidates tie on handling the economy (48 percent each). \u00a0Trump led by 12 points on each of these issues as recently as May. On immigration, by a wide 77-19 percent margin, voters support setting up a system for illegal immigrants currently working in the United States to become legal residents over deporting them, and those supporting legalization back Clinton over Trump by 18 points. \u201cTrump has an opportunity to attract more support by moving off his hardline position on immigration. \u00a0Nearly half of Johnson and Stein supporters say they\u2019d be more likely to vote for him if he did,\u201d says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw. \u201cSome of Trump\u2019s supporters will be frustrated if he eases his promise of mass deportations, but they won\u2019t find a more aggressive anti-immigration candidate elsewhere, so they\u2019ll likely stick with him.\u201d And don\u2019t expect major movement in the race over the next few weeks, as most Clinton (87 percent) and Trump (88 percent) supporters feel certain in their choice. \u00a0Plus, almost all non-Clinton supporters (87 percent) say they would \u201cnever\u201d consider voting for her, and almost all non-Trump folks say the same about him (85 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from August 28-30, 2016. \u00a0The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.",

In the latest survey from USA Today and the Pew Research Center, 54 percent of respondents said Obama is not tough enough on foreign policy and just 35 percent of respondents approved of his handling of Iraq, with an equally low number approving of his Russia response. Obama\u2019s broadly panned remarks Thursday seemed designed to throw cold water on the dire warnings issued by his military team last week. Obama also ducked a question about whether Russian troops fighting in Ukraine constitutes \u201can invasion.\u201d But the line that will certainly define this chaotic era of U.S. foreign policy \u2013 \u201cwe don\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d \u2013 was the most obvious effort to demonstrate the president\u2019s go slow approach. [The Daily Beast reveals the depths of the divisions within Team Obama on the issue.] Exactly -The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama was referring only \u2018to military options for striking\u2019 Islamist militants in Syria when he said the White House did not \u2018have a strategy yet,\u2019 press secretary Josh Earnest insisted Thursday. \u201c [\u201c#mediabuzz\u201dhost Howard Kurtz and his panelists will look at the pundits pounding President Obama over ISIS.\u00a0Watch \u201c#mediabuzz\u201d Sunday at 11 a.m. ET, with a second airing at 5 p.m.] Shuttle diplomacy -The president\u00a0is interrupting a weekend trip to return to D.C., tonight. The AP reports, \u201cThe White House says Obama has changed his plans for Friday and will return to Washington late in the evening after fundraisers in Rhode Island and New York. He had planned to spend the night in New York. Presidential aides say the change in plans was not related to any current events and was the president's personal choice.\u201d Down on the farm - On Saturday, the president will attend the super swank wedding of a White House aide and an MSNBC host dubbed by Vogue as Washington\u2019s \u201c\u2018it-couple\u2019\u201d of 2014.

Then out on the trail - President Obama will headline a union rally in Wisconsin on Labor Day. It is unclear if he will appear with Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s, R-Wis., rival Democrat Mary Burke, but the move certainly shows the president\u2019s interest in Democrats\u2019 top gubernatorial target this year. \u2018Your Addams Family tie blends awkwardly with your nursing home security guard jacket\u2019 - Esquire, a men\u2019s fashion magazine that certainly dresses to the left, was horrified by the president\u2019s taupe suit, chiding the commander in chief: \u201cYou are not the president of Sears.\u201d The Tampa Bay Times even called it a flip flop: [For Michael Lewis\u2019 2012 profile of Obama in Vanity Fair magazine, the] venerable writer had almost unfettered access to the president for the pre-election story that provided many anecdotes from the inner workings of Obama\u2019s White House and Air Force One, as well as his philosophies and habits. That included how Obama dresses.\u00a0 \u2018You\u2019ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m trying to pare down decisions. I don\u2019t want to make decisions about what I\u2019m eating or wearing.

It was nine years ago today that Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. The storm itself was not unprecedented, but its path, subsequent storm surge and the city\u2019s shoddy civil engineering and poor organization created a disaster of proportions unseen in modern America. Aside from the human cost, the storm caused more than $100 billion in damage. Following the devastation, many people stepped up to help, including over 70 countries. Kuwait made the largest pledge of $500 million, while Qatar and the United Arab Emirates each made donations of $100 million. Israel Defense Forces even traveled to the Gulf to deliver food, diapers, beds and blankets. A small team of Israeli divers and physicians also provided assistance by discovering victims, administering first aid and rescuing abandoned pets. Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

            "article_content": "House speaker describes GOP meeting with presumptive Republican presidential nominee as 'a very good start' Donald Trump and Paul Ryan might not have built the bridge but they at least may have established the framework toward presenting a unified front against Democrats in November, after their sit-down Thursday morning on Capitol Hill. Following a bruising primary season where Trump and House Speaker Ryan were publicly cool toward one another, the two met at Republican Party headquarters in downtown Washington, and later described it as a \u201cgreat conversation.\u201d Much was at stake for the presumptive nominee, for Ryan and for the party itself. The meeting was called after Ryan last week declined to endorse Trump \u2013 at a press conference following the meeting, Ryan still would not publicly do so. Reprising comments from a day earlier, Ryan said: \u201cThis is a process. It takes a little time. You don\u2019t put it together in 45 minutes. \u2026 I don\u2019t want us to have a fake unification process here.\u201d At the same time, Ryan said he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d and they are \u201cplanting the seeds\u201d to get unified. Trump on Thursday had lined up three meetings with members of the Republican establishment he\u2019s spent much of his campaign railing against. He met first with Ryan and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who also tweeted that the meeting was a \u201cvery positive step toward party unity.\u201d He then sat down with House GOP leaders, followed by a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other top Senate Republicans. \u201cWhile we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,\u201d Trump and Ryan said in a joint statement. \u201cWe will be having additional discussions, but remain confident there\u2019s a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall, and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal. \u2026 This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification.\u201d Trump tweeted afterward: Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016 pic.twitter.com/hfHY9MdAc7 A source inside the first meeting also described it as \u201cvery positive\u201d and a \u201cgood step toward achieving party unity.\u201d According to the source, Trump and Ryan discussed a range of policy issues. The source would not characterize, though, whether Ryan was \u201cthere\u201d yet on Trump himself. But the source provided an unvarnished assessment to Fox News: \u201cNo B.S. Very helpful.\u201d On the sidelines, lawmakers had conflicting views over how to handle Trump as their party nominee. Pro-Trump Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., told Fox News he\u2019s \u201cbaffled\u201d by colleagues who won\u2019t get behind Trump. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., though, said he\u2019s among those \u201cwho would love to see [Trump] tone it down.\u201d On Wednesday, explaining his hesitation about outright endorsing Trump, Ryan said he wanted to pursue \"real unification\" among Republicans after a hotly contested primary campaign. \"We cannot afford to lose this election to Hillary Clinton,\u201d Ryan said at a news conference Wednesday. In a closed-door GOP meeting Wednesday, a number of Republicans stood up and argued in support of Trump, with one saying that anyone who cares about \"unborn babies\" should get behind him because of the likelihood the next president will make Supreme Court appointments, and Trump's would be better than Clinton's, lawmakers who were present told the Associated Press. Others expressed reservations, and asked Ryan to raise concerns with Trump about where he really stands on social issues and budgetary policies, including changes to Social Security and Medicare. Trump has said in the past that he doesn't want to touch Social Security or Medicare, whereas Medicare cuts have been a centerpiece of GOP budgets Ryan has shepherded over the years. Earlier Wednesday, Trump sought to downplay the stakes of his visit with Ryan, telling \"Fox and Friends\", \"If we make a deal, that will be great. And if we don't, we will trudge forward like I've been doing and winning all the time.\" Trump's allies and advisers have repeatedly insisted that he can claim the White House with or without leading congressional Republicans. Additionally, Trump's team doesn't believe Ryan or the GOP's other congressional leaders have any significant influence on the majority of general election voters. Some congressional Republicans have made clear that they would like to see Ryan come around to supporting Trump sooner rather than later. \"Donald Trump is unifying the party already,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump's chief Washington ally. \"The party is the people who vote.\" Another Trump supporter, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., predicted it was \"very unlikely\" that Ryan would not ultimately back the Republican nominee. Wednesday night, Trump's campaign released an endorsement signed by the chairs of seven House committees. \"It is paramount that we coalesce around the Republican nominee, Mr. Donald J. Trump,\" the GOP lawmakers wrote. While Trump's team is prepared to shrug off much of the party's establishment, that does not include the RNC. The political novice plans to rely heavily on the committee's expansive political operation to supplement his bare-bones campaign, which has so far ignored seemingly vital functions such as voter data collection, swing-state staffing and fundraising infrastructure. \"As we turn our focus toward the general election, we want to make sure there's the strongest partnership,\" said Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist. Absent a viable Republican alternative, there were new signs on Capitol Hill that Trump's conservative critics were beginning to fall in line. \"As a conservative, I cannot trust Donald Trump to do the right thing, but I can deeply trust Hillary Clinton to do the wrong thing every time,\" said Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., adding that he would vote for Trump if that's the choice he has. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho., said he will support Trump, although \"I'm not enthusiastic about it.\" \"He can get us enthusiastic if he comes to talk to us,\" continued Labrador. Meanwhile, more Republican voters appear to be moving behind Trump, despite big-name holdouts such as Ryan, both former president Bushes and the party's 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Almost two in three Republican-leaning voters now view Trump favorably, compared to 31 percent who view him unfavorably, according to a national Gallup Poll taken last week. The numbers represent a near reversal from Gallup's survey in early March. Fox News' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sarah Westwood weighs in PHILADELPHIA \u2013 After Bernie Sanders doubled down on his endorsement of Hillary Clinton Monday, many of his supporters remain politically homeless and in no mood to back the presumptive Democratic nominee \u00a0-- a situation Donald Trump is keen to exploit. His campaign and allied Republicans are now launching a renewed push to bring the loyal opposition from the Democratic primary race aboard the Trump train. \u201cThey\u2019re liking what I\u2019m saying in terms of trade,\u201d Trump told Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Tuesday, after making an open appeal to Sanders supporters in his convention speech last week. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get a lot of [Sanders] supporters.\u201d Conversations with Sanders supporters in Philadelphia suggest a number of them are now resolved to oppose Clinton in November, following the scandal over leaked DNC emails that indicated a pro-Clinton bias at the top during the primary campaign. Trump surely would have a tough time winning them over in large numbers -- but some in the \"Never Hillary\" camp indicated a willingness to consider voting for him. \u201cI think it would be a disaster if [Hillary Clinton] was elected,\u201d Jared Foster, a combat veteran from Joanna, S.C., told FoxNews.com. He said he wants to support Sanders, but would support Donald Trump presuming Clinton formally claims the nomination this week. The signs and chants in street protests outside the Democrats' convention in Philadelphia made plain the sentiments of the Sanders crowd. \u201cHell no DNC, we won\u2019t vote for Hillary\u201d and \u201clock her up\u201d were repeatedly chanted during Monday\u2019s pro-Sanders march. Some signs portrayed Clinton as a war criminal, while another presented her as Shakespearean antagonist Lady Macbeth. Tracy Graunstadt, who had traveled from Michigan to protest, was holding a sign that said \u201cYou can\u2019t make me vote for Hillary\u201d and told FoxNews.com the leaked DNC emails were the tipping point for her. \u201cThat was the final straw for me. I was a little bit on the fence before ... but after seeing how the DNC essentially rigged the election and worked against Bernie, and I think that Hillary knew exactly what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI could never vote for someone like that.\u201d \u201cFor my own conscience, I will not be able to do something I don\u2019t believe in,\u201d agreed Alex Ozkaynak, a Brooklyn resident. Trump is not their only option. Many protesters eyed Green Party candidate Jill Stein as their anti-Clinton choice, sporting green flags and Stein placards. Yet some showed themselves open to the unlikely possibility of voting for Trump as an alternative, even just as a way to knife Clinton after what many perceive as a stolen primary process. While the most likely positive outcome for the Trump campaign is that Sanders supporters stay home or vote for Stein, shaving off vital percentage points from Clinton in swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan could make a difference. \"I'll bet you a lot of his people come to us,\" Trump said Monday in Roanoke, Va., again citing their common cause on trade. After Sanders\u2019 speech Monday backing Clinton, though, Trump accused Sanders of abandoning his revolution. \u201cWe welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs,\u201d he said. Another tweet presented the billionaire as the post-Bernie candidate. Though there is a gulf in the two candidates' views on subjects such as abortion, political correctness and especially immigration, there are also similarities. Both campaigns have appealed to voters as movements that come from outside the Washington system, and have resonated with working class voters on issues like free trade. Republicans hammered those similarities at their convention last week. \u201cWhat Bernie Sanders and Trump have in common, which is not a lot, is their appeal to the everyday working man and woman, and to the everyday American,\u201d Keith Grover, a Utah state GOP representative, told FoxNews.com in Cleveland. Sanders and Trump also have criticized Clinton using similar themes, namely her ties to Wall Street, allegations of corruption, and her stance on trade. \u201cClinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq,\u201d Trump tweeted. While Trump is unlikely to attract die-hard left-wing voters, he may be able to peel off others attracted to Sanders as an outsider. \"If Bernie Sanders supporters were to be disenchanted with their nominee and throw support behind Donald Trump, you bet that's totally in play and we know that the margins will be very small come fall,\" Grover said.

            "article_content": "Jennifer Griffin explains on 'Special Report' With Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over Donald Trump all but gone, her campaign is pushing prominent Democrats, including former primary rival Bernie Sanders, into the field in an effort to lock up the youth vote for the Democratic nominee. The effort began in earnest Friday, when first lady Michelle Obama addressed a rally at George Mason University in northern Virginia. She warned young voters against\u00a0being \"tired or turned off,\" and urged them to rally around Clinton, \"particularly given the alternative.\" Despite the first lady's efforts, the Wall Street Journal reported some members of the crowd could be heard chanting \"Four more years!\" Clinton led most national polls by double digits in the days following the Democratic convention, but most recent polls have the race in a statistical dead heat. Much of that can be attributed to a drop in her support among young people. In a Fox News poll taken in early August, days after the convention, Clinton led Trump by 27 points among voters under 35. In the most recent Fox News poll, Clinton led Trump by just five points among likely voters under 35. Many of the voters who once backed Clinton appear to have thrown their support to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. In the recent Fox News poll, Johnson only garnered the support of 8 percent of all likely voters. However, Johnson polled at 16 percent among under-35s. Sanders, who mounted a surprisingly strong primary challenge to Clinton with the help of overwhelming youth support, was scheduled to speak on Clinton's behalf at two Ohio colleges Saturday. A recent CNN/ORC poll showed Trump with a five-point lead over Clinton in the Buckeye State. \"I can criticize Hillary Clinton for this, that, and the other thing,\" Sanders told CNN Friday. \"Trump literally changes his views every other day.\" The self-described democratic socialist went on to call the real estate mogul \"a fraud and a phony\" who was running a \"campaign of bigotry.\" Clinton pollster and adviser Joel Benenson admitted to the Journal Friday that the campaign \"closed the deal\" with young voters. Another Clinton campaign official said they planned to stress a message that a vote for a third-party candidate like Johnson or Jill Stein of the Green Party was in effect a vote for Trump. But other Clinton supporters believe the best advocate may be Michelle Obama, whom they\u00a0want in battleground states as much as possible between now and Election Day. Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director and a former Obama adviser, called the first lady \"an advocate without peer.\" \"There is no other surrogate with the reach, credibility and respect she has,\" Palmieri said.

This would seem to be an easy question to answer. Check the drawer for form 0F 109 and if Clinton signed, hers should be the first one in the drawer. But the Democratic frontrunner wouldn\u2019t say when Fox News tracked her to a campaign event Monday. And her former agency has gone nearly a week without responding to a Freedom of Information Act request. Saying that she did sign would be bad news because it would mean that she maintained her trove of government emails despite swearing that she had given everything up. Saying she didn\u2019t sign would be another embarrassing lapse in security and records management for an agency with big problems on the front. The third option \u2013 that Clinton signed but the form cannot be found \u2013 would simply add to the list of too-convenient deletions and omissions in this ongoing email scandal.Teacher union chief: 'Yes,' I knew about Hillary\u2019s private email - Weekly Standard: \u201cRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, says that she knew about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email. Weingarten made the comment in Twitter, in response to a question from a Jeb Bush spokesman.\u00a0Tim Miller, the Bush spokesman, tweeted, \u2018@rweingarten also if not secret - did you know about the private email before the NYT story?\u2019\u00a0 Weingarten responded, \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d [The latest CNN/ORC poll finds Americans split on Hillary\u2019s email problems. 51 percent call the use of personal email as a very or somewhat serious problem while 48 percent don\u2019t find much of a problem with it.]White House office to delete its FOIA regulations - USA Today: \u201cThe White House is removing a federal regulation that subjects its Office of Administration to the Freedom of Information Act, making official a policy under Presidents Bush and Obama to reject requests for records to that office. The White House said the cleanup of FOIA regulations is consistent with court rulings that hold that the office is not subject to the transparency law. The office handles, among other things, White House record-keeping duties like the archiving of e-mails. But the timing of the move raised eyebrows among transparency advocates, coming on National Freedom of Information Day and during a national debate over the preservation of Obama administration records. It's also Sunshine Week, an effort by news organizations and watchdog groups to highlight issues of government transparency.\u201dHillary looks to shut out challengers in early primaries - AP: \u201cHillary Rodham Clinton is expected to run a primary campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination focused on the four traditional early-to-vote states, forgoing the chance to parlay her dominant position into an early start in the swing states key to the general election. Data-driven grassroots organizing in states such as Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, along with fundraising, will be the focus when Clinton launches her presidential campaign, probably in early April, according to people familiar with the strategy\u2026\u201dHillary billed taxpayers $527,000 for charter flights as Senator - USA Today: \u201cBefore her 2006 Senate re-election campaign and 2008 presidential bid, then-senator Hillary Rodham Clinton dramatically increased her use of taxpayer-funded charter flights, becoming the Senate's biggest spender on reported charter airfare.\u00a0\u2026 The figure rose to $527,000 when the cost of the staff who flew with her is included.\u201dForeign aid recipients among Clinton donors\u00a0 - NRO: \u201cAlgeria and the Dominican Republic, which both contributed to the Clinton Foundation, receive hundreds of millions of dollars yearly in foreign aid - including from the U.S. government\u2026It took $8.6 million in assistance from the U.S. government the same year that it made the donation. And in 2011, a typical year for the North African country, it received $190 million in aid from foreign governments worldwide\u2026The Dominican Republic gave a much larger donation to the Clinton Foundation, somewhere between $10 and $25 million in a grant to the organization\u2019s HIV/AIDS program (the Foundation\u2019s website does not provide exact grant numbers). The Caribbean nation received $35.5 million from the U.S. government in 2010, and the next year raked in $225 million from foreign governments around the world.\u201dOBAMA TRADE PUSH A HEADACHE FOR HILLARYWhile President Obama has been taking heat from House Democrats over his request for expanded authority to make trade deals, Obama\u2019s push has become a problem for Hillary Clinton. The 2016 Democratic frontrunner is under pressure from liberals to oppose her former boss\u2019s push and are concerned about Clinton\u2019s own complicated record on trade the Hill reports. \u201cWhile some reports indicate Clinton backed [the North American Free Trade Agreement] internally during her husband\u2019s years in the White House, she told a union audience in 2008 that she raised the \u2018yellow caution flag\u2019 against the pact\u2026.As Obama\u2019s secretary of State, she supported a controversial Colombia trade agreement that organized labor vehemently opposed.

SWINGThe (Charleston) Post and Courier: \u201cCOLUMBIA \u2013 Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s latest swing through South Carolina will begin Tuesday in Greenville to highlight business and education policy and end with a speech here to S.C. House Republicans. \u2026 Gov. Nikki Haley and Bush will hold a news conference around 3 p.m., following their visit to Sistercare, a Midlands organization that provides services to and support for domestic violence survivors and their children. \u2026\u00a0 Bush plans to begin his day at the Upstate Chamber Coalition, a business group focused on public policy. Later, he\u2019ll visit the Greenville area\u2019s private Hidden Treasure Christian School in an event closed to the public. Bush\u2019s visit to the school is expected to highlight a South Carolina education program that was based on a Florida initiative\u2026 Bush is known for championing school choice initiatives. But his continued support for the controversial Common Core education standards, which South Carolina did away with this year, may leave some Republicans on the fence.\u201dWALKER LOOKS TO QUELL CONCERNS ABOUT ETHANOL FLIPBloomberg: \u201cScott Walker continued to defend himself against suggestions that he\u2019s flip-flopped on a key issue for\u00a0Iowa, the state that will host the first presidential nomination voting in early 2016, as he spoke Monday evening with Tea Party activists nationwide. On a conference call organized by the Tea Party Patriots, the Wisconsin governor and likely Republican presidential candidate said he's been unwavering in his view that corn-based ethanol should eventually lose government protections and incentives\u2026\u2018From our standpoint, our position is consistent,\u2019 said Walker, who was first elected governor amid the 2010 Tea Party wave. \u2018I talked about not wanting a mandate in Wisconsin as governor. We don\u2019t have one. I do not support one.\u2019\u2026At a March 7 agricultural\u00a0summit\u00a0in Iowa, however, Walker said he supports the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets the amount of renewable fuel that must be blended into gas sold in the U.S. At the time, he also called for the eventual elimination of government support for ethanol and other biofuels, as well as wind energy.\u201dSnarky Twitter feed for new Walker hire Irks Iowans - Des Moines Register: \u201cIowa has been a punching bag in online quips by Republican Scott Walker\u2019s new strategist for online communications. \u2018In other news, I see Iowa is once again embarrassing itself, and the GOP, this morning. Thanks, guys,\u2019 Republican political consultant Liz Mair tweeted in January this year, just after U.S. Rep. Steve King\u2019s daylong multicontender Iowa Freedom Summit began.\u201dMITT WARMS TO RUBIOWaPo: \u201cSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been cultivating a relationship with Mitt Romney and his intimates, landing some of the 2012 Republican nominee\u2019s top advisers and donors and persistently courting others as he readies an expected 2016 presidential campaign. In a crowded field of contenders, the imprimatur of Romney could help clear Rubio\u2019s path into the top tier. Since Romney announced in January that he would not run for the White House again, he and Rubio have had at least two lengthy phone calls in which Romney encouraged and mentored the 43-year-old Florida senator about the political landscape, according to a Romney associate. Rubio and Romney have built a warm and trusting rapport, in contrast to the frostiness that exists between Romney and the two current GOP front-runners, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2026In one-on-one meetings and communications with members of Romney\u2019s inner circle, Rubio has impressed them with what they see as his compelling personal story, his depth and positions on policies, and his respect for Romney and his legacy in the Republican Party.\u201dCHRISTIE TRIES TO BUCK UP BACKERSWSJ: \u201cNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gave donors to his political action committee a pep talk Monday and encouraged them to keep up their work in the face of a difficult stretch for his possible 2016 presidential bid. About 50 people attended the Monday breakfast in New Jersey for bundlers for the Republican governor\u2019s PAC, Leadership Matters for America, according to those who went to the event. Attendees had to commit to raising between $25,000 and $100,000 by the end of March.\u00a0An invitation for the event in Bernardsville, N.J., had capped the number of slots to 25 attendees, but was expanded to meet more demand. Attendees were a mix of those who have supported Mr. Christie since he first ran for governor in New Jersey in 2009, and newer faces, said John Lutz, one of the co-hosts.\u201dSOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER RANKINGS\u201cCarly Fiorina is very smart, articulate and able to take the fight to Hillary Clinton--the traditional role of a good VP candidate.

By one measure, even more Irish than Ireland. WaPo: \u201cAccording to the Census, there are 34.5 million Americans who list their heritage as either primarily or partially Irish. That number is, incidentally, seven times larger than the population of Ireland itself (4.68 million). Irish is the second-most common ancestry among Americans, falling just behind German. New York has the most concentrated Irish population; 12.9 percent of its residents claim Irish ancestry, which compares to a rate of 11.1 percent of the country overall. Boston, meanwhile, claims the most-concentrated Irish population for a city: 20.4 percent. Trulia\u2019s chief economist Jed Kulko put all this data on a map, which shows the heaviest concentration of Irish-American zip codes. He notes that \u2018Irish-Americans are at least 5 percent of the population in most counties across the U.S., and 10 percent or more in most of New England, New York state, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and other smaller counties across the country.\u2019\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

In January, Patti McDonald allegedly meted out a dose of unnatural selection when she came upon Hornet, a falcon owned by hunter Scott Dinger. In his investigation of the incident which reportedly led to the bird of prey\u2019s demise, Craig Walker, an Idaho Department of Fish and Game regional conservation officer said his office received a phone call from an unidentified woman who said she saw a falcon take a duck from the air and then went to the aid of the duck and tried to scare away the falcon.

            "article_content": "Former Democratic presidential candidate urges Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Democrats tried to turn their attention Monday night from an email scandal that claimed their party chairwoman and sent Bernie Sanders supporters into near rebellion with a scorching attack on Donald Trump that ranged from unnamed references by Michelle Obama to in-your-face attacks by Elizabeth Warren and Sanders himself. The Vermont senator blasted Trump as a candidate who \"insults\" minorities and \"divides us up.\" \u201cBased on her ideas and her leadership, Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States,\u201d the Vermont senator told the rowdy and emotional convention crowd, with many of his supporters visibly crying during his remarks and chanting his name. Sanders appealed to supporters Monday night to get behind Clinton, as he tried to restore order at the Democratic convention after a chaotic opening day marked by intense street protests and near-constant disruptions inside the arena from delegates and others loyal to him. Sanders suddenly found himself in the role of helping the Democratic Party whose establishment had shunned him for much of the primary race. But he now is virtually their only hope for easing the tensions at the Philadelphia convention, where delegates are poised to crown Clinton as the party\u2019s presidential nominee on Tuesday. \u201cI understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. I think it\u2019s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am,\u201d he told delegates. \u201cBut to all of our supporters \u2013 here and around the country \u2013 I hope you take enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved.\u201d Sanders argued that, despite his differences with Clinton during the primary campaign, her views are far more in line with his than are Republican nominee Trump\u2019s \u2013 on issues ranging from the minimum wage to climate change to college tuition costs. \u201cIt is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues,\u201d he said. But Sanders said they have come together on some of them, and his side was able to win major changes to the party platform. \u201cHillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her tonight,\u201d Sanders said, though some in the audience still booed at Clinton\u2019s name. Trump, tweeting from the sidelines, fired back: Sanders was joined by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in appealing to the left wing of the party to unite behind Clinton. First lady Michelle Obama, too, worked to ease the tensions in the convention hall in an earlier speech that at times seemed to rally the divided crowd. \u201cAmerica faces a choice,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because our choice is Hillary Clinton. I\u2019m with Hillary.\u201d She called Trump a \"man who inherited a fortune from his father\u201d and cares only for himself. \"Donald Trump has no real plans for jobs, for college kids, for seniors. No plans to make anything great for anyone except rich guys like Donald Trump.\" The liberal icon, who spoke right before Sanders, still faced small pockets of unrest as she delivered a full-throated Clinton endorsement, with some people chanting \u201cwe trusted you\u201d over her remarks. But Warren called Clinton \u201ca woman who fights for all of us.\u201d Together, the two speakers had an opportunity to tamp down the unrest among liberal activists, many of whom not only backed Sanders during the turbulent primary battle but wanted to either see Warren step into the ring or be tapped for running mate. Whether their words can now help calm the storm inside and outside the convention hall remains to be seen. Sanders\u2019 speech could help. \u201cIt was a very unifying message, the essence of unity,\u201d Kit Andrews, a Vermont alternate delegate and Sanders supporter, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process to bring people together. He has always said that.\u201d Sanders and Warren, along with Michelle Obama and Clinton booster New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, addressed the convention at the close of a noisy and boisterous Monday session. From the very start, Sanders supporters booed and jeered convention officials as they tried to gavel in. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who was presiding, scolded the protesters as they interrupted at the very mention of Clinton. \u201cWe are all Democrats, and we need to act like it,\u201d she said. Michelle Obama, speaking hours and countless disruptions later, seemed to draw a more positive response, eliciting applause during her lines on Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m with her,\u201d Obama declared, asking Democrats to do for the former secretary of state what they did for her husband \u2013 and turn out to the polls. \u201cBetween now and November, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. \u2026 We need to get out every vote!\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d The audience remained visibly divided during her remarks, however, with one man being shushed for saying, \u201cWe love you, Michelle.\u201d Obama didn't leave the stage without taking a veiled shot at Trump. She warned that the White House couldn't be in the hands of someone with a \"thin skin or tendency to lash out or someone who tells voters the country could be great again. Booker, who had been considered for running mate before the job went to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, earlier blasted Republican nominee Donald Trump while touting Clinton\u2019s support for a \u201cfair wage\u201d and \u201cdebt-free college\u201d \u2013 and trying to connect her ideals to Sanders\u2019. \u201cIt represents the best of our values, the best of our history and the best of our party -- all of our shared ideas and values together,\u201d Booker said. Several celebrities including comedian Sarah Silverman and actress Eva Longoria also rallied to Clinton\u2019s defense \u2013 with Silverman even taking on the Sanders crowd, saying, \u201cBernie or bust people, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d Even before the disruptions in the arena, the convention had kicked off Monday under a cloud of controversy -- after the leak of emails indicating an anti-Bernie Sanders bias inside the DNC forced the resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She had been expected to open the convention anyway, but after facing continued backlash from Sanders supporters Monday morning was replaced in that role by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Anti-Clinton sentiment, however, continued to run high inside and outside the convention site, as pro-Sanders and other demonstrators marched from Camden to downtown Philadelphia and ultimately toward the arena \u2013 all while the convention was gaveling in. Inside the hall, Sanders supporters jeered Democratic officials trying to move the proceedings along. The developments added up to a far more chaotic start than at the Republicans\u2019 convention a week ago in Cleveland. Trump, from the sidelines, stoked the unrest inside the Democratic ranks by tweeting about how Bernie Sanders had been mistreated by the party. He tweeted before the convention start: \u201cThe Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!\u201d FoxNews.com\u2019s Joseph Weber, Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The lawmaker discusses the tight Wisconsin race Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson won his rematch against Russ Feingold on Tuesday, aiding the Republican effort to retain control of the Senate. The Johnson-Feingold race was a redo of the 2010 election when Johnson unseated Feingold, a Democrat. The only senator who has come back to win his old seat from the opponent who bested him was the late Sen. Peter Gerry, D-R.I., in 1934. Feingold was initially thought to have a good shot to turn the tables on Johnson, but the race tightened significantly as the election came down to the wire. A huge infusion of campaign committee and outside money poured into both sides of the race during the closing days. Johnson\u2019s seat was thought to be vulnerable, and was one of several races Democrats targeted in an uphill battle to retake control of the Senate. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who was leading voting in the state late on Tuesday, put up far bigger margins than had been expected, perhaps helping to boost Johnson\u2019s chances. Feingold\u2019s pitch for redemption centered on the claim that Johnson hadn\u2019t done a strong job for Wisconsin voters during his six years in the Senate; however, Johnson argued the voters shouldn\u2019t give Feingold a second shot at a job he\u2019d already been sacked from once before.

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz reacts to Donald Trump briefly upstaging the DNC by making a speech in Florida The uproar over Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments is a classic case of media-generated outrage. All over the newspapers, all over the airwaves, there is shock and horror that Trump would appeal to Russia to furnish Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails. The lines seemed so obviously sarcastic to me, as I watched Trump\u2019s presser from the Democratic convention here in Philadelphia, that I didn\u2019t see the tsunami coming. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but as a longtime Trump-watcher, that\u2019s how it came off to me. But think about the media coverage for a minute. To believe that the Republican nominee was dead serious in urging an adversary of the United States to commit or complete an act of espionage against his Democratic opponent is to believe that Trump is clinically insane. And I do think many journalists and commentators view him as a bit unhinged. That\u2019s why this makes sense to them. They think Trump is so off the wall that it seems perfectly plausible. Others, I believe, don\u2019t believe Trump really meant it, but they think he stepped in it with the remarks and are happy to bash him over it. Look, Trump says a lot of incendiary things. His comments on Mexicans and Muslims and the like get him into trouble and are more than fair game for criticism. But this one is different. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said. He added that the press would love that. Trump is a master, of course, of saying things that are just far enough over the line that he drives a story for days. In this case, it means keeping a focus on the 33,000 emails that Clinton deleted from her private server as pundits and politicians debate whether he crossed a line\u2014siphoning covering from the convention speeches by President Obama, Vice President Biden, Bill Clinton and others. Trump now says he was being sarcastic and we don\u2019t even know whether the Russians are behind the hacking. What\u2019s striking about the coverage is that it barely acknowledges that this could be an open question: The New York Times headline: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Appeal to Russia Shocks Foreign Policy Experts\u201d: \u201cThere is simply no precedent for this: A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalf.\u201d The Washington Post lead: \u201cRepublican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the U.S. presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton \u2014 an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politics.\" Politico\u2019s lead: \"Donald Trump's call on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails has shocked, flabbergasted and appalled lawmakers and national security experts across the political spectrum, with one saying it was \u2018tantamount to treason.\u2019\u201d \u201cIs it possible that Trump was being sarcastic? That he was joking?\u201d CNN\u2019s Carol Costello asked her panel. The response was no, and even if he was, it wasn\u2019t funny. This is why professional politicians avoid sarcasm, to avoid uttering words that create an uproar. But Trump delights in it, which is why his supporters love him, his detractors view him as reckless and the media can never seem to get enough.",

            "article_content": "Barry Bennett on the dismissal of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2019s abrupt firing Monday came down to a battle of ultimatums. And ultimately, Lewandowski lost. Paul Manafort, the veteran operative who since March has been amassing influence inside Trump HQ, recently telegraphed through third parties he would be gone in 48 hours if Trump didn\u2019t oust Lewandowski, who'd run his campaign from the outset. Manafort was fed up with battling Lewandowski and let the campaign know the two of them \"just couldn't get along.\" From there, it became a family affair. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner didn\u2019t want to lose Manafort, believing him to be the more experienced hand to guide the campaign into the general election. They convinced Trump to keep him \u2013 and the only way to do that, given Manafort\u2019s terms, was to dump Lewandowski. Faced with a choice, Trump chose Manafort. This account was relayed to Fox News by a campaign source. The details shed light on arguably the biggest staff shake-up of the 2016 cycle. Despite the shock of Trump parting ways with Lewandowski, one of his closest and most loyal advisers, just weeks before the convention, in some corners the decision was not so surprising. The former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations, fundraising, and Trump's search for a running mate, but Lewandowski's aggressive approach also fueled near-constant campaign infighting that complicated Trump's shift toward the general election. Another Trump campaign official, Michael Caputo, resigned Monday afternoon over a tweet he sent out earlier in the day about Lewandowski's firing, a campaign source told Fox News. Ding dong the witch is dead! https://t.co/pSqQwmAGz1 pic.twitter.com/5dE7GMeEK6 Caputo tweeted \"Ding, dong, the witch is dead\" shortly after news about Lewandowski broke.\u00a0\u00a0Accompanying the tweet was a photo from the \"Wizard of Oz,\" showing the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East protruding from under a house. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed Caputo is no longer with the campaign. Reached on Monday by The Associated Press, Lewandowski deflected any criticism of his approach, pointing instead to Manafort. \"Paul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7. That's a fact,\" Lewandowski said, declining to elaborate on his dismissal. In a subsequent interview with CNN, Lewandowski repeatedly said he didn\u2019t know why he was fired. But he said working for the campaign was \u201can honor and a privilege\u201d and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t change one second.\u201d He also claimed there was no animosity in the relationship with Manafort. A person close to Trump told the AP that Lewandowski was forced out largely because of his poor relationship with the Republican National Committee and GOP officials. On Capitol Hill, a Republican congressional aide close to pro-Trump lawmakers told Fox News the campaign did not inform members of Congress of the Lewandowski departure. Still, some sources said they were not surprised by the move and had been given the impression there would be a pivot soon to the general election, involving a potential staffing change. Fox News is told that Trump\u2019s children ultimately convinced the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to lose Lewandowski \u2013 an effort preceded by the tensions between Manafort and Lewandowski. Manafort was originally brought on in March to help the Trump campaign\u2019s delegate operation. He was later promoted to the role of campaign chairman \u2013 and will now take over as campaign manager, Fox News is told. \u201cHe\u2019s the campaign chairman, so yeah \u2013 he\u2019s the person in charge,\u201d Trump senior adviser Barry Bennett told Fox News. Whether the ouster is simply an effort to smooth over rifts inside the Trump campaign or signals a major shift in strategy remains to be seen. Bennett downplayed the notion that there would be any dramatic changes, but suggested Trump would be talking more about the issues in the weeks ahead. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren in an \"On The Record\" interview he thought the staff change was a \"new direction\" for the Trump campaign. \"I see a pivot and seriousness to the general election,\" he said. Lewandowski has long been a controversial figure in Trump's campaign, but benefited from his proximity to the presumptive Republican nominee. He traveled with Trump on his private plane to nearly every campaign stop, giving him more direct access to the businessman than nearly any other campaign staffer. He was a chief promoter of the idea that the best campaign strategy was to \"Let Trump be Trump.\" He frequently dismissed the notion that Trump needed to hire more experienced political hands, spend on polling and sophisticated data operations, or moderate his rhetoric as he moved toward the general election. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement: \"The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.\" The decision to part ways followed a rough patch for Trump at a time when he had an opening to crank up his general election operation as presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was still fighting to fend off Bernie Sanders. Instead, Trump\u2019s poll numbers against Clinton slipped, as Trump has found himself caught up in several controversies over his own comments \u2013 in turn stoking tensions with other top Republicans. Aside from the controversies that have hung over the Trump campaign in recent weeks \u2013 including his comments claiming a judge is biased against him in the Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage; his renewed calls for a Muslim immigration ban; and his decision to revoke credentials for The Washington Post \u2013 the campaign is also entering a new and arguably tougher phase as Democratic groups start spending big against him. Clinton and her Democratic allies have invested at least $41 million in commercials in crucial states such as Ohio, Florida and Nevada over the next six weeks. Those messages will be echoed by hundreds of Clinton workers in those same states and amplified by President Obama and other top Democrats. Vice President Biden was also delivering an anti-Trump speech Monday. Fox News\u2019 John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENCE, INDEED\u2026 If you ever wondered how important the media narrative is to elections, we have a time capsule from the 2012 race to show it. The Associated Press\u2019 Matthew Lee would win accolades on the left just two weeks after the election for his press-conference bludgeoning of then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland about the administration\u2019s refusal to denounce Israel for attacks against the Islamist militants of Hamas \u2013 suggesting the strikes might be \u201cwar crimes\u201d and intoning about a \u201ccatastrophic humanitarian situation\u201d in Gaza \u2013 and fuming over the administration\u2019s stated support for Israel. But before the election, Lee was angry with Nuland over a different topic: what he saw as the administration\u2019s laggardly response to coverage by Fox News about the Sept. 11, 2012 raid on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya. In a newly released email exchange two days after the attack, when the Obama administration was still publicly claiming that the raid was a spontaneous event rather than a planned strike, Lee concurred with Nuland\u2019s description of Fox\u2019s coverage as \u201cbull----\u201d but then says \u201cthis is killing you guys.\u201d Reporters often offer sources the chance to tell their side of the story and might encourage a spokeswoman to \u201cset the record straight.\u201d That\u2019s a good and ethical way to coax a source into giving an exclusive interview or providing background information. But Lee doesn\u2019t appear to be asking for anything here. He\u2019s just scolding Nuland and complaining about Fox News, which he said was \u201cshocking.\u201d The thread appears to close, in fact, with her assuring Lee that a famously pro-administration competitor had been given the story and that it had made the most influential political Web site, The Drudge Report. That story trumpeted: \u201cA U.S. official told POLITICO: \u2018There\u2019s no intelligence indicating that the attack in Benghazi was premeditated.\u2019\u201d But there was such intelligence. And the attack was premeditated. But true or, as we now know, false, none of that would be any help to Lee professionally, so why did Nuland bring it up? Lee has won accolades on the right of late for pointing out in another round of briefing bludgeoning that Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State accomplished little of note, but his sympathies seem pretty obvious here, or at least Nuland thought they were. As it turns out, Fox News was ahead of the pack on the story and, as another embarrassing round of disclosures revealed this week, the administration not only hid the truth from reporters ahead of the election but also elided about the existence. Watching the evident anger on the part of ABC News\u2019 Jon Karl as his former colleague Jay Carney delivers an answer to the latest disclosure that was so absurd as to be taunting. He ought to be angry. The White House covered up its doctored talking points and then shamed Karl and others for reporting that turned out to be basically on the nose. This weekend, the Washington press corps will celebrate itself at the White House Correspondents Association\u2019s annual dinner. There will be lots of complaining about how crummy the current administration is about granting access. There will be little outrage, however, over an administration that has frequently been caught lying and misleading and then bullying reporters \u2013 tactics that go beyond the usual rough and tumble of the Washington press game. Remember, this is an administration that has criminally targeted reporters for pursuing stories and gobbled up phone records at the AP. If all of the reporters are not as angry as Karl was about this kind of brazenness, then perhaps what Nuland assumed about Lee back in 2012 is really true about MOST OF the rest. [Reporters report on the reporting on themselves - Politico polled 60 of the \u201celite of the elite\u201d reporters to find out what it is like to be White House correspondents.] Benghazi hearing today - Following Wednesday's heated exchange at the White House briefing over the former U.N. ambassador Susan Rice\u2019s controversial Sunday show talking points on Benghazi, the former head of the US Africa Command is scheduled to testify about the Benghazi attack before the House Oversight Committee. [Watch Fox: Sen. John McCain, R-Az., appears in the 10 a.m. ET hour] WHITE HOUSE TRIES SPIN MOVE ON GLOOMY OBAMACARE NUMBERS The Obama administration and Republicans continue to fight about how many people have signed up\u2014and paid for\u2014health insurance plans in the marketplace. House Republicans say 67 percent of enrollees have paid premiums, while Centers for Medicare and Medicaid spokesman Aaron Albright argues, \u201cThese claims are based on only about half of the approximately 300 issuers in the federally-facilitated marketplace and they do not match up with public comments from insurance companies themselves, most of\u00a0which indicate that 80 to 90 percent of enrollees have paid their premium.\u201d Not the first time \u2013 The constant back and forth is nothing new to the administration, and remember the president has been busted in the past for false assertions about his signature health care law. The most infamous of these claims, of course, is President Obama\u2019s promise time and again, \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\u201d which earned him WaPo\u2019s biggest Pinocchio of the year award, and also was named PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d Last month, President Obama boasted 35 percent of people enrolled through the federal marketplace are under the age of 35. WaPo\u2019s Glenn Kessler explained why this was misleading: \u201cThe young invincibles are between the ages of 18 and 34 \u2014 and as White House \u2018fact sheet\u2019 acknowledged, that figure is 28 percent. The 35 percent figures includes children under the age of 18.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget the administration\u2019s claims about expanded Medicaid enrollment, which fact checkers say are wildly overinflated. Ruh-roh - Even if 28 percent of \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d have signed up, a figure important because young enrollees are needed to compensate costs for older, sicker Americans in the marketplace, those 18 to 35 year olds haven\u2019t written the checks quite yet. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce says only 25 percent of younger individuals have paid their bill so far. STUDY ON \u2018DARK MONEY\u2019 FUNDED BY\u2026 WAIT FOR IT Free Beacon: \u201cLiberal senators and [President Obama] appointees on Wednesday decried the influence of anonymous campaign donations in American politics while citing data from organizations that accept anonymous donations. Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) said in an opening statement before a Senate Rules Committee hearing that so-called \u2018dark money\u2019 is a \u2018systemic issue that threatens all of us and our very democracy.\u2019 King cited data from the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) and the Wesleyan Media Project to note that spending by groups that do not disclose their donors is nearly four times higher than it was at this time in 2012. However, King did not mention that both of the groups have received financial support from foundations that do not disclose their donors. CRP received $350,000 from \u2026groups that are linked to liberal mega-donor George Soros\u2026Additionally, the Wesleyan Project has received support from the Knight Foundation, another group that is linked to \u2026 Soros-funded groups\u2026FEC vice chairwoman Ann Ravel was one of the witnesses at the hearing\u2026However, Koch Industries\u2014owned by businessmen [Charles Koch] and David Koch\u2014vigorously denied the allegations in an October statement and said they were not involved in the Proposition 32 issue[,a prohibition on using union dues for political purposes.]\u2026Ravel was later forced to admit that the Koch brothers were not involved in the ballot initiatives. \u2018The Koch brothers have never been implicated themselves as having been direct donors,\u2019 she said\u2026 Wednesday\u2019s hearing also came amid the annual meeting for the secretive club of wealthy liberals known as the Democracy Alliance, which has steered more than $500 million to liberal groups since its inception in 2005. One of its members, hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, has pledged to spend $100 million on candidates in the midterm elections who say they support environmentalist causes\u2014but recently said he will not disclose the donors. Neither the alliance nor Steyer were discussed at the hearing.\u201d WITH YOUR\u00a0SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...New research shows that those who use their middle initial in their name seem more intelligent.

Jeb Bush to their current Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., when it comes to 2016 candidates, giving Bush 27 percent of their support compared to 11 percent for Rubio. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did slightly better with 14 percent, while Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, all polled in the mid-single digits with GOP primary voters. Heavy for Hillary - But among all voters surveyed, the same poll shows that Floridians would choose 2016 Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton over Bush, 49 to 41 percent.\u00a0 Respondents also said they would choose Clinton over each of the potential GOP presidential nominees by even wider margins.

POLL SHOWS DEAD HEAT IN NEBRASKA Watchdog.com: \u201cAn independent poll taken in mid-April has Nebraska\u2019s Senate race in a statistical dead-heat, with newcomer Ben Sasse leading with over 29 percent, followed closely by Shane Osborn with nearly 27 percent\u2026. The poll was commissioned by the Tea Party Express, the nation\u2019s largest tea party political action committee\u2026. However, in the hotly contested GOP primary race that lately has revolved around which candidate has the most genuine Tea Party support in Nebraska, the poll showed Sasse had a 12-point advantage among self-identified Tea Party supporters, garnering 37 percent to Osborn\u2019s 25 percent. Sasse had a 71 percent favorability rating among Tea Partiers, compared to Osborn\u2019s 65 percent. \u2026 Sasse also picked up a coveted endorsement Wednesday from the Nebraska Farm Bureau, marking only the second time the farm group has made an endorsement in a statewide primary. The other time was in 2006, when they endorsed Gov. Dave Heineman over Tom Osborne.\u201d Nebraska's primary election is May 13.

Thad Cochran, R-Miss., is \u201crefusing to debate\u201d Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel. \u201cAfter five decades in Washington, Cochran won't even come home to defend his record. Why? Maybe because Cochran\u2019s record is filled with bailouts, tax hikes, trillions in debt, and pay raises for himself.\u201d Recent polls show Cochran remains ahead. The two face off in the June 3 primary. OKLA. SENATE HOPEFUL SPEAKS ABOUT FREEDOM IN NEW AD Republican senate hopeful Rep. James Lankford released a new ad Wednesday in hopes of succeeding retiring Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. The ad features Lankford, sitting at a restaurant table with constituents, explaining the importance of freedom. \u201cAll the freedoms that we had in the past now are evaporating,\u201d says Lankford. \u201cWe are losing our freedom and we are losing it quickly because of this administration.

Fires back after attack ad \u2013 Jacobs released another ad Wednesday defending his conservative reputation. \u201cWhat I will do is show up for work every day and support conservative values and Iowa jobs.\u201d In the ad, Jacobs also compares attack ads to bullies that throw rocks behind the fence instead of having the courage to show their face. Whitaker touts Iowa home \u2013 In Republican Matt Whitaker\u2019s first TV ad, he touts his Iowa football roots and firm stance on issues. \u201cAs your U.S. attorney, I protected Iowa, putting thugs and predators behind bars. And as you senator, when it comes to standing up to Barak Obama, I won\u2019t waiver.\u201d The ad will air across Iowa. UDALL TRIES TO HORN IN ON GARDNER\u2019S GAS BILL Washington Examiner: \u201cEven though Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall is trying to fend off Rep. Cory Gardner to keep his Senate seat, he does like at least one thing about his Republican challenger -- his natural gas export bill. Udall said Wednesday he would try to tie an amendment modeled on a Gardner-sponsored bill the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed earlier in the day to an energy-efficiency bill that could hit the Senate floor next week\u2026Both lawmakers have tried to position themselves as the champion for natural gas exports -- which would incentivize new drilling in natural gas-rich Colorado -- in what has become a tight race heading into the November midterm election. It got to the point that when both dropped virtually identical bills in early March, Udall reminded the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that he had introduced his legislation first.\u201d N.H. DEMS: BROWN DIDN\u2019T MEET DEADLINE The Hill: \u201cThe New Hampshire Democratic Party is requesting a Federal Elections Commission investigation into whether Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown failed to report campaign expenditures while he was exploring a bid. In the nine-page complaint, the party also questions whether Brown may have filed as a candidate later than required by FEC regulations, following his admission this weekend that he decided to make his bid on Feb. 14, though he spent the subsequent month saying he hadn\u2019t yet made a decision. \u2018Scott Brown decided to become a candidate for Senate on Valentine\u2019s Day, and that should have triggered FEC filing requirements and deadlines that he clearly did not meet. We're asking the FEC for a thorough and swift investigation,\u2019 said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley in a statement announcing the complaint.\u201d GRIMES ATTACKS MCCONNELL ON JOBS Democratic Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes launched a new minute online ad bashing Sen.

MICHIGAN WORKERS SAY NO TO UNION More than 80 percent of health care workers in Michigan are choosing to part ways with the SEIU, the union that represents them. Since state voters ended forced unionization by approving right-to-work legislation in 2012, union reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor show more than 44 thousand home-based caregivers are opting out. According to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, \u201cThe workers previously were forced to pay dues or fees\u00a0to the SEIU after the union orchestrated a scheme that took money from the Medicaid checks of the people the workers\u00a0were caring for in homes across the state. The \u2018dues skim\u2019 ended in 2013, but not before the SEIU took more than $34 million from the elderly and disabled across the state.\u201d The shedding of members will mean a 4.2 million dollar loss for the union. \u201cWhen given the choice, those in the program didn\u2019t want to give the union a dime,\u201d said Mackinac legal analyst Patrick Wright. THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: NO MARKET FOR RACISM Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano compares the racist comments from the Los Angeles Clipper\u2019s owner Donald Sterling and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and discusses where the government fits into the situation: \u201cHateful and hurtful words have natural and probable consequences where the people are free to counter them. The government has no business cleansing the public marketplace of hateful ideas. The most effective equalizer for hatred is the free market. It will remedy Sterling\u2019s hatred far more effectively than the NBA can. As advertisers and sponsors and fans desert Sterling-owned properties, he will be forced to sell them, lest his financial losses become catastrophic. And it has removed Bundy from the public stage altogether.\u201d Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.",

            "article_content": "Would the Virginia senator be a safe pick or inspired choice? Ford O'Connell and Julian Epstein join the debate CLEVELAND \u2013 As Donald Trump\u2019s campaign prepared for the most important speech of his brief but meteoric political career \u2013 one it hopes will not only propel him to the White House but unite a divided Republican Party \u2013 his November opponent was hunkered down just days before her coming-out party begins to find the right fit for the Democratic ticket. In Cleveland, the Republican Party standard-bearer was putting the finishing touches on his nomination acceptance speech. Trump\u2019s address is set to cap a dramatic convention week marked by powerful displays of party unity but also tensions, flaring most recently when Ted Cruz withheld his endorsement Wednesday night. But those tensions could pale in comparison to those on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton is trying to strike the right balance with the base as she weighs her running mate options, after a rigorous primary battle against liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who only came around to endorse Clinton days ago. While Cruz's controversy was fading, Clinton might have to fret about Sanders' address next week to his own delegates in Philadelphia -- whose allegiance may still be up in the air. The plot thickened in the Democratic veepstakes Thursday, as a source familiar with the vice presidential search process told Fox News that Clinton met last Friday with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at her Washington home. Asked about the process during a pro-Clinton press conference in Cleveland, Booker said: \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about the convention ... I know the Clinton campaign is in the midst of deciding. I\u2019m very happy to be where I am.\u201d It was already known that Clinton had met with several other prospects, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Housing Secretary Julian Castro \u2013 though some problems have since surfaced with that list. Time is quickly running out for Clinton, considering the convention, which starts Monday in Philadelphia, is where the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are formally nominated. She reportedly said she would make a decision this Friday. Another curveball came in the form of an apparently errant and mistaken report that Clinton was considering former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned Democrat. But that report was pulled back, and Crist downplayed the talk. He told The Tampa Bay Times Clinton was coming to Tampa and they would meet but knew of no plans to consider him for the ticket. \"Not that I'm aware of,\" he told the newspaper. The eleventh-hour speculation comes amid reports that Clinton was narrowing her selections down to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Booker, though, was among the first prominent Democratic lawmakers to endorse Clinton and has been a strong advocate for her campaign since essentially the start of the election cycle. Clinton does extremely well with African-American voters, based on recent and exit primary polls. But Booker, who is black, could help her expand her outreach among minority voters in her general election race against Trump. Both Castro and Perez, meanwhile, have faced some turbulence over the last week. Castro was just cited for violating federal law when he touted Clinton\u2019s candidacy in an April news interview. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0then published a potentially problematic report on Perez, who regularly retells the story of grandfather Rafael Brache being forced to flee the Dominican Republic for opposing the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo.\u00a0Perez has praised his grandfather as being \u201con the right side of history.\u201d What Perez didn't offer up as often is that his grandfather was one of the dictator\u2019s champions during the first five years of his three-decade rule. The Wall Street Journal said Brache also held a string of high-level offices in the Trujillo regime, including being ambassador to the U.S. Brache reportedly \u201cexpressed great optimism\u201d for the regime as late as 1935 when political assassinations had been well documented. Kaine, long rumored to be on Clinton's short-list, still seems to be the leading contender. The former Virginia governor, who represents a key battleground state, is considered a safe choice for Clinton, someone who could help her appeal to moderates who have been turned off by Trump's rhetoric. However, Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who is a longtime friend of the Clintons, is being described as a \"strong\" second choice.

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from San Jose Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders battled for a single delegate Thursday in Kentucky, but a review of primary election results didn't change the outcome of the May 17 primary. The review, held at the request of the Sanders' campaign, put Clinton in line to pick up an extra delegate from the Bluegrass state, while elsewhere, Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination for president. If the Kentucky results stand, Clinton would need just 77 more delegates to secure the nomination. She leads Sanders by 271 pledged delegates and has a nearly 500 delegate advantage in superdelegates. Fewer than 2,000 votes separate Clinton and Sanders in Kentucky, or less than one half of 1 percent of all votes cast in the state. Both candidates picked up 27 delegates from the state, but one delegate from the 6th Congressional District has not been awarded. Thursday's recanvassing -- a review of totals from electronic voting machines and absentee ballots -- confirmed Clinton leads Sanders by about 500 votes in the district. If the results hold, Clinton would win the extra delegate. Sanders still has options. He could ask a judge to order a recount, which is a more thorough examination of the results. But Sanders would have to pay for that himself, a costly gamble given the reward would likely be just a single delegate. The deadline to ask for a recount is Friday. Sanders won nearly every coal-producing county in Kentucky, underscoring Clinton's weakness in Appalachia after her comments that her policies would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Clinton has said she was mistaken in her remarks and has since touted her plan to invest billions of dollars in economically depressed coal regions. Clinton enjoyed the support of most of Kentucky's Democratic leaders, including former Gov. Steve Beshear and Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.",

            "article_content": "Mike Emanuel reports from Tempe, Arizona WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama staunchly defended Hillary Clinton's use of private email as an \"honest mistake,\" suggesting Wednesday that voters should discount innuendo-filled revelations that the FBI is looking into more emails just ahead of Election Day. Obama walked a careful line in his first public comments about FBI Director James Comey's decision to publicly disclose the emails' existence, which has roiled the campaign. Though he did not explicitly criticize Comey, Obama outlined a standard for how investigations should be conducted that contrasted sharply with the approach Comey has pursued. \"I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations, we don't operate on innuendo, we don't operate on incomplete information, we don't operate on leaks,\" Obama said in an interview with online news outlet NowThis. \"We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.\" Comey notified Congress in a brief and ambiguous letter last week that the FBI was examining whether newly uncovered emails might pertain to a dormant FBI probe into Clinton's email practices. Comey's letter shed no light on whether investigators were likely to actually turn up anything of note. Meanwhile, a series of leaks by FBI and Justice Department officials about how the emails came to light have further muddied the waters for voters, who must decide whether to let the revelations affect their choice for president. The White House insisted that Obama comments shouldn't be construed as pertaining to Clinton's case, even though they came in response to a direct question about Comey and the Clinton emails. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama was merely pointing out that if facts are released before an investigation is completed, \"that could lead to public speculation or innuendo.\" \"The president believes that \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 that doesn't serve our interests,\" Schultz said. Obama, in the interview, emphasized that he's trying to avoid looking like he's meddling in an independent process. At the same time, he pointed to the FBI's earlier investigation of Clinton, which concluded she shouldn't be charged with a crime, as evidence that the issue was much ado about nothing. \"Hillary Clinton, having been in the arena for 30 years, oftentimes gets knocked around, and people say crazy stuff about her, and when she makes a mistake \u2014 an honest mistake \u2014 it ends up being blown up as if it's just some crazy thing,\" Obama said. How to handle the uproar over Comey and the emails has become a delicate balancing act for the White House. The principle of judicial independence dictates that the president shouldn't risk the perception of influencing investigations by commenting about whether they are appropriate or how they are conducted. On the other hand, White House aides and other Democrats are concerned that Clinton could be unfairly disadvantaged by the disclosure that the FBI is looking into her emails again, even it if ultimately amounts to nothing. In the closing days of the race, there also has been speculation and contradictory reports about whether the FBI is investigating Donald Trump's possible connections with Russia.",

            "article_content": "'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the last minute opinions from around the media, and some are outrageous The final countdown to tomorrow\u2019s election has become a cacophony, with just about everyone joining in the craziness. Ann Coulter, the conservative provocateur, writes: \u201cMy Final Argument for Trump: Humiliate the Media!\u201d Susan Sarandon, the Bernie supporter who once flirted with backing Trump, denounced the DNC as \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d and told CNN she\u2019s supporting Jill Stein. Mike Huckabee tweeted that \u201cTrump may be a car wreck, but at least his car is pointed in right direction. Hillary is a drunk-driver going the wrong way on the freeway.\u201d Ringing endorsement, huh? Actress Ali Wentworth, the wife of George Stephanopoulos, told the Hollywood Reporter that \u201cif Trump wins, we\u2019ll start looking at real estate in Sydney, Australia. No crime, no guns.\u201d No word on whether George has signed off. Former White House chief of staff John Sununu said at a Trump rally: \"Bill was referring to Hillary when he said, 'I did not have sex with that woman.'\" Seriously. Some conservatives tweeted a Wikileaks disclosure following this Drudge headline: \u201cWIKI WICCAN: PODESTA PRACTICES OCCULT MAGIC.\u201d Turns out John Podesta was invited to a dinner last year with performance artist Marina Abramovic, who sometimes does weird occult stuff, but she says it was a \u201cnormal dinner\u201d with \u201cno blood, no anything else,\u201d and Podesta wasn\u2019t there, only his brother Tony. So no Satanic rituals for Clinton\u2019s campaign chief. Meanwhile, as the candidates race to their final rallies and the pundits stand at their color-coded maps, you can sense the relief that this polarizing campaign is finally coming to a close. I don\u2019t fault all the prognosticators who are looking at red and blue states, early voting, turnout operations, demographic groups, past trends and a plethora of polls to figure out who has the best path to 270. They\u2019re smart people, and this is what they do. This is the pregame chatter on Cubs vs. Indians, and they\u2019re expected to pick winners and losers. But sometimes it can seem a bit comical. On Friday, CNN put up a \u201cbreaking news\u201d barrier that Clinton had dropped below 270 electoral votes. Meaning that CNN\u2019s analysts were projecting she no longer had a lock on the election. Brian Williams appeared to scold MSNBC and Bloomberg anchor Mark Halperin on the air, saying: \u201c I think you\u2019ve gone out of your way find the path, argue for the path, forge the path for him in an argumentative way with your co-host to the nomination. Tonight, I thought you were interestingly optimistic. Where are you getting the path of positivity you laid out on your broadcast tonight?\u201d Halperin responded that he wasn\u2019t being optimistic, he was looking at the data. But Politico says there\u2019s a \u201ctheory\u201d bouncing around on Clinton that \u201cif she takes Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Virginia -- all states where she seems to have a lead, or is building one through early voting -- Donald Trump can win Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado and New Hampshire and still lose.\u201d Assuming he wins Wisconsin. And then there are the bettors: \u201cTraders on the website are now paying 68 cents for a \u2018Clinton win\u2019 share that would pay $1 if Clinton is elected. Just last week the same share on PredictIt cost 81 cents,\u201d says USA Today. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s going to win\u2014and that\u2019s a very different situation than 10 days ago, when we were awash in reports on who was in the running to be Clinton\u2019s interior secretary. The momentum seems to have broken Trump\u2019s way. \u00a0In a whole slew of states, including New Hampshire, Colorado, Nevada and Florida, Trump has gone from trailing to significantly ahead or virtually tied, at least according to some polls. And that makes me think that if undecided voters haven\u2019t broken for Hillary by now, they\u2019re not going to\u2014not if this is a change election. At the same time, Trump is in a position where he has to win every one of a half-dozen or so contested states plus grab a state that Mitt Romney lost. And he has to do this with less money and far less of a ground game than the Clinton operation. So he has less margin for error. A conventional wisdom has emerged that Trump drops when the news is about him, and Clinton drops when the news is about her. But there\u2019s been a split-screen focus on both of them in recent days. It\u2019s a funny thing about elections. After all the ads and the attacks, the conventions and the debates, there is still one day where voters have to be motivated enough\u2014perhaps with a nudge from volunteers\u2014to turn out to vote for a candidate. (Yes, that\u2019s been diluted by weeks of early voting, but Nov. 8 will still decide the election.) And that\u2019s where such random factors as bad weather and even a Philadelphia transit strike can be factors. Starting Wednesday morning, we\u2019ll be up to our eyeballs in exploring why Trump or Clinton won (or lost), the outlook for the new administration, the media\u2019s role in the race, and why the campaign often seemed longer on insults than issues. But right now, it\u2019s a heckuva horse race.",

            "article_content": "Catherine Herridge reports from Washington, D.C. A senior member of Hillary Rodham Clinton's inner circle testified Friday before a House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Libya as a nasty spat erupted between a Republican staffer and a Democratic lawmaker who insists it's time for the committee to disband. Jake Sullivan, a former policy director and deputy chief of staff under Clinton at the State Department, was questioned by the panel in a daylong session of testimony behind closed doors. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the committee's chairman, said Sullivan was in a \"unique position\" to talk about how U.S. policy in Libya required the State Department to have a physical presence in the country. Sullivan is currently a top policy aide on Clinton's presidential campaign. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, said at midday that Sullivan had answered every question. The panel is investigating the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks at the U.S. facilities in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Mike Morrell, the CIA's former deputy director, likely will be the next witness to appear before the panel, Gowdy told reporters. Separately, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a member of the panel, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the committee had become \"little more than a partisan tool to influence the presidential race, a dangerous precedent that will haunt Congress for decades.\" He said the panel had let down the families of those killed in the attacks. That prompted a highly unusual attack from Jamal Ware, a spokesman for the GOP-led panel. In an email to reporters, Ware blasted Schiff, saying he had not attended enough of the panel's meetings to levy criticism, including Friday's session. Schiff was traveling from California to Washington on Friday. \"You all need to ask Mr. Schiff how it is he has drawn these conclusions since he has only seen fit to attend one hour of one witness interview since the committee was constituted,\" Ware said. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for the 2016 nomination, has been dogged by criticism about her use of a private email server for government business during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton acknowledged on Friday that the use of a private email system wasn't the \"best choice\" and acknowledged she didn't \"stop and think\" about the set-up when she became secretary of state in 2009. In an interview with NBC News, Clinton did not apologize for her decision. She said she wishes she had \"made a different choice\" and takes responsibility for the decision. The GOP-led House panel that was established to investigate Benghazi has gotten immersed in the controversy surrounding Clinton's email practices. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff, answered questions for the panel for 9 1/2 hours on Thursday. Few details were released, but knowledgeable officials said lawmakers asked Mills about her role in preparing \"talking points\" for administration officials following the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Gowdy said Friday that inquiries which focused on a private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state, including its set-up, came only later in the session. \"Our committee is the committee on Benghazi. It's not the committee on emails,\" Gowdy said. In his op-ed, Schiff called for the panel to be shut down. \"Whatever their original purpose, the Select Committee's leaders appear no longer to have any interest in Benghazi, except as the tragic events of that day may be used as a cudgel against the likely Democratic nominee for president,\" he wrote. Cummings called for Gowdy and committee Republicans to release a transcript of Mills' testimony as soon as possible, so the public can learn what questions were asked and how they were answered. The request to release the transcript was unlikely to be granted, Gowdy said, noting that much of what was discussed related to national security.",

Sign up\u00a0here.** PRESENTING YOUR SOUTH CAROLINA FIELD GUIDE The polls say this should be a great day for Donald Trump \u2013 a big victory to ratify his status as the GOP frontrunner and a harbinger of future successes in the so-called \u201cSEC primary\u201d on March 1. But the polls have gotten a little screwy in the final days of the \u201cfirst in the South\u201d primary, with Marco Rubio nipping past Ted Cruz in some surveys. Trump\u2019s dominance, however, hasn\u2019t been cast in much doubt. His margin of victory matters, though. Given the resistance to Trump\u2019s nomination in many quarters of the party, a big win would be a big boost. The message from a Trump double-digit win: Resistance is futile. But if Trump stubs his toe and ends up with a narrow victory, it would only embolden his detractors. With those high stakes in mind, the polls aren\u2019t enough to get a grasp on what\u2019s really happening down South.

This is Appalachia and very much part of what Michael Barone calls \u201cThe Jacksonian Belt.\u201d Voters here are famous dissenters and have long prided themselves on their stubborn independence. But the Upstate of South Carolina is also fastest growing region of the state. The counties of Greenville and Spartanburg are home to big businesses like Bank of America, 3M and BMW. For all the changes, the Upstate is true to its political roots. The region is one of the most politically conservative and most religiously observant throughout the South. The more populous counties of the upstate region should be Ted Cruz\u2019s space. These are the most conservative voters in the state and have social issues on their mind. As the son of a preacher, and self-proclaimed defender of conservativism, Cruz relates well to these voters. In order to hold on to a second-place finish, Cruz needs to win in the more populated ares. But Marco Rubio has a chance with these voters too. He is also a strong conservative who has been touting his family values throughout the state enough that he could siphon off some support from Cruz. In less populated regions of the Upstate, however, it\u2019s Trump territory. Counties like Anderson County are manufacturing areas, but haven\u2019t felt the economic boom of the larger areas like Greenville just yet. This makes them more open to someone who says he\u2019ll protect their jobs from going overseas.

The city center and more affluent suburbs stand to be one of the biggest troves of votes for Marco Rubio. The Florida senator has paid plenty of attention to the region, often putting his plan for increased military spending front and center. The Midlands is also home to the state\u2019s best Republican bellwether, Lexington County, which includes part of Columbia and much of its suburbs, but also rural voters. A Republican stronghold, Lexington has picked the state\u2019s Republican primary winner the past three presidential election cycles. Communities farther from the population center are Trump territory. These are some of the poorest counties in South Carolina, with large African-American populations \u2013 the kinds of places polls have shown Trump excelling with blue-collar white voters.\u00a0 Places like Barnwell County, where 11 percent of adults have a college education and a low median household income, should be a sweep for Trump.

Primary throughout the day here.] DOWNSTATE/COASTALThe downstate and coastal area is the wealthiest and most politically moderate part of the state. The two major counties, Charleston and Beaufort, are vacation retreats and popular destinations for Yankee retirees fleeing cold winters. But there is also a strong military and military retiree presence here that changes the political calculus. These are voters who lifted John McCain to his win in 2008 and kept Mitt Romney in the hunt in 2012. This should be the best part of the state for Marco Rubio, but it also is where he stands to have the most votes siphoned off by Jeb Bush and John Kasich. For Rubio to run second, he will need to prevent too much costal erosion. Rubio\u2019s endorsements from key South Carolina players like Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama said Monday that the time has come for Iran to decide whether to accept a nuclear deal, and he acknowledged \"very real differences\" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the negotiations. In a campaign speech, Netanyahu criticized the international negotiations with Iran and portrayed his scheduled address to the U.S. Congress next month as an attempt to describe Israel's objections. \"A bad deal with Iran is forming in Munich that will endanger Israel's existence,\" Netanyahu said, referring to talks over the weekend in Germany between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart. \"Therefore I am determined to go to Washington and present Israel's position before the members of Congress and the American people.\" Obama said the world powers negotiating with Iran are unified in their offer, while acknowledging the forceful opposition from Netanyahu. \"I don't want to be coy -- the prime minister and I have a very real difference around Iran's sanctions,\" Obama said at a White House news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, another party to the talks. The president defended his decision not to meet with Netanyahu while he's in town at the invitation of Republican House Speaker John Boehner. Obama cited the precedence for U.S. presidents not to meet with foreign leaders who are facing an upcoming election, to avoid the perception of trying to influence the outcome. \"As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one,\" Obama said to a smile from Merkel, although she did not weigh in with her own perspective. Democratic lawmakers fear Netanyahu will use the speech to lawmakers to try to embarrass Obama and further his own re-election prospects. A handful of Democratic House members have said they will skip it, and liberal Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday became the first senator to announce he won't attend. \"The president of the United States heads up our foreign policy and the idea that the president wasn't even consulted -- that is wrong,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"I am not going. I may watch it on TV, but I'm not going.\" Israel has long claimed a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to world peace and security. Israel views a nuclear-armed Iran a threat to its very existence, noting calls by Iranian leaders for destruction of the Jewish state. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but critics in the West dismiss such explanations. Obama warned Tehran that he sees no reason to further extend negotiations for a basic agreement next month. \"We're at a point where they need to make a decision,\" Obama said. He said the only question remaining is, \"Does Iran have the political will and desire to get a deal done?\" Iranian officials on Sunday signaled a willingness to come to an agreement. \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told a gathering of the world's top diplomats and defense officials. He said an extension would be in no one's interests. Obama argued the extended negotiations with Iran have been time \"well spent.\" \"The program has not only been frozen, but with respect to, for example, 20 percent enriched uranium, they've reversed it, and so we're in a better position than we were before the interim program was set up,\" Obama said. Boehner's office objected to that assessment. \"President Obama tried to clean up his debunked claims on Iran's nuclear program today but he still couldn't help but repeat a false claim. Now more than ever, it's critical that the American people hear the truth about the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program,\" said Boehner spokesman Cory Fritz.",

In an interview Tuesday with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Clinton called the videos \"disturbing\" and said Planned Parenthood still has questions to address. \u201cI have seen the pictures from them and obviously find them disturbing,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is answering questions and will continue to answer questions.\u201d Her comments come after the Center for Medical Progress released several undercover videos. Those videos showed Planned Parenthood representatives discussing fetal tissue extraction and compensation. Clinton and other Democrats had largely avoided commenting on the issue. While selling such fetal issue is illegal, Planned Parenthood maintains it only donates the tissue, legally. Republican White House candidates, and lawmakers, have since called for de-funding Planned Parenthood -- Republicans are considering a bill in the Senate to do so. Clinton, however, added in her interview that she still supports the organization. \u201cI think there are two points to make,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cOne, Planned Parenthood for more than a century has done a lot of really good work for women: cancer screenings, family planning, all kinds of health services. And this raises not questions about Planned Parenthood so much as it raises questions about the whole process, that is, not just involving Planned Parenthood, but many institutions in our country.\u201d She told the paper that funding for the organization is at no more risk than it has been.",

For instance, it once would have been unimaginable that a sitting president of the United States would have spoken as harshly and explicitly about a candidate as President Obama did of Donald Trump on Tuesday. That Obama did it from the White House and in the company of a foreign leader makes it all the more astonishing. Standing beside the Singaporean prime minister at a press conference, Obama declared Trump \u201cunfit to serve as president\u201d and lacking \u201cthe judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.\u201d In another year, it would have been seen as beneath the dignity of the office for a president to engage this way. Presidents are supposed to say that they will leave it to the voters, defer to the nominee of their party and not get into the back and forth, yadda, yadda yadda\u2026 But in 2016, it\u2019s sort of \u201cwhatevs.\u201d Part of this is the fraying of institutions and the coarsening of the culture. But most of it is Trump himself, who is already proving to be a catalytic historical figure. If his campaign is really teetering on the brink of collapse and Republicans are near open revolt, as is being reported elsewhere, then Trump would be, in fact, a historical one-off. But that\u2019s not what seems to really be happening here. Yes, Trump is trailing in the polls, but his core support seems to be holding, keeping him consistently above the 40 percent mark \u2013 about the same the GOP nominee held the week after the conventions in 2012. Trump had a respectable fundraising haul in July and can be expected to bring in plenty of money in the form of small-dollar donations from his army of supporters. In short, the political system is appalled by Trump, but the voting public, for now at least, is treating him like an ordinary Republican politician. And there\u2019s no reason to believe, based on external signs, that Trump is going anywhere. Contrary to what many in the press and public life want to believe, this is really happening. And Trump really is going to leave a lasting mark on American politics and culture. Trump delights in smashing every convention. He attacks his own party with glee, refusing to endorse its leaders in their re-election bids. He\u2019s been in a days-long bitter battle with the parents of a war hero killed in Iraq. He won\u2019t release his tax returns. He engages in the rawest, most personal political conflict we have seen in modern times. He does whatever he wants and he doesn\u2019t care what the rules say. Obama was looking to call Trump out for his conduct. We watched rival Republicans try to do the same thing in primary battles with Trump and each time it didn\u2019t work. Rather than being shamed, Trump was empowered and the other guy ended up abasing himself. Now, that\u2019s not to say that it will work as well in the general election. Hardly. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich summed it up in an interview on Fox Business Network this morning, discussing what he said was Trump\u2019s \u201cvery self-destructive behavior\u201d: \u201cTrump is still behaving as though it was the primaries and there were 17 candidates. He has not made the transition to being the potential president of the United States, which is a much tougher league.\u201d True dat. But even if Trump doesn\u2019t win the election, he has already remade his party. Watching the agony of GOP members contorting themselves in the pitiful Terpsichore of the simultaneous denunciation/endorsement would be sad if it were happening to people other than politicians. That was Obama\u2019s point Tuesday when he called out the Republican leadership and urged its members to repudiate Trump: \u201cThe alternative is that the entire party, the Republican Party, effectively endorses and validates the positions that are being articulated by Mr. Trump.\u201d Obama is right, at least in the sense that Republicans have substantially lost their party and its traditional posture. That\u2019s over now. This is a new party that will live or die based on the way the story of Trump ends. The history books leave no room for asterisks next to nominees\u2019 names. What Obama seems not to grasp is that Trump is changing the rest of politics, too. The president apparently believed he could sacrifice a little more of the dignity and remove of the White House podium in order to shame voters into rejecting Trump. Most of Trump\u2019s voters certainly don\u2019t care, and there\u2019s little reason to believe this kind of tut-tutting does much good in the broader electorate. Obama was looking to use his office to rise above the moment and be an authoritative voice. But rather than rising above the fray, Obama is climbing into the wrestling ring with Trump.TIME OUT: PUNCTUATION WON\u2019T BRBThe Conversation: \u201cThough periods can still signal the end of a sentence in a text message, many users will omit them (especially if the message is only one sentence long). This tendency now subtly influences how we interpret them. Because text messaging is a conversation that involves a lot of back-and-forth, people add fillers as a way to mimic spoken language. We see this with the\u00a0increased use of ellipses, which can invite the recipient to continue the conversation. The period is the opposite of that \u2013 a definitive stop that signals, as linguistics professor Mark Liberman\u00a0has explained, \u2018This is final, this is the end of the discussion.\u2019 For some, this can appear angry or standoffish.\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questionsSCOREBOARD Average of national presidential polls: Clinton vs. Trump: Clinton +5 pointsGeneric congressional vote:\u00a0Democrats +2.8 [Watch Fox: A new national Fox News poll on the heels of both conventions will be released tonight on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d]KANSAS PRIMARY VOTERS DUMP REPUBLICAN RENEGADEWichita Eagle: \u201cVoters in Kansas\u2019 1st District primary chose newcomer Roger Marshall over three-term incumbent Rep.

            "article_content": "James Rosen reports from Washington, D.C. California lawmakers have OK'd a Planned Parenthood-backed bill that creates new penalties for distributing secret recordings of discussions with health providers \u2013 but civil rights and media advocates say the measure goes too far. The bill, which passed Friday and now goes to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk, targets activists such as the Center for Medical Progress -- which last year released secretly recorded videos purportedly showing activists discussing the purchase of aborted fetal body parts with Planned Parenthood representatives. The videos, while criticized for selective editing, sparked significant outrage among Republicans who called for the organization to be defunded. Recording and distributing a \u201cconfidential communication\u201d without consent already is a crime under California law. However, the new bill adds an additional layer of penalties -- including additional fines and up to a year in prison -- specifically for recording a conversation with a health care provider. Planned Parenthood supported the bill and said that in light of the videos, it had seen a nine-fold increase in violence against its facilities. \u201cWith the Internet and the tremendous wildfire nature in which news can be spread now through\u00a0social media, we\u00a0need to have a crime against distribution by those in particular who did the illegal recording,\u201d Beth Parker, chief legal\u00a0counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California,\u00a0told the Los Angeles Times. The bill passed on a party-line vote. However, some voices often allied with Democrats were unhappy with the bill. \u201cWe know of no legitimate governmental reason for singling-out disclosure of all health care provider communications for special criminal sanctions, making the bill vulnerable not only on First Amendment grounds but also on equal protection grounds,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union argued in opposition to the bill in June. The Sacramento Bee reported that the measure initially stalled in the state Senate due to opposition from media advocates that it could prevent lawyers and journalists from doing their jobs. However, it passed after language was added that restricted who could be prosecuted under the law -- which proponents said would prevent it being used against news organizations reporting on such videos. \u201cIt is narrowly tailored to address the growing threat to health care providers,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson told the Bee. It did not appear, though, that those changes specifically addressed the ACLU's complaints. The ACLU did not immediately respond to a request for comment from FoxNews.com on Tuesday. Even after the amendments,\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorial board on Aug. 31 called the move to give health care providers special protection \u201cmystifying\u201d and accused the lawmakers behind the bill of pandering to special interests. \u201cBut make no mistake, this measure would heap more criminal and civil penalties on making a secret recording \u2014 an act that\u2019s already prohibited by state law,\u00a0even when done in the public interest \u2014 simply to satisfy an interest group popular among Sacramento Democrats,\u201d the board said. The editorial board warned that the bill could disincentivize potential whistle-blowers from recording abuses such as a patient who sees a doctor handing out opioid prescriptions too liberally. \u201cThe potential for unanticipated and unwelcome consequences is huge,\u201d the board said.",

            "article_content": "Senate majority leader hints that GOP's opposition to Obama's agenda is rooted in race \u201cSummer has come and passed. The innocent can never last. Wake me up when September ends.\u201d -- Wake Me Up When September Ends, Green Day It\u2019s as constant as chlorophyll draining from the leaves every September, flipping green pigments to rich browns, reds and golds. Perpetual as the crash of football pads every September Saturday on college campuses, intermittently pierced by the shrill tweet of a referee\u2019s whistle. It\u2019s as regular as the hordes of children, weighted down by North Face and Pok\u00e9mon backpacks, dashing for the bus as school resumes in September. Every September is about the same, punctuated by rituals signaling shifts from summer to fall. September commands particular customs on Capitol Hill, too. Lawmakers must fund the federal government by the end of the federal fiscal year. That deadline is always September 30. Over the past two-plus decades, September almost always sparks a flurry of negotiations between top Congressional leaders and the White House in an attempt to approve some sort of interim spending bill (known in congressional parlance as a Continuing Resolution, often abbreviated simply as a \u201cCR\u201d) and avoid a government shutdown. A CR is a stopgap spending package that funds the government at current levels for a short period \u2013 until Congress must OK another package to re-up funding again. While there is often chatter about the possibility of a government shutdown in September, the prospects of an actual shutdown are rare. Still in August, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, invoked the specter of a shutdown in a conference call with reporters. It probably doesn\u2019t help matters that the government actually did shutter for more than two weeks just three years ago. So the possibility remains ripe in the minds of political observers. In September, some other nagging but crucial policy issues usually come to the fore as well. It\u2019s funding to combat Zika this year. Inevitably, Congress will marry the Zika money to the CR. Officials from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican, canvassed Capitol Hill in recent weeks to make the case for Zika aid as the federal fiscal year draws to a close. But everyone stares at the calendar. September 30. Nothing has to happen in Congress until that deadline. And so, things are playing out the way they usually do in September in Washington. The Senate assumed the lead in writing this year\u2019s CR. There was a theory this week that the chamber could potentially knock the bill out and perhaps vote late on Thursday night. Senators would then skip town completely until after the election. It didn\u2019t happen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., made clear he wants vulnerable GOP senators facing challenging contests to get home to campaign. Republican prospects of potentially holding control of the Senate improved dramatically of late. That only underscores McConnell\u2019s desire to cut everyone loose soon. Yet, things on the CR are crawling. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is not gone,\u201d Reid declared mid-week. Yes. Planned Parenthood. \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d is a provision GOP lawmakers demanded leaders include in a Zika-related bill the House adopted in June. Senate Democrats view this provision as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that they can\u2019t swallow. So they filibustered the same measure in July and in September. Ironically, the verbiage is silent when it comes to Planned Parenthood. One issue at stake is whether Profamilias, Puerto Rico\u2019s version of Planned Parenthood, can receive money targeted to combat Zika. The so-called \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d language reads like this: \u201cThat of the funds appropriated under this heading, $95,000,000 shall be transferred to the \u2018Social Services Block Grant\u2019 for health services provided by public health departments, hospitals, or reimbursed through public health plans, notwithstanding section 2005(a)(4) of the Social Security Act, in States, territories, or tribal lands with active or local transmission cases of the Zika virus.\u201d In short, that means that Profamilias cannot receive federal assistance. This seems to have stymied talks on Zika. \u201cZika is a tough nut to crack,\u201d said one source. Another source noted to Fox News that \u201cit\u2019s hard to get to common ground (on Planned Parenthood) when there isn\u2019t a lot of common ground on that issue to begin with.\u201d So efforts to advance the CR with Zika money slowed this week. \u201cThings came to a stand-still today,\u201d said one senior congressional aide close to the process on Wednesday. One can distill the entire CR battle into a singular, prescient comment offered by one senior source close to the process. \u201cIt\u2019s only September 14th,\u201d the source said. That\u2019s the whole story. There are two more weeks left in September. And in September, this is just how Congress rolls. This infuriates many conservatives -- especially some who thought things might be better under the guidance of House Speaker Paul Ryan. Many award the Wisconsin Republican kudos for a better process and more input. But still, the outcome is virtually the same. A big, catch-all spending bill to avoid a government shutdown in late-September coupled with another package in mid-December. This is why many conservatives pushed to have everything wrapped up this month in hopes of sidestepping a second bill before Christmas. \u201cIf what we're going to do in December is so great, let's do it today and take credit for it in November,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. The House GOP leadership is trying to gin up support for the September CR, and some form of a December package by securing buy-in to do miniature spending bills in the lame duck session. The smaller bills could curb the scope of the December bill. But lawmakers have to deal with September first. \u201cIt takes a while to do these things,\u201d lamented Ryan when asked about the pace of assembling the CR. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s bogged down. It\u2019s just taking a little longer.\u201d One reporter asked the speaker if the House shouldn\u2019t have ceded authority to the Senate to author the CR. \u201cIt's always a mistake to let the Senate go first,\u201d replied Ryan with a smile, drawing laughter. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had a different take on the same question. \u201cThe reason it's beginning in the Senate is that the speaker can't pass a bill which originates in the House,\u201d she said. That said, if things continue to drag on in the Senate, Ryan didn\u2019t rule out the House moving its own version of a CR first. \u201cWe would like to get it done,\u201d Ryan said. If that\u2019s the case, would the House GOP write a bill which appeals to only Republicans? That wouldn\u2019t make it through the Senate to say nothing of getting past President Obama. Or would Republicans try to advance something palatable to all. The latter plan -- which would actually keep the government operating -- would require Democratic support on the floors of both bodies. \u201cWe have to have some input if they're going to get Democratic votes,\u201d Pelosi said. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., heads the Senate panel in charge of health and Zika money. He\u2019s also facing an increasingly competitive re-election fight against Democrat Jason Kander back home. The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report/Roll Call race rating just switched the Blunt/Kander contest from \u201cRepublican Favored\u201d to \u201cLeans Republican.\u201d But Blunt\u2019s involved in the CR talks, despite the contest. \u201cI\u2019m glad to do my job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things behind the problem which are making it more difficult to solve the problem. Like keeping us here.\u201d After all, it is September. And lawmakers are performing a familiar dance. \u201cIt\u2019s always a lot like this,\u201d Blunt said. This is why you might find some lawmakers humming a few bars of Green Day over the next few weeks. They know what\u2019s ahead. Just wake them up when September ends.",

Clinton allowed that she had \u201cseen pictures\u201d from the videos that depict officials from America\u2019s leading abortion provider talking in ghoulish terms about harvesting the organs of aborted babies. Clinton said what she saw was \u201cdisturbing\u201d and touted her own efforts in her prior White House stint to reduce the number of elective abortions conducted each year. But Clinton, who is under pressure to return donations from Planned Parenthood, stopped short of criticizing the group. She suggested that her longtime ally was a victim of circumstance, saying that \u201cthe whole process\u201d of how aborted babies\u2019 body parts are harvested ought to be scrutinized.Two-month gap in Hillary\u2019s emails - Fox News: \u201cA reported two-month gap in emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account during 2012 coincides with a period of escalating violence in Libya and the obtaining of a special exemption by her top aide, Huma Abedin, to work for both the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. The Daily Beast\u00a0reported late Tuesday that no emails between Clinton and her State Department staff for the months of May and June 2012 are among the estimated 2,000 messages that have been released from the Democratic presidential frontrunner\u2019s account. \u2026 If true, that means neither Clinton nor her staff communicated via e-mail during a period that saw three attacks on international outposts in Benghazi, including one on the consulate itself.\u201dTaunts Keystone questioners - USA Today: \u201cHillary Clinton again declined to take a position on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline on Tuesday, saying that decision currently belongs to President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. \u2018If it\u2019s undecided when I become president, I will answer your question,\u2019 Clinton said during a town hall in New Hampshire.

The traffic: A vote to cut off federal funding for \u00a0Planned Parenthood, sparked by videos of the abortion provider hawking fetal body parts, looks likely in the Senate, but not in the House. A 3-month patch appears destined to keep transportation projects running this summer. While the Senate continues to work on six-year highway bill that House leadership has refused to take up, the lower chamber is melding the 3-month fix with \u201cmust pass\u201d VA hospital funding before heading for their districts this week. The tactic is expected to result in Senate passage before it leaves next week. The 60-day clock continues to tick on Congressional review of the administration\u2019s Iran nuclear deal, which was met with considerable skepticism by House and Senate panels in testimony this week. Bottom line: and already full pattern faces Congress on their return flights. [House Democrats are at the White House today where President Obama is expected to push his Iran deal.]House hijinks - Fox News: \u201cIn a move unprecedented in the history of the House of Representatives, a Republican lawmaker filed a motion Tuesday to remove House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, from his post, in another sign of dissatisfaction with Boehner\u2019s leadership by a number of House conservatives. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., filed the resolution \u2013 a \u2018motion to vacate the chair\u2019 \u2013 late Tuesday, claiming that he \u201chas endeavored to consolidate power and centralize decision-making, bypassing the majority of the 435 Members of Congress and the people they represent.\u201d The proposal was referred to a committee stocked with leadership loyalists, and therefore unlikely to emerge\u2026\u201dSenate deep freeze - Confrontation between Senate Republicans appears to be easing following days of strife over the highway bill The Hill reports: \u201c[L]awmakers insisted that the conflict between conservatives and party leaders was not evidence of a splintering caucus, and they predicted they will unify for the fiscal battles that loom on the legislative calendar. The most public peace offering came from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who\u00a0issued a joint statement on Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about repealing ObamaCare, following a combative conference meeting late Monday.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026The New Yorker takes a deep dive into the mystery of stage fright. The disease has crippled the most successful performers, and doesn\u2019t seem to let up over time. As they write, \u201cIn a number of ways, stagefright doesn\u2019t make sense. Laurence Olivier, when he was in his late fifties, was visited by a spell that lasted, intermittently, for five years, causing him great anguish. At the time, he was the most celebrated stage actor in England. How could\u00a0he\u00a0be frightened of failing? Ditto Mikhail Baryshnikov. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, Baryshnikov was the most famous ballet dancer in the world, and he probably still is, though he ceased classical dancing some twenty-five years ago. Since then, he has built a successful career in modern dance and theatre. But he experiences terrible stagefright, and says that it has only got worse over the years.\u201d Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

Sen.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told Geno\u2019s Steaks owner Geno Vento he\u2019s had cheesesteaks with Cheez Whiz in Philadelphia before and would have been dripping the orange goo if he ordered his the usual way.

            "article_content": "Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, on Sunday compared Democratic presidental nomine Hillary Clinton to Hitler over the crime bill that \"put tens of thousands of black brothers and sisters in prison.\u201d \u201cMrs. Clinton backed the crime bill and then called our young people super predators,\" the 82-year-old reverend said. \"Of course she apologized, but just a minute. See, Hitler could\u2019ve said to the Jews after Auschwitz, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 Would that be enough to satisfy you?\u201d In April, Hillary Clinton said she was sorry for what she described as the unintended consequences of the landmark 1994 crime bill signed into law by her husband. Clinton's past support for the law has come under fire from some African-Americans, who say that it has contributed to mass incarceration of young blacks. Farrakhan's disapproval of Clinton did not stop there. He said that, while secretary of state, Clinton influenced President Obama in his decision to distance himself from the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam. \u201cBarack did not want to denounce me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hillary forced him. And he gave in.\u201d Farrakhan did not endorse either candidate during a speech Sunday at the Chicago-based movement's headquarters. He did take swipes at Republican nominee Donald Trump over his tax practices but stayed largely focused on Clinton. \u201cMy friends are going to vote for Mrs. Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not mad at them, they see some value in her because they don\u2019t know who she really is.\u201d Farrakhan criticized Clinton's judgement as secretary of state and brought up some issues dating back to the 2008 campaign. Apparently citing the popular book \"Game Change,\" he recalled the reported interaction between former President Bill Clinton and then-Sen.Ted Kennedy. Bill Clinton wanted Kennedy to endorse Hillary over Barack Obama, and reportedly told Kennedy, \u201cA few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee.\u201d After Kennedy endorsed Obama, Clinton reportedly said, \u201cthe only reason you are endorsing him is because he\u2019s black. Let\u2019s just be clear.\u201d Farrakhan has not been a fan of Clinton in the past.

            "article_content": "Chief Washington correspondent James Rosen reports Former Hewlett Packard CEO and 2016 presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina is reportedly eyeing up a new political run \u2013 this time to replace Reince Priebus as chair of the Republican National Committee \u2013 although some fear her refusal to back Donald Trump may hurt her chances. Fiorina, who was largely seen as an unlikely candidate for the GOP nomination when she announced her candidacy last year, surprised many commentators with a strong run. In particular, a moment at the September debate in California, in which Fiorina implored President Obama and Hillary Clinton to watch leaked videos that described controversial practices at Planned Parenthood, resonated with Republican voters and saw her briefly surge near the top of the pack in some polls. Her numbers later fizzled and she dropped out after a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary in February. Fiorina has been spending the time since then campaigning for Republican House and Senate candidates, and has not endorsed Trump. A number of outlets, including Time and Politico, reported Tuesday that the Fiorina is mulling a bid to replace Priebus after the November election \u2013 and is reaching out to state party chairs offering to help \u201cin any way\u201d as a way of laying the groundwork for a run. Time reported that domain names CarlyForChair.com and CarlyForRNC.com were bought up at the same time in July. Priebus has not yet announced if he will seek another term as party chair. Should Trump win the White House in November, he would have considerable say over who becomes chair, and so would be unlikely to recommend Fiorina. But should Hillary Clinton win the White House, her chances look much stronger. While Fiorina has never held elected public office, she does have some experience in party leadership. After her unsuccessful 2010 California Senate bid, she served as vice-chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and later the chair of the American Conservative Union Foundation.\u00a0Her background in management and technology industries could also help her clinch the role. Some Fiorina supporters say it would be the right move for her, and for the party. \u201cShe has proven herself to be an outstanding, eloquent spokeswoman for conservative principles and the Republican Party, as someone who had been on the front line implementing those principles in the real world and in the private sector,\u201d Keith Appell, former senior adviser to the \u201cCARLY for America\u201d Super PAC, told FoxNews.com. \u201cOne of the things she did well as a candidate was getting a lot of people to nod their heads and say \u2018yes\u2019 when she explained the practical applications of conservative policies and principles. That\u2019s something the party has needed,\u201d Appell said. However, some believe her refusal to back Donald Trump could be fatal, even if the billionaire loses. Fiorina briefly became Ted Cruz\u2019s running mate before he dropped out, and said of Trump in March: \u201che does not represent me, he does not represent our party.\u201d Former Iowa Republican Party chair Craig Robinson told FoxNews.com that while Fiorina is a good candidate for the job, her apparent gamble that Trump will lose shows she is not a team player. \u201cWhere I have questions is on the timing of all this. It seems she is plotting her next personal step at a time when Republicans at large should be doing what they can to help their nominee win the White House,\u201d Robinson, who also runs The Iowa Republican blog, said. \u201cShe\u2019s out there running for RNC chair instead of helping the team elect Donald Trump president.\u201d Robinson said that although \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone who does a better job of communicating the message against Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said that putting herself above the party may cost her the job. \u201cI think she really misplayed this. I think she\u2019s going to turn off certain elements within the RNC committee that she\u2019s going to need for support,\u201d he said. \u00a0\u201cThey want to win and they\u2019re supporting Donald Trump. If she\u2019s not doing that I don\u2019t see how these individuals say she\u2019s right to lead the party.\u201d Fox News' David Lee Miller contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "FILE - In tis June 21, 2016, file photo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., accompanied by, from left, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, listen to a question during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 Averting an election-year crisis, Congress late Wednesday sent President Barack Obama a bill to keep the government operating through Dec. 9 and provide $1.1 billion in long-delayed funding to battle the Zika virus. The House cleared the measure by a 342-85 vote just hours after a bipartisan Senate tally. The votes came after top congressional leaders broke through a stalemate over aid to help Flint, Michigan, address its water crisis. Democratic advocates for Flint are now satisfied with renewed guarantees that Flint will get funding later this year to help rid its water system of lead. The hybrid spending measure was Capitol Hill's last major to-do item before the election and its completion allows lawmakers to jet home to campaign to save their jobs. Congress won't return to Washington until the week after Election Day for what promises to be a difficult lame-duck session. The bill caps months of wrangling over money to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus. It also includes $500 million for rebuilding assistance to flood-ravaged Louisiana and other states. The White House said Obama will sign the measure and praised the progress on Flint. The temporary spending bill sped through the House shortly after the chamber passed a water projects bill containing the breakthrough compromise on Flint. The move to add the Flint package to the water projects bill, negotiated by top leaders in both parties and passed Wednesday by a 284-141 vote, was the key to lifting the Democratic blockade on the separate spending bill. The deal averts a potential federal shutdown and comes just three days before deadline. It defuses a lengthy, frustrating battle over Zika spending. Democrats claimed a partial victory on Flint while the GOP-dominated Louisiana delegation won a down payment on Obama's $2.6 billion request for their state. The politicking and power plays enormously complicated what should have been a routine measure to avoid an election-eve government shutdown. The temporary government-wide spending bill had stalled in the Senate Tuesday over Democrats' demands that the measure include $220 million in Senate-passed funding to help Flint and other cities deal with lead-tainted water. Democrats were initially unwilling to accept promises that Flint funding would come after the election, but relented after they won stronger assurances from top GOP leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and agreed to address the city's crisis in the separate water development bill. The Flint issue arose as the final stumbling block after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added the flood aid for Louisiana to the spending bill. Democrats argued it was unfair that the water crisis in Flint has gone on for more than a year with no assistance, while Louisiana and other states are getting $500 million for floods that occurred just last month. Democrats played a strong hand in the negotiations and had leverage because Republicans controlling the House and Senate were eager to avoid a politically harmful shutdown six weeks before the election. Behind-the-scenes maneuvering and campaign-season gamesmanship between Republicans and Democrats had slowed efforts to pass the temporary spending measure, once among the most routine of Capitol Hill's annual activities. A longstanding stalemate over Zika funding spilled on to the measure, which many GOP conservatives disliked because it guarantees a lame-duck session that's likely to feature post-election compromises that they'll oppose. McConnell has made numerous concessions in weeks of negotiations, agreeing, for instance, to drop contentious provisions tied to Zika funding that led Democrats to block prior Zika measures. A provision to make Planned Parenthood ineligible for new anti-Zika funding for Puerto Rico was dropped, as was a provision to ease pesticide regulations under the Clean Water Act. Democrats relented on a $400 million package of spending cuts. Many House Republicans have opposed helping Flint, arguing that the city's problems are a local issue and that many cities have problems with aging water systems. Flint's drinking water became tainted when the city, then under state control, began drawing from the Flint River in 2014 to save money. Regulators failed to ensure the water was treated properly and lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply. As many as 12,000 children have been exposed to lead in water, officials say. Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, Flint's congressman, had accused Republicans of ignoring the plight of the predominantly black city after Republicans initially would not permit a vote. But Wednesday morning Kildee issued a statement that called the upcoming vote on the non-binding, $170 million promise for Flint \u2014 an amendment in his name that's less generous than he originally asked for \u2014\"a step forward to ensuring that Flint families get the resources they need to recover from this crisis.\" There were other winners and losers in the scramble to produce the legislation. Democrats and some Republicans were thwarted in an attempt to allow the Export-Import Bank to approve export deals exceeding $10 million even though it lacks a quorum. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, failed to win a provision to block the U.S. government from transferring the Commerce Department's role in governing the internet's domain name addressing systems to a nonprofit consortium known as ICANN. And Democrats failed to use the bill to reverse a ban engineered last year by McConnell on proposals to allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to require publicly-traded corporations to disclose political spending permitted under the Supreme Court's 2010 decision allowing unlimited political spending by businesses. The spending bill also includes full-year funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure permits veterans with war injuries to receive in vitro fertilization treatments. A longtime ban on such treatments \u2014 demanded in the early 1990s by anti-abortion lawmakers concerned about destroyed embryos \u2014 has been lifted.",

            "article_content": "Florida is investigating whether there is possibly a third active transmission zone in Miami-Dade County; Phil Keating reports for 'Special Report' WASHINGTON \u2013 Lawmakers returning to Washington after a seven-week break picked up right where they left off \u2014 feuding about legislation to battle the mosquito-borne Zika virus and deadlocked over the defense budget. A tightening presidential race and pitched warfare for control of the Senate this November promise to overshadow whatever Congress accomplishes in an election-shortened September session \u2014 which, for now, looks like little more than a temporary government-wide spending bill to prevent a shutdown at month's end, possibly linked to money to battle Zika. In its first vote Tuesday, Senate Democrats for the third time blocked a $1.1 billion Zika funding package and an accompanying Veterans Administration spending bill over restrictions on Planned Parenthood. They then voted to prevent the Senate from turning to a $576 billion Pentagon spending measure. \"It's hard to explain why \u2014 despite their own calls for funding \u2014 Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep pregnant women and babies safer from Zika,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"It's also hard to explain why \u2014 despite the array of terror attacks we've seen across the world \u2014 Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep the American people safer from threats.\" Democrats oppose the Zika measure as it bars Planned Parenthood clinics in Zika-suffering Puerto Rico from receiving new money to treat the disease and curb its spread. The legislation also would ease, over the objections of environmentalists, permitting requirements for pesticide spraying to kill the mosquitoes that can spread the virus. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans had \"loaded it up with poison pill riders to assuage the hard right.\" Republicans added those provisions to the measure in June, along with spending cuts to help pay for the Zika bill, saying they are reasonable priorities that reflect their control of the House and Senate. The Zika threat hasn't gripped the public as Ebola did two years ago, but pressure is building as dozens of mosquito-transmitted Zika cases have been confirmed in the political battleground state of Florida since lawmakers left Washington in July. The defense bill, meanwhile, is caught in a furious battle sparked by a Republican move to use emergency war funds to try to artificially increase the basic Pentagon budget by $16 billion next year. The Obama administration and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill are dead set against the idea, which breaks with a hard-won budget deal that's less than a year old; they say that if Republicans want more money for defense, domestic programs will have to receive an equal boost. The defense battle won't be resolved until after Election Day, but Tuesday's vote on Zika should send the warring parties back to the drawing board, and it appears likely that the provision targeting Planned Parenthood \u2014 and perhaps the underlying $95 million worth of social services grants \u2014 will have to be dropped from the measure. \"We're going to work through these issues and I'm sure we'll have a successful outcome to make sure just that the trains are running on time,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told hometown radio host Stan Milam of AM 1380 in Janesville on Tuesday. On the Zika virus, which has spread over the summer and is linked to birth defects, Ryan said, \"I do believe we'll find some kind of resolution.\" For his part, Ryan has to navigate some tricky waters on the underlying stopgap spending bill, known in Washington-speak as a continuing resolution. Some conservatives want to block any post-election session and are pressing for a continuing resolution that keeps the government open until March or so. But President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats are dead set against the idea \u2014 they want a full-year spending agreement completed this year \u2014 and Ryan said he wants to keep negotiating on the full-year spending bills through the fall. Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Tuesday that an extension of current spending \"should be in my view be passed as soon as possible, it should go to sometime in December\" and budget work should be finished by the end of the year. As the inauguration of the next president looms in January, a multi-year restoration of the iconic Capitol Dome is nearing completion, and the Rotunda reopened for visitors on Tuesday, free of scaffolding and safety netting that prevented visitors from a full view of its artwork. Politically, Republicans are pressing for additional investigations of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails. House conservatives are determined to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, saying he stonewalled and impeded congressional investigations into IRS targeting of conservative organizations. Koskinen wasn't commissioner at the time.",

Richard Hanna on Tuesday became the first GOP member of Congress to say he will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton for president instead of Republican candidate Donald Trump, castigating the business mogul as \u201cunfit to serve our party.\u201d Hanna, a three-term congressman who represents the 22nd District in upstate New York, wrote in an op-ed for Syracuse.com that he disagreed with Clinton, but could not vote for a man who was \u201cunrepentant in all things.\u201d \u201cI do not expect perfection, but I do require more than the embodiment of at least a short list of the seven deadly sins,\u201d Hanna wrote.

John McCain, R-Ariz., who Trump seemed to dispute was a war hero because he was \u201ccaptured.\u201d \u201cOr the countless other insults he's proudly lobbed from behind the Republican presidential podium,\u201d Hanna wrote. \u201cFor me, it is not enough to simply denounce his comments: He is unfit to serve our party and cannot lead this country.\u201d Hanna, who is retiring at the end of his term, has often broken with the Republican party line. A member of the LGBT Equality Caucus, Hanna has supported same-sex marriage since 2013. He\u2019s voted against cuts to Planned Parenthood, and told a crowd of mostly women in 2012 to \u201ccontribute your money\u201d to Democrats because they \u201cspeak out on your behalf.\u201d But his reasons for supporting Clinton go beyond simply refusing to cast a ballot for Trump. Hanna wrote that Clinton \u201chas stood for causes bigger than herself for a lifetime. That matters.\u201d He wrote that while he disagrees with the former secretary of state on a multitude of matters, he \u201ctrusts\u201d that she can lead the country. \u201cAll Republicans may not like the direction,\u201d Hanna wrote, \u201cbut they can live to win or lose another day with a real candidate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Presumptive GOP nominee amps up attacks on Hillary Clinton by focusing on husband Bill's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment, calling his rival an 'enabler.' Will that help 'The Donald' with women voters? Laura Ingraham goes 'On the Record' Donald Trump this weekend again dragged Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal life into the political campaign fray, including her husband\u2019s infidelity, as the potential general election rivals compete for the critical women\u2019s vote. Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said Saturday at a rally in Spokane, Wash., that Clinton\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u201cwas the worst abuser of women in the history of politics.\" And he called Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, an \u201cenabler\u201d because \u201cshe treated these women horribly. \u2026 And some of these women were destroyed, not by him, but by the way that Hillary Clinton treated them after everything went down.\" To be sure, winning women voters will be key to winning the general election. More than half of all voters in the 2012 presidential race were women, and at least 53 percent of them voted for President Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. Trump's attacks Saturday appeared to be in response to reports that Priorities USA, the lead super PAC backing Clinton, has reserved $91 million in TV advertising, which will start next month and in part focus on Trump\u2019s statements and actions regarding women. \u201cTwo can play that game,\" said Trump, in a likely preview of a bruising and personal general election battle. Trump\u2019s run for the nomination perhaps suffered its biggest setback when he retweeted an unflattering picture of the wife of primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz -- a move he later said he regretted. Amid criticism about his treatment of women, the billionaire businessman also has touted a history of hiring women to top jobs in his real estate and entrepreneurial empire. At a later rally Saturday, in Lynden, Wash., Trump repeated that former President Clinton\u2019s denial of a relationship with a White House intern later lead to his impeachment. \"Do you remember the famous, 'I did not have sex with that woman?' \" Trump asked. \"And then a couple of months later, 'I'm guilty.' And [Hillary Clinton] is taking negative ads on me.\" Trump also sought to downplay past comments about women in venues like the Howard Stern radio show in the days before he was a politician. He said some were made in the name of entertainment, while others, like his criticism of actress and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, were warranted. \"Who the hell wouldn't speak badly about Rosie O'Donnell? She's terrible,\" he said. Clinton told CNN on Wednesday, after Trump became the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee, that she felt certain that Americans won\u2019t take a chance on electing a \"loose cannon\" like him. And she appeared to warn Trump that others have tried and failed to defeat her politically with similar personal attacks. \"If he wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s, if he wants to follow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I'm more than happy to have him do that,\" she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "150 delegates up for grabs in Michigan, Idaho, Mississippi, and Hawaii **Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up\u00a0here.** PRESENTING YOUR MARCH 8 PRIMARY DAY FIELD GUIDEWith slightly more than one-third of Republican delegates allocated, the GOP contest roars into its middle phase today. Four years ago, this was the point at which the GOP frontrunner started to put it away. This time, it\u2019s different. Contests in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii will award 150 delegates to the remaining Republican candidates, who are each trying to reach the magic number of 1,237. All of the states\u2019 reward their delegates proportionally so we can expect something of a split decision. How that split shapes up, though, will provide essential clues about the state of the race as it enters its decisive phase. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has won about 44 percent of the delegates so far, about 10 points better than his closest competitor, Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz, meanwhile, is doubling up Sen. Marco Rubio. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has just 4 percent of the delegates so far. Trump needs to do substantially better to win the nomination outright. To get on a good foot, Trump needs to start approaching a 60-percent threshold of all the remaining delegates to avoid a contested convention. Results from five contests over the weekend, however, show Trump going in the wrong direction, grabbing just 31 percent. Did Thursday\u2019s rough and rowdy debate in Detroit, combined with a new onslaught of character attack ads against Trump and the dire warning from native Michiganian Mitt Romney, have an effect? New national polling suggests some slippage for Trump, but today\u2019s results will tell us even more. [Watch Fox: Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier bring you the latest results tonight as the polls close at 8 p.m. ET] MICHIGANIt was the Great Lakes State that in 2012 helped save Romney from a protracted and even more painful nominating process. Romney pulled off a narrow victory in the state his father had governed, but narrow was enough to dispel concerns about his chances in a two-man race with former Sen. Rick Santorum. Could it do the same for Trump? The math is a little different this time in that there are three bidders for Michigan\u2019s delegates: Trump, Kasich and Cruz. In the final pre-election poll, Trump remained ahead, but his margin was shrinking over the other two contenders, with considerable shrinkage the final two days the poll was in the field. A three-way tussle and a fairly even delegate split would not be helpful for Trump\u2019s efforts to subdue the resistance within his party. Here\u2019s a look at where the contenders will look to try to find a breakout performance: Michigan is a politically diverse state that has been undergoing massive demographic reordering in the past decade with the collapse of Detroit. But the Motor City metro is still the largest trove of votes in the state by far. One of the reasons Trump should do very well in Michigan are places like Wayne County, home to Detroit, and Macomb County, to the city\u2019s northeast. Many voters here are the archetypical \u201cReagan Democrats.\u201d Trump\u2019s message on tariffs, trade and China is a winner with blue-collar, pro-union voters pummeled by successive decades of industrial decline. Plus, his support for government-run insurance programs, federal funding for Planned Parenthood and harsh attacks on former President George W. Bush are no liabilities. But don\u2019t forget about the minivan set. Oakland County is home to some very high-end suburbs and has lots of Republican voters -- accounting for 15 percent of the nearly 1 million primary votes cast four years ago. That\u2019s good news for Kasich, who has been blitzing his neighboring state for weeks, and whose nice-guy message and aggressive pragmatism should be a good fit for voters who went almost two-to-one for Romney four years ago. Cruz, on the other hand, is looking west to the Republican heartland of the state. Western Michigan is loaded with conservative Dutch Reformed Christians and other stalwarts of the right. Communities like Grand Rapids in Kent County and nearby communities could propel Cruz into contention. The Texan\u2019s test will be not just winning in more populous places, but also besting Trump in the many rural counties that account for the rest of Michigan\u2019s vote. Wayne County (Detroit Metro)--Population: 1,764,804 --Median household income: $41,421 --Race: Caucasian, 55 percent; black, 39 percent --Adults with bachelor\u2019s degrees: 22 percent --2012 election: Obama 73 percent --Residents 65 or older: 14 percent --In 1909, Wayne County built the first mile of concrete highway in the world.

[2012 Republican Primary: Rick Santorum, 42 percent; Mitt Romney, 40 percent; Ron Paul, 10 percent; Newt Gingrich, 5 percent] MISSISSIPPIThe Magnolia State should smell so sweet for Trump. Trump crushed the competition in neighboring Alabama \u2013 another Deep South state with an open primary \u2013 last week. He won almost three-quarters of the delegates with a 22-point victory over his closest competitor. Trump didn\u2019t fare as well on Saturday in Louisiana, Mississippi\u2019s neighbor to the east, winning just one more delegate than Cruz. Louisiana, though, restricts its Republican primary to party members and was held on a weekend, giving the advantage to high-propensity voters. His Alabama stomping should be the yard stick by which to measure Trump\u2019s performance in Mississippi today. It is the poorest state in the Union, and has the highest percentage of African American residents of any state. In contests so far, Trump has dominated with economically disadvantaged white voters who live in close proximity to substantial minority populations. Trump ought to be head and shoulders above Cruz. But if Cruz aims to make things interesting in Mississippi, it will be along the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, stretching from suburban Memphis in the north down to Biloxi in Harrison County to the south. Cruz\u2019s support from State Sen. Chris McDaniel, the renegade who forced incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran into a bruising runoff in 2014, as well as Gov. Phil Bryant, show signs that the divided state GOP maybe uniting behind Cruz. Should that be the case, Cruz just has to hope that there are not enough white Democrats left in Mississippi to put Trump over the top. Hinds County (Capitol Idea)--Population: 243,729 --Median household income: $38,021 --Race: Caucasian, 27 percent; black, 71 percent --Adults with bachelor\u2019s degrees: 28 percent --2012 election: Obama 71 percent --Residents 65 or older: 12 percent --Jackson is home to Malaco Records, the leading independent label for gospel and soul music.

[2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 32 percent; Rick Santorum, 31 percent; Newt Gingrich, 30 percent; Ron Paul, 6 percent] IDAHOIdaho could make a claim to be the most conservative state in America. Its 32 delegates are nothing to sneeze at, but it gets little electoral attention because of its remoteness and widely dispersed population. This year, however, it has gotten love from Rubio and Cruz who are looking for a win in the closed primary there. In 2012, Romney romped winning all the delegates, but that can be attributed at least in part to the state\u2019s large Mormon population. That was no impediment to Trump in neighboring Nevada, but the race looks different now and so does the political makeup of the Gem State. Religious liberty is a big issue here and both Cruz and Rubio have honed in on the subject. But this looks like a better opportunity for Cruz to pull off an outright win. Ada County (Jeez, Napoleon)--Population: 426,236 --Median household income: $55,805 --Race: Caucasian, 92 percent; black, 1 percent --Adults with bachelor\u2019s degrees: 36 percent --2012 election: Romney 55 percent --Residents 65 or older: 13 percent --Home to the state capital of Boise and the most populous county in the state. [2012 Republican Primary: Mitt Romney, 52 percent; Rick Santorum, 23 percent; Ron Paul, 22 percent; Newt Gingrich, 4 percent] HAWAIIRepublicans are almost as rare in Hawaii as snow days, but they still get to vote and they still get 19 delegates. There were only about 10,000 voters who came out for the closed GOP caucuses four years ago, and they matched the state\u2019s moderate leanings with a big win for Romney. If Rubio hopes to notch a win tonight it will be in Aloha State. Honolulu County (Mild Wind)--Population: 991,788 --Median household income: $73,581 --Race: Caucasian, 23 percent; Asian, 42 percent --Adults with bachelor\u2019s degrees: 33 percent --2012 election: Obama 69 percent --Residents 65 or older: 16 percent --Home to the site of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial.

            "article_content": "Dave Strnisa, left, moves a bag of balloons as preparations continue for the Republican National Convention, Friday, July 15, 2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (The Associated Press) Adam West prepares to move a ladder from in front of the stage screen that displays an American flag as preparations continue for the Republican National Convention, Friday, July 15,2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (The Associated Press) President Barack Obama speaks about the attack in Nice, France, Friday, July 15, 2016, during a Diplomatic Corps Reception in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times local): 4:40 p.m. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has visited Hillary Clinton's Washington home as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee ponders her choice for vice president. Hickenlooper was in a car that departed Clinton's Washington home Friday afternoon. The Democratic governor declined to comment on his visit. The apparent meeting came after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited Clinton's house earlier Friday. Other candidates Clinton is known to be vetting are Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. A person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters said earlier that Clinton was holding meetings Friday about her running mate selection. ___ 4 p.m. Delegates to the Republican National Convention are embracing Donald Trump's choice for vice president \u2014 even those who have yet to warm up to Trump. Some delegates hope the choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence will help unite Republicans and fire up the party base to support Trump. Not everyone is on board. But at the very least, Trump has all but assured that next week's convention vote for vice president will go smoothly. Pence has a strong reputation among fellow Republicans as a social conservative. The former congressman has plenty of Washington experience and a calm, thoughtful demeanor that stands in stark contrast to the bombastic Trump. New Hampshire delegate Tom Rath called Pence a solid pick who should reassure a lot of people in the party. __ 3:40 p.m. An application by Bernie Sanders' campaign for a permit to rally during the Democratic National Convention has been denied. A spokeswoman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney says it was rejected because of the requested location in a park across from the convention site. She says the campaign sought to use a certain field that can only be used for recreational purposes. The application said the July 24 rally would be in support of Sanders' campaign and estimated the crowd size at 15,000 to 40,000 people. Kenney's spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt, says it's not too late for the campaign to apply for a different location, if it is still interested. Sanders said Friday he won't be holding any large rallies during the July 25-28 convention, but will focus on attending smaller events and talking to delegates. __ 3:30 p.m. President Barack Obama says calls after the French truck attack for the U.S. to expel Muslims who believe in Sharia law are \"repugnant.\" Obama says the suggestion is an \"affront to everything we stand for as Americans.\" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich responded to Thursday's deadly attack in southern France by saying the U.S. should deport Muslims who believe in Sharia. He says Sharia is \"incompatible with Western civilization.\" Gingrich was under consideration to be Donald Trump's running mate until Trump chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Obama commented during a White House reception Friday for diplomats from around the world. Obama says he told French President Francois Hollande by telephone that the U.S. \"will stand with our French friends.\" ___ 3:10 p.m. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appears to have met with Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee considers a pick for vice president. Warren was in a car that departed Clinton's Washington home on Friday afternoon. It's the second known private meeting the senator has had with Clinton since she clinched the nomination last month. Warren is one of the people Clinton is considering for her ticket. She is also vetting Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. ___ 2:45 p.m. Hillary Clinton is holding meetings at her Washington home about her running mate selection. That's according to a person familiar with the meetings who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Clinton was joined by campaign chairman John Podesta and vice chairwoman Huma Abedin. Several vehicles with tinted windows entered through a gate near the home during the daylong session. Among the people Clinton is considering as her running mate: Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton campaigned with Kaine in Virginia on Thursday. ___ 2:30 p.m. Now that Bernie Sanders has offered his support to Hillary Clinton, the two campaigns are negotiating over the convention nominating process. In an interview with the Associated Press, Clinton's defeated rival leaves open the possibility that she could receive the nomination by acclamation \u2014 or unanimous nomination \u2014 at the end of a full roll call of the states. In 2008, Clinton halted the traditional roll call midway through and called for then-Sen. Barack Obama to be approved by acclamation. Sanders says he'll still press at the convention for changes in the Democratic Party's nominating system. He says there are too many super-delegates, and primaries closed to party members. ___ 2:05 p.m. The delegate rebellion against Donald Trump is dead. That's according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. He tells The Associated Press that a highly publicized push to dump Trump during next week's convention is a \"nothing burger.\" He says, \"It's over. It was never there.\" The GOP chairman made the comments during an AP interview on Friday, the day after anti-Trump delegates failed to change party rules to allow them to oppose Trump on the convention floor. Priebus said, \"There is no other candidate. That was one of the problems that this Never Trump issue had last night. Who is the other candidate? What VP nominees are you vetting? We're voting next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday. What money are you raising? Where is this person?\" He added, \"There have been many reports about how I was going to have a rebellion on the rules committee. And they all turned out to be nothing burgers.\" ___ 2 p.m. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says he's excited and humbled by Donald Trump's decision to select him as his running mate. Pence spoke to reporters briefly as he left his midtown Manhattan hotel. Pence had flown in Thursday for an announcement Friday that Trump postponed after the Nice, France, attack. Pence says: \"We love Indiana. We love our country. My family and I couldn't be more happy for the opportunity to run with and serve with the next president of the United States.\" Trump and Pence are scheduled to hold their first joint appearance in New York on Saturday. ___ 2 p.m. Newt Gingrich says he's \"very comfortable\" with not being selected as Donald Trump's running mate. Gingrich told The Associated Press that he had not been told personally by Trump that he was choosing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential pick. Gingrich says he has been communicating with Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the businessman's son, Don. Jr. Gingrich says Pence is a \"good choice\" who will make a significant contribution to the Republican ticket. The former House speaker says he was not offered another role in Trump's administration, but is sure he would be helpful. He says: \"Let's first win this.\" ___ 1:50 p.m. Democrats are aiming to use the four nights of their national convention to showcase past, current and future stars of their party. Here are some of the expected speakers in Philadelphia later in July: President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The schedule also includes Chelsea Clinton, immigration advocates and members of the \"Mothers of Movement\" \u2014 who had children killed by gun violence and in police shootings. More speakers are to be announced in the coming days. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and are also expected to be on the program. Both are being screened as potential running mates for Clinton. ___ 1:30 p.m. Bernie Sanders says that at the Democratic National Convention, he'll continue to push for changes in how the party picks its presidential nominees. The Vermont senator tells The Associated Press in an interview that he wants a review of superdelegates and closed primaries, and how the party can up itself up. He says his campaign is prepared to take those fights to the floor of the convention. Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton this week after a hard-fought primary. He says the campaigns are discussing the convention process and he's leaving open the possibility she could receive the nomination by acclamation at the end of a full roll call vote. ___ 1:10 p.m. Ivanka Trump's rabbi says he's asking to be \"relieved\" of his commitment to deliver the invocation at next week's Republican convention. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein writes in an email to his congregation that he had agreed to deliver the invocation \"out of respect\" for Ivanka Trump. She's a member of his synagogue and the daughter of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. But the rabbi says that after his name appeared on a convention speakers' list without noting he could be delivering the invocation and not giving a campaign speech, \"the whole matter turned from rabbinic to political.\" Lookstein says his request to no longer appear at the convention \"has been honored.\" Donald Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks says the rabbi's \"statement speaks for itself.\" ___ 12:45 p.m. The Republican Party chairman says Donald Trump's vice presidential pick shows that Trump is maturing as a candidate. Chairman Reince Priebus (ryns PREE'-bus) says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 a former congressman \u2014 has experience inside and outside Washington and is a Christian conservative. Priebus says Pence offers a \"very different style that I think shows a lot of maturity\" on Trump's part. Priebus was in an interview with The Associated Press when Trump tweeted the news about Pence. Priebus says Pence also helps Trump politically by drawing in conservative groups that may have been slow to come to Trump's side. ___ 12:35 p.m. The Republican Party is already working to raise money right off Donald Trump's decision to name Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Trump says in a fundraising email sent shortly after he tweeted his choice that supporters should \"contribute now to be the first to join the Trump-Pence Team.\" Pence's selection is aimed in part at assuring donors that Trump is prepared to run a more serious and disciplined general election campaign. ___ 12:25 p.m. Donald Trump is set to make his first public appearance with his chosen running mate \u2014 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence \u2014 on Saturday morning in New York. The official announcement that Pence is the vice presidential pick is set for the same Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan where Trump had been scheduled to reveal his choice Friday. Trump postponed the announcement following the truck attack in Nice, France, that left scores dead. ___ 12:10 p.m. House Speaker Paul Ryan is welcoming Donald Trump's decision to tap Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence is a former congressman, and Ryan says in a statement that Pence comes from the heart of the conservative movement and \"the heart of America.\" Ryan says \"we need someone who is steady and secure in his principles, someone who can cut through the noise and make a compelling case for conservatism.\" The speaker says Pence will bring real change to Washington. Ryan says he'll do everything he can to help the GOP ticket win in November and the party win a national majority. ___ 11:20 a.m. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign says Donald Trump has \"doubled down\" on what the Clinton team calls his \"disturbing beliefs\" by choosing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta says Pence is \"an incredibly divisive and unpopular figure.\" Podesta says Pence is known for supporting what Podesta calls \"discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families.\" Clinton's campaign says Pence was an early advocate for the tea party in Congress \u2014 and as governor, pushed a law that discriminated against gays and lesbians and alienated businesses in Indiana. The Clinton team notes Pence led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict abortion rights and has opposed raising the federal minimum wage. ___ 11:10 a.m Now that he's Donald Trump's running mate, Mike Pence has withdrawn from the Indiana governor's race. The first-term Republican governor was seeking re-election. But state law bars him from running for that office and also appearing on the ballot as a candidate for vice president. The deadline for Pence to exit the race was noon on Friday. One of the governor's aides filed the paperwork with the Indiana Secretary of State's office a few minutes after Trump announced that Pence would join him on the Republican ticket. Trump had originally planned to make his announcement on Friday, but called off the formal event in the wake of the deadly truck attack in France. Trump says he'll now hold a news conference on Saturday morning. ___ 10:54 a.m. Donald Trump says on Twitter that he's picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Trump says he'll hold a news conference on Saturday morning. Trump had originally planned to announce his running mate on Friday. But he delayed the announcement because of the attacks in Nice, France, late Thursday. Pence had already flown to New York before Trump announced the postponement. ___ 10:20 a.m. That's some disparity. It would take almost 14 days of eyes glued to the TV to watch all the feel-good Hillary Clinton ads that have aired since the general election campaign began last month. Anyone flipping through the channels looking for positive ads about Donald Trump would be disappointed. He hasn't yet put up a spot appealing to November voters, and groups supporting him have been similarly silent. It shows that the presidential candidates have drastically different views of the importance of traditional political campaigning. Trump says he sees little need for advertising at this stage. He's been banking on free media coverage propelled by his celebrity appeal. As a result, Trump has largely ceded control over what the voting public is hearing about him. Clinton's large batch of biographical ads has given her an opportunity to directly influence views about her image. ___ 10:10 a.m. An Associated Press-GfK poll finds that Hillary Clinton enters the summer damaged by perceptions that she violated the law by using a private email system while serving as secretary of state. According to the poll, more than half of Americans think the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee broke the law and nearly 4 in 10 think she did so intentionally. Clinton has battled the notion during her campaign that she is dishonest and purposely set up the private email server because she wanted to hide her public and private exchanges from public scrutiny and skirt disclosure laws. Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, calls her \"crooked\" at virtually every campaign appearance. ___ 9:50 a.m. It's a last gasp for conservatives who are trying to derail Donald Trump's drive for the Republican presidential nomination. A committee at the GOP national convention has crushed their bid to let delegates back the candidate of their choice. The convention's rules committee is dominated by Trump backers, as well as national and state GOP officials. It's appeared uncertain whether the conservatives could get enough support to force the full convention to revisit the proposal when the convention opens on Monday. Foes say they believe the movement is essentially finished. ___ 9:30 a.m. Donald Trump has offered Indiana Gov. Mike Pence the vice presidential spot on the Republican ticket \u2014 and Trump aides have told Pence that the formal announcement could come as early as Saturday. That word comes from a Republican with direct knowledge of the selection process. The Republican wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of Trump's search for a running mate and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Republican says Trump made the offer on Thursday afternoon, before Pence traveled later in the day to New York. Trump delayed his plans for a vice presidential announcement Thursday night after the truck attack in France. Trump said in television interviews Thursday night that he hadn't yet settled on a \"final, final\" choice \u2014 leaving open the possibility that Trump could change his mind.",

Galileo set out to further Nicolaus Copernicus\u2019 theory that the universe was heliocentric, a decision that would cause Galileo to be excommunicated from the Catholic Church, and live under house arrest until his death. But death was not the end of Galileo\u2019s adventure. The story of his burial is more complicated than most. Since he was excommunicated, Pope Urban VIII refused to allow a tomb to be built for Galileo, and he was initially buried in an unmarked grave in Florence, Italy.\u00a0 Nearly 100 years after his death, Galileo\u2019s body was moved to his final resting place in a tomb between Niccolo Machiavelli and Michelangelo at the Basilica of Santa Croce also in Florence. In the process of moving his body, someone cut off his middle finger, which is now on display, and is said to be pointing towards Rome.Got a\u00a0TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

            "article_content": "Dan Springer reports from Salem, Oregon The list of things 15-year-olds are not legally allowed to do in Oregon is long: Drive, smoke, donate blood, get a tattoo -- even go to a tanning bed. But, under a first-in-the-nation policy quietly enacted in January that many parents are only now finding out about, 15-year-olds are now allowed to get a sex-change operation. Many residents are stunned to learn they can do it without parental notification -- and the state will even pay for it through its Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Plan. \"It is trespassing on the hearts, the minds, the bodies of our children,\" said Lori Porter of Parents' Rights in Education. \"They're our children. And for a decision, a life-altering decision like that to be done unbeknownst to a parent or guardian, it's mindboggling.\" In a statement, Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Susan Wickstrom explained it this way: \"Age of medical consent varies by state. Oregon law -- which applies to both Medicaid and non-Medicaid Oregonians -- states that the age of medical consent is 15.\" While 15 is the medical age of consent in the state, the decision to cover sex-change operations specifically was made by the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC). Members are appointed by the governor and paid by the state of Oregon. With no public debate, HERC changed its policy to include cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and gender-reassignment surgery as covered treatments for people with gender dysphoria, formally known as gender identity disorder. HERC officials refused repeated requests by Fox News for an interview and even gave Fox News inaccurate information about the medical director's work schedule. Oregon Health Authority officials directed Fox News to their website. It shows transgender policy was discussed at four meetings in 2014. It was passed without any opposition or even discussion about teenagers' new access to undergoing a sex change. Gender dysphoria is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder in which a person identifies as the sex opposite of his or her birth. It is rare, affecting one out of every 20,000 males and one out of every 50,000 females. According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \"most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty.\" Dr. Paul McHugh, who led the Johns Hopkins Psychiatry Department and still practices, said Oregon's policy amounts to child abuse. \"We have a very radical and even mutilating treatment being offered to children without any evidence that the long-term outcome of this would be good,\" McHugh said. Dr. Jack Drescher, a member of the APA who worked on the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group, says treatment for gender dysphoria has received a lot more attention in recent years. He said this year New York changed its policy to cover cross-sex hormone drugs and sex-reassignment surgery for Medicaid recipients who are at least 18 years old. He thinks Oregon is offering the treatment too early. \"Children age 15 may not fully understand all the consequences of the procedures they are undergoing,\" he said. Jenn Burleton disagrees. She underwent a sex-reassignment surgery and started the Portland non-profit group TransActive. She said requiring parental consent would lead to more suffering and teen suicide attempts. \"Parents may not be supportive,\" Burleton said. \"They may not be in an environment where they feel the parent will affirm their identity, this may have been going on for years.\" The science is unsettled. A 2010 Murad study concluded \"very low quality evidence suggests sex reassignment ... improves gender dysphoria and overall quality of life.\" The authors admitted the evidence was \"sparse and inconclusive.\" Lisa Maloney, a parent and Scappoose, Ore., School Board member, is outraged. \"To know that taxpayers are now on the hook for that, that a child can do that without their parent's knowledge or information or consent, parents have absolutely no say, that's appalling,\" Maloney said. The Oregon Health Authority could not say how many Medicaid recipients have been treated for gender dysphoria since the new policy took effect in January. Oregon has 935,000 people enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan. HERC assumes between 14 and 112 of them may be gender dysphoric. It estimates the total cost of adding cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and sex reassignment surgeries to the coverage will be no more than $150,000 per year. But HERC also believes the state will save money due to fewer suicide attempts. It estimates there will be one less suicide attempt per year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the average cost per suicide attempt in the U.S. is $7,234. But Dr. McHugh says a sex-change operation, especially for young people with gender dysphoria, is never appropriate. \"We can help them if we begin to explore with them and their families what they're fearing about development, what they're fearing about being a young boy, a young adolescent appropriate to themselves.\"",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton delivers her acceptance speech at the DNC. (Reuters) Now that both the Democratic and Republican conventions have come to a close, it seems like an appropriate moment to take a deep breath and reflect. We have the first woman as a presidential nominee for a major political party and a former reality TV star and billionaire political outsider who shocked the world by becoming the counterpart nominee of the other. But remember, we said the same thing in 2008. Eight years ago, America elected its first black president and the Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate. For Latinos like myself, that was a groundbreaking moment for our community as well. On election night, \u201cSi se puede\u201d (Yes we can), quite literally, rang out from rooftops and on street corners. Whether or not one voted for Barack Obama, we could feel a tectonic shift in what was possible for minorities in American politics and more importantly, in American life. If ever there was a political mandate for real change, 2008 was it. And yet, despite all the work this week by Democrats to cozy up to Hispanics, the fact is that in their two years of uncontested legislative majorities and a sitting Democratic president in the White House, the party leadership failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Their failure to not prioritize immigration reform resulted in a broken promise. Now, they make the same promise again, and Latinos don\u2019t know if they can trust either party. In a recent television interview, I explained that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic. We support aspects of the platform of both parties. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans can pander to us or use us as political pawns and get away with it. We are the fastest growing voting block in America and we are already large enough to tip the scales for either party in any election. In 2004, George W. Bush received 44 percent of our vote, and in 2012 Mitt Romney received 27 percent, running on a conspicuously anti-immigration platform. Today, even with Donald Trump\u2019s deplorable rhetoric on Hispanics and his enthusiasm for building a wall, he\u2019s only polling 3-4 points behind Romney\u2019s 2012 totals. These poll numbers say less about Trump\u2019s rhetoric and more about our community\u2019s aversion to certain aspects of the Democratic platform. By-and-large, Hispanics are a deeply spiritual people. We have strong family values, support religious freedoms and the sanctity of life. Spiritually, I like to say that the Latino community is a mix between Pope Francis, Billy Graham and Martin Luther King, Jr. Just as rhetorical demagoguery targeting Mexicans and the lack of affirmation for the Hispanic American community builds a defacto wall between Latinos and the party of the elephant, so do the policies and platform espoused by the party of the donkey. By supporting Planned Parenthood, objecting to charter schools and higher standards and advancing the narrative of discrimination against Christians in education via such laws as CA Senate Bill 1146 in my home state, the Democratic Party does not speak the language of Christian Latinos. Since almost all Latinos are people of faith, the fact remains, the Democrats missed their best chance to pass immigration reform. Given all that Trump has said this election cycle, it would be easy to assume he would have close to zero support from Hispanics.\u00a0What\u2019s perhaps most amazing is that he has as much support as he does. Regardless of Trump\u2019s behavior and rhetoric, which I\u2019ve publicly criticized time and again, his party\u2019s policies are more in line with our values. This should be a wake up call to Democrats everywhere. You cannot stand opposed to our faith and you cannot fill us with empty promises. If you want our vote, you too must earn it.\u00a0If only....",

            "article_content": "FILE -- August 2, 2011. The U.S. Capitol dome and U.S. Senate (R) in Washington. (Reuters) (Reuters) Quantum physicists sometimes discuss the possibility of a \u201cmultiverse.\u201d A multiverse is where the cosmos is like a layered quilt, populated with alternate realities, different dimensions and unique timelines. As a result, an infinite number of possibilities or scenarios pass along each temporal continuum. Capitol Hill is now seemingly moored in a legislative multiverse. The House and Senate return to Washington in early September, following an epic, seven-week summer recess. There are only a handful of policy issues lawmakers must tackle when Congress reconvenes, but an almost incalculable string of outcomes loom ahead when they return. In other words, almost anything can happen. House Republican leaders conducted a half-hour conference call with rank-and-file GOPers late Thursday. According to sources familiar with the call, the Republican brass offered few specifics as to their approaches on big issues like funding the government, Zika and even an effort by House conservatives to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. \u201cIt was the least informative call I\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d groused one Republican lawmaker. \u201cI learned next to nothing,\u201d complained another. \u201cPathetic,\u201d lamented a senior Republican. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., routinely publishes a memo at various calendar intervals about upcoming legislative plans. Though the missive is addressed to House Republicans, McCarthy\u2019s audience is really the congressional press corps and other interested parties tracking legislation. There was a paucity of information about the schedule in this month\u2019s missive. Granted, the letter talked about the long-term policy blueprint crafted by House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., titled \u201cA Better Way.\u201d But nothing addressed issues in the near-term. McCarthy instead presented metrics about bills Congress has already moved through committee or across the House floor. At no point did he talk about plans to fund the federal government beyond an approaching October 1 deadline. He also failed to shed light on how Congress may address the growing Zika crisis in Florida. Congressional leaders on both sides of Capitol Hill don\u2019t have a lot of answers right now. The political universes won\u2019t fully form until lawmakers return to their orbits inside the Beltway. So, let\u2019s explore some of the strands of the congressional multiverse to anticipate some scenarios and outcomes. The major issue is funding the government to avoid a shutdown on October 1, the start of the federal fiscal year. Conservatives are pushing for a stopgap plan -- called a \u201cContinuing Resolution\u201d or \u201cCR\u201d -- which would fund the government through next March. Democrats and the House Republican leadership prefer a plan which runs until early December. Conservatives see no value in approving a plan through December when they can just handle everything now in a massive, catch-all package. Others like the shorter bill because they can then make decisions based on outcomes in the election. Fox is told House Republicans plan to discuss the different approaches on the interim spending bill in a conference meeting the day after lawmakers return to Washington. Republicans are infighting about the length of the CR. The GOP leadership and many Republican senators would prefer Congress adopt a plan that runs through early-December. Conservatives want next March. Senate Republicans think that\u2019s too long. They worry the GOP won\u2019t control the Senate next year and they can assert more influence now. House conservatives could reject a shorter bill or a plan that doesn\u2019t match their spending priorities. It\u2019s quite possible Ryan could turn to Democrats to provide votes to approve the spending bill. That\u2019s a maneuver which eventually got former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, into trouble. And it could be the same headache for Ryan. Combatting Zika might impact both the length and scope of the spending plan. Florida Republicans demanded throughout the recess that Congress return to session early to address the issue. The House approved a Zika plan in late June. But Senate Democrats filibustered the package over provisions dealing with Planned Parenthood. Some House Republicans believe Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, \u00a0would ultimately relent and permit approval of the existing Zika measure if that\u2019s the only plan on the table. But many are skeptical of that school of thought. Florida voters are blaming Republicans for the lack of additional Zika funding and taking notice of the protracted congressional recess. That\u2019s why Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican, will jet to Washington to lobby lawmakers on the issue on the first day Congress returns to session. One of only two votes on the Senate schedule is a procedural roll call to break the Democrats\u2019 filibuster of the Zika bill. It\u2019s a revote of one which failed earlier this summer. It\u2019s possible Congress could approve a reworked, standalone Zika bill. It\u2019s also possible lawmakers could combine the packages. It\u2019s possible the House could approve a spending plan amenable to only House conservatives -- knowing full well that is just a show vote. That scenario could enable the Senate to prepare a bill that combines spending and Zika and permit Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to take the lead on the plan. Rubio faces a tough re-election this fall in a swing state. Allowing Rubio to flex his legislative muscles on an issue critically important to his home state could help him at the polls. When Congress returns, Ryan faces two potential problems involving the House Freedom Caucus. Keep in mind the Freedom Caucus is the group of roughly 40 conservatives who eventually helped usher Boehner into retirement last fall. Freedom Caucus members now believe Ryan and other GOP leadership sources \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d helped GOP challenger Roger Marshall defeat Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, in a primary earlier this month. Ryan confidantes and other Republican leaders deny this allegation. But Fox is told some Freedom Caucus members want a huddle with the speaker when Congress returns. One influential members of the Freedom Caucus tells Fox they will be watching to see how Ryan addresses their concerns. \u201cRyan needs to work this out,\u201d said the lawmaker. \u201cHe\u2019ll have problems in January.\u201d \u201cJanuary\u201d refers to the vote for speaker on the House floor. Members of the caucus grudgingly went along with Ryan in his bid for speaker. Ryan has generally scored good marks from Freedom Caucus members his short tenure as leader of the GOP-controlled chamber. But things could become unsettled if the Freedom Caucus isn\u2019t pleased with the speaker. Just before the break in July, Huelskamp and Rep. John Fleming, R-La., filed a special resolution demanding that the House impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. That resolution dissolved over the break. Now, members of the House Freedom Caucus want to bring it back. Fox has learned the House won\u2019t wrestle with the issue immediately as Freedom Caucus members will wait to see how the GOP leadership intends to handle the matter. House Republican leaders aren\u2019t fans of Koskinen. But they are lukewarm on impeaching the IRS chief. Congress hasn\u2019t impeached a cabinet official since it sanctioned Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. As IRS commissioner, Koskinen isn\u2019t even a cabinet official. There\u2019s concern about setting a precedent if Congress begins impeaching various administration officials. House Republicans will hold a separate conference meeting on Koskinen in mid-September. A source familiar with the thinking of the Freedom Caucus tells Fox its members aren\u2019t in a hurry to refile the Koskinen resolution right away. They don\u2019t want to pressure leadership right off the bat. A House GOP leadership source told Fox that the public isn\u2019t attuned to impeaching Koskinen. Still, the GOP leadership could further draw the ire of the Freedom Caucus if there isn\u2019t a try to impeach Koskinen. This is the Capitol Hill multiverse. No one is quite sure how lawmakers will resolve these issues in the end. But as lawmakers return to Washington, there are almost an infinite number of scenarios and possibilities -- because virtually no one\u2019s decided anything yet.",

The ad, which focuses on Trump\u2019s liberal positions of the past and of the present, dovetails with a recent television and online barrage from groups supporting Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The Quinnipiac University poll out today of likely GOP Iowa caucus-goers shows just how high the stakes are for the last-ditch effort to block Trump. The Republican frontrunner leads Cruz by the scantest of margins 31 percent to 29 percent with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a furlong behind Trump and Cruz. Those numbers are essentially unchanged from last month. The rest of the pack is knotted up far behind Rubio. Funding for the group, Our Principles PAC, remains unknown, but its spokeswoman Katie Packer Gage, was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. Other GOP heavy hitters are rumored to be on the team as well. Gage said that the ad is focused on Iowa \u201cfor now.\u201d Though she did not comment on the size of the ad buy, those with knowledge of the group\u2019s activities, including one Iowa GOP operative, suggested the initial push is backed by at least $1 million dollars. Other buys are said to be planned for subsequent primary markets in New Hampshire and South Carolina The 30-second spot is a trimmed down version of a longer loop of Trump\u2019s flip-flop for liberal positions that made the rounds on the internet last week. Attacking Trump for inconsistent and liberal positions might not be a winner with the new voters \u2013 including many Democrats and left-leaning independents \u2013 Trump is trying to attract to the caucuses. As a Fox News poll out over the weekend shows, Trump is an overwhelming favorite among those who say they plan to attend their first caucus on Monday. This surge in first-time caucus goers would be unprecedented in Iowa political history. But the Quinnipiac poll gives a snapshot of two electorates in Iowa: one with the Trump surge in new caucus goers, and one without. Cruz wins under the normal model, Trump wins when the surge is present. While Iowa waits to see if history is about to be made, Republicans seem focused on hitting Trump with the GOP base and eroding his support among more predictable caucus goers. Cruz hits Trump hard in Iowa - Dallas Morning News: \u201cEntering the Iowa homestretch under attack and still overshadowed by Donald Trump, Ted Cruz hit back Monday by painting the billionaire as a phony conservative and evangelical. And he projected confidence that he\u2019ll finish strong in the first test of the 2016 contest next Monday night. He asserted that Trump supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and \u201cBernie Sanders-style socialized medicine.\u2019 And he launched a coordinated effort to portray Trump as a \u2018New York liberal.\u2019\u201d READERS REACT: GOP POWER INDEX\u201cMy thought at this point is I\u2019m willing to wait the week to let IA and NH folks have their say.\u00a0 But if a candidate doesn\u2019t come in the top 4 (or definitely 5) in either of those contests, it\u2019s time to get out of the way.\u201d \u2013 J.E. Schreiner  \u201cI believe you are right on with your Bush assessment.\u00a0 As a strong supporter of both Governor Bush and Senator Rubio here in the State of Florida, I am deeply disappointed with Mr. Bush in how he has handled the Rubio situation\u2026.I will be voting for Marco Rubio without question now as the best bet to beat Clinton.\u00a0 How sad for Jeb Bush and the State of Florida.\u201d \u2013 Dennis Bignham \u201cTrump has been the big dog in national and state polls of Republican primary voters since July. He has achieved this feat by having the staunchest supporters of any candidate. No attack ad, no media outrage, no gaffe has seemed to dissuade his supporters.\u201d \u2013 Ray Quigley WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026On this day in 1979, \u201cDukes of Hazard,\u201d a television show about cousins living in the rural South, premiered. The show has created many references that have become mainstays in pop culture, but one of the shows central themes revolved around a more controversial image: crazy car chases with the family vehicle named The General Lee, which had a Confederate flag painted across the roof. Although TV Land pulled reruns of the show over the appearance of the flag, the Atlantic says that its inclusion in the popular show actually neutralized the message. As the article explains: \u201cThe\u00a0Dukes of Hazzard\u00a0solidified the idea that the flag could have\u2014or at least could claim to have\u2014an alternate meaning besides the original one of defiant racism. But the show also made clear how awkward that alternate meaning can be. It suggested the way that a flag, layered onto to the body of a car, can have its own kind of layered meaning. And the layering continued. The defiance continued. As late as\u00a02005\u2019s feature-filmed reboot of the show, the Confederate flag remained atop the General Lee.\u201d Got a TIP\u00a0from the\u00a0RIGHT\u00a0or the\u00a0LEFT?

The spot, being aired by the ESA Fund, describes Mr. Sanders\u2019s policy positions on a range of issues, such as tuition-free college and single-payer health care, saying that it amounts to a flood of new government spending. \u2026The spot is expected to be backed by $600,000 in spending on television ads, and there will be additional expenditures on radio and digital advertising.\u201d HILLARY SLIPS AGAIN IN NEW GRANITE STATE POLLBoston Herald: \u201cHillary Clinton faces a 16-point deficit to a challenger almost universally liked by New Hampshire Democratic voters \u2014 from liberals to independents \u2014 while Republican Donald Trump has widened his big lead over rival Texas U.S. Sen.

Now, two years into the law, it\u2019s clear that progress is going to be slower. The Obama administration acknowledged as much\u00a0in late 2014, and again\u00a0in October, when it presented its own modest predictions. Monday, the budget office also agreed,\u00a0slashing its 2016 estimate\u00a0by close to 40 percent. \u2026 The new budget and economic outlook\u00a0now predicts\u00a0that about 13 million people will get their health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces this year, down from an earlier estimate of 21 million. The budget office\u2019s estimates for future years won\u2019t be released until March, but it seems reasonable to assume they will also come down.

Piet Lammert, vice principal of Camden Hills Regional High School in Rockport, posted the controversial remarks on his Facebook page, one day after a white lone gunman shot and killed three people and wounded nine others at a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic on Nov. 27. \"The only terrorists we need to fear are domestic white 'Christian' men with easy access to guns. Vote Bernie,\" Lammert wrote. After public criticism of the post -- which has since been removed -- Lammert penned an apology Nov. 29 on his Facebook page. \"I am writing to take responsibility and apologize for a post that I made on my private Facebook account yesterday,\" wrote Lammert. \"I mistakenly left my setting open to 'Public' and in doing so made a post that offended some members of our community and beyond.\" \"I deeply regret doing so, take full responsibility, and hope that those I offended will accept my apology,\" he said. \"I would also ask that those who shared my post would share my apology as well so that it reaches those who I offended but don\u2019t personally know.\" Days later, after a Muslim couple radicalized by ISIS gunned down 14 people in California, Lammert issued a second, lengthy apology for his comment on the social media site. \"With true humility, I write to apologize for the offensive statement that I recently posted on Facebook,\" Lammert wrote last Friday, two days after Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik opened fire at a holiday party in theInland Regional CenterinSan Bernardino, killing 14 people and injuring 21 before they were killed in a fierce gun battle with police. \"I did not intend this statement literally when I wrote it -- it was an exaggeration -- but soon after realized that it was unintentionally hurtful, offensive, and divisive at a time when more than ever we need compassion and understanding,\" Lammert said in his second post. \"In short, I did not mean what I said and wish with all my heart that I could take it back. But I need to take responsibility for it nonetheless, because I wrote it. \"Had I simply written what I meant, the post would have reflected my urgent distress at the epidemic of mass violence in our country, which more recent events have proven to span all social groups,\" he continued. \"Ironically, in my effort to point out that we run the risk of simplifying the problem by singling out a particular ethnic group, I did exactly that to the group to which I belong. It was careless and rash.\" Lammert's apology was shared 129 times and received wide-spread support from other Facebook users. \"Piet I was one of those you truly offended if not the most offended,\" wrote one man. \"My family is full of white Christian men with easy access to guns. My family and I have spent our lives serving our Country, people around the world and I now serve our State. \"That being said I am Christian and forgiving,\" the man wrote to Lammert. \"You are a good man and it took courage to post this and own up to a mistake. You have my respect and trust.\" \"We support you Piet and I respect you for apologizing to those who were offended. I hope they are open to forgiveness,\" wrote another person. Maria Libby, the superintendent of the school system, criticized the Facebook post but defended Lammert's character. \"He understands that he made a mistake and he has tried to take responsibility for that,\" Libby told FoxNews.com Tuesday -- though she added, \"I don\u2019t think that everyone in the community would say it\u2019s resolved.\" \"I think that there are people in the community who are quite upset over the post and may not be happy unless that assistant principal is fired,\" she said. Libby said the situation has been handled appropriately but did not provide details on what actions were taken. She said he will not be fired. Libby described Lammert as a \"caring, compassionate, open and trust-worthy\" vice principal who has worked for 17 years at the school -- first as a guidance counselor. \"He has a stellar reputation in our district,\" Libby said. \"He has been very well loved by students and parents.\"",

            "article_content": "Sept. 13, 2016: Senate Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid of Nev. speaks to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 A must-do bill to prevent the government from shutting down this weekend and to fund the fight against the Zika virus is stalled in the Senate, held up by bipartisan opposition as the clock ticks toward a Friday deadline. Democrats, demanding money so Flint, Michigan, can address its lead-contaminated water crisis, overwhelmingly opposed the measure is a Senate test vote Tuesday. So did a dozen of the Senate's most conservative members. The 45-55 vote ties up the stopgap funding bill \u2014 for now at least. The GOP defections left Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., short of a simple majority, much less the 60 votes needed to clear a filibuster hurdle. McConnell is looking for a way out of the legislative box canyon that doesn't include capitulating on Flint, which GOP leaders fear would start a revolt among House tea party conservatives. Instead, senior congressional leaders are scrambling for a compromise solution on the Flint water issue that would satisfy Democrats. The Senate has passed $220 million worth of aid to Flint and other cities grappling with lead-tainted water and want the package added to the temporary spending bill. Republican leaders are promising to address the Flint issue after the election in endgame talks on a separate water resources bill, but Democrats refuse to take them at their word. \"'Trust me, we will consider Flint later' \u2014 that's like nothing to me,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said talks continued. \"There might be an element (on Flint) we could do,\" McCarthy told reporters. Democrats say it's unfair that the water crisis in Flint has gone on for more than a year with no assistance, while Louisiana and other states are getting $500 million for floods that occurred just last month. Democrats have played a strong hand in the negotiations and know they have leverage because Republicans controlling the House and Senate are eager to avoid a politically harmful shutdown at midnight Friday. \"Democrats have been clear that Congress should not leave Flint and other lead-tainted communities out of any (stopgap spending) negotiation that includes emergency disaster funding,\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and other top Democrats in a Tuesday morning letter to McConnell. McConnell characterized the Democratic position as \"no Flint, no flood\" and indicated he is considering dropping the flood aid. Both sides hope to avert that. The stopgap spending bill would keep the government running through Dec. 9 and provide $1.1 billion in long-delayed funding to fight the spread of the Zika virus and develop a vaccine and improved tests to detect it. Zika can cause can cause grave birth defects. McConnell has made numerous concessions in weeks of negotiations on the measure, agreeing, for instance, to drop contentious provisions tied to Zika funding that led Democrats to filibuster prior Zika measures this summer and earlier this month. A provision to make Planned Parenthood ineligible for new anti-Zika funding for Puerto Rico was dropped, as was a provision to ease pesticide regulations under the Clean Water Act. A $400 million package of spending cuts added to the measure is no longer controversial. The measure also includes a popular full-year spending bill that provides a 4 percent budget increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \"Can it really be that Democratic leaders have embraced dysfunction so thoroughly that they'd tank a noncontroversial, 10-week funding bill over \u2014 well, what exactly?\" McConnell asked, as he opened the Senate on Tuesday. \"It's almost as if a few Democratic leaders decided long ago that bringing our country to the brink would make for good election-year politics.\" Republicans say the Flint issue will be handled in a separate measure to authorize water development projects. House floor debate began Tuesday on that measure \u2014 without Flint money \u2014 but Republicans are telegraphing it will be included in any final measure handled in a postelection session. But GOP leaders on Monday night blocked Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich. \u2014 who represents Flint \u2014 from getting a vote on the Senate measure. Kildee noted that Flint is a predominantly African-American city and that other areas of the country are often quick to win help when disaster strikes. \"There's something about this poor community \u2014 this poor, majority-minority community \u2014 that exempts them from the kind of help that we have provided time and time again to people in crisis in this country,\" said Kildee, who is white. \"I hate to come to the conclusion that there's something about these people that causes this Congress to decide they don't deserve that help. That is a shame.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Tuesday that the water development bill \"is the better place to address this.\" The White House, which has not transmitted an official request for Flint aid, poked at Ryan for excluding it from the water projects bill. \"The speaker of the House says he opposes adding funding for Flint to the continuing resolution and believes that it should be handled in the water resources bill. But it's not included in the water resources bill that's advancing through the House. And then he has the nerve to suggest that it's Democrats who are the ones causing problems,\" said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.",

            "article_content": "June 28, 2016: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev speaks in Washington. (AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 A year after South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its capitol grounds, official Washington is struggling with further restrictions on the flag's display on federal property, including in the U.S. Capitol complex. The National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Army have longstanding guidelines for its cemeteries that permit display of the Confederate flag one or two days a year. This is particularly true in Southern states that celebrate Confederate Memorial Day, giving descendants of Southern soldiers the chance to use the flag to commemorate their ancestors. Last week, Republicans quietly dumped a provision preventing the flag from being flown over mass graves of Confederate soldiers from broader legislation to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. Flag displays would still have been allowed over the graves of individual soldiers. The move angered Democrats, especially since both House Republicans and Democrats had voted in May for the provision. Further complicating the issue is that the flag provision had been combined with an overall bill to fund the fight against the Zika virus. \"Republicans even used this ... listen to this one -- to block the prohibition of Confederate flags on federal facilities,\" said top Senate Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid mentioned the flag fight every day this week, often muddying the facts. On Monday, he accused Republicans of allowing the flag to fly over \"any veterans' facility,\" which would include hospitals and clinics. On Tuesday, he claimed that there is already an \"order in effect saying you can't fly the flag on military cemeteries\" and said Republicans would rescind it. Congressional Democrats have not pressed the White House on this issue. Unlike official rulemaking, which requires public feedback and can take years, guidelines on the flag can be swiftly changed by agency officials who answer to the White House. The White House seemed surprised when asked about it this week. \"I'm not aware of any executive action that's being contemplated,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. The White House followed up with a response detailing the limited circumstances in which the flag can be displayed in VA cemeteries. The flag issue became a national discussion after a white man was arrested for gunning down nine black parishioners last year at a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina. Democrats tried in the aftermath of the shooting to ban the flag's display at cemeteries run by the National Park Service, but divisions in the House scuttled the effort. While Republicans in Washington ducked the Confederate flag issue, the South Carolina legislature -- dominated by tea party Republicans and including many black Democrats -- voted overwhelmingly to remove the flag from the Capitol grounds in Columbia. The debate won wide praise for its civility. In Washington this year, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., sought to put the Confederate flag controversy to rest. Ryan approved a move to block the Mississippi flag, which incorporates the Confederate battle flag in its top inner corner, from being restored to its display in a passageway between the Capitol and a House office building. Republicans negotiating the final bill to fund the Veterans Affairs department abandoned the provision despite the House vote in May. \"It is shameful that Republicans would once again seek to allow Confederate battle flags, a historic symbol of hate, to be flown over VA cemeteries,\" said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who had sponsored the provision. Republicans rammed the bill through the House last week, but Senate Democrats blocked it on Tuesday, angered by the way Republicans had funded the Zika fight and the restrictions they imposed on money for Planned Parenthood. On Thursday, Reid revisited the Confederate flag topic: \"Just for icing on their cake, they decided, `You know, let's get rid of that language in the bill that says you can't fly a Confederate flag in a military cemetery.' \" Yet he bristled when asked Thursday about the flag, including whether the Senate should follow Ryan's lead and remove the Mississippi flag from a tunnel connecting the Capitol and a Senate office building. \"I can't imagine you're hung up on this when we have all the other problems facing us,\" Reid chided a questioner.",

            "article_content": "Inside the potential fallout from House speaker shakeup Grassroots conservatives are doing a victory lap after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy abruptly withdrew from the speaker race \u2013 but whether they can come together behind a consensus candidate and a common agenda remains to be seen. What exactly these groups and lawmakers want in a new leader, and whether they\u2019d back somebody who also has favor with the so-called \u201cestablishment,\u201d is the big question as the House postpones leadership elections. In a series of interviews on Friday, representatives with several influential conservative groups told FoxNews.com they\u2019re looking for a candidate who speaks to their values. Specifically \u2013 while their stances are not monolithic \u2013 they said they want to see someone who will \u201chold the line\u201d on budgetary spending caps. Some also want to see more done on tax reform, an often-discussed goal that has never materialized into real action, as well as regulatory reform and efforts to rein in agencies like the EPA and IRS. \u201cThere are places where we can and should be fighting,\u201d Mark Meckler, president of Citizens for Self-Governance, told FoxNews.com. Meckler has traveled to dozens of states to gauge political sentiment within the conservative base. \u201cThey are frustrated that their representatives have been fighting no fight. They feel like all they\u2019ve seen is capitulation, surrender and unwarranted compromise. And they are looking ahead at leaders who will pick those strategic fights,\u201d he said. Meckler and others say the sticking point is also about style. \u201cFrom a grassroots perspective, I think [McCarthy] was polluted from the start in his association with [John] Boehner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way Boehner ran the House, there was very little input from the conservative wing and that was very frustrating for people.\u201d McCarthy, in withdrawing, said he thinks the conference needs a \u201cfresh face\u201d and voiced doubts about his own ability to attract a majority vote for speaker on the House floor. His announcement immediately put attention on the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose 30-40 members were planning to back rival candidate Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. But that\u2019s just one faction \u2013 leaders face pressure from an array of conservative blocs, who in turn face pressure from a network of Tea Party groups, fiscal watchdogs and others pushing for limited government, lower taxes, and other issues, each with a different idea of what fights are worth having and what fights are a lost cause. One area of common ground might be in budgetary spending caps, which some Republicans have tried to ease for defense. \u201cOur activists are adamant they hold the line on those spending caps,\u201d said Levi Russell, spokesman for Americans for Prosperity. \u201cI think there is recognition that some issues are more controversial than others. I think you start with spending. I think there is ample opportunity to enjoin the leadership on that issue.\u201d That, he added, will \u201cgive breathing space for the other, more controversial issues.\u201d Despite grumbling from the base, Boehner has entertained efforts to launch against-the-odds legislative fights with the administration, most notably using the budget as leverage to try and undo ObamaCare in 2013. The effort failed, as did a short-lived attempt to defund Planned Parenthood. Republicans point to bills passed to green-light the Keystone XL Pipeline and repeal ObamaCare\u2019s medical device tax as victories -- \u201cbut that\u2019s small ball. People want to see real things get done,\u201d Adam Brandon, CEO of FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com. There is no question these activists feel emboldened by recent events. After McCarthy dropped out, Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin declared it the second \u201cvictory\u201d for the grassroots \u2013 the first being Boehner\u2019s resignation. Left vying for the speakership are Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Webster. It is not clear whether either could get the roughly 218 votes needed to win. Others are considering joining and top GOP leaders are meanwhile pressuring Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to enter, despite his resistance. \u201c[Ryan] is a very credible candidate,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a member of the Freedom Caucus, told Fox News, adding: \u201cOutside of that, there are already other candidates who are here.\u201d Meckler said there is a good chance other conservatives may end up jumping in by early next week. \u201cThere are people who have been in Congress for a little while, they know the people and they have a great track record,\u201d he said, noting he\u2019s heard Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s name bandied about, as well as Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon\u2019s. \u201cI would love to see [Texas Rep.] Jeb Hensarling get in the race,\u201d he added. As with the presidential primary race right now, Martin said, this is a time for outsiders, and not \u201cestablishment thinking.\u201d Yet, practically speaking, it\u2019s unclear whether any true outsider candidate could muster a majority on the House floor for the speakership. Deep divisions remain in the Republican caucus, with a key complaint against the conservative wing being that they expect the leadership to be unyielding on demands they have little chance of getting. Republican strategist Brent Littlefield said it is reasonable to look for a leader who sticks to conservative principles, but can \u201cbring everyone together to move an agenda and be a good spokesman for our common beliefs.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think they are exclusive of one another,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "I am the bad boy of Facebook. I earned that badge of honor back in 2013 when Facebook blocked my page and removed a message I had posted that invoked Paula Deen, the National Rifle Association and Jesus Christ. Here\u2019s what I wrote: \"I'm about as politically incorrect as you can get. I'm wearing an NRA ball cap, eating a Chick-fil-A sandwich, reading a Paula Deen cookbook and sipping a 20-ounce sweet tea while sitting in my Cracker Barrel rocking chair with the Gaither Vocal Band singing 'Jesus Saves' on the stereo and a Gideon's Bible in my pocket. Yes sir, I'm politically incorrect and happy as a June bug.\" The folks over at Facebook took great offense to that message. Join Todd\u2019s American Dispatch newsletter: A must-read for conservatives! \"We removed this from Facebook because it violates our Community Standards,\" Facebook wrote me. \"So you're temporarily blocked from using this feature.\" I wasn't even allowed to post our daily Bible verse -- a popular feature called \"Morning Glory -- Start Your Day Inspired.\" For the record, I really do have a Cracker Barrel rocking chair, I'm quite fond of sweet tea, I love Chick-fil-A, I'm a huge fan of Southern Gospel music, I own several Paula Deen cookbooks and I'm a proud member of the National Rifle Association. Does that make me a bad person? I was genuinely perplexed by Facebook's censors \u2013 befuddled even. So I decided to investigate Facebook's community standards \u2013 which at best \u2013 are rather vague. Among its commandments were bans on nudity, bullying, harassment, graphic content, pornography and spam. For the record, I require all of our followers to wear pants and Miss Paula was not doing anything unladylike with a stick of butter. It is true that one of my daily postings included some spam \u2013 a delicious recipe for a fried spam sandwich. It's even more puzzling that they would target a patriotic, conservative website like mine when they allow a host of vulgar, violent and pornographic sites to stay in business. Among the sites I found just this morning: \u201cF*** Donald Trump\u201d \u201cF*** Sarah Palin Hoe A** B**** \u201cTea Party Can Kiss My A**\u201d \u201cRush Limbaugh is an Abject A******\u201d Had I been reading Saul Alinsky's\u00a0\u201cRules For Radicals,\u201d wearing a Planned Parenthood ball cap and smoking a joint, Facebook would've left me alone. Facebook's decision to block me generated quite a bit of outrage. Don't choke on your Fruit Loops, but even the folks over at\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0came to my defense. And a few hours after banning me, Facebook had a change of heart. \"A member of our team accidentally removed something you posted on Facebook,\" they told me in an email. \"This was a mistake and we sincerely apologize for this error.\" Since that fateful day, I\u2019ve noticed that my page has been subjected to random censorship by the Facebook gods. I\u2019ve received dozens of complaints from readers who tell me my content no longer appears on their pages. In some cases, Facebook won\u2019t allow them to share my postings. And I\u2019ve lost count of the number of fellow conservative writers whose pages have been blocked, banned or censored. So I wasn\u2019t all that surprised when a group of former Facebook workers told the tech news website Gizmodo that they put a liberal spin on \u201cTrending Topics\u201d \u2013 and routinely censored conservative news. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg strongly denied the allegations. \u201cFacebook stands for giving everyone a voice,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook posting. \u201cWe believe the world is better when people from different backgrounds and with different ideas all have the power to share their thoughts and experiences. That\u2019s what makes social media unique.\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg has agreed to meet with some conservative newsmakers later this week to address the allegations that Facebook suppressed conservative content. \u201cThe reason I care so much about this is that it gets to the core of everything Facebook is and everything I want it to be,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEvery tool we build is designed to give more people a voice and bring our global community together. For as long as I'm leading this company this will always be our mission.\u201d I really want to believe that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s social networking platform is a place where anyone can share anything \u2013a place that gives people a voice -- including people who ascribe to traditional American values. Because any community that frowns upon the Good Book and sweet tea is a community that violates my personal standards.",

            "article_content": "Giving the gunman what he wants The boyfriend of the Virginia television reporter who was shot and killed live on the air in August has met with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to discuss the possibility of running for Congress, Fox News has learned. Chris Hurst worked with Alison Parker at WDBJ-TV in Roanoke, Va., and is still a journalist there. The two had been dating and had moved in together shortly before she was murdered. Fox News is told Hurst has since spoken with Democratic officials and lawmakers about a possible run for Congress. The DCCC, the group with which he met, is the national organization charged with electing Democrats to the House. At present, this is in a very preliminary stage. Fox News is told the DCCC is not actively recruiting Hurst and that despite the discussions, Hurst is not expected to run for the seat -- though nothing is final. The House seat in the Roanoke area is currently held by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. Going up against the powerful Republican would be an uphill climb. Goodlatte garnered 66 percent of the vote in this very GOP district in 2014 and has never dipped below 60 percent since his first election in 1992. President Obama scored just over 40 percent of the vote in this district in 2012. Still, firearms is a big issue for Democrats amid a recent wave of mass shootings. Just Wednesday, a group of House Democrats called for the reinstatement of the assault-weapons ban. Democrats tried unsuccessfully to attach a provision onto the omnibus spending bill now moving through Congress to remove a prohibition on federal gun violence research. And there was an effort a few weeks ago to latch various firearms provisions to a Senate measure to repeal ObamaCare and defund Planned Parenthood. Democrats would like a candidate to take up the cause once championed by former Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who retired earlier this year. She came to Congress in 1996 on a platform of gun control and safety after her husband was killed and son wounded in a 1993 mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road. Democratic sources note the odds were also against McCarthy when she ran as a political novice in 1996. She defeated then-Rep. Daniel Frisa, R-N.Y., seizing Democratic control of the district.",

            "article_content": "'The O'Reilly Factor' analyzes the release of new undercover videos Two Democratic operatives are out of a job after a controversial conservative activist released undercover footage showing discussions of \"busing\" in voters and inciting violence at Republican rallies. Scott Foval, the national field director of Americans United for Change, was booted on Monday and Democracy Partners head Robert Creamer announced on Tuesday he was \u201cstepping back\u201d from efforts to elect Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \u201cI am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing [Hillary] Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\u201d Creamer said in a statement. The Democratic National Committee also disavowed the schemes discussed in the video. \u201cThe practices described in the video by this temporary sub-contractor do not in any way comport with our long standing policies on organizing events, and those statements and sentiments do not represent the values that the Committee holds dear,\u201d DNC interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile said of Foval in a statement on Tuesday. The undercover \u201cRigging the Election\u201d videos, produced by controversial activist James O\u2019Keefe, total over 32 minutes and were released in two, edited portions on\u00a0Monday\u00a0and\u00a0Tuesday. An undercover filmmaker posing as a donor is seen attempting to engage Foval and Creamer in discussions of voter fraud and other schemes. Creamer doesn\u2019t bite, but Foval fills the filmmaker in on supposed plots and implicates Creamer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy thing for Republicans to say, \u2018Well, they\u2019re busing people in.\u2019 \u2026 We\u2019ve been busing people in to deal with you f-----\u2018 a------- for fifty years and we\u2019re not going to stop now, we\u2019re just going to find a different way to do it,\u201d says Foval, who indicates using personal vehicles for each voter arouses less suspicion than busing in a large number of people from out of state at once. Foval also discusses planting people at rallies for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Those chosen are sent to incite violence and are even given scripts and training, according to Foval. \u201cI mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these a------- to pop off,\u201d Foval says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know? You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you.\u201d Foval worked as a sub-contractor for Creamer\u2019s group, which was contracted with the DNC since June 2016. A DNC source stressed that Foval was not a DNC employee. Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said, \"While Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed.\" As reported on \"The Kelly File,\"\u00a0Creamer also is shown on video being asked about circumventing voter registration laws for Hispanics, though he later said in a statement that none of the schemes described in the conversation on video ever took place. O\u2019Keefe has previously come under fire for heavily editing and manipulating his recordings. His tactics have also been questioned. O\u2019Keefe was arrested while trying to gain access to Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s office in Louisiana in 2010. He was later charged with a misdemeanor and sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. \u201cThe discredited source of these videos, James O\u2019Keefe, is a convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance his ideological agenda,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cWe are in the process of conducting an internal investigation to determine whether he and his cohorts committed any illegal activities in this well-funded operation.\u201d Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.",

However, he added fuel to the fire by continuing to slam the group\u2019s backers, the Koch brothers, calling them \u2018un-American.\u2019\u00a0 Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips, in response, said Reid had effectively \u2018attacked the character and integrity of every American who had the courage to share how they're being hurt by the president's health care law\u2019\u2026 Reid said Wednesday morning on the Senate floor that he believes Americans for Prosperity hires actors in their ads to tell fake stories about canceled policies, higher premiums and ruined lives under ObamaCare. \u2018There\u2019s plenty of horror stories being told,\u2019 Reid said. \u2018All of them are untrue. But they\u2019re being told all over America.\u2019\u2019\u2019 [\u201cThey\u2019re desperate because every single one of them who passed ObamaCare has been a disaster for the country and they\u2019re afraid there will be a price for it later this November\u2026 The Senate majority leader calling them a liar, is just going to make them want to come out and tell their story.

The problem is that the situation in Ukraine IS rocky. With Russia staging military exercises off the coast and more aggressive statements coming from Moscow, critics are saying the Obama administration could use a little more Stallone.

President Obama\u2019s job approval dropped 5 points since last month\u2019s poll, dipping down to 41 percent, tying his lowest-ever rating in that category. Public esteem for the president\u2019s party slipped to 42 percent, a level not seen since, you guessed it, 2010. Republicans led in the generic congressional ballot test by 4 points, higher than any NYT/CBS poll during the last midterm cycle. Wondering why? Consider that the percent of respondents who said that ObamaCare should be repealed in its entirety jumped 8 points to 42 percent since January. The share of voters who believed the law can be repaired dropped 6 points to 50 percent. Among the 38 percent of respondents who called themselves independents \u2013 the largest category of potential voters \u2013 Democrats trailed Republicans by 14 points in the generic ballot.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO PUMP BIG CASH INTO 2014 RACESAmerica\u2019s largest abortion provider is touting big spending for this year\u2019s elections. Planned Parenthood told Politico that it would dump some $16 million into midterm races. It\u2019s a far cry from the money that big labor and big business will spend to keep Democrats in control of the Senate, but it would further enhance the clout of the organization. That\u2019s important because the group relies heavily on tax subsidies to operate. [Abortion group makes nod for Pa. Gov - Planned Parenthood is picking Rep.

Cory Gardner will challenge incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. This is a coup not just because Gardner is top-tier talent \u2013 a rising star in the House who snatched a seat from an incumbent Democrat in 2010 and was re-elected by a 17-point margin in 2012 \u2013 but because the previous frontrunner for the nomination, Ken Buck, bowed out gracefully to run in Gardner\u2019s current district covering the state\u2019s eastern plains. Buck got tangled up in his 2010 run against Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., when Buck gave a politically incorrect answer to a question from NBC News about the causes of gayness. The last poll done in the state showed Buck nipping at Udall\u2019s heels. With Udall suffering for his office\u2019s part in trying to suppress the release of policy cancellations under ObamaCare, the incumbent looks very vulnerable. While the state\u2019s Republican gubernatorial contest still carries some worry for the party, Buck\u2019s departure from the statewide race will make it harder for Democrats and the press to paint the GOP as \u201cextreme.\u201d Gardner, a former state representative, is plenty conservative, but isn\u2019t given to controversy.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., enjoys a strong plurality in his primary contest, with 45 percent of likely Republican voters backing the incumbent in a new Winthrop University poll.

The movie industry's main lobbying group has ramped up its budget and donations to political groups in the past few years, and, in a switch for an industry long associated with Democrats, has quietly reached out to Republicans and conservative-leaning organizations in an effort to rebuild its clout. Last year, the MPAA replaced its longtime lead lobbying firm, considered to be close with Democrats, with a lobbyist with ties to key GOP lawmakers. Its political-action committee now gives more donations to Republicans than Democrats. And it has sent money to a GOP super PAC, a conservative antitax entity and a business lobby helping Republicans in the 2014 elections\u2026 MPAA gave $75,000 to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is a top supporter of Republican candidates for Congress; $100,000 to Americans for Tax Reform, the antitax group run by conservative advocate Grover Norquist ; $25,000 to the large pro-Republican super PAC American Action Network\u2026\u201d WHY DOGS WOULD MAKE PERFECT POLITICIANSExperts say your dog is lying to you. Well, not really. The animal behavior gurus who talked to the AP said that that ashamed-looking face that dogs make when their masters scold them is not shame at all. Says AP: \u201cThe guilty look \u2013 head cowered, ears back, eyes droopy \u2013 is a reaction to the tantrum you are throwing now over the damage they did hours earlier.\u201d So wait, dogs are photogenic, have a skill for insincere shame and seek constant praise?

And when your prophecies don\u2019t come to pass, the way out is simple. You just point at the unicorn barn. That\u2019s where the other guys \u2013 the bad guys who are too scared, too stupid or too corrupt \u2013 keep the solutions locked away. Republicans won\u2019t agree to an unconditional increase to the debt limit? Mint a $1 trillion coin, Mr. President. Supreme Court rules against conservatives on same-sex marriage? Simple: Just ignore the court. Any criticism of the plans can be brushed away by calling for another unicorn release (FYI: they eat mostly Frankenberry and pepperoni pizza Combos): \u201cwinning the messaging war\u201d or similar claptrap that imagines an unpopular point of view will garner more support in the midst of a vicious public struggle. Or that shame somehow still exists in American civic life. None of this is to say that politicians don\u2019t sometimes fail because they are scared (often), stupid (sigh) or corrupt (occasionally). Stipulated. But the unicorn wranglers are the ones who exploit the failing system by making impossible promises. Last week, President Obama rustled up a whole herd of unicorns on the issue of gun control. To listen to the president, one would have assumed that there was a piece of legislation or a serious proposal under consideration that would have prevented the most recent campus killings. In this version, Republicans are too scared, stupid and corrupt to allow this \u201ccommon sense\u201d legislation to advance. But that\u2019s not the case. In recent years, Democrats have focused mostly on closing loopholes in federal background checks \u2013 especially on private sales. But in none of the recent mass shootings that spur these occasional surges in media interest in gun control has the so-called \u201cgun-show loophole\u201d been a factor. There were lapses in the application of existing laws and failures to report obvious mental illnesses, certainly, but not one used a private sale to circumvent the law. We had a similarly disjointed conversation after the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn. Then, the focus was on banning certain weapons, and reinstating the lapsed \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban. But that turned out to be false prophecy, too. So the movement moved back to the background check argument. The president knows about these disconnections. But, he argued Thursday, it is appropriate to politicize the moments that refocus public attention on the issue of gun laws. Well, maybe. It\u2019s certainly fine to use a searing incident to advance legislation to prevent its recurrence. But it\u2019s neither wise nor appropriate to exploit a tragedy for achieving a substantially unrelated goal. There\u2019s no way to know how many or how few of the more than 11,000 homicides committed with firearms in 2013 (the most recent data available) were facilitated by a private sale. If you want to close the loophole, then find the victims of it and make martyrs of them. But don\u2019t placate your political base and stoke contributors on the grounds that you have a solution. And certainly don\u2019t do so with the deaths of citizens as props. But who wants to tell voters a sad story about complicated public safety in a world where pistols outnumber functional families, of unraveled communities and the pharmacological palliatives pasted on top of them? Calling to regulate the firearms industry more sure sounds better. There is one plan that might arguably prevent mass shootings. The president made passing reference to something in the vein when he mentioned that Australia had changed its laws in response to a mass shooting there. What he was referring to was a 1996 law that enacted a sweeping ban on many firearms, including existing ones, and set rigid requirements for gun licenses. A ban and mass confiscations might work (or it might not) but at least it is on topic. But is the president really ready to lead the fight for a constitutional amendment to allow such a thing? Or wreck the remainder of his presidency in a legal fight over the Second Amendment he would surely lose? Most likely, Obama will blame the bad guys in the other side and then fill the feedbags with Frankenberry. On to the next fundraiser, guys. And now we know what Hillary Clinton is going to do, too.

Maggie Hassan announced Monday she is\u00a0challenging GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte for Senate in the Granite State, rather than seek a third term as governor. It\u2019s a move Democrats say gives the party its\u00a0best shot at picking up a seat that will prove critical to Senate control\u2026. In recent months, a\u00a0handful of polls found Hassan and Ayotte tied in a head-to-head match-up. And Democrats say Hassan will be a strong fundraiser with a proven history of winning statewide in New Hampshire. But Ayotte starts the race with a significant cash on hand advantage and the power of incumbency, giving her a slight edge more than a year from Election Day.\u201dWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026National Geographic: \u201cIn a study published recently in the\u00a0journal Animal Behaviour, [Kaeli Swift] found that\u00a0American crows\u00a0associate people seen handling dead crows with danger, and can be wary of feeding near such people.

This week\u2019s Power Index reflects the shifting ground in two of those states. Especially in New Hampshire where this month\u2019s NBC/WSJ Marist poll shows Carly Fiorina making a 10-point leap: from 6 percent last month to 16 percent this month. She still trails frontrunner Donald Trump, but her Granite State surge shows a potential path for Fiorina who has been mostly surfing the national zeitgeist. The bad news was for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose numbers receded after a media blitz from his super PAC helped get him to the top tier there. He now sits in seventh place behind fellow all-or-nothing-in-New Hampshire candidate Gov. Chris Christie. But if anyone has a reason to breathe a sigh of relief at this poll it\u2019s Jeb Bush who gained 3 points and finished in third place, but not enough to offset continuing national woes. Bush spent the weekend weathering the fallout from saying \u201cstuff happens\u201d about a recent mass shooting. It may not have an immediate effect on Bush\u2019s polling, but now is certainly not the time that Bush can afford to look wobbly before skeptical donors.

So what? One could argue that by the same logic that Republicans use to say that taxpayer funding for the group\u2019s non-abortion-related activities, Fiorina\u2019s patronage of the firm generates revenues that facilitate its overall operations, thereby indirectly supporting the Planned Parenthood contributions of others. You wouldn\u2019t know that from the lede of the story, which is part of the ongoing media irradiation of the only female GOP contender, but that\u2019s the crux: \u201cAsked if Fiorina has a problem with Ayco distributing funds to Planned Parenthood, and if she\u2019s ever lobbied them to stop, [campaign spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores] said, \u201cCarly has no control over those clients and their giving preferences.\u201d Asked why Fiorina doesn\u2019t just find a donor-advised fund that vows never to give money to Planned Parenthood on behalf of anyone, Flores didn\u2019t respond.\u201d [But along with the press lashing, Fiorina\u2019s rise has given her the chance to make her case to deep-pocketed donors in the Koch network.

McCarthy appears to have the support of a majority of House Republicans \u2013 making him the likely winner of a closed-door election set for Thursday. While neither McCarthy nor Chaffetz appear to have a clear path to the necessary 218 votes from the full House later this month, McCarthy is rallying. He now has support from Rep.

Scalise, the sitting majority whip, made the announcement in an evening conference call with supporters.

Not because they're in a Montague-and-Capulet-style feud, but because they worry Cox and Anderton\u2014dating for nearly two years, engaged for almost one\u2014won't be able to handle parental responsibilities, since they both have Down syndrome, Australia Story reports. \"That makes me feel very worried, apprehensive, and concerned,\" Anderton's mom says, and Cox's dad agrees: \"I don't see parenthood being something that they're going to achieve, or really they probably should achieve.\" He notes it would be \"very difficult\" for the couple to handle not only day-to-day activities such as having jobs and driving, but also parenting skills such as helping out with homework and dealing with adolescent issues. The couple gained recognition in May when a clip about them aired on ABC Australia. A geneticist tells Australia Story a couple with Down syndrome becoming pregnant is a rarity, and that if they did conceive, chances would be about 50-50 they'd have a child with Down syndrome. Michelle O'Flynn, director of Queensland Advocacy Inc., notes the couple's parents could try to block a pregnancy by getting a sterilization order, though she says they'd probably fail and that that option is \"abhorrent.\" Disability advocates like O'Flynn say it's Cox and Anderton's right to retain \"bodily integrity\" and reproduce if they want. But Cox's dad dismisses that, noting, \"[The advocates are] not the ones picking up the pieces.\" Michael Cox understands their parents' concern, noting, \"Their heart is in the right place,\" but he says they're \"overprotective.\" This article originally appeared on Newser: Couple With Down Syndrome Fighting to Have Kids",

With Democrats poised to lose control of the Senate, this could be a very big deal. With new regulations set to ban more policies and the prospect of millions of Americans being dumped from their employer-based health insurance, next fall promises to be a painful season for ObamaCare implementation. But by delaying the start of the enrollment season, the White House may be able to push some of the outrage past Election Day and perhaps spare vulnerable Democrats. With massive disruptions and exploding premiums for existing policy holders expected, a Nov. 1 start date will come just four days ahead of voting and long after many citizens have gone to the polls to cast early ballots.

[\u201cThe death of this law would be for health insurance companies to price policies for 2015 in a way that premiums skyrocket.\u201d \u2013 Ana Gupte, a health-industry analyst, talking to Bloomberg.] Nuke it - The move by Senate Democrats to dump nearly 225 years of precedent and end the 60-vote threshold for presidential appointments for every post other than Supreme Court justice will give President Obama a historic opportunity to ram through his nominees. Aside from lifetime federal judgeships, Obama now has the chance to replace troubled cabinet officials (Kathleen Sebelius, you have a call on line one) or install nominees previously rejected as ideologically extreme or ethically challenged. He can do it all without worrying about Republicans and can even lose as many as five moderate Democrats. Ramming speed - It would seem to be a rather unfortunate time for Democrats in Washington to make a naked power grab. Americans already don\u2019t trust them with the powers they have amid the ObamaCare crash and nobody likes to see politicians do anything naked. At all. Fire up the base, prepare for months of terrible turmoil and know that if you lose the Senate, at least you will have left a legacy of a liberal judiciary and new regulations enacted by swiftly-confirmed appointees. These are not the actions of people who expect things to improve anytime soon. Read more from the Power Play column.

West Virginia Metro news reports the state\u2019s insurance commissioner announced the decision Thursday citing the risk of increased rates and the potential for market instability. California officials offered similar concerns, saying the proposal hinders its efforts to attract young people. Susan Kennedy,\u00a0a board member for the state exchange, bluntly told the Tribune of San Luis Obispo, \u201cThere is no way to make the federal law work without this transition to (compliant) plans.\u201d Indiana\u2019s commissioner Stephen Robertson recently offered a scathing rejection of the plan in a press release, saying it \u201cwould seriously destabilize Indiana's insurance market and create logistical chaos.\u201d The states join New York, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in their rejections of the president\u2019s plan.

But with the ACA, the losers are angry, loud, and have been given a powerful platform\u2014one that threatens to make hell for the president and his party alike.

E-mails sent by project manager Henry Chao just three days before the Web site\u2019s launch reveal a bleak report.

What will insurers say about growing anger over a promised bailout if, as expected, the new law causes chaos in the industry? When will urging and tweeting and cajoling of young Americans turn into un-hipster, non-ironic threats of fines? Somebody better call \u201cPajama Boy,\u201d because the first demographic snapshot of ObamaCare signups looks like a mess. The shorthand: President Obama\u2019s signature entitlement program needs 40 percent of its enrollees to be paying customers in the prime 18-34 age range. Otherwise, the risk pool will be too shallow and insurers will have to jack up rates even more on everyone else in order to stay solvent. The first numbers show only 25 percent of enrollees are in the most desirable demographic. The administration has until the end of March to herd people into the program, but if older, sicker and more costly customers continue to so heavily outnumber the young, \u201crisk corridors\u201d (a.k.a. bailouts) built into the law are sure to see some traffic. [Daily Caller shares the story of former ObamaCare supporter Steve Freiss unfortunate experience with Healthcare.gov.] Rubio ready - Whatever anyone tells you, the next big ObamaCare battlefield will be over these bailouts. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., got there first and is holding the high ground with his bill to block the funds from flowing. But no matter how much American\u2019s dislike the idea of an insurance bailout, they would like even less the idea of a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d resulting in escalating premiums for all, including those with employer-based insurance. The end of the spiral comes when the whole marketplace goes kablooey and everybody has to go sign up for Medicaid. Team Obama would much rather be the one playing populist cards right now, but their go-to move of scourging big insurance won\u2019t work when the administration is trying to keep the industry placated and solvent in order to avoid an even bigger election-year uproar.

While the justices repeatedly called those powers into question, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli warned the court that it would essentially write that power out of the Constitution if it found that those appointments were illegal.\u00a0But Justice Elena Kagan seized on the political dispute to make the point to Verrilli that \u201ccongressional intransigence\u201d to Obama nominees may not be enough to win the court fight.\u00a0Kagan, Verrilli\u2019s predecessor as Obama\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, suggested that it \u201cis the Senate\u2019s role to determine whether they\u2019re in recess.\u201d More. \u201cI don't think [justices are] going to be persuaded that the president and the head of the executive branch gets to determine for the legislative branch when we\u2019re in session.

When some White House advisers tried to get President Bush to support cap and trade, Gillespie stopped it cold. He opposed the auto bailout.

            "article_content": "Five week old sleeping boy and girl fraternal twin newborn babies. They are wearing crocheted pink and blue striped hats. (katrinaelena) Men exposed to dioxin, a chemical once common in herbicides, may be less likely to father boys than peers who didn't come in contact with this toxin, a recent study suggests. Researchers studied men and women who were employed between 1969 and 1984 at a plant in New Zealand making what's known as phenoxy herbicides, chemicals sprayed on plants to prevent uncontrolled growth. The chemical blend included several types of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) that are linked to a range of health issues including decreased odds of male offspring. \"Twenty years ago, it was first reported that men that had been exposed to high levels of dioxin as a result of an industrial accident in Seveso, Italy, on average fathered less boys than girls compared to men exposed to background levels of dioxin,\" said lead study author Andrea 't Mannetje, a public health researcher at Massey University in Wellington, New Zealand. Since then, only a few studies have been done on people exposed to dioxin; some found a similar effect on the gender of children but others did not. \"This study, which was conducted in a group of former producers of dioxin-contaminated herbicides, adds to the number of studies that have observed this effect,\" she added by email. \"This study also provides evidence that the effect is dose-dependent (the higher the dioxin exposure, the bigger the effect) and male-mediated (the effect was observed in men with high dioxin exposure, not in women with high dioxin exposure).\" Dioxins are mainly byproducts of industrial activities but can also be produced by natural events like volcanic eruptions and forest fires. These chemicals typically accumulate in the food chain, mostly in the fatty tissue of animals. TCDD is the most toxic type of dioxin, according to the World Health Organization. Long-term exposure is linked to impairment of the immune system, the developing nervous system, the endocrine system and reproductive functions. For the current study, researchers analyzed data on 127 men and 21 women who reported conceiving a total of 355 children after they started working at the New Zealand herbicide plant. This group of kids included 197 boys and 158 girls, which translated to an overall sex ratio of 0.55, meaning 55 boys and 45 girls per 100 births, researchers report in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. All of the workers in the study provided blood samples in 2007 and 2008 for researchers to test for concentrations of TCDD. Researchers used the results to estimate blood levels of the chemical for the parents at the time their babies were born. For fathers with blood concentrations of TCDD of at least 20 picograms per gram (pg/g) at the time of birth, the sex ratio was 0.47, meaning these men were more likely to have girls than boys. When fathers had blood concentrations of at least 100 pg/g at the time of birth, the sex ratio was 0.45, making boys even less likely for fathers with greater exposure to the herbicides at the plant. Researchers didn't find an effect in women. One limitation of the study, however, is that it didn't include enough female workers to produce statistically meaningful results about their babies. Researchers also lacked data on blood concentrations of TCDD for many of the workers at the plant, reducing the number of employees that could be included in their analysis. Still, the findings add to results from research at the accident site in Italy, that also found the decrease in male births was more pronounced when people were exposed to larger amounts of dioxin, said Michele Marcus, a public health researcher at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn't involved in the New Zealand study. \"This is important because the sex ratio was proportional to the dose of the exposure,\" Marcus said by email. \"This makes it more likely that the exposure is causal.\"",

            "article_content": "Overweight Man (Copyright 2006, Mike Watson Images Limited.) If your sex drive isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be, you can\u2019t focus at work or you\u2019re tired all the time, low testosterone could be to blame. Approximately 4 out of 10 men over age 45 have low testosterone, according to the Urology Care Foundation. Although it can affect your sex life, some men with the condition also have high blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity. Low testosterone can also increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, according to a study in the journal Cell Metabolism. If you suspect you have low testosterone, here are 10 are warning signs to keep an eye on and talk about with your doctor. 1. Low libido Although some men will notice their libido decreases as they get older, the most significant and obvious sign of low testosterone is a sudden decline in sex drive, said Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor in the departments of urology and obstetrics and gynecology and director of Male Reproductive Health at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. 2. Extra weight Carrying extra pounds can affect testosterone because fat cells convert testosterone to estrogen, which decreases circulating testosterone, said Dr. Philip Werthman, a urologist and director of the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and Vasectomy Reversal in Los Angeles. Although men who are overweight or obese can have low testosterone, it\u2019s not clear whether they gain weight because their testosterone is low or if their testosterone is low because they\u2019re overweight. Either way, eating healthy, exercising and losing weight is often enough for them to feel better, he said. 3. Erectile dysfunction As many as 30 million men have erectile dysfunction and low testosterone could be to blame. In order to get and keep a strong erection, it\u2019s necessary to have adequate blood flow, circulation, functioning valves, normal sensations and sex drive and testosterone is responsible for all of it, Werthman said. 4. Fatigue If you\u2019re exhausted by lunchtime, crash on the couch after work and find it challenging to get motivated to do anything, low testosterone could be zapping your energy. 5. Sleep problems Men with low testosterone can experience insomnia but it\u2019s also associated with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder which affects more than 18 million Americans and can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and problems with mood and memory. Although low testosterone doesn\u2019t cause obstructive sleep apnea, many men who have sleep apnea are also overweight, which can lead to low testosterone, Werthman said. The bottom line: If your partner says you snore, or you feel tired after sleeping all night, see your doctor for a sleep study. 6. Lack of concentration Since testosterone is responsible for focus, if the hormone is low, you can experience brain fog, have trouble concentrating and even have memory problems. 7. Depression A study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that 56 percent of men who had borderline low testosterone also had significant symptoms of depression, were already diagnosed with depression and/or were taking antidepressant medication. When men receive testosterone replacement therapy, they often see an improvement in their depression, and it\u2019s more effective than the anti-depressants they were taking, Werthman said. 8. Breast growth Since low testosterone causes the ratio of estrogen and testosterone in the body to become unbalanced, some men may grow breast tissue, a condition known as gynecomastia. 9. Aches and pains Low testosterone can decrease muscle mass and strength so some men may experience joint pain, muscle aches and be more prone to injury. 10. Bone problems Although osteoporosis is usually thought to affect women only, it can be a problem for men with low testosterone because it decreases bone density. If you suspect you have low testosterone, make an appointment with your doctor who can diagnose it with a simple blood test and suggest several types of testosterone replacement therapy.",

Infertility is a common and serious problem that many women worry about. In fact, about 10 percent of American women have a difficult time getting pregnant. We got this email from a concerned viewer:Dear Dr. Manny, I've been on birth control for 10+ years. I would like to have kids within the next couple of years but am worried about the effects my birth control usage might have. Are there any infertility risks to being on the pill for so long? Thanks, Rebecca The good news is that being on birth control for a long period of time will not hurt your chances of getting pregnant in the future. Birth control pills are made of hormones that keep your eggs from ovulating and make your cervical mucus thicker, in order to keep sperm away from your eggs. Once you stop taking the pill, the hormone supplements are usually out of your body within a couple of days or weeks. Without the hormones, your menstrual cycle should return to normal within three months or so. The birth control and infertility myth has been circling around since the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill in 1960. In 2010, it was estimated that 100 million women across the globe were using oral contraceptives. It is one of the most thoroughly tested medications, and some research has even shown that prolonged birth control use could make it easier to conceive. A study in the journal of Human Reproduction found that women who used the contraceptive pill for more than five years were actually more likely to get pregnant within six months to a year than women who never took the pill. Bottom line? Whether or not you used birth control pills for six months or 10 years, once you go off the pill, your body should go back to ovulating normally. If you are still concerned about your fertility or any underlying ovulation problems, you should speak with your primary physician or OB-GYN. Do you have a health question for Dr. Manny?

The regulatory agency is calling for the ban of the tattoo ink, The Sun reported. Risks included serious allergic reactions and painful itching that can last for years. Researchers found red ink was the most dangerous, but they warned blue, green and black ink is also risky. According to The Sun, the ECHA\u2019s report will likely lead in the ban of certain inks and chemicals in the European Union (EU). \u201cThe most severe concerns are allergies caused by the substances in the inks and possible carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductive toxic effects,\u201d the ECHA said in the report. Governments in the EU do not regulate tattoo ink as they do drugs and food, and many shops operate without government regulation, The Sun reported. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates chemicals in products including tattoo ink, cosmetics and color additives. But due to other public health priorities and a previous lack of safety evidence, the FDA has not traditionally regulated tattoo ink and pigments. A recent influx of cheap Chinese tattoo inks that aren\u2019t subject to safety checks are to blame, Rick Stevens, president of the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union in the United Kingdom, told The Sun.",

Is there any kind of link between laser hair removal and cancer? For some women, laser hair removal treatments are worth the big price tag for smooth, hairless skin. The average price for laser hair removal is $289, depending on what areas are being treated and the number of sessions needed. But for others, concerns about the safety of the fuzz-free procedure may cause them to hesitate. We got this question from a viewer: Dear Dr. Manny, I have my honeymoon coming up and I've been thinking about getting laser hair removal for my bikini line, but I'm a little worried about the radiation that's involved with it. Is there any kind of link between laser hair removal and cancer? Thanks, Annie In terms of cancer risk, X-rays and gamma rays are the most dangerous and are known as high-frequency ionizing radiation. Although both types can come from natural sources like radon gas, they can also be manmade. For example, nuclear power plants create this type of radiation for nuclear energy, and medical imaging tests like CT scans use X-rays to produce pictures of areas inside the body. When ionizing radiation passes through the body it can cause direct damage to a cell\u2019s DNA and potentially lead to cancer later on. As powerful as ionizing radiation is, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states the laser energy in hair removal procedures use non-ionizing radiation. \u201cThe light energy from these lasers actually remains superficially, it remains at the level of the skin,\u201d Dr. Whitney Bowe, a dermatologist in New York City told FoxNews.com. \u201cThese lasers don\u2019t cause DNA damage and they don\u2019t cause DNA mutations.\u201d The pulses of light energy used in laser hair removal treatments are only designed to heat and destroy hair follicles. Although some women continue to be concerned about treating areas near their reproductive organs, experts say there is no additional risk. \u201cThe light used does not penetrate beyond the depths of the hair follicle and internal organs are in no way affected, nor is fertility,\u201d Dr. Konstantin Zakashansky, a gynecologic oncologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital told FoxNews.com. As of now, no research has showed the light energy from hair removal lasers can cause cancer. But there are some risks involved like redness, scarring and discoloration in the treated area, Bowe said. If a patient experiences some irritation after a laser session, several remedies can help soothe the treated area. \u201cIcing the area immediately following treatment is key--\u00a0cold milk compresses are amazingly soothing,\u201d Bowe said.\u00a0\u201cPopping an Aleve or ibuprofen can decrease swelling and redness, but avoid Tylenol.\u00a0If the redness lasts for longer than a few hours, be sure to tell your doctor so they can be more conservative with the settings at your next session.\u201d On average, it can take about six sessions to\u00a0achieve lasting results, but Bowe encourages her patients to come in for touch-ups every two years for those stubborn strays that manage to survive or grow\u00a0back over time. For people looking to stick with more traditional hair removal methods, Bowe recommends shaving. \u201cIf laser treatments are too pricey, or the hair is not dark brown or black (and therefore not a good\u00a0candidate for laser treatments), then go for\u00a0shaving over waxing. Waxing has the highest risk of causing in-grown hairs that can be painful and even get infected with MRSA,\u201d she said. Do you have a health question for Dr. Manny?

            "article_content": "This undated image shows a package of estrogen/progestin birth control pills. (AP) The nonprofit Catholic organization SSM Health will provide birth control pills at the 26 clinics inside St. Louis-area Walgreens stores that it began operating Thursday, an SSM spokesman said. Four groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote letters to SSM and Walgreens on Aug. 18, asking whether the clinics would be restricted by religious doctrine from allowing consultations on birth control and referrals for abortions. SSM spokesman Jason Merrill said in a phone interview Thursday that the clinics will provide 30-day refills for contraceptive pills previously prescribed by a physician \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the same policy carried by the clinics previously run in-house by Walgreens. A website for the clinics shows a long list of services, everything from vaccinations and wellness checkups to treatment for illness and injury, but it makes no reference to birth control. The new clinics, operated by a nurse practitioner, will be known as the SSM Health Express Clinic at Walgreens. Twenty-two of them are in Missouri, and four are in Illinois. Lorie Chaiten, director of the women's and reproductive rights project for the ACLU of Illinois, said the decision to provide birth control was encouraging. But Chaiten and others who wrote letters last week still want a meeting with Walgreens and SSM. Amy Chen, staff attorney for the National Health Law Program, said questions remain \"about the type of reproductive health care that patients will be receiving.\" Patients are increasingly choosing retail walk-in clinics like those available at more than 400 Walgreens stores, opting for the convenience of weekend and evening services that need no appointment. The consulting firm Accenture says the number of retail clinics will surpass 2,800 by 2017, a 47 percent increase from 2014. The partnership with outside health systems is part of Walgreens' growth plan, a spokeswoman for the Illinois-based chain said last week. The agreement with Walgreens is an \"important milestone in SSM Health's commitment to improving the health of our community,\" James Bleicher, regional president of the SSM Health Medical Group, said in a statement. SSM is based in St. Louis. Last week's letters to Walgreens and SSM were signed by representatives of ACLU offices in Missouri and Illinois, the National Health Law Program, and MergerWatch, an affiliate of Community Catalyst, which was formed in 1996 to push for reproductive services during mergers of secular and religious hospitals. The ACLU previously raised concerns over similar deals in Washington and Oregon involving 25 Walgreens-based clinics and another Catholic health system, Providence Health.",

Although eating right and exercise are a good start, experts agree that there are other natural ways that can help you conceive.Before you head to the IVF clinic, try these ideas. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keep your uterus warm. In Chinese medicine, a \u201ccold\u201d uterus, or poor blood flow and circulation to the uterus, is a diagnosis and could be the reason you can\u2019t get pregnant. \u201cWe see the uterus as a palatial space to grow a baby and if it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s not very hospitable or comfortable,\u201d said Aimee Raupp, a licensed acupuncturist, women's health and fertility expert in New York City and Nyack, N.Y. and author of \u201cYes, You Can Get Pregnant: Natural Ways to Improve Your Fertility Now and Into Your 40s.\u201d If you notice your menstrual blood is dark purple, or even black, you have a lot of clots and your whole body tends to be cold, you could have a cold uterus. To warm up your uterus during your period, Raupp recommends warm baths, wearing socks or slippers, placing a hot water bottle on your abdomen and drinking ginger or cinnamon tea. Also, avoid cold, raw foods, swimming or anything that gives you a chill. 2. Time sex right. If you have a 28-day cycle, you\u2019ll probably ovulate on day 14. For the best possible chance of conceiving, have sex on days 12, 14 and 16. Since sperm lasts up to three days on average, you\u2019ll still improve your chances even if you don\u2019t have sex every day while you\u2019re ovulating, said Dr. Brian Levine, a board-certified OB-GYN and fertility specialist, and the New York practice director for the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine in New York City. 3. Have hot, steamy sex\u2014 and lots of it. Although when you have sex is key, how much sex you have could be equally important.\u00a0 In fact, women who have frequent sex even outside their fertile windows are more fertile, according to research in the journals Fertility and Sterility and Physiology and Behaviors. Researchers believe the reason some women may have trouble conceiving is due to an autoimmune response that causes their bodies to reject sperm or the embryo because they\u2019re not having sex enough. Not only can more sex improve your chances of getting pregnant, but spicing up your sex life can help you intimately reconnect with your partner and help you remember you\u2019re creating a life out of love. \u201cIt lets your partner know that you want him outside of his sperm,\u201d Raupp said. 4. Drink bone broth. \u201cNutrition is a really important way to fight the aging process in Chinese medicine and prolong and improve our fertility,\u201d Raupp said. Soups made from bones or that have bone marrow are nutrient dense and contain every type of amino acid. Drink four ounces of bone broth, four to five times a week. 5. Use the right lube. \u201cThe secret to getting pregnant ultimately is good cervical mucus,\u201d Levine said. Yet some personal lubricants that make sex more comfortable and pleasurable can affect your chances of getting pregnant. When semen is exposed to oil- or petroleum-based lubricants, it can disrupt the cervical mucus and prevent sperm from making their way to the uterus. Some lubricants also contain spermicide, which kill sperm. Instead, use a water-based lubricant or those specifically marketed for pregnancy. 6. Add wheat grass to your diet. Wheat grass is a powerful antioxidant and anti-aging medicinal that balances estrogen and improves fertility. Wheat grass is available as a supplement and can be taken every day. 7. Detox. There are 80,000 chemicals in use in the U.S., many of which have been linked to infertility and some even show up in dust inside our homes, according to a recent study in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Although it\u2019s impossible to avoid exposure to every last one, avoid GMOs and pesticides in food and chemicals in cleaning products, housewares and personal care products. \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat it, you shouldn\u2019t put it on your skin,\u201d Raupp said. 8. Deal with emotions. If you\u2019re struggling with infertility, you might doubt your body, your health and your relationship. As a result, what you say to yourself may not be kind or compassionate. What\u2019s more, negative energy, toxic relationships and stress can all prevent energy from flowing to the uterus and allowing for pregnancy, Raupp said. Pay attention to your inner dialogue, try to have more kindness for yourself, your partner and other people in your life and make changes where possible. One of the best ways to cope with negative emotions is through meditation and journaling. 9. Eat caviar. \u201cIf you want to improve your egg quality, eat eggs,\u201d Raupp said. Although chicken eggs are one of the healthiest foods you can eat, caviar in particular is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and healthy fats, which can improve your chances of getting pregnant. Aim for 1 ounce, one to two times a week. 10. Shut down the iPad. If you have a nighttime ritual of binge watching reality TV or reading on your iPad, the artificial light could affect your circadian rhythm and your fertility, a study in the journal Fertility and Sterility found. Shut off the screens one to two hours before going to bed and find something relaxing to do like reading, yoga or sex, which will help you sleep more soundly. \u201cQuality of sleep is just as important as quantity of sleep,\u201d Levine said. 11. Use apps wisely. A fertility app can help you determine your fertile window, but many of the apps are accurate only if you have a regular cycle. In fact, a study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that only 3 of 33 fertility apps accurately predict a woman\u2019s fertile window. \u201cIf the app doesn\u2019t allow for someone who has variable cycles, be aware that the fertile window could be advanced or delayed by two to three days on either end,\u201d he said. 12. Eat fish in moderation. Although fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to improve fertility, mercury exposure can also hamper your ability to get pregnant. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to eliminate fish altogether. Instead, go for fish with the lowest levels of mercury like salmon, shrimp and scallops and eat them in moderation. Also, choose wild-caught over farm-raised if possible, since there isn\u2019t enough evidence that farm-raised fish are safe. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re putting into our mouths as adults, why do you want to put this into your child\u2019s mouth?\u201d Levine said.",

            "article_content": "Hobby Lobby CEO Steven Green, (r.), is the world's foremost private collector of biblical artifacts. (MuseumoftheBible.com As the world\u2019s foremost collector of rare biblical artifacts, Steven Green may have made a deal with the devil - helping to preserve Iraq\u2019s disappearing Christian heritage by allegedly buying black market items plundered by the Islamic State. Green, whose family-owned Hobby Lobby company clashed bitterly with the Obama administration over federal health care laws that required it to cover reproductive services, is being investigated by Customs & Border Protection reportedly for attempting to smuggle as many as 300 age-old cuneiform tablets from Iraq into the U.S. via Israel, labeling them \"tiles.\" It was not clear if the probe centers on Green, the company, or both, but the shipment was reportedly addressed to Hobby Lobby headquarters in Oklahoma City. The tablets, which The Daily Beast reported are thousands of years old and inscribed with text used in ancient Assyria and Babylonia, were seized by Customs agents in Memphis, Tenn., in 2011, but were on their way into Green\u2019s collection of the \u201crarest and most significant biblical texts and artifacts ever assembled\u201d including \u201ccuneiform tablets dating from the time of Abraham, Dead Sea Scroll fragments, biblical papyri and manuscripts, Torah scrolls, and rare printed Bibles.\u201d \"We understand that Hobby Lobby is cooperating with the investigation related to certain biblical artifacts.\u201d Some 40,000 historical Christian artifacts and objects are being prepped for display in Green\u2019s $400 million, 430,000-square-foot, 8-story \u201cMuseum of the Bible,\u201d set to open in late 2017 just three blocks from the U.S. Capitol in Washington. \"We understand that Hobby Lobby is cooperating with the investigation related to certain biblical artifacts,\u201d said Museum of the Bible Vice President Steven Bickley in a statement to FoxNews.com.\u00a0\u201cThe Museum of the Bible is a separate not-for-profit entity made possible by the generous charitable contributions of the Green family and others.\" Little is known publicly about this case, and U.S. Customs did not comment on FoxNews.com\u2019s inquiry. But one U.S. archaeologist who has worked with the Greens said the family is very meticulous and ethical about acquisitions. \"In my opinion the Greens would not have knowingly purchased antiquities from an unknown or suspected source,\" said the archaeologist, a prominent professor at a respected university who asked not to be identified. \"However, the authorities are extremely sensitive about any antiquities coming into the market at this time and are critical of almost any trade or sale between the Middle East and other countries, especially with regard to well-funded private collectors such as the Greens. Therefore, they would be a prime target of investigation.\" Others called Hobby Lobby\u2019s reported claim that the tablets were hand-crafted \u201ctiles\u201d worth just $300 a piece \u201cludicrous.\u201d The tablets could be worth anywhere from $2,000 to $30,000 each, according to Amr Al-Azm, an associate professor Middle East History and Anthropology in the Department of Social Sciences at Shawnee State University. And calling the tablets \u201ctiles\u201d is comparable to labeling ancient books as tiles, because they are both square shaped, said Eric Meyers, an archaeologist and director of the graduate program in religion at Duke University. He estimated that ISIS reaps up to $100 million a year by selling plundered artifacts on the black market. Under Iraqi law, cultural heritage is the property of the state, with antiquities recognized as \"national treasures\u201d and anyone who removes them from the country is a thief. This can in turn trigger a legal claim in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, that would allow Iraq to recover them. And it could likewise expose any sellers, dealers, or purchasers to criminal penalties. American law also criminalizes the receipt, possession, and transport of stolen property.\u00a0Penalties for violating the National Stolen Property Act can be up to 10 years in prison and fines. In August, the FBI issued an alert that Islamic State\u2019s looted antiquities were being sold in the American market, and warned collectors and dealers who purchase these objects may be funding terror activities and would be subject to sanctions and prosecution under federal law. If the smuggling allegations are true, the Greens could argue they saved important historical and cultural religious artifacts from sure destruction at the hands of terrorists in an unstable, war-torn country, Al-Azm said. However, both Al-Azm and Meyers said buying artifacts from terrorists is both unethical and illegal. Besides funding the terror operations, dealing with the looters also encourages continued pillaging and destruction of sacred sites. As the Islamic State wages waves of terror in Iraq and Syria, how to best handle the organized and systematic pillaging and destruction of irreplaceable historical objects and artifacts and religious sites is a hot topic among academics, archeologists, bureaucrats and historians. The Islamic State has become so well organized in its looting of antiquities, the terror group has its own black market network that has become one of its leading sources of revenue. The Islamic State demands a 20 percent cut of any looted objects sold by locals, regulates access to historical sites, in part by issuing permits and licenses and in addition to performing their own looting, also hires contractors to raid sites, Al-Azm said. The Islamic State formed the its own Archaeological Administration in the city of Manbij to organize the sale and transfer of artifacts, which it distributes through a highly organized network of approved dealers, Al-Azm said. \u201cThis evidence indicates that the control and sale of looted antiquities is extremely lucrative, well worth the time and financial investment by ISIS,\u201d Al-Azm said. \u201cISIS is clearly involved and profiting at every level from the illicit trade of antiquities\u2014from their initial extraction from the ground to their final sale and exit from ISIS-controlled territory.\u201d Over the past few months, pillaging and destruction by the Islamic State has only become \u201cdarker and more sinister\u201d, Al-Azm said. \u201cIn what can only be described as cultural atrocities, ISIS very publicly set out to destroy the contents of the Mosul Museum and the archaeological sites of Nineveh and Hatra most likely extensively looting them as well,\u201d Al-Azm said. \u201cThese atrocities shocked the world, allowing ISIS to demonstrate its ability to act with impunity and illustrating the impotence of the international community to prevent the atrocities.\u201d While looting is an extremely old phenomenon, \u201cas old as the pyramids,\u201d Al-Azm pointed out, and has continued over the centuries largely in countries involved in war, Meyers said items stolen in Iraq have flooded the market since the first Gulf War, turning up largely in the hands of dealers throughout the middle east and Europe. Many other irreplaceable items have been destroyed and thrown away, which is tragic, said Meyers who is involved with American Schools of Oriental Research, which works on behalf of U.S. Department of State to document, protect, and preserve the cultural heritage of war-torn Syria and northern Iraq. Sept. 30, The State Department announced a $5 million reward for anyone who could provide information that disrupts the Islamic State\u2019s plundering activities. \u201cISIL\u2019s damage and looting of historic sites in Syria and Iraq have not only destroyed irreplaceable evidence of ancient life and society but have also helped fund its reign of terror inside those countries,\u201d the State Department announced from the New York Metropolitan Museum.\u00a0\u201cISIL\u2019s damage and\u00a0looting of historic sites in Syria and Iraq have not only destroyed\u00a0irreplaceable evidence of ancient life and society but have also helped fund\u00a0its reign of terror inside those countries.\u201d The investigation has reportedly extended over four years, and in the end, Green and his $3.7-billion company could face civil fines or criminal charges. The Greens took on the Obama administration previously in the U.S. Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. In a June, 2014 decision, the high court allowed the company an exemption to the Obamacare healthcare mandate on religious grounds from providing certain kinds of contraception.",

Doctors, including Fox News Health Senior Managing Editor Dr. Manny Alvarez, confirmed the birth of a child with Zika virus linked to microcephaly\u2014 the first reported case of the birth defect, which is marked by a partially formed brain, in the continental United States. The baby, who was born via emergency C-section Tuesday, has been diagnosed with microcephaly (Fox News) The 31-year-old mother, whose name was not disclosed, apparently contracted the Zika virus while in Honduras and was admitted to the emergency room at Hackensack University Medical Center on Friday while vacationing in the U.S. Doctors at Hackensack performed an emergency caesarean section to deliver the baby girl, who was born also with intestinal and visual issues. The mother arrived in the U.S. about 30 days ago. It was not clear if she had been diagnosed with Zika in her homeland, but doctors at the New Jersey hospital made the determination Friday. It was not immediately known how much the baby weighed, but babies born with the disease typically suffer from low birth weights. The child's mother, who developed a rash for two days in Honduras but had no other symptoms until arriving in the U.S., was under the care of a surgical team led by Dr. Abdulla Al-Khan and Alvarez, the hospital's chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive science. A neonatologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist, as well as nursing personnel, were on hand for the birth. The newborn's mother contracted the Zika virus in Honduras. (Fox News) Doctors in Honduras suspected intracranial complications with the child in utero, but it was not until she was admitted to the high-risk unit at Hackensack University Medical Center that doctors confirmed the microcephaly diagnosis. The patient\u2019s aunt told FoxNews.com the mother is not doing well emotionally after the birth of her child. While this is the first birth of a child with Zika-linked complications at Hackensack, it is not the first such case in the U.S. In February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that a woman in Hawaii delivered a baby who suffered from severe microcephaly as a result of Zika infection. Microcephaly is a birth defect wherein a baby\u2019s head is smaller than expected compared with other babies of the same sex and age. According to the CDC, babies with the condition typically have smaller brains that might not have developed properly. Microcephaly can also cause seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, hearing loss, vision problems, feeding issues, and problems with movement and balance. In April, researchers at the CDC concluded that after a careful review of evidence, the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. The CDC has advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to areas where Zika is spreading, and to talk to a health care provider to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), women planning to become pregnant should wait at least eight weeks before trying to conceive if they or their partner live in or are returning from Zika virus hotspots. While there is no vaccine to prevent Zika virus, health officials recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, as well as practicing mosquito control to prevent infection where Zika is being transmitted. According to the CDC, 591 cases of Zika have been diagnosed in the U.S., and all have been travel related. Infected patients typically do not present symptoms, but those who do may complain of fever, rash, joint pain or red eyes.",

            "article_content": "A male Bombay night frog calls from a fallen tree trunk. (SD Biju) A new frog mating position, only the seventh type ever observed, has been discovered in the monsoonal forests of India. Bombay night frogs (Nyctibatrachus humayuni) mate by having the male straddle the female without grasping her, and releasing sperm over her back. The female then lays her eggs, allowing the sperm to run down her back and fertilize the eggs. \"Species such as the Bombay night frog, which are endemic to small regions (most often outside protected areas and threatened with anthropogenic activities), definitely require conservation prioritization,\" study leader Sathyabhama\u00a0Das Biju, an amphibian researcher at the University of Delhi, told Live Science in an email. \"Therefore, natural history studies not only provide necessary information for planning effective conservation strategies, but also highlight unique frogs, such as the ancient night frogs that exhibit highly diverse reproductive\u00a0behaviors.\" Related from LiveScience:\u00a0See Photos of the Bombay Night Frogs in Mating Positions Bombay night frogs mate only during monsoon season nights, and only in the vegetation overhanging flooded forest streams in India's Western Ghats. This made fieldwork a \"very challenging experience,\" Biju said. Researchers had to find the male frogs by listening for their calls and then standing in the fast-flowing streams with infrared camera equipment, trying to keep the electronics from getting rained on while they documented the frog sex. &nbsp; Often, the frogs' attempts would end with the amphibians falling into the water. They usually returned to their original spots to finish mating, Biju said, but these interruptions stretch out the mating encounter by several wet, uncomfortable hours. \"Various venomous snakes\" share habitat with the frogs as well, Biju said. The research team spent 8 hours a night for about 40 nights between 2010 and 2012 documenting the Bombay night frog nightlife. They successfully recorded 13 complete breeding sequences and multiple partial sequences to reveal the new mating position. Before these observations, researchers knew of six types of amplexus, the name for frog mating behavior. Very few frog species reproduce via internal fertilization; rather, most use the amplexus position (a male-female embrace) to release sperm and egg in close proximity for external fertilization. Most species use either inguinal amplexus (the male grasping in front of the female's back legs with his front legs) or axillary amplexus (the male grasping behind the female's front legs with his front legs). Other options include \"straddle\" (the male's pelvis over the female's head), \"glued\" (the male stuck to the female's rump with abdominal excretions), \"cloacal apposition\" (male and female rear-to-rear, facing away from one another) and \"cephalic\" (male on top of female, front feet grasping her throat). Researchers dubbed the new position the \"dorsal straddle.\" It isn't clear whether this mating position offers advantages over any others; fertilization rates of inguinal amplexus (which evolved very early in frogs) and axillary amplexus are similar, Biju said, and more research is needed to determine the pros and cons of various positions. \"Since genus Nyctibatrachus represents an ancient group of frogs with [the] presence of several interesting forms of reproductive behavior, it would be all the more interesting to study how such diversity may have evolved within this group,\" Biju said. In another first, the researchers videotaped snakes eating frog eggs \u2014\u00a0a phenomenon not before observed in India. The researchers reported their findings today (June 14) in the open-access journal PeerJ. Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company. All rights reserved.

Believe it or not, your lovemaking ability (or lack thereof) is directly related to your diet, and certain foods are more detrimental to your ability to perform than others. If you happen to be a man who is experiencing a little trouble getting, er, \u201cinspired\u201d for sexy time, we have a\u00a0list of foods that can potentially help you fight erectile dysfunction. Sexual desires are controlled by what is known as the libido \u2014 a fancy word for sex drive. Libido is determined by a number of factors that include sociological, psychological, and hormonal influences. \u201cIn both men and women, the hormone testosterone drives much of human libido,\u201d explained Dr. Michael Hirt, founder of the\u00a0Center for Integrative Medicine\u00a0in California's San Fernando Valley, who often hands out a list of foods to patients who complain about a lowered sex drive. \u201cLow testosterone means a lower sex drive.\u201d More On Sexual Health Eating Out: Food For Our Sex Drive 15 Foods That Will Boost Your Sex Drive 11 Foods That Are Killing Your Sex Drive This is why the idea of aphrodisiacs,\u00a0foods that stimulate your sex-drive, is widely accepted and revered by the most amorous of humans. While there isn\u2019t much scientific evidence\u00a0that such foods can really rev up your sex drive, the theory is that certain foodstuffs can help us become aroused through their smell, taste, and texture (slurping oysters, anyone?). Additionally, some people believe that the chemical makeup of these sexy foods can alter hormones in your body. The facts behind arousal through food are slightly more complicated. \u201cCertain foods can lower testosterone levels,\u201d Hirt said. \u201cThe foods that are most likely to do so include cheese\u2026 chocolate, and alcohol. These foods lower testosterone by increasing the activity of an enzyme, aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen. The overall effect of\u00a0increased aromatase activity\u00a0is lower testosterone levels and higher estrogen levels.\u201d Many may assume that high estrogen and low testosterone is a recipe for romantic disaster solely for men, but this isn't the case; women can experience adverse symptoms when they have too much estrogen as well.\u00a0The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians notes that when a woman\u2019s estrogen levels are too high, she may undergo negative health complications including an increase in PMS symptoms, uterine fibroids, and endometriosis\u00a0as well as other symptoms such as allergies, decreased libido, fatigue, fibrocystic breasts, headaches, infertility, irritability, and fat gain around the abdomen and on the top of the thighs. Further, numerous studies demonstrate that excess estrogen can cause breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers (all of which are considered estrogen-dependent cancers), cervical dysplasia (a precancerous condition characterized by abnormal changes to cervical tissues), and even\u00a0menopausal symptoms. To help you make sure your romantic evening isn\u2019t cut short, we\u2019ve put together the following list of hormone-altering\u00a0foods and drinks. To help keep the proverbial fires burning, you might want to keep these foods off of your date-night menu. 1. Alcohol There are\u00a0some facts about alcohol that just aren\u2019t true. Alcohol may make approaching someone easier, but it can seriously damage your\u00a0ability to perform. \u201cAlcoholic beverages do a double whammy on your sex life by lowering your testosterone and your sexual functioning,\u201d says Hirt. 2. All-Purpose Flour Processed foods, especially all-purpose or white flour, are stripped of many components which are vital for sexual health. One such component, the mineral zinc, is essential to a man\u2019s reproductive health. Compared to whole-grain or whole-wheat flour,\u00a0all-purpose flour has about three-quarters less zinc. Additionally, eating all-purpose flour can lead to insulin resistance and, eventually, diabetes. Diabetes can, in turn, narrow one\u2019s arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and erectile dysfunction. If you\u2019re looking to keep your sex life healthy, check out our\u00a0list of foods you can eat after removing processed foods from your diet. 3. Beets While\u00a0eating beets before your workout can improve muscle function, these deliciously sweet vegetables may not do much to bolster your sexual ability. Consuming\u00a0these trendy root vegetables will support healthy estrogen levels in your body, a facet of a beet\u2019s nutritional attributes that has negative consequences for those who have an existing hormonal imbalance. If your hormones are in check, though,\u00a0beets\u2019 natural ability to increase blood flow may prove beneficial for men who have trouble getting \u201cinspired\u201d for a little lovemaking. 4. Berries From a nutritional standpoint,\u00a0eating fresh or frozen berries is incredibly beneficial, but produce with edible skin, especially berries, contains some of the highest levels of pesticides, which mimic estrogen. If you can find some organic, pesticide-free berries, you\u2019ll find that their vitamin content can help to improve\u00a0your sex life. 5. Bottled Water There\u00a0are many, many reasons to avoid conventionally bottled water, but when it comes to virility and fertility, the BPAs found in plastic bottles are the largest one. Bisphenol A, commonly referred to as BPA, is a chemical component found in many plastic food containers that can harm your body in more ways than one. You\u2019re better off avoiding BPAs when selecting a reusable water bottle, especially because they can cause erectile dysfunction in men. Additionally, a Slovenian study in Fertility & Sterility found a significant association between urinary BPA concentration in men and lower total sperm count, concentration, and vitality. In a Harvard School of Public Health study, it was found that women who had the higher BPA levels in their bodies produced 27 percent less viable eggs.

Cervicitis affects over half of women at some point in their lives, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and sex that makes you say \"yowza,\" but not in a good way, is one common tip-off of the condition. Cervicitis has many potential causes, but it often happens due to an infection of some sort. MORE FROM SELF: \u00a0The One Food Nutritionists Eat Every Single Day Infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia can lead to an angry cervix, board-certified ob/gyn Antonio Pizarro, M.D., tells SELF. He notes that \"the cervix is a very delicate part of the body.\" Other common culprits: herpes, HPV, and the little-known, very common STD trichomoniasis. \"[Cervicitis] can also come from bacterial vaginosis and an overgrowth of yeast,\" says Pizarro. \"You can also see chemical cervicitis, which is almost like an allergic reaction when the cervix comes into contact with something that irritates the tissue and stimulates an immune system response,\" Jamil Abdur-Rahman, M.D., board-certified ob/gyn and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois, tells SELF.This can occur because of a latex allergy, sensitivity to spermicide, douching, or even scented body washes and feminine hygiene products. MORE FROM SELF:\u00a0 18 Things You Should Never Put In Your Vagina In addition, pelvic trauma like childbirth and pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions on the cervix can lead to cervicitis, says Abdur-Rahman. And since your cervix can't speak, if it's in trouble, it might make that known via painful sex. It makes sense when you think about how roughed up your cervix can get during penetration. The act can make a completely healthy cervix sore, so if yours is inflamed, normal sexual contact can become intensely painful because of \"damage [cervicitis] is doing to the tissue,\" says Pizarro. In addition to pain, you might also experience bleeding during sex if you have cervicitis. MORE FROM SELF: \u00a05 Reasons You\u2019re Not Having An Orgasm (And How To Make It More Likely) More generally, cervicitis can cause generalized pelvic pain that gets worse during your period, says Abdur-Rahman. If the inflammation spreads through your vagina, you might also notice painful urination, increased discharge, itching, or other signs of vaginal irritation. At that point, it's time to see a doctor, who will run tests to figure out the reason for your cervicitis. MORE FROM SELF: \u00a07 Sex Positions That Will Make You Feel Drunk In Love Treatment for cervicitis usually targets the root cause, which often requires some investigation. \"I do targeted testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and a group of other things,\" says Pizarro. \"If there's nothing there, then [I'll do] a Pap smear, because bleeding and pain during intercourse can be signs of cervical cancer.\" This process of elimination helps avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, says Pizarro (especially important since antibiotic-resistant STDs are on the rise, according to the World Health Organization). If the issue is something like herpes, your doctor will probably recommend an antiviral treatment, like Valtrex, and if it's chemical cervicitis, avoiding exposure to latex, douches, spermicide, or whatever irritated you is the best course of action. PH-balancing gels might also help, depending on the situation, Pizarro adds MORE FROM SELF: \u00a0The One Thing Hairstylists Wish You\u2019d Stop Doing There are also ways of treating symptoms\u2014namely pain\u2014while waiting for the cause to clear up. \"There's lidocaine jelly, which is local anesthetic in jelly form, and you can place it anywhere with mucous membranes to diminish discomfort,\" says Abdur-Rahman. The good news is that cervicitis is easy to clear up, and when caught early, is really NBD. MORE FROM SELF: \u00a0What's Your Sex Number? There's only one caveat, but it's an important one. \"Cervicitis is benign for the most part, but it can be problematic,\" says Abdur-Rahman. When left untreated, STDs like gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause cervicitis that leads to pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the reproductive organs that can increase your risk of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, and miscarriage, says Abdur-Rahman. \"Cervicitis can lead to some larger issues, so it's important to nip it in the bud,\" he explains. But, \"when treated early, cervicitis shouldn't affect your fertility,\" says Pizarro. So, if you think you have cervicitis, there's no need to freak out, but there is a need to go see a doctor.",

GLOBAL THREATS SHREDDED DEM PLAYBOOKHow did Scott Brown push the New Hampshire Senate race from long shot to toss-up? Why did the Democratic plan to roil the election with an executive order on amnesty disappear? What explains the shift toward the GOP among women, Latinos and now even young adults? When did the Democratic effort to make this an election about social issues fall apart? The answer is as simple as a look at today\u2019s biggest story. A series of national security catastrophes, starting this summer, reset the election and left Democrats in retreat instead of merely on defense. Russian aggression, chaos at the southern border, Ebola\u2019s arrival in America and, most of all, the unraveling of Iraq and Syria at the hands of Islamist militants shredded the Democratic playbook. When things got real, a strategy based on micromarketing of wedge issues was untenable. [President Obama campaigns today in Maine. That probably sounded like a safer bet before headlines like this.]Couldn\u2019t hear the siren - Republicans certainly seem to understand the dynamic of the election while Democrats couldn\u2019t quite wrap their heads around the issue set. But if there is one thing that explains why the race is closing so poorly for Democrats it is the huge drop in Obama\u2019s handling of foreign affairs, even after he reluctantly started a limited air campaign against the Islamists in Iraq and Syria. And on Ebola, while there is a partisan split on estimating the president\u2019s handling of the crisis, there is broad disagreement with his actual policies. [The Judge\u2019s ruling - Fox News Judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in on the constitutionality of the government\u2019s ability to quarantine. Read it.]Flipped - Given the difficulty of the overall environment, it is not surprising that Democrats are getting desperate. Like, sweaty desperate. Democrats are optimistic that nominating a hawkish former secretary of State in 2016 will help the blue team retake the high ground on foreign policy and national security. It may work, or we may be seeing a reversion to what was the political norm for most of the 50 years prior to the Iraq war: Republicans are more trusted on national security while Democrats are more trusted on social welfare. But for now, Obama\u2019s handling of the crises of 2014 has left a party led by a man elected in large part for his foreign policy positions in the dumps.-- 5 days until Nov. 4 --Q POLL SHOWS GARDNER STRETCHING LEADDenver Post: \u201cThe clock is ticking on Democratic incumbent Mark Udall as another poll shows him behind Republican challenger Cory Gardner in Colorado\u2019s important U.S. Senate race.

If, as expected, the Gardner-Udall race draws more voters than 2010 but fewer than 2012, the number of ballots received so far is a pretty substantial figure.

John Adams, born on this day in 1735, might very well have been doomed to a dim corner of history between the bright lights of Virginians George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. But destiny had something else in mind for Adams, the brilliant but dour New England lawyer, whose zeal for the American Revolution was matched only by his devotion to his beloved Abigail. Adams rescuer was historian David McCullough, whose 2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, begat an acclaimed television series about the second president and his wife. McCullough reintroduced Americans to a man who struggled mightily \u2013 often against his own impulses \u2013 but who never gave up. And was the soul of John Adams: perseverance. A letter from Abigail amid his ordeal in Philadelphia in 1775 could have been the couple\u2019s motto: \u201cGreat difficulties may be surmounted, by patience and perseverance.\u201d Adams would probably be surprised, but secretly pleased, with the notoriety he enjoys 279 years hence. \u00a0And he would most certainly counsel us, in troubled times, to preserve.\u00a0 Happy Birthday, John Adams.

He finds that the number is highly exaggerated. \u201cIt\u2019s a virtual certainty that the number of enrollments attributable to Obamacare is an order of magnitude less than the 4 million sign-ups implied, and the number of people [on Medicaid] who would actually lose their insurance if Obamacare were repealed is probably around 200,000 to 300,000.\u201d Read it all and be gobsmacked. Working poor left out - As the Obama administration struggles to implement the president\u2019s signature health law, lower middle-class families are feeling the pinch. USA Today reports on a much-touted provision in ObamaCare to permit states to provide coverage for those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for subsides. Several states are eager to enact the program but are unable to because the administration has not released the regulations governing them. \u2018What the secretary meant to say\u2026\u2019 - Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Michigan ObamaCare applicants facing coverage gaps, federal fines for noncompliance and deepening frustrations because of massive technical and logistical failures of the program in the state that \u201cThere's nothing people can do but kind of get in line.\u201d The Detroit Free Press has the story. The Judge\u2019s Ruling: Little Sisters of the Poor Get no Mercy - Judge Andrew Napolitano examines the Obama administration\u2019s treatment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that provides care for the elderly, for Fox News Opinion. From the Nuns and the President: \u201cCan he [President Obama] give them a break, too? In a word: No. His Department of (political) Justice has vigorously resisted the nuns and even mocked them\u2026If the government can tax you and me and selfless nuns for fidelity to long held religious beliefs while exempting others because of their fleeting political beliefs, then the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is meaningless. And our rights are in the hands of a congressionally enabled tyrant.\u201d WARNER: MODERATE DEMS WORKING ON OBAMACARE OVERHAUL\u201cThere's actually a group of us who are starting to work on a series of changes.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., talking to the Weekly Standard\u2019s John McCormack about Democratic efforts to fix problems in ObamaCare. Warner said the group was examining the mandatory coverage rules for employers as part of a \u201cwhole package\u201d of alterations. [Ed. note: Gee, wonder why?

If Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, it would undercut the last remaining Democratic narrative for midterms: That with the economy revived, the time is now to raise taxes and spending to help address the income gap between rich and poor. [Watch Fox: House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy,R-Calif., responds to President Obama\u2019s Wednesday remarks on the economy in the 9 a.m. ET hour.] WASHINGTON COMMUTERS GET AN EYEFULBankrupting America, a group promoting fiscal responsibility, started an ad blitz today at mass transit stops in and around Capitol Hill, slamming lawmakers over wasteful spending and broken promises. The Stop Toying With Us campaign compares Washington promises to Christmas presents that begin to lose their luster. The color-soaked ads, reminiscent of Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s work, focus on deceptive practices. From one Metro ad: \u201c\u2018I promise\u2026\u2019*\u201d The asterisk: \u201cIntegrity not included.\u201d WILL: COMMON CORE GOING NUCLEAR George Will looks into the burgeoning opposition to the Obama administration\u2019s Common Core school standards. \u201cThe rise of opposition to the Common Core illustrates three healthy aspects of today's politics. First, new communication skills and technologies enable energized minorities to force new topics onto the political agenda. Second, this uprising of local communities against state capitals, the nation's capital and various muscular organizations \u2026demonstrates that although the public agenda is malleable, a sturdy portion of the public is not. Third, political dishonesty has swift, radiating and condign consequences. Opposition to the Common Core is surging because Washington, hoping to mollify opponents, is saying, in effect: \u2018If you like your local control of education, you can keep it. Period.\u2019 To which a burgeoning movement is responding: \u2018No. Period.\u2019\u2019 EPA BUSTED FOR COORDINATING WITH GREEN GROUPSFrom Lachlan Markay at the Washington Free Beacon: \u201cInternal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emails show extensive collaboration between top agency officials and leading environmentalist groups, including overt efforts to coordinate messaging and pressure the fossil fuel industry.\u201d e.g.: \u201cNancy Grantham, director of public affairs for EPA Region 1, which covers New England, asked an organizer for the Sierra Club\u2019s New Hampshire chapter to share the group\u2019s agenda so EPA could adjust its messaging accordingly in an email dated March 12, 2012. \u2018If you could, it would great [sic] if you can send me an email describing what you would like to do in early April in NH\u2013that way I can coordinate messaging with our air offices here and at HQ,\u2019 Grantham wrote.\u201d WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026Washington Examiner\u2019s micro data maestro Michael Barone considers what the latest Census data says about how government dependency affects demography. \u201cSluggish population growth is matched by sluggish geographic mobility. The Census Bureau reports that only 4.8 million Americans moved across state lines in 2012 \u2014 about half the percentage that did so in the boom years of the 1990s\u2026But not uniformly and not everywhere. Population growth has been accelerating in states that depend heavily on the private sector and declining in states with relatively high dependence on government.\u201d Got a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The committee report, offered by Chairwoman Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., blames the State Department, then headed by Clinton, for not bolstering security at the compound, despite repeated warnings about imminent attacks. Fox News has more. \u201cWe know there were training camps around that area, and it is something that I think the state department has to really come to grips with.\u201d \u2013 Sen.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., hit hard against the Democratic frontrunner, saying \u201cAt the end of the day, she was responsible for ensuring the safety of all Americans serving in our diplomatic facilities. Her failure to do so clearly made a difference in the lives of the four murdered Americans and their families.\u201d YOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: BENGHAZI BLAME GAMEThe Senate\u2019s Benghazi report places blame on the State Department but fails to specifically hold President Obama or former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton accountable. That was the opinion viewer-panelists shared with columnist Jonah Goldberg during Wednesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel. As measured by Bing Pulse, men, women, Republicans, Democrats and independents strongly agreed with Goldberg\u2019s charge, \u201cIt seems like part of the negotiation that led to this report was a way to avoid casting specific blame on\u00a0 anybody who matters and just have this be a general indictment of the bureaucracy.\u201d As for who was responsible for the attack, there was strong disagreement across the political spectrum with the State Department\u2019s claim that al Qaeda core had no involvement. Discussion of Obama\u2019s agenda for the year ahead drew heightened viewer engagement. Weekly Standard Senior Writer Stephen Hayes drew agreement from Republicans, Democrats, and independents when he scoffed at the administration\u2019s claim that 2014 would be \u201ca year of action.\u201d Hayes saw a spike, to 24,000 viewer votes per minute, when he stated, \u201cAnybody believe that in Washington, 2014 is going to be a year of action?\u00a0 You have got a president who is as unpopular as he has ever been. Democrats who are running away from him. Republicans who feel emboldened.

Christie, R-N.J., still tops the field of potential GOP contenders despite the fallout from the uproar surrounding his aides ordering the closure of traffic lanes as part of a political vendetta. But the real takeaway from the survey: It\u2019s anybody\u2019s game. Christie leads with 16 percent, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., garners 12 percent, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., 9 percent, Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., 8 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., 7 percent, Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., 4 percent and Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., 3 percent. Christie builds out donor base - Christie is heading to Florida to meet with more than 100 GOP donors Sunday at the residence of Home Depot co-founder, billionaire Ken Langone. Christie will look to reassure influential supporters from the financial and political communities.

Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, made official his run for a remarkable sixth term as the Hawkeye State\u2019s chief executive. Branstad was the state\u2019s youngest-ever governor when he took office at age 36 in 1983. He served until 1999. Branstad, now 67, ran and won in 2010 and is now seeking another term, which, if he wins and completes, would give him 24 years in the governor\u2019s mansion. Branstad is heavily favored in his run, a disconcerting sign for Democrats hoping to hold on to the Senate seat being left vacant by the retirement of longtime Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. Branstad\u2019s clout in the state with the first 2016 nominating contest will win him lots of help from national Republicans. The Des Moines Register has the story. [Hey, buddy - Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 Republican contender from neighboring Wisconsin, was among the first to congratulate Branstad. Walker tweeted, \u201cCongratulations to my friend Gov @TerryBranstad who announced his plans for re-election in Iowa tonight. @IowasTeam.\u201d] BROWNBACK INVOKES SLAVERY WARS IN ABORTION DEBATEIn his State of the State address, Gov. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., alluded to the state\u2019s unique history with slavery and abortion, saying that Kansas has been called upon in the past \u201cto blaze the trail for America out of the wilderness\u201d on moral issues. Citing the Summer of Mercy anti-abortion protests in Wichita in 1991 and 2001, Brownback compared the demonstrations to the violent Bleeding Kansas struggle between pro-slavery and abolitionist forces in the 1850s, culminating with the 1856 Pottawatomie Massacre led by abolitionist John Brown. The Summer of Mercy protests were against late-term abortionist Dr. George Tiller,\u00a0who was gunned down in 2009. \u201cThe chains of bondage of our brothers rubbed our skin and our hearts raw until we could stand it no more and erupted into \u2018Bleeding Kansas,\u2019 The Summer of Mercy sprung forth in Kansas as we could no longer tolerate the death of innocent children,\u201d Brownback said. AP reports. STEMS AND SEEDS: SOCIAL ISSUES COMPLICATE COLORADOColorado\u2019s swing to the left could pose problems for Democrats down the road. The state has been a hotbed for a whole host of social issues including marijuana, gun control, gay marriage and taxes. With the recall of two state legislators and the once wildly popular Gov.

Buck McKeon, R-Calif., saying he is expected to announce his retirement today, a battle for his coveted chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee is likely ensue. The Hill has details. As for McKeon\u2019s House seat, the district is quite Republican by California standards (going narrowly for Mitt Romney in 2012), making this a good year for party-loyal McKeon to make his departure after 22 years. CHEERS! MCAULIFFE PUTS GOP TURNCOAT ON LIQUOR BOARDGov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., has named long-time GOP operative Boyd Marcus to the state\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. Boyd, a former staffer to Majority Leader Eric Cantor and former Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va., surprised party leaders by backing McAuliffe over Republican Ken Cuccinelli last year. Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Pat Mullins offered this caustic response, \u201cLet me be the first to offer my congratulations to Boyd Marcus on his appointment to the Virginia ABC Board. It's nice to know the exchange rate for 30 pieces of silver these days is about $122,000 per year plus benefits.\u201d BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS DELICIOUS\u2026New Yorkers famously disdain Washingtonians\u2019 cultural ambitions, but D.C.\u2019s most celebrated chef, Michel Richard, is recognized in New York and around the world as a culinary force with which to be reckoned. Perhaps that is why NYT food critic Pete Wells took such evident glee in brutalizing Richard\u2019s entry into New York\u2019s restaurant scene. An appetizer: \u201cThink of everything that\u2019s great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can\u2019t perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain. \u2026 Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes.

            "article_content": "(Mor Salomon) (Mor Salomon) The insect world may have found its \u2018Mom of the Year\u2019 in the female Stegodyphus lineatus, a desert spider that feeds herself to her young shortly after they\u2019re hatched. This practice\u00ad, which is known as matriphagy, has been recorded in spiders before, according to Mor Salomon of the Israel Cohen Institute for Biological Control in Yehud-Monosson, Israel. \u201cMatriphagy was first discovered by the German arachnologist Ernst Kullmann in [the] seventies, so the behaviors of regurgitation and matriphagy are not the new discovery here,\u201d Salomon told FoxNews.com. \u00a0\u201cThe big discovery [here] is the mechanism behind these behaviors.\u201d Found in the semi-arid regions of Israel and other parts of the Mediterranean basin as well as throughout the Near East and Asia Minor, the female Stegodyphus spins her webs in shrubbery. Webs studied in Salomon\u2019s research were found in bushes near dried-up river beds in Israel\u2019s Negev Desert. \u00a0Inside the web, she creates a silk disc that contains 70 to 80 eggs, while her intestine tissues begin to dissolve. When the \u201cspiderlings\u201d hatch, she pierces the silk disc, allowing the babies to emerge. Note, dear readers, those of you with weak stomachs may want to stop reading at this point. \u201c[At this time] a liquid has already accumulated in her gut, allowing her to start regurgitating to her young,\u201d Salomon said. \u201cWhile she regurgitates, the process in her intestine intensifies and the liquid formed probably travels back through her intestinal tube to her mouth where she secretes it for her young.\u201d The babies crawl all over her head, trying to get at the liquid that is leaking from her face. She makes no attempt to escape as her young eventually pierce her soft abdomen with their mouths before feasting on the liquefied guts inside. This process takes a few hours, at the end of which their mom (otherwise known as \u201cdinner\u201d) is officially dead. In the end, the mother has given all but 4 percent of her body mass to her young, who leave her heart alone. Thanks, kids! While it might seem like a case of taking a mother\u2019s love too far, in the spider world this is business as usual. \u201cStegodyphus is not the only spider genus showing matriphagy,\u201d Salomon added. \u201cAll species in the family Eresidae (to which Stegodyphus belong) show matriphagy and there are other spider families in which it is also [involved].\u201d And though many may find the concept of baby spiders eating their mother\u2019s liquefied innards revolting, Salomon suggested that it\u2019s just another amazing example of nature at work. \u201cI know it looks \u2018disgusting\u2019 for someone who is not familiar, but it shows the amazing way evolution and natural selection work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is amazing to think that this behavior has evolved as the best way (evolutionarily) for a female to reach a high reproductive success by \u2018giving herself to her young\u2019. It really shows how the natural world is remarkable.\u201d The report by Salomon and her colleagues can be found in the April Journal of Arachnology.",
