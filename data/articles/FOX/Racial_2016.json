            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee blasts 'stupid' U.S. leadership, refugee and immigration policies on 'Fox & Friends' Every week, Fox News contributor Karl Rove wraps up the last week in politics and offers an inside look at the week ahead. Events Continue to Intrude:\u00a0 Pressure cooker bombs in New York City\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, pipe bombs in northern New Jersey, and a knife wielding Somalia-American in Minnesota are powerful evidence the U.S. faces a rising threat of global Islamic terrorism. What does this mean politically? When terrorism intrudes more heavily into the campaign, it tends to help Donald Trump, who calls the threat by its name and promises tough action.\u00a0 Even before police confirmed that it was a bomb in New York and not an accident, Trump declared it was a bomb.\u00a0 He later tweeted, \u201cUnder the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook! ... Saturday's attacks show that failed Obama/Hillary Clinton polices [sic] won't keep us safe!\u201d Hillary Clinton may now be recognizing the political impact of terrorism on the campaign since she, too, issued a tough statement saying, \u201cI strongly condemn the apparent terrorist attacks\u201d and pledging \u201cwe will not rest\u201d until \u201cwe bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\u00a0 She called for the defeat of \u201cISIS and other terrorist groups\u201d and referred to her \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to do that, reminding Americans they \u201chave faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger.\u201d But Clinton later made a mistake by disputing Trump\u2019s claim that terror attacks in the U.S. are on a rise.\u00a0 Ordinary Americans are right to think the country is more at risk for Islamic-inspired and often directed attacks.\u00a0 This is another reason that when the issue is terrorism, many swing voters are inclined to think the answer is Trump. After a Few Good Weeks, Trump Falls Off The Wagon:\u00a0 When the Washington Post\u2019s Bob Costa asked Trump Wednesday if he thought President Obama was born in the United States, Trump answered, \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\u201d\u00a0 He also waved off a statement by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, that Trump now accepts that Obama was U.S. born, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to speak what she thinks.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s re-involvement in the birther movement put him squarely in the fever swamps, taking the short end of an issue where 80 percent of the American people think he\u2019s wrong. Trump tried to close Friday by saying \u201cPresident Obama was born in the United States, period.\u201d\u00a0 But he and his campaign then claimed the birther issue was first raised by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign with Conway pointing to a statement by Clinton\u2019s former manager that a volunteer in Iowa was spreading the issue eight years ago.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a big difference between the candidate and her campaign raising the issue and a volunteer doing it.\u00a0 Team Trump should avoid putting themselves in a place where every Trump supporter\u2019s actions and words could be laid at the feet of the candidate. Also on Friday, Trump discarded his script and extemporized at a Miami rally, suggesting Clinton\u2019s Secret Service detail should have their guns taken away and \u201cthen we will see what happens.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s never good for a candidate to sound like he expects violence. With the debate a week away and the election only 50 days off, Trump must remember the voters he needs are not like his hard core base, who might respond to red meat like that (though even many of them may winch, too).\u00a0 Swing voters desperately want change but worry Trump is too risky.\u00a0 His rhetorical flourish that she should have to face the campaign trail with unarmed Secret Service agents heightens the concerns of the voters Trump needs to win. Race Tightens More: In the last week, the RealClearPolitics average has tightened from 45.9% Clinton, 43.1 Trump last Monday \u2013 a 2.8% margin for Clinton \u2013 to 44.9 Clinton to 44% Trump, a 0.9% margin, this Monday. \u00a0The movement largely occurred because of events the week before last, when Clinton was under fire over her emails, special favors for Clinton Foundation donors, and keeping her diagnosis of pneumonia from the public. The race is probably a little wider than a point since the RealClearPolitics average includes the LA Times/USC Tracking Internet poll which has suspect methodology and gave Trump a seven-point lead.\u00a0 Even so, Trump has wiped out more than 80 percent of the lead Clinton enjoyed in early August. In the RealClearPolitics average of state polls, Trump now leads in Florida by 1%, Ohio by 1.2%, and Iowa by 4.3%.\u00a0 In late May, Trump was surprised when told he had a shot at Iowa.\u00a0 He\u2019s also ahead in Maine\u2019s Second District by 5.4% (Maine and Nebraska award Electoral votes by congressional district). In addition, Trump trails in North Carolina by only 0.8% and in Nevada by 0.7%.\u00a0\u00a0 The former was carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, the latter by Obama. But\u2026: Trump still has a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.\u00a0 If he carries North Carolina and the rest of the Romney states PLUS Florida, Ohio and Iowa, he\u2019s at 259 Electoral votes.\u00a0 If he takes Nevada, he\u2019s at 265. But then he must win Pennsylvania or Michigan or Virginia, which would give him 285, 282 or 278 respectively.\u00a0 Today, the RealClearPolitics average has him behind in the Keystone State by 6.6%, in Michigan by 5.2%, and in Virginia by 3.5%.\u00a0 While these margins are smaller than they were at this time last month, the race has not closed as much in these three battlegrounds as it has nationally. If he loses all three states, then his last option might be to win the four Electoral votes of New Hampshire (where he trails by 5%) plus the one Electoral vote from Maine\u2019s Second District.\u00a0 The would move him from 265 to 270, unless Clinton snakes away the Electoral vote from Nebraska\u2019s Second District that President Obama won in 2012.\u00a0 If that happened, then it would be Clinton 271 to Trump 269. Imagine \u2013 the presidential election could come down to how the residents of Bangor, Maine and Omaha, Nebraska vote.\u00a0 What a year.",

            "article_content": "'Off the Record,' 3/18/15: Dem senator should be ashamed for playing the race card in holdup over holdup in attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch's confirmation vote. By the way, the Senate should be ashamed for voting on Lynch already The congressional impasse over Loretta Lynch's nomination for attorney general is taking a nasty turn, with the delay fueling a round of racially charged accusations on Capitol Hill. For weeks, Democrats have accused their Senate Republican colleagues of using the nomination as an excuse for waging proxy battles on sticky issues like immigration and abortion. But the simmering frustration boiled over Wednesday as a top Democrat accused the GOP of making Lynch -- who would be the nation's first black female attorney general -- \"sit in the back of the bus.\" \"It is a civil rights milestone that her name has been submitted,\" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, who noted 130 days have passed since President Obama tapped Lynch to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder. The Illinois Democrat argued there is \"no substantive reason\" for the delay, which he likened to being \"asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\" The sharp remark did not go unchallenged. Responding on Twitter, a Mitch McConnell spokesman posted a photo of U.S. Circuit Judge Janice Rogers Brown, who is black, along with the caption: \"Remember that time Sen. Durbin led filbusters [sic] in an attempt to defeat this judge?\" Democrats blocked Brown's nomination for nearly two years after President George W. Bush nominated her in 2003. Lynch's nomination is stalled over a separate matter. Senate business has ground to a halt over an abortion provision tucked into an anti-human-trafficking bill, with both sides publicly questioning the other's commitment to helping victims of modern-day slavery. Democrats only recently noticed the abortion provision, though it had been in the bill for weeks, and are refusing to advance the bill until it's taken out. Majority Leader McConnell, in turn, said the vote on Lynch won't move forward until the trafficking bill impasse is broken. But with one week to go before senators skip town on a two-week Easter recess, the path forward is murkier -- and the language sharper -- than ever. Republicans insist Democrats are the ones delaying Lynch's confirmation by repeatedly filibustering the trafficking bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee initially voted 12-8 to approve Lynch, who is currently a U.S. attorney in New York. Mid-April is the earliest she could be confirmed if the chamber does not consider her nomination during its current work period. Some Lynch supporters have warned Republicans of potential political fallout as the party gears up for the 2016 elections. \"All across the country, women are watching, African-African American women are watching and the civil rights community is watching,\" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told reporters on a conference call organized by the Congressional Black Caucus earlier this week. Underscoring just how political the standoff has become, even presumptive Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton weighed in. \"Congressional trifecta against women today: 1) Blocking great nominee, 1st African American woman AG, for longer than any AG in 30 years,\" the former secretary of state said in a series of tweets that also bashed the GOP for \"playing politics with trafficking victims.\" For their part, Republicans have also sought advantage but have focused their attention on the legislation to combat human trafficking. Once a noncontroversial measure that passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee, the bill's bipartisan coalition fell apart after Democrats accused Republicans of legislative sleight of hand by secretly inserting a provision to prevent a victims' compensation fund from covering abortion. Democratic cosponsors said they were unaware the abortion language was in the bill. \"At the very best, they're confessing to incredibly bad staff work,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate GOP's campaign arm, which has launched robo-calls targeting in-cycle Democratic senators who voted to block the trafficking bill. \"Harry Reid and his Democratic caucus don't like to vote on issues. This was true in the last term of Congress and Harry Reid led his caucus off the cliff in so doing.\" The saga may be political but it has not been exclusively partisan. Four Democratic senators broke with their caucus this week to back the trafficking bill, and Lynch likewise has the support of at least four Republican senators -- in addition to Sens. Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Susan Collins has said she would vote for her. Under Senate rules, a simple majority is required to confirm most nominees, which means the 46-member Democratic caucus would need the help of at least four Republican senators (in the event of a 50-50 split, Vice President Joe Biden would cast the tie-breaking vote). Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate who supports Lynch and voted to end the filibuster of the trafficking bill, said the entire episode reflects poorly on Congress. \"I've been here four years. This is politics, Washington -- it's not personal,\" the West Virginia Democrat told reporters before meeting with Lynch in his office. \"I think Ms. Lynch understands that.\" Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

            "article_content": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Republican Rep. Joe Heck and former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto breezed through their primaries Tuesday to set up a pivotal U.S. Senate contest, while state Sen. Ruben Kihuen scored a solid win in a competitive Democratic congressional primary and businessman Danny Tarkanian bested a more moderate state senator in a bitter Republican House contest. The wins on Tuesday cap a high-spending primary season and end two heated House races that attracted big names -- and dollars -- from the outside. In Tarkanian's 3rd Congressional District race, a dark money group called Ending Spending dumped $1.6 million into last-minute ads attacking him and promoting state Sen. Michael Roberson. \"When they came out with (the commercials), I was concerned that maybe we would lose support,\" Tarkanian said in an interview after his win. \"I've got to thank the voters of CD3 for not believing that.\" Roberson held the top-ranking post in the state senate last year and helped shepherd a $1.4 billion, governor-backed tax package through the Legislature that dogged him during the congressional campaign. He congratulated Tarkanian on a hard-fought race. \"I look forward to continuing my work as Senate Majority Leader and working to maintain Republican control of the state Senate in November,\" Roberson said in a statement. Tarkanian, who made several unsuccessful bids for office in the past, will now face Democrat Jacky Rosen, a synagogue leader endorsed by Sen. Harry Reid. Rosen beat attorney Jesse Sbaih in the Democratic primary in the southern Nevada district, which is split nearly evenly between Democrats and Republicans. \"I felt confident, but it's a bigger margin than I thought. We were out there and able to get our message out,\" said Rosen, who later issued a statement criticizing Tarkanian as \"ultra-conservative and \"an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.\" In the 4th Congressional District race that includes North Las Vegas and rural central Nevada, Kihuen pulled far ahead of former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores and philanthropist Susie Lee. The primary was competitive and all candidates raised comparable funds, but Kihuen had backing from Reid and President Bill Clinton, and the hospitality workers of the Culinary Union mobilized a massive ground effort to round up the vote. In a statement, Kihuen thanked the powerful union \"for believing in this campaign and working day in and day out in the hot sun and in the pouring rain to get our message out to the voters.\" He'll face incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy, who won an easy primary but has an uphill general election battle in a district that leans solidly Democratic. Flores was unable to pull out a win even though Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders sent wildly successful fundraising pitches on her behalf. \"We did everything we possibly could,\" said Flores campaign manager Tony Valdovinos. \"Ultimately, low turnout seemed to hurt us the most.\" Lee's campaign manager, Jonathan Pattillo, congratulated Kihuen and said Lee would support him in spite of the difficult loss. \"We feel we ran a very strong campaign that ran a strong message,\" Pattillo said. The Senate race that now belongs to Heck and Cortez Masto turned out as expected. Cortez Masto easily defeated a trio of little-known opponents, and Heck scored a comfortable win against conservative activist Sharron Angle in the Nevada primary. They'll compete for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid. \"It's always humbling to get the support of the voters,\" Heck said by phone from Washington D.C. on Tuesday night, where he said he was reading bills to prepare for Wednesday's work in Congress. While Trump's presence could sway his election, Heck, who endorses the presumptive GOP nominee for president, said he's focused on his own race: \"We're going to run our campaign according to the plan we've laid out.\" Masto issued a prepared statement after her victory, saying it sets up a race between two distinct ideologies. \"I am confident that this November voters will reject Trump and Congressman Heck's reckless agenda and elect me as our next Senator,\" she said. In other races, incumbent Democratic Rep. Dina Titus scored an easy win in her heavily Democratic Las Vegas district. Republican Rep. Mark Amodei didn't have any primary opponents in his northern Nevada district. Voters weighed in on numerous legislative races, including Republican contests that have exposed deep rifts between the party's moderate and more conservative wings. Republican incumbents who supported Sandoval's tax package mostly survived challenges from anti-tax purists, although several lost their bid for re-election. Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske said she expected turnout for the primary would be on par with 2014, when 19 percent of voters turned out. Nevada has 1.3 million active voters.",

Romney is also, Trump wrote, a \u201cdope.\u201d But Romney is arguably the very best Republican to be asking Trump about his tax returns given how successfully Democrats exploited Romney\u2019s filings to alienate potential voters. Democrats essentially called Romney a tax cheat for his low rates and the attack stuck. And it is a line, in some form or another, which Democrats will be sure to repeat against the billionaire Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee. Romney began releasing his tax returns amid pressure from his rivals in early Republican primaries in 2012. But because Trump\u2019s rivals have neglected to actually attack the frontrunner very much, Trump is only just now being pressed on this crucial general election issue. Romney\u2019s troll timing is perfect. Trump is either less than a week away from starting to put the Republican nomination in the bag or facing lengthening odds in his unlikely but so-far successful quest. He is also facing tonight what promises to be his most challenging debate yet. Trump\u2019s detractors to this point have mostly knocked Trump for insufficient conservativeness, or flip flopping, or being of poor character. But voters primarily interested in conservative orthodoxy and personal virtue are probably not part of Trump\u2019s long-term coalition. Trump\u2019s voters don\u2019t seem to care about his politics. They just want a winner. What few have hit the frontrunner on are his business failures and the unhappy chapters of his career. His business troubles and his finances have been a long-running part of Trump\u2019s media feuds in the past but have oddly not been part of the political discussion. It is particularly odd given how much of a focus Romney\u2019s relatively tame business record was four years ago. Romney\u2019s mischievous speculation is using Trump\u2019s tactics against Trump. When the celebrity billionaire speculated about Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s nativity, Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s sweat glands, or Ben Carson\u2019s gifts as a teenaged knife fighter, he was doing exactly what Romney is doing now. Whether Trump can manage to lock up his party\u2019s nomination \u2013 which could come as soon as March 15 \u2013 without divulging his tax returns will depend on the press and his competitors. Neither has shown themselves to have much snap in their noodles when it comes to taking on Trump so far, but the hour is late and the stakes are high. Rubio, Cruz sharpen attacks on Trump - Fox News: \u201cSpeaking at a special forum in Houston hosted by Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called on Republican voters Wednesday to unite around his campaign, saying that his was \u2018the only campaign that can beat Donald [and] has beat Donald,\u2019 a reference to his win in last month's Iowa caucuses\u2026Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has finished second in each of the last two nominating contests, acknowledged that Trump was \u2018the frontrunner and I\u2019m the underdog, but I\u2019ve been an underdog my entire life.\u2019 Rubio added that his campaign \u2018would not allow the conservative movement to be defined by a nominee who isn't a conservative.\u2019 Rubio also took a shot at Trump, though he did not mention that candidate's name, for his remarks on Muslims.\u201d Trump\u2019s resort spurned American applicants for foreign workers - NYT: \u201cSince 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers [at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.]. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired. In all but a handful of cases, Mar-a-Lago sought to fill the jobs with hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries.\u201d White nationalists plump for Trump in robocalls - Daily Beast: \u201cA xenophobic pro-Donald Trump robocall urges voters in Vermont and Minnesota not to vote for a \u2018Cuban\u2019 like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz. The call comes from the American National PAC and is voiced by its founded William Daniel Johnson, the leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party. \u2018The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called \u2018racist,\u2019 the call said. \u2018I am afraid to be called racist. Donald Trump is not a racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don\u2019t vote for a Cuban. Vote for Donald Trump.\u2019 Trump had previously disavowed the super PAC that released controversial robocalls on his behalf in Iowa.\u201d Why it\u2019s still a race - RCP\u2019s Lou Cannon explains why Trump isn\u2019t the inevitable nominee writing that Trump\u2019s unfavorable rating and loss of late-breaking voters means Trump still faces competition heading into Super Tuesday. March 15: \u2018Day of Reckoning\u2019 - FiveThirtyEight: \u201cMarch 15 is truly the GOP\u2019s \u2018day of reckoning,\u2019 and Florida may be the most pivotal state on the entire calendar. If Trump defeats Rubio in his winner-take-all backyard, it would be game over. But if Rubio wins over enough of Jeb Bush\u2019s old supporters to claim Florida\u2019s 99-delegate jackpot, it could mark a long-awaited turning point in the race. At the very least, he could leverage such an outcome to try to prevent Trump from winning a majority of delegates by June.\u201d Carson wonders whether his campaign ripped off donors - The Atlantic: \u201cFor months, reporters and political operatives\u2026have been pointing out that Ben Carson\u2019s campaign bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam operation. Now Carson seems to agree. On CNN on Tuesday, Carson discussed his\u00a0year-end staff shake-up: \u2018We had people who didn't really seem to understand finances,\u2019 a laughing Carson [said] adding, \u2018or maybe they did\u2014maybe they were doing it on purpose.\u2019 It\u2019s a remarkable statement\u2014especially because he\u2019s so blithe about it\u2026 First, many of the companies being paid millions and millions of dollars are run by top campaign officials or their friends and relations, meaning those people are making a mint. Second, many of the contributions are coming from small-dollar donors. If that money is being given by well-meaning grassroots conservatives for a campaign that\u2019s designed not to win but to produce revenue for venders, isn\u2019t it just a grift?\u201d [GOP delegate count:\u00a0Trump\u00a082;\u00a0Cruz\u00a017;\u00a0Rubio\u00a016;\u00a0Kasich 6; Carson\u00a04 (1,237 needed to win)] Ed Note: Wednesday\u2019s Fox First incorrectly listed Cruz\u2019s delegate count.

Smithsonian has the story: \u201cWhat if you sifted through every last little organism that lives or passes through a single cubic foot of space in a day? On a coral reef? In a forest? How many species would you find? This was the question that [photographer Michael] Liittschwager wanted to answer\u2014and photograph. He came up with the idea of a biocube; his proposed standard for sampling biodiversity. A 12-inch cube that he would set in one place and observe long enough to catalog everything within it.

THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING: APPLE VS. DOJFox News\u2019 Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano argues that the Department of Justice has no authority to force Apple to give them the ability to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorists, and says DOJ already has the information they\u2019re seeking: \u201cThe DOJ knows where this data on this killer\u2019s cellphone can be found, but if it subpoenas the NSA, and the NSA complies with that subpoena, and all this becomes public, that will put the lie to the government\u2019s incredible denials that it spies upon all of us all the time.

She said: \u2018I know it sounds mad but we had a guy in to paint the whole house. We\u2019d been planning it for ages and had packed everything into boxes. We just thought it would be easier to wait, although it did mean that Gerry had to carry round the winning ticket in his wallet all week.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Latest on the Senate votes on gun control legislation (all times Eastern): 3:45 p.m. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte says she will support a Democratic amendment to allow the government to ban the sale of guns to suspected terrorists, a reversal after voting against a similar version in December. Ayotte, who is in a tough re-election race in New Hampshire, says she will vote for the amendment sponsored by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She'll also back a Republican alternative to delay gun sales to suspected terrorist for 72 hours, but require court action to block the sale permanently. Ayotte says she is working with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine on a compromise. That version would prohibit the sale of guns to terrorism suspects who are on the government's no-fly list and allow an appeals process for those who may be mistakenly on the list. New Hampshire is home to some of the nation's most lenient gun laws, but Ayotte's approval rating fell after she voted against expanding background checks following the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. ___ 2:30 p.m. A top Republican is rejecting a potential compromise on gun control negotiated by moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said Monday that Collins' proposal is problematic because it would immediately prohibit the sale of guns to people on the government's no fly list \u2014 even those mistakenly identified as terrorism suspects. Cornyn says the appeals process in the bill comes too late. The Senate is voting Monday on an amendment from Cornyn to allow the government to delay a gun sale to a suspected terrorist for 72 hours, but require court action to block the sale permanently. It's unclear if Collins' legislation will get a vote. Cornyn said that \"any time you are denying an American citizen their constitutional rights it ought to be with evidence.\" He says the \"burden ought to be on the government and it ought to come from a court.\" A spokeswoman for Collins says the bill has \"thorough and robust\" protections for those who may mistakenly be on the list.",

            "article_content": "October 9, 2016: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speak during their presidential town hall debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. (REUTERS/Jim Young) Millions of Americans tuned into the second presidential debate on Sunday night to witness one of the more anticipated events in recent political history. In many households, the sense of suspense was likely significant -- to the point that even children noticed the drama. For many families, it can be difficult to convey to young people that despite the noise and excitement surrounding this race, presidential debates and elections are serious things. They can affect the lives of millions of Americans, and on many occasions in the past, they have. Indeed, a little American history is a healthy counterweight to the daily commotion of the presidential campaign. That is one purpose of \"Hail to the Chief,\" the latest in my New York Times bestselling series of children\u2019s books featuring Ellis the Elephant. In \"Hail to the Chief,\" Ellis discovers many of America\u2019s greatest presidents--including a few who have participated in some extraordinary debates themselves. In 1960, for instance, the debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon may well have been decisive in that election--one of the closest in our nation\u2019s history. Kennedy\u2019s victory had huge ramifications for the country and the world--culturally, politically, and militarily--for decades to come. In \"Hail to the Chief,\" Ellis also discovers Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln\u2019s 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas on the topic of slavery were reprinted in newspapers throughout the country. They were crucial in raising Lincoln\u2019s national stature and clarifying public debate on the question that ultimately led to the Civil War. Today, as our country awaits the final presidential debate of 2016 and prepares to elect its 45th president, stories like these from our nation\u2019s past can help young and old alike understand that debates really do matter, and that elections really do have consequences. Ellis offers readers a useful lesson about the wisdom of the American people, as well. Throughout our history, Americans have chosen some exceptional leaders--tough and energetic figures who have inspired the nation. And we have also selected some unlikely presidents who no one would have predicted, but who offered the country unique leadership when it was urgently needed. Unfortunately, we have some real work to do when it comes to passing this history on to the next generation of Americans. The results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress show that students score worse in American history than in any other subject--at every grade level and often overwhelmingly so. Just 20 percent of fourth-graders, 18 percent of eighth-graders and 12 percent of twelfth-graders are at grade-level proficiency in American history. This election is a perfect occasion for each of us to begin promoting knowledge of our presidential past with the young people in our own lives. Hail to the Chief is an excellent starting place, as it highlights the stories of some of our greatest presidents. During this election season, take a few minutes to share the stories of our country\u2019s greatest presidents with the young Americans in your life. You\u2019ll be doing a service that too many of our schools are not--and in the process, perhaps inspiring the next generation of American leaders.",

            "article_content": "The GOP nominee counseled himself not to blow the ultimate push; Carl Cameron reports for 'Special Report' Presidential contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton held near-simultaneous rallies in the battleground state of North Carolina Thursday evening, during which Trump claimed Clinton committed perjury and Clinton said Trump's election would lead to \"normalizing discrimination.\" North Carolina's 15 electoral votes have emerged as a key part of Trump's path to victory. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed Clinton and Trump in a close race among North Carolina voters. At a rally in Selma, Trump tried to court North Carolina's sizable military vote, delivering his stump speech flanked by a dozen veterans onstage. The real estate mogul told the crowd that \"we know Hillary can't be trusted\" with national security, a reference to the ongoing FBI investigation of Clinton's private email server, and called the former secretary of state \"the most dishonest person ever to run for office.\" \"When I look at these great admirals and great generals ... behind me, to think of her being their boss? I don't think so,\" Trump said, adding that such \"incredible patriots ... would never say a thing\" about Clinton \"but I know what they're thinking.\" Trump then cited a CBS News report that FBI agents have discovered previously unseen emails related to Clinton's State Department tenure on a computer owned by former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of the Democratic nominee's top aide, Huma Abedin. \"Remember they said 'They're duplicates, they're duplicates,'\" Trump said. \"How can there be duplicates? Hillary therefore committed perjury because of her statements [to the FBI] in addition to all her other crimes.\" Approximately 30 miles to the northwest in Raleigh, Clinton was addressing a rally to boost early voting turnout, especially among African-Americans. She was joined by her former primary rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and hip-hop producer Pharrell Williams. Clinton decried what she called the \"distressful\" tone of the campaign, saying that \"I've had people say that they can't sleep, their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches.\" Clinton then pivoted to an attack on Trump, saying that his past reported comments about women, the disabled, Muslims and other groups have \"already revealed who he is.\" She discussed Trump's conduct in the now-infamous 1989 \"Central Park Five\" rape case, in which five black and Latino teens were convicted of sexual assault before later being exonerated. Last month, Trump said the teens \"admitted they were guilty.\" \"If he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can he fight for fairness and justice?\" Clinton asked. \"Do we want him appointing our judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\" President Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina in 32 years when he took the state in 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won it back in 2012.",

            "article_content": "Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Credit: Library of Congress) Eighty-four years ago this week, Amelia Earhart stunned the world by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, in a grueling test of endurance and skill. Today, 130 women pilots are gearing up for a challenge that will be just as demanding and personally fulfilling \u2014 they will be flying the Air Race Classic, an annual four-day, 2,700-mile, all-women airplane race. From the moment they leave Prescott, Ariz., the morning of June 21, they will put their determination and abilities to the test as they wing their way across the country as fast as their airplanes will go, racing the clock around the Midwest and down to Daytona Beach, Fla. Over the years, ARC racers have included WASP who flew for the Army during World War II, the country\u2019s first helicopter instrument flight instructor, military fliers, airline pilots, civilian flight instructors, college students, even high school students; women of all ages and from all walks of life. The ARC is a direct descendant of the 1929 Women\u2019s Air Derby \u2014 aka the Powder Puff \u2014 which Earhart flew but, incidentally, did not win. Back then, women held only about 3 percent of pilot\u2019s licenses. That wasn\u2019t unusual; many professions were virtually exclusively male. But in the 80 years since, much has changed. More than 50 percent of college students in the U.S. are female. Women practice in every medical specialty. The Supreme Court, which didn\u2019t get its first woman justice until 1981, is now one-third female. And in aviation? The percentage of U.S. aviators who are women has risen to a whopping 6 percent: about 40,000 women out of 600,000 total pilots. Why hasn\u2019t aviation kept up? Shamefully, as in 1929, it is still largely a boys\u2019 club. Many flight schools expect students to be familiar with engines and mechanical systems that girls are not exposed to. Females who ask questions are made to feel stupid. Sexual harassment can start during flight training and persist throughout a woman\u2019s piloting career. At a recent\u00a0National Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA) contest, a female competitor from a storied aviation university was singled out for shaming on social media by other teams. Think it got personal? Of course it did. Qantas, the Australian airline, only this year got around to providing woman-tailored uniforms for its female pilots. The author, Bev Weintraub, piloting her aircraft. (Credit: Philip F. Cianciolo) Last week, four female pilots sued Frontier Airlines claiming discrimination while they were pregnant and nursing \u2014\u00a0including forced unpaid leave of as much as 10 weeks. The indignities range from the ridiculous to the outrageous, and they make no sense. The aviation industry should be seeking out the best pilots around, both men and women, rather than dismissing half the population. Encouraging female pilots would be good for business: Harley-Davidson saw sales boom when it started marketing to women, a promising strategy for flight schools operating on a shoestring. It would be good for safety: A 2013 survey found that while women make up 10 percent of U.S. Army Apache helicopter pilots, they account for only 3 percent of accidents \u2014 for all-female crews, the number of accidents was zero. And it would be good for the country: The U.S. is suffering from a pilot shortage that has, according to Forbes magazine, already curtailed air service to more than 100 cities since 2013 and is only going to get worse. Doubling the hiring pool would provide many of the thousands of pilots we will need in the decades ahead. Until that happens, though, each of our nation\u2019s female fliers needs to answer the skepticism and nagging doubts by showing confidence in her abilities, having the skills to back it up and building a robust support system. That\u2019s why, even in 2016, the Air Race Classic is so important. The ARC is the oldest women\u2019s networking organization in aviation, providing aeronautical education, safety training, professional contacts and an unparalleled opportunity for putting piloting abilities to the test. The 55 teams who will be competing this year are a source of support and strength \u2013 and fierce competition, forcing all who fly the race to bring their best. When those pilots take off from Prescott, facing brutal heat, high density altitude, unfamiliar mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather, they will prove beyond a doubt that they have earned their wings, soaring high and flying proud. Beverly Weintraub, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, is a New York-based director of the Air Race Classic and will be competing in this year\u2019s race, co-piloting a Beechcraft Sundowner C23.",

            "article_content": "Micah Xavier Johnson identified as shooter The sniper who killed five Dallas police officers Thursday night as they guarded protesters at an anti-police brutality march was angry about recent shootings by police and \u201cwanted to kill white people,\u201d according to authorities. The gunman was identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, who was blown up by a police robot while holed up on the second level of a parking garage early Friday morning after negotiations with police broke down. During a search of his home, detectives found bomb making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics, Dallas police reported. The murderous rampage was the deadliest day in American law enforcement since 9/11 and prompted President Obama to declare it a \u201cvicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.\u201d \"We're hurting,\" said Dallas Police Chief David Brown in a Friday morning news conference. \"Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. All I know is this must stop, this divisiveness betweeen our police and our citizens.\" Prayers to the families, officers, all affected by this. Good will triumph over this evil. #PrayForDallas pic.twitter.com/npTFAnNvB6 The protest was one of several around the country, prompted by police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. One of the police officers killed has been identified as Dallas Area Rapid Transit Officer Brent Thompson, 43. (LinkedIn) Brown said the dead suspect told authorities he was angry about police shootings. \"He said he was upset at white people,\" Brown said. \"He said he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers.\" The sniper is believed to have fired from a downtown parking garage. (Associated Press) Initial reports said there was more than one sniper, but at the news conference, Brown indicated the dead suspect may have been the sole gunman. Although he told police he was \"not affiliated\" with anyone else, three others were being held. A woman was taken into custody near the garage and two men reportedly seen packing a camouflage bag into a Mercedes before speeding from the scene were apprehended and detained, the mayor said. A Dallas police source estimated to Fox News that at least 60 rounds were fired over a \"large kill zone.\" The source added that the shooting would have required considerable planning. The suspect was killed when police sent an explosives-equipped robot into the El Centro Community College parking garage to detonate the bomb after negotiations went nowhere, Brown said, refuting earlier reports that the man killed himself. Before he died, he had claimed that explosives had been set around the city, and much of downtown Dallas was locked down while police searched before determining there were no bombs. \"It's a heartbreaking moment for the city of Dallas,\" Mayor Mike Rawlings said. \"I ask that everybody focus on one thing right now, and that is Dallas police officers, their families, those that are deceased [and] those that are in the hospital fighting for their lives.\" Obama, speaking from a NATO summit in Poland, said America is \u201chorrified\u201d over the shootings and asked all Americans to pray for the fallen officers and their families. He renewed his calls for more gun control. \u201cThere\u2019s no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement,\u201d Obama said, hours after a pre-attack speech in which he cited two racially charged police shootings earlier in the week and called for an end to bias in law enforcement. Three of the cops killed were identified Friday. Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Officer Brent Thompson, 43; and Dallas Police Officers Michael Krol, 40, and Patrick Zamarripa, 32. Witness Carlos Harris told the\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0the gunfire was \"strategic.\u00a0It was tap-tap-pause. Tap-tap-pause.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott released a statement saying he has directed the Texas Department of Public Safety director to offer \"whatever assistance the City of Dallas needs at this time.\" \"In times like this we must remember -- and emphasize -- the importance of uniting as Americans,\" Abbott said. The protesters had gathered after a Minnesota officer on Wednesday fatally shot Philando Castile while he was in a car with a woman and a child in a St. Paul suburb. The aftermath of the shooting was purportedly livestreamed in a widely shared Facebook video. A day earlier, Alton Sterling was shot in Louisiana after being pinned to the pavement by two white officers. That, too, was captured on a cellphone video. Other protests across the U.S. on Thursday were peaceful. In midtown Manhattan, protesters first gathered in Union Square Park. In Minnesota, where Castile was shot, hundreds of protesters marched in the rain from a vigil to the governor's official residence. Protesters also marched in Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia. Anti-police protests have roiled the nation in each of the last two summers following controversial police shootings, including the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and last April's death of Freddie Gray while in custody of Baltimore police. A Department of Justice investigation cleared the police officer who shot Brown, and, of the six Baltimore police officers charged in Gray's death, two have been acquitted, one's case was declared a mistrial and three more face trial. The attack made Thursday the deadliest day for law officers since\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001, when 72 officers died, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

            "article_content": "Four4Four Science: Wild horses proposal angers animal rights activists; how selfies are helping conserved land, scientists capture dolphin chatter, lightning deaths The U.S. government is coming under fire from animal rights activists amid concerns that almost 45,000 wild horses could be euthanized in an attempt to control their numbers. Last week the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s National Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board recommended that the Bureau euthanize or sell \u201cwithout limitation\u201d excess \u201cunadoptable\u201d horses and burros in the BLM\u2019s off-range corrals and pastures. An \u201cunadoptable\u201d horse or burro is typically at least 5 years old, making them less attractive for purchase or adoption. The bureau has more than 44,000 horses and more than 1,000 burros in off-range pastures and corrals. The recommendation prompted an angry response from The Humane Society of the United States. \u201cThe decision of the BLM advisory board to recommend the destruction of the 45,000 wild horses currently in holding facilities is a complete abdication of responsibility for their care,\u201d said Humane Society Senior Vice President of Programs & Innovations Holly Hazard, in a statement. Under the terms of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, the BLM manages, protects and controls wild horses and burros. The law authorizes the agency to move wild horses and burros off ranges to sustain the health of public lands. In addition to the off-range animals, the bureau estimates that more than 67,000 wild horses and burros are roaming on BLM-managed rangelands in 10 Western states. With virtually no natural predators, wild horse and burro herd sizes can double about every four years, which means that thousands of the animals are removed from the range each year to control herd sizes and protect the land. The BLM has its own off-range holding corrals in states such as Nevada and California, as well as contracts with private ranches in locations such as Kansas and Oklahoma. The Bureau has not yet made a formal response to the board\u2019s recommendation, although, in a statement, it said that it will continue to care and seek good homes for animals that have been removed from the range. \u201cWhat this means is that we will continue with our current policy, which is not to sell or send wild horses or burros to slaughter,\u201d it said. A BLM spokesman told FoxNews.com that the animals are protected. \u201cThese are public lands and the horses are a symbol of the history of the Old West,\u201d he said. Since 1971, the BLM has adopted out more than 235,000 wild horses and burros, according to the spokesman. \u201cWe screen buyers and we screen adopters,\u201d he added. The agency also noted that the Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board is an independent panel comprised of members of the public. The bureau spent $49 million caring for off-range animals during its fiscal year 2015, which accounted for two-thirds of its wild horse and burro budget. However, the Humane Society has slammed the agency\u2019s efforts. \u201cOver the past 20 years, the BLM has maintained round-up and removal as a primary management strategy for wild horse and burro populations on America\u2019s western rangelands \u2013 an effort which has led to a financially unsustainable Wild Horse and Burro Program,\u201d it said, in its statement. \u201cBy focusing massive efforts on removing horses and burros from the range, without treating those horses remaining on the range with any form of fertility control to limit population growth, holding facilities throughout the United States have become overburdened.\u201d Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers",

            "article_content": "Mo Elleithee, Marc Thiessen and Howard Kurtz weigh in on what to expect Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday as the presidential candidates brush up on foreign policy hours before their debate. Clinton\u2019s meeting with Netanyahu was brief. The two met for less than an hour in Manhattan, according to Clinton campaign officials. Her meeting came after Trump sat down with the prime minister at his residence in Trump Tower at length, Trump campaign officials said. Reporters were barred from covering either meeting. Clintons' campaign said in a statement that the two had an \"in-depth conversation.\" She stressed that \"a strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States\" and \"reaffirmed unwavering commitment\" to the relationship. According to her campaign, Clinton stressed her support for the 10-year, $38 billion military aid package signed between the two countries earlier the month and opposition to efforts to boycott Israel. They also discussed Iran, the conflict in Syria and other regional challenges, including her support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict negotiated by the two parties \u2014 not an outside organization like the U.N. Security Council. Trump and Netanyahu discussed such key issues as the Iran nuclear deal, Middle East stability and the problems that the Islamic State terror group has created in the region, according to Trump campaign officials. Trump and Netanyahu are long-time acquaintances. But in December 2015, Trump postponed a trip to Israel to meet with Netanyahu after the prime minister\u2019s office criticized his proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants -- in the aftermath of several terror attacks inspired or executed by radical Islamic terrorists. The Trump campaign said Sunday that the nominee and the prime minister \u201chave known each other for many years and had the opportunity to discuss many topics important to both countries,\u201d citing ISIS, the Iran deal and Trump suggesting, if elected, continuing U.S. military aid to Israel. Trump and other leading Republicans have suggested that Obama and his administration have failed to maintain strong ties with Israel, which has provided Western nations with support and stability amid decades of Middle East turmoil. The United States also provides billons annually to Israel in military aid. Most recently, Trump and fellow Republicans have agreed with Netanyahu that the administration-brokered Iran nuclear deal hurts Israel, Tehran\u2019s enemy, because it lifts economic sanctions without enough safeguards to ensure Iran has indeed curbed efforts to build a nuclear weapon. \u201cMr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism,\u201d the campaign also said after the meeting. \u201cHe agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.\u201d They also said Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been \u201cthe eternal capital of the Jewish People for more than 3,000 years\u201d and that the U.S., with Trump as president, \u201cwill finally accept the long-standing congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s meeting with each of the candidates was designed to put Israel on good footing with the next U.S. president. Both candidates likely will seek Netanyahu\u2019s support for their respective White House bids, considering Israel is often called the United States\u2019 most important ally. The Israeli leader has sought to project neutrality this time after perceptions arose that he favored Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama in 2012. But it also served to showcase the candidates' expertise in foreign policy in the shadow of their first debate Monday, six weeks before Election Day. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, often says that Trump does not know enough about the world and lacks the temperament to be president. Trump has argued that he has extensive experience with foreign policy through his career as a business executive and blames Clinton for many of the nation's stumbles in foreign policy.

In the original Facebook post, the BLM said the video \"captured this strange 'thing' swimming in the Chena River in Fairbanks.\" The \"thing\" quickly became known as the Alaska Ice Monster, with all kinds of crazy theories from commenters about what it might be. NPR rounds up some of them, including a giant sturgeon, a lost shark, a \"beavegator\" (no idea), a Nessie-ish creature, and a \"giant arctic crocodile.\" Mother Nature News took note of this one: \"What is the likelihood that this is a whale that seriously lost its way from the Yukon river, transferring across other small river fjords into the Chena?\" Alas, the BLM then updated with a less exciting explanation. \"So far the most compelling explanation ... is that the video shows 'frazil ice stuck to a rope that is probably caught on a bridge pier.'\" Frazil ice is \"a kind of loose, slushy ice that forms on water,\" explains Alaska Dispatch News. \"It looks like it's swimming upstream but it's actually stationary and just wading in the current,\" a biologist with the state's Department of Fish and Game says of the formerly mysterious subject of the video, adding, \"it's not organic.\" Not that the fun is necessarily over. \"Such a clear, scientific explanation isn't likely to stop the multiplication of more 'creative' stories about the Alaska 'ice monster,'\" observes the Christian Science Monitor.

            "article_content": "Harris Faulkner's America: Former pollster for President Clinton explains why he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton and how she can potentially produce a 'constitutional crisis' Editor's note: The following column first appeared on TheHill.com. I made one of the most difficult decisions of my life \u2014 not just political, but also personal \u2014 on Sunday night. During my weekly show on \"The Fox Report\" hosted by Harris Faulkner with Pat Caddell and John LeBoutillier, I indicated that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for me to vote for Hillary Clinton on November 8. Why did I say this? Not for any small reason. I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election. FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to make public the fact that more emails potentially pertinent to the Clinton probe had been found on Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer changes the impact of this election on the future of the country. I say this because regardless of what Secretary Clinton did or didn\u2019t do or what her aide, Huma Abedin, did or didn\u2019t do or even what Anthony Weiner did or didn\u2019t do, I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election. In the best case scenario, there will be at the very least a criminal investigation of president-elect Clinton. And there will be a criminal investigation of Huma Abedin, which is apparently ongoing. Furthermore, there will be potential investigations into the actions of the Justice Department and most of all the FBI and its director, James Comey. After the past eight years wherein America has become progressively more and more divided and a campaign season that has magnified these divisions, I fear for that we will not be able to withstand this kind of continued scandal. Let me contextualize this point a bit more as the term \u201cWatergate\u201d gets thrown around alot these days. Donald Trump likes to say that the Clinton email scandal is worse than Watergate. I remember Watergate very well. What troubled me most, other than the crimes committed, was that the United States was paralyzed and unable to act. President Nixon and the government were rendered impotent, unable to govern and meet its responsibilities to the American public. I worry that the same thing could happen after a victory by Secretary Clinton and could carry on into her term of office. There will be no goodwill or honeymoon period for Clinton. Her first 100-days agenda will take a backseat to partisan divisions and polarization with little chance of constructive legislative action occurring. We have seen that a hyper-partisan, gridlocked Washington is bad for the country. There is no reason to believe that Clinton\u2019s tenure will be anything but more of the same in this way and, most likely, a lot worse. Further, Russian President Vladimir Putin said (tongue-in-cheek) that we are not a banana republic.\u200e I greatly fear we could become one if Secretary Clinton is elected president. Our national security will continue to be jeopardized by ongoing investigations by the FBI, and potentially the Justice Department and Congress, putting us at immediate risk of more assertive actions in Europe, Middle East and Asia by the Russians and Chinese. Moreover, we simply cannot face a situation where the president elect may need or want a pardon from the president to govern. Or worse yet, need to pardon herself after she takes office. As of now, I have no confidence that either of those questions will be answered by Election Day or that we will have full clarity on an investigation into what could be as many as 650,000 emails that found their way to Weiner and Abedin\u2019s computer. However, in good conscience, and as a Democrat, I am actively doubting whether I can vote for the Secretary of State. I also want to make clear that I cannot vote for Donald Trump as his world view and mine are very different. I remain a Democrat and proud of the work I did for six years for President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 2000 and I write with extreme sadness. But I cannot in the waning days of the election make the case that Secretary Clinton should be elected. I still share her worldview and am much closer to her approach to policies than I am to Donald Trump. That said, with America facing a potential constitutional crisis after her election, I am not able, under the circumstances we are now facing, to vote for Secretary Clinton.",

            "article_content": "FBI's October surprise on Clinton appears to have improved Trumps overall standing in the electoral map. 'On the Record' takes a closer look The FBI\u2019s October surprise appears to have improved Donald Trump\u2019s overall standing in the electoral map, with the latest Fox News Electoral Scorecard showing several states shifting in his favor since last week. The Fox News Decision Team announced updates to the scorecard Thursday afternoon, reflecting the following changes based on recent polling and other factors: Despite the changes, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton maintains the clear advantage, and Trump\u2019s path to victory remains a tight one. But the latest ratings show Clinton\u2019s advantage diminishing. If Clinton were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the Democratic column, she\u2019d have 283 electoral votes \u2013 more than the 270 needed to win. If Trump were to win all the states leaning toward or solidly in the GOP column, he\u2019d be short at 192 electoral votes. But winning all the toss-up states would put him just 15 electoral votes shy of 270. One more win in North Carolina, Michigan or Pennsylvania could get him to victory. The updates and fresh polling comes in the wake of the FBI\u2019s decision Friday to revisit the Clinton email investigation after new messages were found on the laptop used by ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The Clinton campaign and its allies have downplayed the significance of the messages while questioning the FBI\u2019s announcement so close to Election Day. Trump, meanwhile, has seized on the news as well as other developments to press his case in the final stretch. Speaking Thursday in Jacksonville, Fla., he cited reporting by Fox News that an FBI investigation regarding the Clinton Foundation has become a \u201chigh priority.\u201d He also touted new polls in Ohio and elsewhere showing him ahead. Clinton and President Obama have, for their part, made an impassioned case to voters to not elect Trump. \u201cYou want a voice who\u2019s bragging about how being famous lets you get away with what would qualify as sexual assault, and calls women pigs, and dogs, and slobs?\u201d Obama warned voters Thursday in Miami. \u201cAnd when he pays attention to women, it\u2019s because he\u2019s grading them on a scale of one to ten. What kind of message are we sending if that\u2019s our voice?\u201d In the latest states to shift, Ohio is the most highly sought prize. Trump has been leading there for weeks and his recent national bounce moves the state back into his column.\u00a0Early ballot requests also suggest a Republican advantage. The Electoral Scorecard also recently moved Florida and Nevada from \u201clean Democrat\u201d into the \u201ctoss-up\u201d column as well, while North Carolina shifted from \u201ctoss-up\u201d to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d",

The car's owner Tim O'Boyle now plans to relist the vehicle closer to the upcoming 2012 presidential election -- perhaps at a lower price, the Chicago Tribune reported after the online auction closed late Wednesday. Lisa Czibor, the eBay seller conducting the auction on O'Boyle's behalf, said, \"We're trying to talk him into rerunning it now and making some changes to [the listing]. Lowering the price, and contacting Obama to find out if there's a charity he'd like us to donate some of the profits to. \"In the end, it's [O'Boyle's] car. It's up to him.\" The auction listing stated that Obama leased the vehicle late in his term as a state senator, in 2004, and during his time as a US senator, from 2005 to 2007. It was accompanied by a photograph of the original Illinois title with Obama's name on it. In December, 2007, Obama reportedly traded in the HEMI V8-powered luxury sedan for a Ford Escape Hybrid. The car was first offered up for sale on eBay three years ago, FOXNews.com reported. That auction, which listed the car for a starting bid of $100,000, fell apart when phony bidders pushed the price up to $1 billion dollars and the car hasn't sold in the years since. Nevertheless, it was posted again last week with the $1 million price tag. A representative for the Illinois-based O'Boyle told FoxNews.com last week that they think the car has even more historical value than it originally did now the president has spent three years in office, citing the reported sale of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 1977 Peugeot for $2.5 million as an example of the potential value of the vehicle.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer - RTSKQZF Donald Trump received a draft deferment during the Vietnam War because a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs in his heels,\u00a0The New York Times reported yesterday. Bone spurs are bony outgrowths that develop on the edges of a person's bones. When these growths occur on a person's heel, they tend to come from the front of the heel bone, along the bottom of the foot, in the direction of the arch of the foot, according to the Mayo Clinic. People can be born with heel spurs, or the growths can form later in life, said Dr. John G. Kennedy, a foot and ankle surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Kennedy has not treated Trump. [16 Oddest Medical Cases] The condition can be painful if the heel spurs are large, Kennedy told Live Science. A person would experience pain in the sole of his or her foot while walking or exercising, Kennedy said. Although one in 10 people has heel spurs, the condition causes pain in only half of the people who have it, or one in 20 people, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Indeed, not everyone with heel spurs even knows that they have the condition, according to the Mayo Clinic. Oftentimes, people learn that they have heel spurs when they get an X-ray for a different problem, Kennedy said. To treat heel spurs, doctors recommend that people change their footwear, Kennedy said. If people wear the right shoes, most heel spurs will stop causing pain, even though the spurs themselves don't go away, he said. Heel spurs can also be surgically removed, but this is very rarely done, he said. Heel spurs are also associated with another condition that causes foot pain: plantar fasciitis, Kennedy said. In people with plantar fasciitis, the tissue that runs along the bottom of a person's foot, called the plantar fascia, becomes inflamed and painful. However, heel spurs do not cause plantar fasciitis, he added. Originally published on Live Science. Copyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company. All rights reserved.

Once it reaches ground, it can chase enemy forces at 70 miles per hour and unleash some serious firepower. Currently, the Marines use options like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicle to move from ship to shore. The AAV-7A1 has been in service for about 45 years, and has undergone upgrades, but there is room for improvement and a new vehicle to meet the current and future requirements of today\u2019s Marine Corps. The ACV 1.1 could join the Marine Corps\u2019 Assault Amphibious Vehicle fleet in the future. (BAE Systems) What can it do? Based on a platform developed by IVECO Defence Vehicles, the ACV 1.1 leverages a new 6-cylinder, 700HP power pack. This approach aims to equip the Marines with even more power than the current Assault Amphibious Vehicle. The ACV 1.1\u00a0is big enough to carry 13 Marines plus a crew of three. It\u2019s about 29 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 9 feet high. In practice that would mean that it could launch from a ship and \u201cswim\u201d about 12 nautical miles through the ocean to reach the shore. While out on the water, it can reach speeds of six knots. Once on land, it could travel about 250 miles at a maximum speed of about 70 mph. It has a total range of approximately 350 miles. Surf? Not a problem for this vehicle. The ACV 1.1 can continue to charge forward in spite of nine-foot plunging surf. On land A ship-to-shore assault force often encounters tough conditions like surf, wet sand, soft soil, and steep inclines among others. Helpful in tackling these sorts of challenges, this 8x8 leverages all-wheel drive for traction, more power and torque for the land and surf areas. \u00a0It also uses 16R20 tires, a type used on other Marine Corps\u2019 vehicles. There is a special H-drive system on this vehicle. You won\u2019t find any axles-- instead on each side there are three drive shafts. In response to feedback from Marines, BAE System also built more stowage and enhanced seating into the design. The instrument panel for the driver was also adapted for better ease of use. For the gunner, the controls will incorporate advances like enhanced automation with easy push-button approaches. (BAE systems) Protection The ACV 1.1 aims to provide Marines with far better protection against IEDs and mines beneath the vehicle, as well as protection from threats above. The design for this assault vehicle includes integrated armor for MRAP-level protection. For further enhanced safety, there are energy-absorbing seats in addition to an optimized blast-resistant hull. Background Last year, the U.S. Marine Corps awarded two contracts to BAE Systems and SAIC for the Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development phase of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle 1.1 program. SAIC is working on their version, called the Terrex 1. During this current phase, BAE Systems will produce 16 prototypes that the Marine Corps will test. The Marine Corps will decide whether to proceed with the ACV 1.1 or the Terrex 1 in 2018. Within two years after the decision, the goal is to have more than 200 of the new amphibious assault vehicles to join the force.",

            "article_content": "In this Jan. 7, 2016, file photo, buildings at St. George's School sit on a hill in Middletown, R.I. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) PROVIDENCE, R.I.  \u2013 An Episcopal diocese in Florida says it is investigating a former headmaster at the elite Rhode Island boarding school St. George's, which is at the center of an abuse scandal. The Rev. George E. Andrews is accused of failing to report sexual abuse by a teacher to authorities when he led the school in the 1980s. He now runs a consulting firm that places chaplains at Episcopal and other schools. His son-in-law is the Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, and his daughter sits on the St. George's board. The Diocese of Southeast Florida opened an investigation into Andrews earlier this year after news broke that dozens of students had been abused at the $58,000-per-year school in Middletown. The church investigation was put on hold while police and independent investigator Martin Murphy looked into St. George's, according to Bishop Peter Eaton of the Diocese of Southeast Florida. Police brought no charges, but last week the independent investigator released a 390-page report that detailed decades of abuse by multiple teachers, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s. According to the report, Andrews, headmaster from 1984 to 1988, fired a choirmaster for inappropriate sexual contact with a student. The investigator found that Andrews, on the advice of a school lawyer, never reported the abuse to authorities. It also concluded that under Rhode Island's reporting laws, his inaction didn't appear to break the law. However, the investigation found Andrews was apparently aware that the dean of students provided a positive job recommendation for the choirmaster to another school. When Andrews announced the choirmaster's departure, he told the school the man had quit and that \"we will feel his separation deeply.\" Andrews told investigators that looking at the remarks today made him ill to his stomach. Eaton told The Associated Press in an email that the diocese was carefully reviewing the independent report. He wouldn't comment further until the completion of the church investigation and said he could not provide a date for when it would be complete. Andrews' lawyer, Michael J. Connolly, said his client relied on lawyers' advice, did not authorize any positive job reference and was unaware of the scale of the abuse. More than a dozen former students told the independent investigator the choirmaster abused them. \"Does he regret what happened? Does he wish he had done more? Of course he does. He is sickened by what he read in that report,\" Connolly said. \"Clearly, not enough was done, but most of the information in the Murphy report was not known to Rev. Andrews or his staff.\" Eric MacLeish, who represents dozens of people abused at St. George's, said Andrews didn't do enough. \"This man is an Episcopal minister. You've got to do more, and more didn't happen,\" he said. \"Maybe somebody got hurt because of this.\" Some of the abuse victims would like to meet with Andrews and others to engage in a process of \"truth and reconciliation,\" MacLeish said. Andrews' lawyer said Andrews would be happy to meet with victims.",

            "article_content": "Ailes says Gretchen Carlson's allegations are 'false' and retaliation for the network's decision not to renew her contract Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes responded forcefully Wednesday night to a lawsuit filed by Gretchen Carlson after her contract was not renewed as a daytime host at the network, calling the allegations \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d In the wake of Carlson\u2019s suit against Ailes, which alleged sexual harassment and wrongful termination, the network\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said it had launched an internal review of conduct by Ailes and by Steve Doocy, Carlson\u2019s former co-host on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d The statement said the company has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Ailes and Doocy. Carlson\u2019s hosting of \u201cThe Real Story\u201d ended on June 23, when her contract expired, which had not been made public until now. The salacious nature of the lawsuit, filed in Bergen County, N.J., generated immediate headlines online. Carlson alleged that Ailes made comments about her physical appearance, and once told her that he would pick her to be stranded with on a desert island and that they should have had a sexual relationship long ago. Ailes said in his personal statement: \u201cGretchen Carlson\u2019s allegations are false. This is a retaliatory suit for the network\u2019s decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup. When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit.\u201d The Carlson suit also alleged that Doocy \u201chad created a hostile work environment by regularly treating her in a condescending and sexist way.\u201d The suit says Ailes responded to her 2009 complaint to a supervisor by telling her to learn to \u201cget along with the boys.\u201d While the lawsuit is based in part on alleged comments by Ailes in private conversations with Carlson, it provides no e-mail, texts or voice mail as evidence. Carlson says in the suit that Ailes limited her opportunities at the network and did little to promote her career. When she was taken off \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in 2013, Ailes created the 2 p.m. show and installed her as solo anchor. \u201cIronically,\u201d Ailes says in his statement, \u201cFox News provided her with more on-air opportunities over her 11-year tenure than any other employer in the industry, for which she thanked me in her recent book. This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously.\u201d When the new program was announced, Carlson said: \u201cI am thrilled that Roger Ailes has given me the opportunity to host a signature show for Fox that will focus on the real stories of the day.\u201d In her book \u201cGetting Real,\u201d published last year, Carlson called Ailes \u201cthe most accessible boss I\u2019ve ever worked for,\u201d and said \u201che saw Fox as a big family, and he cared about everything we did.\u201d She said he had even urged her to speak occasionally about having been Miss America in 1989. The former host said in her own statement that she has \u201cstrived to empower women and girls throughout my entire career. Although this was a difficult step to take, I had to stand up for myself and speak out for all women and the next generation of women in the workplace.\" In her book, Carlson wrote of her time on the morning show with Doocy and Brian Kilmeade, \u201cI teasingly called Steve and Brian my \u2018work husbands\u2019 because I spent more time with them than I did with Casey.\u201d She is married to sports agent and former pro baseball player Casey Close. In describing her success, Carlson says in the suit that her daytime show consistently ranked first in its time slot. But it is also true that she lost to CNN more often than any other Fox News program. The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for the decision not to renew her contract.",

Police in Milwaukee say a black man whose killing by police touched off arson and rock-throwing was shot by a black officer after turning toward him with a gun in his hand. Wisconsin's governor, meanwhile, has put the National Guard on standby in case of more violence Sunday night. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps) (The Associated Press) MILWAUKEE \u2013 The man whose shooting by Milwaukee police triggered hours of violent protests on the city's predominantly black north side was a 23-year-old black man and father to a toddler, his mother said Sunday. Mildred Haynes told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/2aW6oE6 ) that her son, Sylville Smith, was killed by police Saturday. A Milwaukee police spokesman did not immediately respond to messages from an Associated Press reporter seeking confirmation of the man's identity. A distraught Haynes told the newspaper that police have told her little about her son's death. \"My son is gone due to the police killing my son,\" she said Sunday. \"I am lost.\" Police say a man fled during a Saturday traffic stop and that he was carrying a weapon. It's unclear whether he pointed the gun at officers before being shot several times. Smith was accused in a shooting last year and charged with recklessly endangering safety, a felony. Smith was subsequently accused of pressuring the victim to recant statements that identified him as the gunman and was charged with trying to intimidate a witness, he newspaper reported. It's unclear why both charges were dropped. He also pleaded guilty to carrying a concealed weapon in 2014. Smith was cited for driving without a license or insurance, speeding and driving with open intoxicants earlier this year. Court records identify Smith as black. Smith's death sparked explosive protests in northern Milwaukee, a town of 600,000 where roughly 40 percent of residents are black. At least four businesses were burned down in the protests that stretched into Sunday morning, leading Gov. Scott Walker to activate National Guard troops in case violence persists.",

            "article_content": "Judge Napolitano reacts to the latest report The long-awaited House committee report on the 2012 Benghazi attacks revealed a striking irony: In the end, the forces that came to evacuate State Department and CIA officers that night were not fellow Americans, but a secret unit of former military officers from the Qaddafi regime that Washington \u2013 and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2013 had helped overthrow. Their intervention, according to the report, likely saved \u201cover two dozen lives.\u201d \u201cIn other words, some of the very individuals the United States had helped remove from power during the Libyan revolution were the only Libyans that came to the assistance of the United States on the night of the Benghazi attacks,\u201d the report said. The detail was one of numerous revelations in the expansive report released Tuesday by the Republican-led committee. While Democrats and Republicans on and off the committee sparred over the group\u2019s work and the political implications for Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, one detail seemed indisputable: U.S. forces from outside Libya did not deploy to Benghazi that night. Not only that, the report said, but neither the sitting Libyan government \u201cthe State Department had worked tirelessly to appease\u201d nor the militia contracted to provide security was able to evacuate Americans under fire at the annex. Instead, the massive convoy that came to rescue Americans the morning after the attack began was sent by a group called Libyan Military Intelligence. CLICK TO READ THE REPORT. The CIA did not know that unit existed, but it apparently was made up of former Qaddafi military officers who had \u201cgone into hiding\u201d for fear of assassination. The report described how one unnamed CIA officer helped arrange for the evacuation, after being put in touch with the secret group by a Libyan official. The group sent a heavily armed convoy to take the American personnel to the airport, and to safety. The report stated: \u201cThis group, ironically, had close ties to the former Qadhafi regime\u2014the very regime the United States had helped remove from power. It was also this group, not groups previously given credit by previous investigations, that came to the rescue of the Americans in those early morning hours \u2014 likely saving dozens of lives as a result.\u201d Committee member Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., highlighted this detail, during a press conference Tuesday morning with other Republican members. \u201cAt the end of the day, no military assets were ever moving toward Benghazi,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for the bravery of a few Americans and the unexpected response of Qaddafi\u2019s underground militia \u2026 there would have been an even greater loss of life that night.\u201d The report, more broadly, described a disconnect between the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d response at upper levels and in Washington, and the urgent response on the ground that night. The report said despite orders from President Obama and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to deploy, the first military force did not do so until more than 13 hours after the attack started. The report said one anti-terrorism security team known as the FAST unit sat waiting for three hours in Rota, Spain, as Marines changed \u201cin and out of their uniforms four times,\u201d and even debated whether they should carry personal weapons, according to one witness. All together, the report said, \u201cit would take nearly 18 hours\u201d for that team to move. In the end, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans -- foreign service officer Sean Smith and former Navy Seals Ty Woods and Glen Doherty -- were killed in the attacks. Democrats have long slammed the committee\u2019s work as partisan, and Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon repeated that charge Tuesday. \u201cFar from honoring the four brave Americans who died, the Benghazi Committee has been a partisan sham since its start,\u201d he tweeted. State Department spokesman Mark Toner defended the department in a written statement issued shortly before the report\u2019s formal release, while saying the \u201cessential facts\u201d surrounding the attacks have been known \u201cfor some time.\u201d \u201cWe have made great progress towards making our posts safer since 2012,\u201d Toner said. \u201c\u2026 Our implementation efforts include work to expand the corps of Diplomatic Security personnel, enhance interagency coordination to address threat information, expand the Marine Security Guard program, and accelerate projects to build and upgrade secure facilities.\u201d He said the department \u201ccooperated extensively with the Select Committee,\u201d providing over 50 current and former employees for interviews and over 100,000 pages of documents.",

(AP) Machado, who a judge once accused of trying to kill him, may not see anything about Melania, but viewers saw a lot more of the ex-Miss Universe when The Sun revealed video on Thursday showing Machado having sex with a male contestant on a Spanish reality show in 2005. While on the \u201cBig Brother\u201d-styled \u201cThe Farm,\u201d Machado was caught on night vision cameras apparently having sex with a male contestant and using strong language to narrate their explicit encounter. Machado was engaged to then-Philadelphia Phillies star Bobby Abreu at the time of the indiscretion. Abreu and Machado soon broke up. \u201cIt was a very strong experience, very difficult in all senses, and I feel very happy with the events in Spain,\u201d Machado told Univision after the show had ended. \u201cI had people\u2019s support once more and I gained respect for what I am as a person and that was the purpose.\u201d She added: \u201cWhen you do a reality show, it\u2019s just that \u2013 a show of reality.\u201d Also emerging was video of Trump and Machado discussing Machado's weight in 1997, a link to which was tweeted Wednesday by a Washington Post reporter. Near the end of the clip, Trump mocks the physical appearance of several reporters, to which Machado laughs and gives a thumbs up.

Francisco Antonio Sbert Mousko was shot outside a church in Caracas\u00a0where his wife -- Rodriguez's sister -- was being eulogized. Sbert reportedly suffered brain damage from the attack.

In a press conference Police Chief David Brown explained that the robot was deployed on the second floor of El Centro College in downtown Dallas following a standoff early Friday. \u201cWe cornered one suspect and we tried to negotiate for several hours - negotiations broke down, we had an exchange of gunfire with the suspect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,\u201d he said. Brown explained that \u201cother options\u201d would have exposed the police officers to great danger. The police chief confirmed that the suspect was killed by the bomb\u2019s detonation, noting that reports the suspect killed himself were inaccurate. Specific details of the robot used by Dallas Police have not been released. The Dallas Police\u2019s deployment of its bomb robot Friday is the first time that a police force has used the technology to kill a suspect, according to defense expert Peter Singer. In a tweet, Singer noted that the MARCbot machine, which is designed to tackle bombs such as IEDs, has been used as a weapon in Iraq. Yes, this is 1st use of robot in this way in policing. Marcbot has been ad hoc used this way by troops in Iraq. https://t.co/FfrsgLS2x1 The Dallas Police Department has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story from FoxNews.com. Police consultant and retired L.A.P.D Lieutenant Raymond Foster told FoxNews.com that he is not aware of any robot bombs in the possession of law enforcement. \u201cI suspect [Dallas Police] used their bomb robot in some improvised manner,\u201d he added. In his press conference, Brown praised the work done by the police negotiator during the standoff before the bomb robot was sent in. \u201cOur hostage negotiator did an exceptional job getting this suspect to talk before he died, during the hours of negotiation that eventually broke down,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Epstein, (l.), and Clinton, (r.), flew dozens of times on the billionaire's jet, dubbed \"The Lolita Express.\" Attorneys for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein touted his close friendship with Bill Clinton and even claimed the billionaire helped start Clinton's controversial family foundation in a 2007 letter aimed at boosting his image during plea negotiations, FoxNews.com has learned. The 23-page letter, written by high-powered lawyers Alan Dershowitz and Gerald Lefcourt, was apparently part of an ultimately successful bid to negotiate a plea deal before Epstein could be tried for using underage girls in a sex ring based in Palm Beach, Fla., and his private island estate\u00a0on the 72-acre Virgin Islands home dubbed \u201cOrgy Island.\u201d\u00a0Epstein spent 13 months in prison and home detention after agreeing to a plea deal\u00a0in which he admitted to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. \"Mr. Epstein was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d read the July 2007 letter to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Florida. \u201cFocuses of this initiative include poverty, climate change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts.\u201d (Excerpt from letter Epstein's lawyers sent to federal prosecutors while negotiating plea deal.) The hedge fund magnate\u2019s true role in creating the foundation could not be confirmed. Whether Epstein was an actual founder of the foundation or exaggerated his role in a phony effort to appear altruistic is not clear. Epstein is not cited in official paperwork filed by the Clinton Global Initiative as a founder or director. Neither The Clinton Foundation nor Dershowitz responded to FoxNews.com\u2019s inquiry as to the extent of Epstein\u2019s involvement.\u00a0FoxNews.com first reported that flight logs show the former president flew on Epstein\u2019s private plane\u00a0dozens of times. But Clinton has publicly credited longtime assistant Doug Band, now counselor and director of the foundation, as conceiving of the idea. The foundation has raised hundreds of millions of dollars, ostensibly for charitable works in places such as Haiti and Africa. But questions have arisen about how much of the donations actually went to aiding the poor, and critics have accused the Clintons of using it as a slush fund. Flight logs show Clinton flew on Epstein's private jet dozens of times Attorneys describe the foundation, which has undergone name changes since its formation in 2005, as designed \u201cto convene world leaders, forward-looking CEOs, and philanthropists to commit to take action on pressing global challenges.\u201d In an effort to emphasize Epstein\u2019s close ties to Clinton before he was sentenced, his lawyers also credited Epstein with \"hosting\" a trip to Africa in 2002 on his private Boeing 727 for the Clinton Global Initiative, which Clinton himself attended, along with actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Chris Tucker, and other celebrities, purportedly for an anti-AIDS and economic-development mission. \"In a feature article about Mr. Epstein in New Yorker magazine, former President Clinton aptly described Mr. Epstein as a 'committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of 21st century science,'\u201d Epstein\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cPresident Clinton reached this conclusion during a monthlong trip to Africa with Mr. Epstein, which Mr. Epstein hosted. The purpose of that trip was to increase AIDS awareness; to work toward a solution to the AIDS crisis; and to provide funding to reduce the costs of delivering medications to those inflicted with the disease.\" Epstein also has supported the Clinton Foundation financially, but that was not made public until two years ago when a whistle-blower released the names of the super-rich, including Epstein, who held Swiss accounts at the HSBC bank. Epstein's private getaway has been dubbed \"Orgy Island.\" (Google Earth images) The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained the data from the whistle-blower, documented $81 million being routed from HSBC Swiss accounts to The Clinton Foundation, including money from Epstein. Epstein had various accounts totaling $3.5 million, the investigative journalists group revealed and, in 2006, directed $25,000 to The Clinton Foundation. The close association between Epstein and Clinton is just one example of their personal and professional ties running much deeper than previously made public. A FoxNews.com investigation in May showed the former president was a frequent flier on Epstein\u2019s infamous jet, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express,\u201d which earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. Flight logs obtained exclusively by FoxNews.com show the former president taking at least 26 trips around the world aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights. Epstein and his attorneys have said in multiple court filings that he has been the subject of the \u201cmost outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.\u201d However, hundreds of pages of court records, including reports from law enforcement, reviewed by FoxNews.com, show Epstein was under close scrutiny by the Palm Beach police and FBI for more than a year. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up. On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators. In a highly unusual civil lawsuit, Florida attorney Brad Edwards, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who represented some of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, are suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned, so that Epstein could potentially face additional criminal charges.",

            "article_content": "Former White House staffer recalls violent fights, Hillary's 'Jekyll and Hyde' personality An ex-Secret Service officer's forthcoming book on Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reportedly claims she has a \u201cvolcanic\u201d leadership style and lacks the \"temperament\" to hold office -- the same charge the candidate leveled last week at Donald Trump. The book, \u201cCrisis of Character,\u201d is due to be released June 28 \u2013 a month before Clinton is likely to take the stage to accept the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia. Written by ex-Secret Service Officer Gary J. Byrne, who was \u201cposted directly outside President Clinton\u2019s Oval Office,\u201d the 285-page book paints Clinton as disdainful of rules and erratic in her personality. While some extracts have already been released on the Amazon.com preview page, the New York Post reported Monday that Byrne claims Clinton is too \u201cerratic, uncontrollable and occasionally violent\u201d to become commander-in-chief. Byrne describes Clinton as switching quickly from friendly to angry in a moment, and repeatedly screaming obscenities at her husband, the Secret Service and White House staffers. Secret Service agents even had to consider what to do in case the first lady attacked the president physically, Byrne claims. \u201cHillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,\u201d Byrne wrote, according to the Post. \u201cFrom the bottom of my soul I know this to be true. And with Hillary\u2019s latest rise, I realize that her own leadership style \u2014 volcanic, impulsive, enabled by sycophants, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d Incidentally, Clinton last week accused presumptive Republican nominee Trump of being \"temperamentally unfit\" for office. In the Amazon preview of the book, Byrne recalled an alleged fight between the first couple during the summer of 1995 in Chapter 1, \u201cThe Vase.\u201d Byrne said a vase was smashed during the loud argument and the next morning President Clinton sported \u201ca shiner, a real, put-a-steak-on-it black eye.\u201d Clinton\u2019s personal scheduler Nancy Hernreich allegedly told Byrne the eye condition was a result of Clinton\u2019s allergy to coffee. Clinton's critics say the book sheds light on the Clintons\u2019 character and suitability for office. \"It\u2019s about them having a separate set of rules or not having to follow the rules, and there are basic questions of character \u2026 in how they treated others and how they treated their colleagues,\u201d Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said Monday on Fox News. However, Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh, a former adviser to John Kerry, said it was an example of the negative 2016 campaign and would only play into the tactics of Trump. \"I think this book is just one more example of where this campaign is going, which is straight to the gutter,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cA really negative campaign is the bet Donald Trump is hoping for because it\u2019s the only one he can win, because people get turned off by truly negative campaigns.\u201d The Clinton campaign dismissed the book, telling the Post it belongs in the fantasy section of a store. \u201cGary Byrne joins the ranks of Ed Klein and other \u2018authors\u2019 in this latest in a long line of books attempting to cash in on the election cycle with their nonsense,\u201d spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. \u201cIt should be put in the fantasy section of the book store.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn\u2019t be drawn into commenting directly about the book. \u201cI'd think I'd reserve judgment about the wisdom of writing a book from such a perspective until I know more about the book,\u201d Earnest told reporters.",

Henderson, who is credited with eradicating smallpox worldwide, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, July 9, 2002. (REUTERS/Hyungwon Kang/File) Donald A. Henderson, who headed the World Health Organization vaccination effort that wiped out smallpox in 1977 and later became a U.S. bioterrorism expert, has died from complications following a hip fracture, officials said on Sunday. He was 87. The 1966-1977 smallpox program at first was given little chance of succeeding. It required the development of labs around the world to produce vaccines, a constant scramble for funding, arm-twisting of governments to join in, and halting outbreaks as soon as they emerged by focusing on vaccinating people who came in contact with those infected, Henderson told the WHO. \"The most important legacy of smallpox eradication was its demonstration of how many people could be protected through vaccination, so rapidly and inexpensively with a well planned program and quality-control monitoring,\" the man known as \"D.A.,\" said in an interview published by the World Health Organization a few years ago. Smallpox is a highly infectious virus that kills 30 percent of its victims and scars the rest for life. In 1972, he flew to Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia to help stamp out the last smallpox outbreak in Europe, the WHO said. After the campaign to wipe out the disease, Henderson became dean of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health from 1977 to 1990, expanding the school's reach and making it a national leader in addressing HIV/AIDS, said Michael Klag, dean of the school. \"D.A. was a force of nature who, until relatively recently, seemed invulnerable. Public health has lost a hero,\" Klag wrote adding, smallpox is the only human disease ever to have been eradicated. In 2001, Henderson was named by then U.S. President George W. Bush to head a newly formed Office of Public Health Preparedness, set up to coordinate the national response to public health emergencies, including a spate of anthrax attacks that took place at the end of that year. In 2002, he received the nation's highest civilian honor when he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Henderson died on Friday at a Baltimore-area hospice, officials said.",

            "article_content": "(Lincoln) Lincoln would like you to step aboard new SUV. Literally. The Lincoln Navigator Concept unveiled at the 2016 New York Auto Show has the attention-getting combination of giant gullwing doors and a three-step staircase to help you enter the high-riding truck. Fantastic flourishes aside, Lincoln says the concept is otherwise a good indicator of what the next-generation Navigator will look like when it goes on sale in a year or so with conventional portals. The three-row SUV features the new face of Lincoln, shared with the latest MKZ and Continental sedan, which includes a rounded rectangular grille. From there, Lincoln says the Navigator\u2019s design is, fittingly, inspired by the world of luxury boating. This includes its swept-back style, sea-colored paint, and teak and white interior trim. The cabin is outfitted for six-passengers, each getting a 30-way adjustable seat. A flow-through console splits all three rows, while all four rear seating positions get Wi-Fi-equipped touchscreen entertainment systems. Behind them in the cargo hold is a shipshape \"gear and wardrobe management system.\" Lincoln hasn\u2019t detailed all of the mechanical specifications for the Navigator, but it appears to be a truck-based SUV like the current one. Whether or not it uses aluminum bodywork like the Ford F-150 pickup is yet to be revealed. What has been is its 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 engine with over 400 horsepower and adjustable suspension system. Safety technology includes collision avoidance technology, lane-keeping and parking assist systems, and a 360-degree camera to help you, well, navigate through tight spots. Introduced in 1997, the Navigator was the first large luxury SUV, but was soon eclipsed by the Cadillac Escalade, which outsold it by more than 3 to 1 in 2015. Although those doors won\u2019t make production, much of the rest of what you see on the Navigator Concept will. Keep an eye out for the new land yacht cruising in from the horizon, likely at Next January\u2019s Detroit Auto Show.",

No, this isn\u2019t the concept Mercedes is\u00a0bringing to the 2016 Paris auto show\u00a0to preview its much-hyped Tesla Motors rival. Rather, it\u2019s a preview of the automaker\u2019s plans for its future vans. It also hints at the design of the\u00a0next-generation Sprinter due out around 2018. The concept is called the Mercedes-Benz Vision Van, and it's part of a greater strategy called adVANce that Mercedes\u2019 commercial vehicles unit is undertaking to expand beyond simply being a manufacturer of vans. It wants to become a supplier of \u201cholistic\u201d system solutions for the delivery of goods, including in the digital realm. The Vision Van is powered by an electric drive system delivering 100 horsepower, with its zero emissions allowing it into cities that one day may ban vehicles that pollute. Lithium-ion batteries are stored in the floor and provide a range of approximately 165 miles. To make the task of delivering goods more efficient for the driver, the concept features innovative algorithms that control order picking, the loading of packages, cargo space management, and ideal delivery routes. Back at the logistics center, packages for delivery are automatically selected and loaded into the vans using special racking systems. More news from Motor Authority According to Mercedes, the combination of the software and automated tasks leads to significantly reduced delivery times for packages. In fact, Volker Mornhinweg, head of Mercedes\u2019 commercial vehicles unit, estimates that the technology would enable an increase in productivity of up to 50\u00a0percent for delivery services. One interesting element is the use of drones to pick up and deliver packages.

When the World Heritage site we know as the Alamo opened in San Antonio as the Mission San Antonio de Valero, it wasn't the first iteration of the mission. Archeologists now think it was initially founded at a different site in 1718, then moved about a mile away from 1719 until 1724, when a hurricane forced the mission to move a final time. And the researchers also believe that the earliest Alamo predecessor has been found. A three-year investigation at a parking lot, field, and courtyard owned by San Antonio's Christopher Columbus Italian Society has turned up artifacts that link the site to the mission, including pottery fragments, beads, hand-made nails, stone flakes, gun flints, colonial glass, and a grinding stone possibly dating to the early 18th century, reports the San Antonio Express-News. More From Newser: People Have Killed to Get Their Hands on This Fish Some artifacts were even lying visible on the ground. \"I looked down and started seeing the metal and I literally, really, I just had to sit down on the ground because I was like, 'This is too incredible,'\" archaeologist Kay Hindes tells News 4 San Antonio. Topography and written records also suggest the original mission was located in the vicinity of the site. However, archaeologists couldn't definitively prove the site was the original. \"What is missing from the site to confirm it 100% would be shreds of Puebla polychrome or San Luis polychrome, that we know in Texas those types of ceramics are not found on sites that postdate 1725,\" Hindes tells Texas Public Radio. But as \"the site has been greatly impacted by 300 years worth of occupation and construction,\" Hindes notes, \"the fact that we've found anything is truly miraculous.\" (This iconic Alamo letter recently returned home.)

According to WAOW-TV, Michael Biadasz, 29, was found by other farmers early Monday when they arrived at Biadasz Farms near Amherst to haul away manure from the football field-sized tanker. Portage County Coroner Scott Rifleman said that the deaths of Biadasz and at least 16 cows are under investigation, but that they were probably overcome by methane or sulfur oxide. Rifleman said the farmer agitated the tank and that this, along with warm upper air temperatures, created a deadly dome of air. Bob Biadasz, the farm\u2019s co-owner, told WAOW-TV that the tragedy only occurred because of unusual weather conditions which created \u201cperfect storm.\u201d Other cows were also sickened by the fumes.

            "article_content": "In this photo provided by Adam Allington, taken June 18, 2016, shows Margaret Anderson. During their working years, women tend to earn less than men, and when they retire, they're more likely to live in poverty. (Adam Allington via AP) During their working years, women tend to earn less than men, and when they retire, they're more likely to live in poverty. These are women who raised children and cared for sick and elderly family members, often taking what savings and income they had and spending it on things besides their own retirement security. The National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit research center, reports that women are 80 percent more likely than men to be impoverished at age 65 and older. Women age 75 to 79 are three times more likely. While experts cite a pay gap as a major cause for retirement insecurity, other factors play a role, from single parenthood and divorce to the fact that women typically live longer than men. For Marsha Hall, 60, the process of trying to save for retirement has been nearly impossible. \"I've had jobs that included a 401(k) and I was able to put some money aside, every month,\" she says.\u00a0 \"But then I would get laid off and have to cash out the 401(k) to have money to live on.\" Born and raised in Detroit, Hall is divorced and doesn't have any children. She works part time as a file clerk. She and her siblings pitch in to care for their 75-year old mother. Hall says she tries not to think about what her situation will be like at that age. \"My bills are current, I have food,\" she says, \"but I'm still living paycheck to paycheck, if it wasn't for Section 8 (a housing subsidy), I don't know where I'd be living.\" Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the National Women's Law Center, says \"the solution to the retirement (funding) crisis starts with the earnings and wage gap.\" That gap narrowed between the 1970s and 1990s, but stopped shrinking in 2001. Women earn about 76 cents to 79 cents on the dollar, compared with men. Women are more likely to report that Social Security is the biggest source of income \u2014 50 percent to 38 percent for men, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Women are 14 percentage points less likely to say they will receive a pension. Entmacher says women are more likely to take on caregiving responsibilities, which increases the likelihood they will end up working part-time jobs, often for lower wages, and without benefits such as pensions, sick leave and health care. \"The bulk of stay-at-home moms are not these high income, well-educated women that you read about,\" she says. Over a 40-year career, the pay gap between men and women adds up to an average of $430,480, according to the Census Bureau. For minorities and women of color, the number is much higher. \"If we are talking about a 65-year-old black woman, she was born before desegregation,\" says Karen Lincoln, a professor at the University of Southern California and director of a center for geriatric social work. \"This has a huge impact on things like the quality of education they receive, the employment opportunities available to them, and their ability to accumulate wealth,\" Lincoln says. Lincoln points to additional census data showing African-American women are paid 64 percent of what white men get, compared with 54 percent for Hispanic and Latina women. In addition to making less, women are much more likely to be single parents, putting additional economic strains on them.\u00a0In 2013, almost 83 percent of custodial parents were mothers, according to the census. Starting with the Johnson administration's \"War on Poverty\" in 1964, and the creation of safety-net programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, poverty rates among both men and women have been falling steadily. In 1966 the percentage of women over 65 living below the federal poverty line stood at 32 percent, compared with 12.1 percent in 2014. For men over 65, the numbers are 23.5 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Yet some analysts say the poverty rate is a poor gauge to assess the quality of life for aging seniors. \"The poverty rate is a deceptive number, it doesn't reflect the money they (men and women) need to actually exist,\" says Jennifer Brown, manager of research at the National Institute on Retirement Security. Brown says that increasing life spans mean a woman in the United States today will live five years longer than the average man, and about four years longer than her grandmother. \"Those increases in longevity come with huge increases in medical costs,\" Brown says. \"Especially if you're talking about things like long-term care or treatment for mental disabilities such as dementia and Alzheimer's.\" Medicare does not cover long-term care. To get some subsidized coverage, seniors would need to spend down their assets to qualify for Medicaid or have a long-term care insurance policy. In 2016, the census poverty threshold for a single person is $11,880. According to UCLA's Elder Index, a measure of the cost for housing, food, transport and health care, for a 65-year-old renter shows that the base cost for these needs is $24,024 and growing.",

            "article_content": "This recently restored home of Mary Thompson in Gettysburg, Pa., served as Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s headquarters at Gettysburg, seen Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016. Over the decades, the stone house and grounds that served as Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's headquarters at Gettysburg sprouted a motel, restaurant and other modern structures that dismayed preservationists and Civil War buffs keen on historic authenticity. Now, after a $6 million restoration that erased decades of development at the 4-acre site, the property looks much as it did in July 1863, when Lee suffered defeat in a bloody three-day battle that turned the tide of the war. \"If Robert E. Lee would ride up tomorrow, he would recognize his headquarters. And for over 100 years that wasn't the case,\" said James Lighthizer, president of Civil War Trust, the nonprofit that bought the house and grounds from private owners and completed the restoration. On Friday, more than 600 people are expected at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the site, which now includes a walking trail and interpretive signage. Plans call for the property to be turned over to the National Park Service. The area around the circa-1830s house was the scene of heavy fighting on the battle's first day, and its strategic location atop Seminary Ridge made it an ideal spot for Lee's battlefield headquarters. \"He's dictating and writing a lot of orders, he's using that as a base from which to observe the enemy, and he is responding to crises and events as they occur,\" said Garry Adelman, Civil War Trust's director of history and education. The longtime occupant, a widow named Mary Thompson, is believed to have remained in the home during the battle, and lived there until her death in 1873. The home was left out of Gettysburg National Military Park, then gutted by fire in the late 1890s. By 1921, it had become General Lee's Headquarters Museum, a commercial venture that transformed the surrounding property. \"Without question, this was one of the most important unprotected historic buildings in America,\" Lighthizer said. Civil War Trust acquired the property in January 2015 after a fundraising effort that included major gifts, grants and smaller donations from more than 11,000 people. Workers removed dormers that were added to the home in the 1900s, replaced the roof, fixed the interior and demolished all modern buildings, including a Comfort Inn. The land was returned to its 1863 contours, and fencing installed to replicate what was there at the time. An apple orchard \u2014 another feature of the Civil War-era landscape \u2014 will be planted in the spring. \"It was by far the most complex restorative effort we've ever done, and nothing else is even close,\" Adelman said. With nearly all work complete, Gettysburg National Military Park plans to expand its boundaries to include Lee's headquarters. The park service will use the house for special programming and open it to the public several days a year, including around the battle's anniversary, similar to how it operates Union Gen. George Meade's headquarters. \"I think there were a lot of folks who are aficionados of Gettysburg who probably never expected to see Lee's headquarters in such a state of preservation,\" said Park Superintendent Ed Clark. \"Civil War Trust really has worked miracles.\" Lighthizer said it was a longtime imperative of the group. \"We're not the oldest democratic republic in the world by accident. We went through a lot of trials and tribulations, and this site marks one of the pivot points in how we remained a democracy, how we remained a unified nation,\" he said. \"And that story needs to be told.\"",

            "article_content": " While the Chevrolet Volt gets the headlines, and the Toyota Prius most of the sales, Mercedes-Benz has managed to leapfrog the competition and become the first automaker to put a next generation lithium-ion battery pack into a production hybrid. Score one for the inventors of the automobile. New technology aside, the Mercedes-Benz S400 is also the company\u2019s first hybrid of any type to make it into showrooms. For 2010, the entire S-Class lineup has been given a very minor refresh that includes a new grille, headlight clusters with flavor-of-the-day LED running lights, and new front and rear bumpers. The S400 shares in all of those updates and, aside from a couple of hybrid badges outside and in, the land yacht is indistinguishable from its S-Class brethren, unless you look under the hood. Even then, it's tough to tell the difference. Click here for a SLIDESHOW of the S400 The powertrain in the S400 is comprised of a 3.5 liter V6 engine, a 7-speed automatic transmission, and a small electric motor mounted between them. The hybrid battery itself is no larger than the 12-volt lead-acid type used to start conventional S-Class sedans, and fits into the same space in the engine bay where one of those is normally found. The hybrid system in the S400 is mild, which means it never operates in electric-only mode the way the one in the Toyota Prius does. Instead, the 20 horsepower electric motor assists the internal combustion engine under acceleration, and allows it to shut off whenever the vehicle comes to a rest and instantly restart when the driver steps on the erstwhile 'gas' pedal. The design trades maximum fuel efficiency for simplicity and lower cost, battery not included. The primary reason we haven't seen a hybrid with a lithium ion pack before is expense, so it's maybe not a surprise that the first one comes in a car with a price tag of $87,950, excluding a $1,150 green tax credit. Mercedes-Benz is hush hush on how much of that money goes towards the battery, but outside estimates range from $8,000 on up. The automaker is likely keeping the number under wraps in the hope that by the time the government mandated 8-10 year/100,000-150,000 warranty runs out, the replacement cost will be down to more palatable levels. Until then, the bottom line is that the S400 has an EPA rating of 19 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. No, those aren't headline-grabbing numbers, but they are impressive for a small battleship, and identical to the ones found on the window sticker of Mercedes-Benz's own E350 sedan, which is about 3/4 the size of the S400. Compared to the V8-powered standard bearer of the S-Class line, the S550, the S400 returns 15% percent better combined fuel economy, and 25% more miles in city driving. Away from the EPA labs, I found that 30 mpg wasn't just attainable, but often unavoidable. The S400 regularly hit that mark, even at highway speeds not normally associated with efficiency. Over the course of 600 miles of mixed driving, the car averaged an even 25 mpg, and I enjoyed every one of them. I'm still not exactly clear on what constitutes a plutocrat, but I know that I feel like one behind the wheel of an S-Class, even one with somwhat green credentials like the S400. The car is a rolling isolation chamber that wafts you along in a \"get out of my way I'm coming through\" sort of manner. The hybrid may be down on power compared to the S550, but with 295 hp and 284 lb-ft of torque, it's still about as quick as a Mazda Miata. If that's not satisfactory enough for you, fuel efficiency is probably not a priority of yours anyway. While it's not quite as nimble as a little roadster, the S400 is very composed, even on roads of the windy, two-lane sort. The air suspension keeps the sedan flat through turns, and flattens out any bumps in the road before they manage to disturb you. Most impressive is how unobtrusive the hybrid system goes about its business. The engine starts and stops with hardly a shudder, and there\u2019s no variation or funkiness in the power delivery at speed. The regenerative brakes, often the Achilles\u2019 Heel of hybrid systems, feel so normal that you\u2019d never notice a difference if you weren\u2019t looking for it very hard. The cabin of the 2010 S-Class sees even fewer modifications than the exterior. New ambient lighting and a Napa leather-covered steering wheel pretty much round out the changes. Navigation, lane departure warning, and massaging seats with active bolsters that squeeze you during paparazzi-evading maneuvers are among the usual luxury options available. Of course, the 900-pound gorilla that would fit nicely in the gargantuan back seat of the S400 is diesel, and why Mercedes-Benz didn't put an engine that burns it into the S-Class instead of the complicated and costly hybrid setup. Call it a hedge. Despite the widening use of the fuel German imports these days - Mercedes-Benz currently has four vehicles with diesel engines in its own lineup - and pump prices on par with gasoline, the U.S. still hasn't gotten over the oil-burning hump the way people in the old countries have. The good news is, we're not missing out on much. European market S350 diesels get 30.5 mpg in fuel economy testing over there, while the S400 is rated at 29 mpg on the same cycle. Click here for more auto news and reviews from FOX Car Report Although it's unlikely that the S400 will overtake the Toyota Prius as the best-selling hybrid in America, there's no reason that it shouldn't be the best-selling S-Class. The price makes it the most-affordable model in the lineup, and for those who buy them to sit in the back seat with that gorilla while being driven from one board meeting to another, performance hardly matters. In any case, the touch of green that comes with it, both in savings and image, should make up for any other inadequacies. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Mercedes-Benz S400 Hybrid Base Price: $87,950 Type: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 4-door sedan Powerplant: 3.5L V6 w/electric motor Power (net): 295 hp, 284 lb-ft torque Transmission: 7-speed automatic MPG: 19 city/26 hwy What do you think of the S400?

(Chevrolet) Chevrolet is entering the silent service. The automaker has built a hydrogen-powered truck for the U.S. Army that generates its own electricity with an onboard fuel cell. The heavily-modified Chevrolet Colorado-based rig is powered by a 174 horsepower electric motor that can drive all four wheels while making hardly any noise and keeping a low thermal profile compared to an internal combustion engine. Under the power dome hood of the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 fuel cell electric vehicle, the fuel cell system that has accumulated 3.1 million miles of real-world driving by civilian and military operators is ready for a year of extreme off-road testing as a U.S. Army demonstrator. General Motors and the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) revealed the vehicle at the fall meeting of the Association of U.S. Army show in Washington, D.C. on Monday (Oct. 3). (Chevrolet) Hydrogen tanks and a small battery are installed where the bed of the Colorado would normally be, along with a power-take-off unit that provides electricity for equipment in the field. Meanwhile, water emissions produced by the fuel cell\u2019s operation can be collected and used by troops for drinking, or keeping that mean bodywork clean in the driest of regions. Inside the rear hatch of the Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 fuel cell electric vehicle is an Electric Power Takeoff unit, capable of providing 25kw of consistent electric power away from the vehicle, such as remote locations where electric power may otherwise be unavailable. (Chevrolet) With its stealthy characteristics, lifted body, 37-inch tires, and an extreme off-road suspension, the ZH2 is envisioned as more as a patrol and reconnaissance vehicle than a replacement for a general purpose vehicle like the Humvee. Chevrolet The project is a collaborative effort between Chevrolet and the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, which will take delivery of the ZH2 in early 2017 before putting it through a year-long evaluation in a variety of environments. It builds on technology that General Motors originally developed for a fleet of hydrogen-powered Chevrolet Equinoxes that have been undergoing on road testing for nearly a decade.",

If the profanity-laced tweets that were sent out by Perry's account are anything to go by, it seems that the pop star's Twitter was hacked.

One particular tweet that mentioned Taylor Swift, for example, seemed like an olive branch intended to smooth the rift between the alleged foes. The message, which read \"miss u baby @taylorswift,\" was the most pleasant of the bunch. Could it be that the entire elaborate scheme was just a super-fan's attempt at restoring a long-lost friendship? In fact, one of the earliest tweets sent out during the breach may have even given away the hacker's identity. The post -- which contained another reference to Swift in the form of a play on the lyrics to her mega-hit Shake it Off -- stated \"haha follow @sw4ylol #hackersgonnahack.\" The same '@sw4ylol' Twitter profile previously tweeted an image of a takedown notice it received from Universal Music Group in regards to an attempt made to upload a Katy Perry song to SoundCloud, reports TechCrunch. The fact that the most followed account on Twitter fell victim to a hack is another example of how common the practice has become on social media.

The G-Class was originally designed for military use, but has been produced commercially since 1979, which makes it the oldest vehicle on sale in the United States. Over the years, what started as a relatively bare-bones machine has morphed into a high-end luxury SUV, with a starting price of $116,325. \u201cStarting\u201d being the operative word. That\u2019ll buy you an entry level G550, while the high performance G63 AMG goes for$138,057 before you add any options. But despite their lofty prices, they\u2019ve both sold so well that Mercedes is turning things up another notch with the introduction of the $218,825 G65 AMG. It has a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 that barely fits in the engine bay and churns out 621 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque, making it the most powerful SUV in the known universe. Nevertheless, it rides on solid front and rear axles, just like a Jeep Wrangler, and has three locking differentials for serious off-roading, if you don\u2019t mind scratching the available matte-finish paint. The hand-built G65 has been on sale in foreign markets for a couple of years, and Mercedes-Benz didn\u2019t originally plan to go through the expensive regulatory process to bring it to the United States, but interest from its customer base was so strong, it couldn\u2019t be denied. As increasingly strong and immortal as this truck seems to be, maybe they should think about changing its name to The Highlander. Oh, right, scratch that. (But not the paint, please.) ---------",

It's been the subject of a half-century-long debate. But thanks to a new mapping technique, mountain experts have identified the tallest mountain in the US Arctic and uncovered a bit of a surprise as well. Using fodar, a technique he invented to map terrain using airborne photography, glaciologist Matt Nolan created a high-resolution topographic map of the Brooks Range in Alaska, which reveals Mount Isto to be the tallest mountain in the US Arctic, standing 8,975 feet tall, reports Live Science. But though scientists have long thought that Mount Chamberlin, located about 30 miles away, was Isto's biggest competition, Nolan says it actually falls short of another peak. At 8,914 feet, Mount Hubley stands about 16 feet taller than Chamberlin, he explains in Cryosphere. Nolan was actually using fodar to observe glacier volume change when he realized he was flying over the highest mountains in the US Arctic\u2014only scientists couldn't decide which should wear the crown. That's when Nolan decided to put his technology to the test to find out. As he flew over the Brooks Range in a Cessna 170B equipped with a DSLR camera linked to a GPS unit, skier and mountaineer Kit DesLauriers climbed up and skied down the mountains with her own GPS unit, allowing the pair to chart elevations from the air and ground simultaneously to provide a \"measure of accuracy.\" The resulting maps are accurate to about 8 inches, according to a release. Nolan notes his technology is much like lidar but costs $30,000 rather than $500,000 and can measure coastal erosion, glacier melt, and landslides. \"The possibilities are truly unlimited,\" he says.

(Diane Diederich) The situation:\u00a0You've got a water glass in the bathroom, at your desk, and on your nightstand, which means you're chugging plenty of H2O\u00a0(high-five for hydration and props for passing on plastic!). But with all the focus on getting the recommended 8 cups a day, some of those glasses have gone unwashed for days\u2014you just keep dumping them out and filling them up. (Looking to take back control of your health?\u00a0Prevention\u00a0has smart answers\u2014get 2 FREE gifts when you subscribe today.) What you're worried about:\u00a0\"Microorganisms need a moist environment to survive, right? So not only have I created a perfect breeding ground\u00a0for bacteria, microbes, parasites, and who knows what, I've gone and ingested them, obviously setting myself up for any number of dreadful diseases.\" The very worst that could happen:\u00a0It's true that bacteria and other potentially dangerous microorganisms (think viruses and intestinal parasites) grow really well in moist environments. So yes, that unwashed glass is a\u00a0petri dish\u00a0of possibility. Every time you take a sip, you're transferring the microbes in your mouth to the glass. (Drinking H20 for weight loss? See how much weight one woman lost when she chugged 2 glasses of water before every meal for 2 weeks.) \"If you're ill and deposit a nasty bug in that glass and it doesn't dry properly before you use it again, there might be enough time for that bug to replicate enough to cause your illness again,\" said Aaron Margolin, PhD, a professor of microbiology at the University of New Hampshire. The source of the water you're sipping can also make a difference:\u00a0Unlike tap water, bottled\u00a0and well water don't automatically come with added chlorine\u00a0to help halt the growth of bacteria. And if it's a shared cup, look out! All those bacteria, viruses, and intestinal parasites passing back and forth could mean stomach ulcers (courtesy of\u00a0Helicobacter pylori\u00a0bacteria) or projectile vomiting and explosive diarrhea (courtesy of norovirus). \"The more people who use that same cup, the greater the probability that one of those people carry bacteria that might make you sick,\" Margolin warned. (Speaking of gross: Here are the 8 germiest public places you touch.) What will probably happen:\u00a0A whole lotta nothing, especially if you're the only one using the glass. \"It's important to mention that\u00a0pathogens\u2014those organisms that make you sick\u2014don't just appear out of nowhere; they have to be introduced by someone or something,\" Margolin said. The fact that it's a glass, not a plastic cup, means it won't degrade over time, creating nooks and crannies where bacteria\u00a0can build up. Plus, glass is more likely to completely dry, and drying, also known as desiccation, is an excellent way to halt the growth of bacteria, Margolin added. What's more, if you're filling up with tap water, most treatment plants use chlorine to zap dangerous contaminants that work both on the water and your saliva. (Still drinking soda? Check out these 7 gross side effects of diet soda.) Bottom line:\u00a0\"If you restrict the usage of the cup to a single individual and you make sure that the water is clean, then you are not going to get sick if you use the same cup over and over,\" Margolin said.

A man who lost his wife in the deadly tornadoes that struck Illinois last week received a lift Saturday after his missing dog was found safe. Clem Schultz's dog Missy, a white German shepherd, disappeared during the tornado Thursday that killed Clem's wife, Geraldine, and destroyed the couple's Fairdale home. On Saturday, an electric utility worker surveying debris spotted the dog in a field and alerted police, who then tracked down the family, NBC Chicago reports. Tyler Rowan, the grandson of Clem Schultz, said the dog -- apparently still traumatized by the storm --\u00a0ran away from everyone for 2.5 miles until they were able to catch up with her. Since then, Clem hasn\u2019t let go of the dog, Rowan told the station. \u201cWe are all happy she is home!\u201d read a post on a Facebook page set up in the search for the dog. Another Facebook page -- Fairdale and Rochelle Illinois Pet Recovery \u2013 has also been set up to assist families whose pets are missing after the tornado. Hundreds of volunteers descended on Fairdale and Rochelle Sunday to assist in recovery efforts. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people, including Geraldine Schultz, were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people and damaged or destroyed dozens of buildings. About 900 volunteers removed debris and helped victims search the debris for personal items that would help them rebuild their lives. In nearby Rochelle, nearly 700 volunteers helped in cleanup efforts. The volunteers came from as far away as Missouri and Ohio. Along with helping residents sift through debris, they brought dogs to provide comfort. Forecasters say the storm had winds of up to 200 mph, was a half-mile wide and was on the ground for nearly 29 miles. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(Santa Fe Police Department) A New Mexico judge has issued an arrest warrant for a suspect in a major jewelry heist at a store in Santa Fe\u2019s historic downtown plaza. More than $1 million in jewelry was stolen from Diva Diamonds & Jewels on Nov. 27 as crowds gathered outside for a Christmas tree-lighting festival. Luis Villabla Boca-Negra, 45, is wanted in connection with the Black Friday theft. He is already on probation in New Mexico for stealing a ring from another jewelry store in the same vicinity, according to Santa Fe Police Lt. Michele Williams. Boca-Negra is described as a 5-foot-9 male, weighing about 170 pounds with brown eyes and black hair. Williams said investigators fear the suspect may have fled the state. Santa Fe Police said Tuesday that police were looking for two more suspects in addition to Boca-Negra. Police said the trio took 11 items while employees were busy with other customers. The owner, Ala Shawabkeh, said he didn\u2019t know the items were gone until later. The two other suspects have not been named. Shawabkeh \u2013 also known as Mark Shaw \u2013 was previously raided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife in late October for selling counterfeit Native American jewelry, according to the Albuquerque Journal.

At present the Russian government uses foreign vehicles, most of which come from Germany. Recently, the Russian Ministry for Industry and Trade hosted an event where several concepts were revealed. Photos from the event, posted on the Russian government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta, reveal some of the concepts which include a limousine, SUV and van. Involved in the project are Russian automakers Sollers, GAZ, KAMAZ and ZiL. The vehicles are to be based on a common platform, which will be engineered in Russia and use Russian-made parts but will also be developed with some outside help led by Porsche Engineering. It is hoped the first working prototypes will be ready by next year, with production to start in 2017 following a rigorous testing program. Only about 5 percent of the planned production is expected to be utilized by the government, with the rest sold to the public. The SUV is expected to be the most popular, with estimates of 40,000 units being produced, though it\u2019s not clear if this is an annual figure or total production.

He sits down with Fox\u2019s Julie Banderas to share what he discovered Robert Herjavec is best known for spotting the next big\u00a0business idea as one of the sharks on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\u201d but recently he set out to discover a different set of innovative ideas. \u201cMy mom passed away from ovarian cancer in 2007, and it was really a hard time,\u201d Herjavec told FoxNews.com. \u201cAnd so this was a chance to get involved with technology that can aid oncology and patient care.\u201d It was through caring for his mother that Herjavec decided to partner with Astellas Oncology and become a judge for their C3Prize program, a contest designed to inspire novel, non-medicine ideas to improve cancer care for patients. In September 2016 at the Stanford Medicine X conference, five finalists were selected to pitch their ideas to Herjavec and a panel of experts. \u201cWe saw everything from a ride-sharing program for people with cancer to a light source product, so there was a lot of stuff that really made people\u2019s lives easier,\u201d Herjavec said. One of the first prize winners, Larry Pederson, of Seattle, Washington, co-founded The Litebook Company, which created a light technology to help patients suffering from exhaustion. \u201cWhen you go through chemotherapy, you get highly fatigued, and it changes your mood and depression,\u201d Herjavec said. \u201cYou hold [the Litebook] to the side of your head, and it gives you radiation and light, and it helps with fatigue, and there\u2019s actually a commercial application of it for jet lag.\u201d Diane Jooris, of Brussels, Belgium, was selected as the grand prize winner. She is the co-founder of Oncomfort, a company that designs virtual reality programs to help pediatric cancer patients manage stress and anxiety before, during and after their treatments. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a child to envision how chemotherapy works into the body,\u201d Jooris told FoxNews.com. \u201cSo the goal of one of our models is really to show to the kids what happens to the body\u2014 so it de-traumatizes chemotherapy, makes them feel part of the therapy and they\u2019re having fun.\u201d The virtual reality program is viewed through goggles to show kids in a game-like format what cancer is and how the treatment will work. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that has been designed to help them visualize what happens with chemotherapy through the treatment. So they navigate through the blood vessels, and they send chemo juice to the cancer cells, so they are destroying cancer cells, not the healthy cells,\u201d Jooris explained. Jooris worked closely with mental health professionals and oncology specialists to help make the program optimal and kid-friendly. Currently six hospitals are using Diane\u2019s virtual reality program for pediatric patients in Europe and the United States. When it comes to spearheading your ideas, Herjavec offered some advice for inspiring innovators. \u201cYou have to find something that can actually execute and help people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t start a business, solve a problem.\u201d For more information on C3 Prize challenge, visit c3prize.com",

(Credit: UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe) The Portland Public Schools board voted last week to ban any materials that cast doubt on climate change, the Portland Tribune reported. According to the resolution passed May 17, the school district must remove any textbooks and other materials that suggest climate change is not occurring or that says human beings are not responsible for it. \u201cA lot of the text materials are kind of thick with the language of doubt, and obviously the science says otherwise,\u201d said Bill Bigelow, a former Portland public school teacher who worked to present the resolution. Bigelow says textbook publishers are yielding to pressure from fossil fuels companies. \u201cWe don\u2019t want kids in Portland learning material courtesy of the fossil fuel industry.\u201d One commenter to the Portland Tribune story responded to the news, saying, \u201cI have never seen a case for homeschooling more clearly put forward. This is further proof that public schools are not interested in education, only political indoctrination.\u201d A petition, meanwhile, circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (OISM) currently lists nearly 32,000 signers, including 9,000 Ph.D.s, who say, \u201cthere is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth.\u201d Still, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says addressing the issue of global warming will help to improve public health, according to U.S. News & World Report. \"I don't want people to think that EPA is just about big rules, or that climate change is just about polar bears,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said. \"It really is about direct public health issues like asthma and kids, like cardiovascular and pulmonary disease associated with air pollution.\" The Portland decision comes weeks after Yale University announced its climate change program will close at the end of June. The shuttering follows three consecutive years of budget cuts for the program, which was established eight years ago to conduct climate change research. The impending closure was announced in an email from the institute\u2019s co-directors, geology and geophysics professors David Bercovici and Jay Ague, and reported by the Yale Daily News. \u201cWhile not all good things have to come to an end, sometimes they just do,\u201d the email dated May 2 said.",

Instead of modifying an existing bike, Triple Eight started from the ground up and constructed a monocoque frame entirely from carbon fiber. The Skycraft is so minimally designed that it carries its fuel within the frame, and its carbon fiber rear swing arm doubles as a silencer for the exhaust. The wheel rims are also carbon fiber, while the bolts, axles and shock spring are all made from titanium The result is a bike that weighs just 165 pounds complete with its KTM two-stroke engine. That\u2019s about 25 percent lighter than a typical FMX bike and could facilitate never before seen aerial tricks. But don\u2019t go looking for one at your local motorcycle shop anytime soon.

A group of volunteers called the \"Saltwater Cowboys\" rounds up the ponies and leads them through the passage at slack tide. (AP/The Daily Times) July 29, 2015: A pair of Chincoteague ponies make the 90th annual Chincoteague Pony Swim across Assateague Channel to the Chincoteague Island, Va. (AP) Hundreds of spectators braved the marshy mud and mosquitoes in Virginia Wednesday to watch the 90th annual Chincoteague pony swim \u2013 even if it meant losing a shoe. The pony swim from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island on the eastern shore was led by a group of volunteers called the \"Saltwater Cowboys,\" who round up the ponies and lead them through the passage at slack tide. The tradition was made famous by Marguerite Henry's 1947 fictional book \"Misty of Chincoteague,\u201d which is based on the event. An auction of a portion of the herd on Thursday will benefit the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department. The auction helps the department comply with a directive from the National Park Service, which allows only 150 horses to stay on the island, Delmarvanow.com reports. Diane Huntley of Fredericksburg, Va., told the Baltimore Sun that she put her foot in the mud to get a glimpse of the swim and when she lifted her leg, her shoe was gone. \"I didn't want to stick my hand in to get it,\" she said. \"I think bare feet would probably have been best.\" The event poses a challenge for spectators, according to the newspaper. Some people crane their necks to see the ponies from a waterside park, while others enter the mud to get a closer view. \"We just had to stop and watch it,\" Sharon Hammond of Woodbridge, Va., told the Baltimore Sun. \u00a0\"It was amazing. I couldn't even take pictures because I was mesmerized.\" The swim began at 8:15 a.m. and ended around nine minutes later. After a 45 minute rest, the Saltwater Cowboys started to herd the ponies to the carnival grounds where the auction will take place. Several ponies escaped from the herd en route to the carnival grounds, frolicking through front yards and weaving through spectators, Delmarvanow.com reported. After the auction, the herd \u2013 minus a key player this year, Surfer Dude \u2013 will swim back to their Assateague Island home on Friday. During his 23 years, Surfer Dude often led the swim to Chincoteague. He was found dead this spring, leaving dozens of ponies he sired to continue his legacy.

            "article_content": "(Knott's Berry Farm/Cedar Fair) Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif. will have one less attraction at its annual Halloween event this year after mental health advocates complained about a virtual reality attraction. Fear VR was a new haunted house ride at Knott\u2019s Scary Farm event featuring a storyline about a possessed patient running around a mental institution. Park visitors were strapped into chairs and moved through the attraction wearing VR headsets. The hospital-themed attraction, which opened Thursday Sept. 22, was originally named Fear VR 5150, numbers for the official state code used to authorize the detention of a person who may be suffering from a mental disorder that causes an individual to be considered a danger to others or himself or herself. Mental Health Advocates Protest Knott's Berry Farm's Halloween Attraction, Fear VR: 5150 https://t.co/tsBxudxmQP @TheMightySite On its website, Knott\u2019s warns that attractions at the Halloween event contain \u201cextremely adult material\u201d and while there is no minimum age requirement, the \u201cevent is recommended for mature audiences only and not recommended for children under 13.\u201d Immediately after its debut, the ride was criticized by several mental health advocates for its portrayal of mental illness. Kay Warren, the wife of Saddleback pastor Rick Warren, told the OC Register that the attraction's original name struck a nerve because her son, who committed suicide in 2013, was \u201cheld on a 5150\u201d several times. On the ride\u2019s opening day, the park announced that it would drop the \u201c5150\u201d from the attraction\u2019s name. But many other California residents continued to speak out against the ride's portrayal of people suffering from mental illness. Los Angeles resident Julia Robinson Shimizu penned an open letter about Knott\u2019s to an L.A. Times editor. \u201cKnott\u2019s Berry Farm is horrifying because it demonizes people with mental illness,\u201d wrote Shimizu of Los \u201cShame on Knott\u2019s Berry Farm and on Los Angeles Times for presenting illness as entertainment. People with mental illness are our loved ones and yours\u2026. People with mental illness are statistically more likely to be a victim of a crime than to commit a crime. The ride stayed open through the weekend but after numerous complaints continued, Knott\u2019s (which is owned by amusement giant Cedar Fair) announced that it would shutter the Fear VR attraction entirely. The park sent a statement about the decision to the L.A. Times: \u201cOver the past week we have heard from a number of people expressing their concern that one of our temporary, Halloween attractions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Fear VR\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is hurtful to those who suffer from mental illnesses.\u00a0Contrary to some traditional and social media accounts, the attraction\u2019s story and presentation were never intended to portray mental illness.\u00a0As it is impossible to address both concerns and misconceptions in the Halloween timeframe, at this time we have decided to close the attraction.\u201d California\u2019s Great America in Santa Clara, Calif. and Wonderland park in Toronto, Canada (both owned by Cedar Fair)\u00a0also cancelled the featured attraction at their Halloween events in the wake of the controversy. Mental health advocates praised the decision. \"I feel good about what happened here,\" John Leyerle, president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Orange County, told the OC Register. \"Thankfully, this attraction will no longer further mental health stigma. By closing this ride down, they've moved things away from a negative place.\u201d But Knott\u2019s Scary Farm, which has been held at the theme park every year 1973, isn\u2019t cheap. Nightly tickets cost $40 and many thrill seekers have started to criticize the park\u2019s decision to close the VR-enhanced haunted house. @knotts I'm sorry that people complained about the vr 5150. When I attend Scary Farm I expect to be scared. I went on 9/23 and had a blast. On Wednesday night, thousands signed a petition asking the park to re-open the ride. \"It is a haunted amusement park, the things that exist in it are meant to terrify and disturb you, this is what people sign on for when they go to the park,\" reads the Change.org page. It continues, \"Closing the attraction is not going to help advocate the increase of knowledge on the subject either. People are still going to be afraid of what they do not understand in regards to mental illness.\" The park states that there are no ticket refunds for the event. Representatives for Knott's Berry Farm and Cedar Fair were not immediately available for comment.",

That\u2019s exactly what Oshkosh Defense is proposing with a new unmanned military machine. The truck specialist recently demonstrating one of its armored M-ATVs fitted with an autonomous vehicle platform called TerraMax. Using a combination of GPS, radar, LIDAR and multispectral cameras with overlapping redundancies, the technology allows the truck to either navigate itself from point to point, with the ability to avoid unexpected obstacles along the way, or be controlled remotely by an operator in a trailing vehicle or stationed nearby. The idea is that an M-ATV fitted with a mine roller could lead a convoy of autonomous vehicles through hostile territory while putting a minimum number of troops at risk. Over 2,500 American service members have been killed by IEDs in U.S combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and similar threats are expected to continue to present themselves in future conflicts. According to Oshkosh, troops can be trained to operate the equipment in just a few days. Its relatively simple interface is a combination of a ruggedized touch-screen tablet and a console video game-style handheld controller that allows a single operator to oversee several trucks. Technically, TerraMax-equipped vehicles could be operated from the other side of the planet, but the system\u2019s chief engineer, John Beck, says that \u201cfrom an operational standpoint, it is desirable for the troops to be in relatively near proximity in order to provide convoy protection and security in the event of an ambush.\u201d The technology is on display this week at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Unmanned Systems in Orlando. And while it hasn\u2019t yet been deployed in a combat theater, Oshkosh has released video of an unmanned mine-sweeping M-ATV leading two TerraMax-equipped cargo trucks through a proving ground course.

According to Foose Design, Chip Foose's latest project is based on a sketch from 1935. Car dealer Wes Rydell and his wife Vivian commissioned a custom Cadillac coupe that was sketched out by GM designer Art Ross. It would take an existing Cadillac sedan, shorten it, lower it and give it a removable hardtop. The drawing is as far as the project got.

Chevy has unveiled the 2017 ZL1, and it\u2019s the most muscular Camaro in history. (Chevrolet) The ZL1 gets a version of the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 from the Corvette Z06, here with an estimated 640 hp. That\u2019s up from the last-generation ZL1\u2019s 580 hp. It\u2019ll be available with either a 6-speed manual transmission or the first application of GM\u2019s new paddle-shifted 10-speed automatic, which will also be featured in future Chevy trucks. It sends the power to the rear wheels via an electronic limited slip differential equipped with Chevy\u2019s adjustable Performance Traction Management system. An active suspension with Magnetic Ride shock absorbers is also standard. The ZL1\u2019s body is as bold as everything underneath it, with an enormous wavy grille to cool and feed the engine, and a vented hood to help reduce lift as it exhales the onrush of air. The front splitter and side skirts jut out far enough to endanger ankles, while the rear spoiler provides downforce to help the foot-wide Goodyear Eagle F1 tires underneath it stick to the road. Chevy calls the ZL1 the decathlete of the Camaro lineup, meaning that it does everything well. It\u2019s quick in a straight line, a good handler, and comes loaded with creature comforts, which run the gamut from deep leather and suede-upholstered Recaro seats to a heated steering wheel. (Chevrolet) Pricing has not yet been announced, but the 2015 model started at $57,800, so the new one will likely be there or above when it goes on sale late this year. ---------- 2016 Chevrolet Camaro V6",

Now, eight more will head to the\u00a0auction\u00a0block at Bonhams on April 24 thanks to a trove of recently discovered barn finds in the UK. They're in rough shape, but the auction house expects them to bring big money. A member of the Brough Superior Club collected most of these motorcycles in the early 1960s, but eventually he stored them away in barns in the Cornish village of Bodmin Moor. Only a few people even knew these bikes still existed. \"This is the last known collection of unrestored Brough Superiors; there will not be another opportunity like this,\" said Ben Walker, International Director for Bonhams Collectors' Motorcycle Department, in the auction announcement. ---------- Also from Autoblog: Google's most-searched cars Buick Regal wagon could be on the way Most fuel-efficient automakers ---------- Junk covered these cycles for about 50 years, and their condition varies from mostly complete \u2013 but rough \u2013 to just a pile of parts.

A 1938 750cc BS4 has the highest sale estimate of the group at between $118,400 and $177,600. Meanwhile, two SS80 cycles in pieces each carry estimates between $8,900 and $11,800.

            "article_content": "Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in Freddie Gray, whose death triggered Monday\u2019s rioting in Baltimore, may have intentionally tried to injure himself in a police van, according to another prisoner in the vehicle, the Washington Post reported late Wednesday night. The Post said the unidentified prisoner, who was separated from Gray by a metal partition and could not see him, reportedly said he heard Gray \u201cbanging himself against the walls\u201d and believed he \u201cwas intentionally trying to injure himself. The prisoner\u2019s statements were contained in an investigative document obtained by the paper, which said it was unclear if there was any additional information to support the theory. Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he ran from police. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police had said. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal injury and was unconscious when the van arrived at a police station. Authorities have not explained how or when Gray\u2019s spine was injured. He died April 19. The death of Gray sparked riots earlier this week in Baltimore as protests turned violent resulting into major property damage throughout the city and around 200 arrests Tuesday, the city started to enforce a curfew starting at 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. More than 3,000 National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers were called into the city to make sure no more violence took place in the city. Baltimore stayed quiet throughout the night Wednesday as well. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has also come under fire after a senior law enforcement told Fox News Wednesday that she ordered police to stand down. The source, who is involved in the enforcement efforts, confirmed to Fox News there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief Monday night, effectively tying the hands of officers as they were pelted with rocks and bottles. The claim follows criticism of the mayor for, over the weekend, saying they were giving space to those who \"wished to destroy.\" Rawlings-Blake has defended her handling of the unrest, which grew out of protests over the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. The mayor, in an interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer on Tuesday, denied any order was issued to hold back on Monday. \"You have to understand, it is not holding back. It is responding appropriately,\" she said, saying there was no stand-down directive. She said her critics have a right to their opinion. Baltimore police are expected to finish their investigation Friday and turn the results over to the city\u2019s state\u2019s attorney office, which will decide whether to seek indictment. Six police officers, including a lieutenant and a sergeant, have been suspended. Fox News' Leland Vittert and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Bugatti Chiron is the automaker\u2019s $2.5 million successor to the Veyron Super Sport, which holds the Guinness World Record for fastest production car at 268 mph. Like the Veyron, the carbon fiber Chiron is powered by an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged 16-cylinder engine, but it puts out nearly 1,500 horsepower, compared to the Super Sport\u2019s relatively measly 1,200 hp. No mass-produced production car has ever come close. Twin fuel injectors for each cylinder help feed the beast, which breathes through six catalytic converters. Bugatti says the Chiron will be limited to 260 mph for road travel, but that it is also \u201cready for a new world speed record.\u201d The Veyron was similarly restricted to 258 mph for use on the street, so this suggests plans for a record run with the electronic nannies turned off. Acceleration is touted to be similarly impressive, with a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time and a 0-186 mph time in \u201cunder 13.6 sec.,\u201d which is a significant figure, because it would beat the Hennessey Venom GT\u2019s Guinness World Record of 13.63 sec. The Chiron features an adaptive suspension system to enhance its ride and handling, along with active aerodynamics that includes a movable rear wing that can make the car slipperier for top speed runs, or increase downforce for better traction in turns and under braking. The Chiron shares a clear family resemblance with the Veyron, but adopts a few styling cues that hearken back to the classic Type 57, including its small central fin and semicircular side panels, here doubling as air intakes. Bugatti plans to build 500 Chirons, and you\u2019d better hurry if you want one. A third of the run was sold to the brand\u2019s loyal customers before the car\u2019s public reveal. ---------- Fox drives the world's fastest car",

As of Tuesday, Republican state Rep. Michael Pitts had filed 24 amendments to the proposal, which is before the House after passing the state Senate on an overwhelming 36-3 vote. The amendments are eclectic and unorthodox. A third of them propose taking down nearly all capital monuments and replacing them with \u201csuitable landscaping, foliage, or sidewalks.\u201d The monuments include not only Confederate symbols, but also African-American, Revolutionary War, and Spanish War memorials. Another calls for alternative war flags to be raised that \u201cmust be illuminated at night\u201d and protected by \u201can appropriate decorative iron fence.\u201d Another demands the American flag atop the Capitol be upside-down. He named his revisions the \u201cPolitically Correct Revision Act of 2015.\u201d The proposals could create turbulence for the Confederate flag push, launched after nine black church members were fatally shot, allegedly by a white gunman, in Charleston last month. Any amendments to the Senate bill would require the two chambers to iron out the differences. And the final legislation still would have to pass by a two-thirds vote to reach Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s desk. Many legislators question Pitts\u2019 intentions. \u201cThe truth is that any amendment either leaves the flag up or keeps us in legislative session all summer long,\u201d state Rep. Norman Brannon told The New York Times. Still, Pitts has garnered eight co-sponsors. He defended his position in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t see that this incident has any bearing on the flag or the flag has bearing on the incident,\u201d he said of the shooting. \u201cRacism exists no matter whether you try to use the flag as a symbol for that or not. \u2026We cannot erase our heritage based on the actions of one deranged individual.\u201d Pitts could not be reached for comment by FoxNews.com. By state law, amendments are required to be debated, and Pitts reportedly has some 100 amendments he could propose during debate. The House could invoke a cloture motion with a two-thirds majority that would prevent new amendments from being added. FoxNews.com\u2019s Matthew Fossen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl offers insight on 'The Real Story' The Supreme Court punted Monday on a challenge by religious-affiliated employers to ObamaCare\u2019s contraception mandate, sending the election-year dispute back to the lower courts. The justices had been considering whether religious-affiliated institutions like the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic charity of nuns, can be exempt from having to pay for -- or indirectly allow -- birth control and other reproductive coverage in their health plans. But the court did not rule on the merits. Instead, the justices sent the cases back to the appeals courts to make new decisions based on recent statements. \u201cThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d the court said in an unsigned, unanimous opinion. \u201cIn particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners' religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest.\u201d The decision ducks, for now, a high-profile dispute before the Supreme Court at the height of an election year -- at a time when the court is dealing with a vacancy following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The matter almost certainly would not return to the Supreme Court until after the 2016 presidential election. The outcome suggests the court lacked a majority for a significant ruling and is perhaps another example of how the justices have been affected by the death of Scalia. In the short term, the government can take steps to make sure that women covered by the groups' health plans have access to cost-free contraceptives. At the same time, the groups will not face fines for refusing to comply with administration rules for objecting to paying for birth control. The Little Sisters of the Poor's legal team nevertheless declared victory Monday. \"We are very encouraged by the Court's decision, which is an important win for the Little Sisters. The Court has recognized that the government changed its position,\" Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said in a statement. \"It is crucial that the Justices unanimously ordered the government not to impose these fines and indicated that the government doesn't need any notice to figure out what should now be obvious -- the Little Sisters respectfully object. There is still work to be done, but today's decision indicates that we will ultimately prevail in court.\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, though, said the administration was \u201cgratified\u201d by the decision, arguing that it ensures millions of woman will have access to health care. The high court two years ago said the Little Sisters and its third-party insurance administrator could remain temporarily exempt from the mandates, while lower courts continued to wrangle with the merits of the primary challenge to the federal health law provisions on contraception. After ObamaCare was passed in 2010, the White House negotiated what it called a compromise aimed at allowing the medical coverage but also providing an administrative workaround for those opposing it. The central dispute revolves around a requirement these groups self-certify -- and sign a form authorizing an outside administrator to provide contraceptives without the employers' direct involvement. The rules were designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit, religious-based organizations the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay. Lawyers for the nuns and related plaintiffs told the court during arguments in March that their clients faced a \"moral dilemma\" -- refuse to comply and face millions in crippling fines, or violate what all sides agree are the nuns' \"sincerely held\" religious beliefs.

Terry McAuliffe's action restoring the voting rights of more than 200,000 felons was unconstitutional, Virginia's highest court ruled Friday (Reuters) RICHMOND, Va. \u2013 Gov. Terry McAuliffe's action restoring the voting rights of more than 200,000 felons was unconstitutional, Virginia's highest court ruled Friday, siding with Republican lawmakers who said the governor overstepped his authority. In a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court of Virginia ordered the state to cancel the registration of the more than 11,000 felons who had signed up to vote so far under the governor's April executive order. Top Republicans called it \"a major victory for the Constitution, the rule of law and the Commonwealth of Virginia.\" \"Our nation was founded on the principles of limited government and separation of powers. Those principles have once again withstood assault from the executive branch. This opinion is a sweeping rebuke of the governor's unprecedented assertion of executive authority,\" House Speaker William Howell and Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment said in a statement. A spokesman for McAuliffe didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The executive order restored voting rights of felons who completed their sentences and also allowed them to run for public office, serve on a jury and become a notary public. Republican lawmakers swiftly sued, arguing that governors cannot restore rights en masse but must consider each former offender's case individually. McAuliffe's administration and backers countered that there's nothing in the constitution that says -- or even implies -- that governors must restore a person's rights on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 \u00a0But the Supreme Court rejected that argument Friday, calling it \"overstated at best.\" Chief Justice Donald Lemons, who wrote the opinion for the court, said the claim that governors can grant blanket pardons is \"irreconcilable\" with the requirement in the Constitution that governors must report to lawmakers the \"'particulars of every case' and state his `reasons' for each pardon.\" \"This requirement implies a specificity and particularity wholly lacking in a blanket, group pardon of a host of unnamed and, to some extent, still unknown number of convicted felons,\" Lemons wrote.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, right, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listen to a question during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP) (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) This election is about a lot of things, but it is fundamentally about the U.S. Constitution and whether federal judges will adhere to their oath to \u201c\u2026 faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me \u2026 under the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d or dilute, attack and destroy our founding document. That the Constitution is on the ballot in the persons of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who hold differing views of it and have pledged to appoint radically different judges to federal benches, is revealed in a recent op-ed for Slate by Richard Posner, a judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. In his op-ed, as reported by The Washington Times, Judge Posner claims to see \u201cabsolutely no value\u201d in studying the Constitution because \u201c18th-century guys, however smart, could not foresee the culture, technology, etc., of the 21st century.\u201d I suspect if they had seen modern culture with our fixation on Kim Kardashian, they might have retreated to England. Even the Bill of Rights, says Posner, \u201cdo not speak to today.\u201d Wow. Freedom of speech, assembly, the press, religion, no warrantless searches and more are outmoded concepts? Who knew? Posner continued: \u201cI see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation (across the centuries \u2014 well, just a little more than two centuries, and of course less for many of the amendments).\u201d After receiving severe criticism, Judge Posner apologized for his \u201ccareless\u201d remarks, but he still doesn\u2019t think the Constitution is relevant for today because, you know, those dead white guys owned slaves and didn\u2019t have the internet. Imagine if such illogic was applied to other creations of the 18th century. There was much literature and music, in addition to political writings, that came from that era. Are Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, Goethe, William Blake, Henry Fielding, all of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton (there\u2019s a modern hit musical about him) and the music of Bach and Beethoven, to mention a few, also irrelevant today? This is the arrogance of some judges who think they know better than the Founders. It is the choice in this election between a president and the judges he or she will appoint who believe, as late Justice Antonin Scalia did, that the Constitution sets boundaries for limited government in order to guarantee liberty to American citizens, or whether it means only what an unelected judge says it does. Posner is no fan of Scalia. In a clever turn of phrase he writes, \u201cLet\u2019s not let the dead bury the living.\u201d He continues: \u201cI worry that law professors are too respectful of the Supreme Court, in part perhaps because they don\u2019t want to spoil the chances of their students to obtain Supreme Court clerkships. I think the Supreme Court is at a nadir. The justices are far too uniform in background, and I don\u2019t think there are any real stars among them\u2026\u201d Washington Times reporter Jessica Chasmar sought reaction from David Bernstein, who teaches at Antonin Scalia Law School, formerly George Mason University School of Law. Bernstein described Posner\u2019s attack of Scalia as \u201crevolting,\u201d adding, \u201cWe all know Posner doesn\u2019t think highly, to say the least, of Scalia. Judging from what Posner writes, the distaste seems to stem primarily from jealousy \u2014 Posner thinks he would be a far better Supreme Court justice than Scalia was, and he resents that as a \u2018lower court\u2019 judge, his writings, though highly influential in their own right, will never get the same attention and accolades as Scalia.\u201d This election will determine the direction of our courts and whether judges will write laws, or interpret under the Constitution the intent of the legislators who wrote them. It will also decide whether the Constitution remains a self-authenticating document, protecting our liberties from encroaching government, or something that in the minds of judges like Richard Posner can be shredded along with our liberties.",

Critics of the election, who had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, argue the vote is an unconstitutional, racially exclusive process. Justice Anthony Kennedy issued a brief order on Friday barring ballots from being counted or certified in the race, \u201cpending further order.\u201d Native Hawaiians have been voting to elect delegates for a convention next year to come up with a self-governance document to be ratified by Native Hawaiians. Voting was set to end Monday. But a group of Native Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians challenged the election, arguing Hawaii residents who don't have Native Hawaiian ancestry are being excluded from the vote, in violation of their constitutional rights. Defendants include the state and Nai Aupuni, the nonprofit organization guiding the election process. Native Hawaiians are the last remaining indigenous group in the United States that hasn't been allowed to establish its own government. U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright in Honolulu ruled last month the purpose of the private election is to establish self-determination for the indigenous people of Hawaii. Those elected won't be able to alter state or local laws, he said. The challengers appealed and also filed an emergency motion to block the votes from being counted. Last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the emergency motion, prompting the challengers to appeal to the high court. Racial exclusivity goes against Hawaiian values, said one of the Native Hawaiian plaintiffs, Kelii Akina, who is also president of public policy think-tank Grassroot Institute of Hawaii. \"The Hawaiian Kingdom consisted of citizens of multiples races including Native Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese, Caucasians and others,\" he said. \"This racial inclusiveness is at the heart of the aloha spirit.\" Election supporters argue it's crucial that the vote move forward because it presents a unique opportunity that has evaded Native Hawaiians for more than 100 years. \"The western way of life has not necessarily been good to us,\" Clyde Namuo, executive director of the Native Hawaiian Roll Commission and a delegate candidate, said last month. \"We will be able to control our destiny in a better way if we form our government.\" Fox News\u2019 Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

The Supreme Court rid itself Monday, May 16, 2016, of a knotty dispute between faith-based groups and the Obama administration over birth control. The court asked lower courts to take another look at the issue in a search for a compromise. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court failed to resolve a knotty dispute between faith-based groups and the Obama administration over birth control on Monday, the latest indication of the shorthanded court's struggle to find a majority for important cases taken up before Justice Antonin Scalia's death. The justices asked lower courts to take another look at the issue in a search for a compromise, issuing an unsigned, unanimous opinion. The case concerns the administration's arrangement for sparing faith-based groups from having to pay for birth control for women covered under their health plans. \"The court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\" the justices wrote, ending a major confrontation over President Barack Obama's health care law ended with a whimper and no resolution. The matter almost certainly will not return to the Supreme Court before the 2016 presidential election, and perhaps not until a new justice is confirmed to take Scalia's seat, if at all. The outcome suggested the court lacked a majority for such a significant ruling, underscoring the effect of Scalia's absence. Already two cases have resulted in 4-4 ties since the conservative's death in February. The lack of a resolution leaves the government able for now to ensure that women covered by faith-based groups' health plans have access to cost-free contraceptives. But the groups, which include not-for-profit colleges and charities, won't face fines for not adhering to administration procedures for objecting to birth control benefits. By complying, they argued they would be complicit in making contraceptives available in violation of their religious beliefs as their insurers or insurance administrators would then assume responsibility for providing birth control. The justices appeared evenly divided on the question when they heard arguments in late March. And the court seemed to acknowledge the division shortly after when it ordered the two sides to file a new and unusual round of legal briefs in search of a compromise, perhaps by making contraceptive coverage available without requiring a notice of objection. Eight appeals courts nationwide have sided with the administration; four of those were challenged in the case before the Supreme Court. One court has ruled for the groups so far. In 2014, the justices divided 5-4 with Scalia in the majority to allow some \"closely held\" businesses with religious objections to refuse to pay for contraceptives. That case involved the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores and other companies that said their rights were being violated under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Catholic and Protestant colleges, charities and advocacy groups invoked the same law in asking the government to find a way that does not involve them or their insurers in birth control provisions. The challengers included Bishop David Zubik, head of the Catholic Diocese in Pittsburgh; the Little Sisters of the Poor, nuns who run more than two dozen nursing homes for impoverished seniors; evangelical and Catholic colleges in Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, D.C.; and the anti-abortion advocacy group Priests for Life. Contraception is among a range of preventive services that must be provided at no extra charge under the health care law. The administration pointed to research showing the high cost of some methods of contraception discourages women from using them. One effective means of birth control, the intrauterine device, can cost up to $1,000. Houses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the birth control requirement. Other faith-affiliated groups have to tell the government or their insurers if they object, and allow their insurer or third-party administrator to handle matters related to birth control. Some groups, including Little Sisters of the Poor, contract with church-based insurers, which themselves are exempt from having to provide contraceptives. A ruling for the groups, the administration argues, would disadvantage tens of thousands of women.",

            "article_content": "2016 GOP presidential candidate lays out his case to the American people on 'Hannity' The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday ended a secret investigation into whether Republican Gov. Scott Walker's campaign illegally coordinated with conservative groups in winning his 2012 recall election. The justices cited free speech in effectively tossing out the case, ruling state election law is overbroad and vague in defining what amounts to \"political purposes.\" The court's action is a major victory for Walker as he pursues the presidency, though one expert said prosecutors could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. No one has been charged in the so-called John Doe probe, Wisconsin's version of a grand jury investigation in which information is tightly controlled. Questions about the investigation have dogged Walker for months. The case centers on political activity conducted by Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative organizations during the 2012 recall, which was spurred by Democrats' anger over a Walker-authored law that effectively ending collective bargaining for most public workers. Prosecutors accused Walker and the groups of illegally coordinating their campaign efforts in violation of state law. They denied wrongdoing. Justice Michael Gableman wrote that prosecutors alleged the groups and the campaign illegally coordinated on issue advocacy, communications that don't expressly call for a candidate's defeat or victory. Gableman wrote that Wisconsin's campaign finance law is unconstitutionally vague about what amounts to coordinating for political purposes. He said \"political purposes\" must be limited to express advocacy, that is, advertisements and communications that clearly call on voters to defeat or elect a specific candidate. With that limitation in place, the law doesn't prohibit any of the coordination the prosecutors believe was illegal. \"To be clear, this conclusion ends the John Doe investigation because the ... prosecutor's legal theory is unsupported in either reason or law,\" Gableman wrote. \"Consequently, the investigation is closed.\" Justice Shirley Abrahamson, one of two liberals on the seven-member court, sharply disagreed in a dissent that accused the majority of a faulty interpretation of state law. \"The majority opinion delivers a significant blow to Wisconsin's campaign finance law and to its paramount objectives of `stimulating vigorous campaigns on a fair and equal basis' and providing for `a better informed electorate,\"' Abrahamson wrote. Republicans had called the investigation, launched by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, a partisan witch hunt. Wisconsin Club for Growth and its director, Eric O'Keefe, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit last year seeking to halt the probe, arguing the investigation violates their free speech rights. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa sided with the club but a federal appellate court later tossed out the lawsuit, saying the issue belonged in state courts. The club and O'Keefe then turned to the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by a four-justice conservative majority. Howard Schweber, an associate professor of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said before the ruling that prosecutors could seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court, possibly arguing bias, if they lost. Lead prosecutor Francis Schmitz in February asked at least two justices to recuse themselves to avoid the appearance of impropriety, but the justices didn't respond.",

Rick Perry was tossed out Friday, giving the Republican presidential candidate a potentially huge legal victory in the face of flagging polling numbers for the 2016 race. The 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin sided Friday with Perry's high-powered legal team in ruling that the charge of coercion of a public servant essentially constituted a violation of Perry's free speech rights. Perry was indicted last August on the coercion charge and a separate charge of abuse of official power, which wasn't affected by the ruling. It's still likely he'll have to face that charge. The case stems from Perry publicly threatening, and then exercising, a veto of state funding for public corruption prosecutors. His move came in the wake of the Democrat who heads the investigative unit rebuffing Perry's calls to resign after she was convicted and jailed for drunken driving. Michael McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor leading the case, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. He will likely have the option of further appealing Friday's decision. Lead Perry counsel Tony Buzbee called the decision \"a clear step towards victory for the rule of law.\" \"The only remaining count we believe to be a misdemeanor, and the only issue is whether the governor's veto -- or any veto in the absence of bribery -- can ever be illegal,\" Buzbee said. \"The appeals court made clear that this case was questionable ... and we are confident that once it is put before the court, it will be dismissed on its face.\" Perry left office in January and has spent most of his time campaigning in the early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, but polls show him badly trailing the race's front-runners. He made a single court appearance in the matter, which so far hasn't affected his 2016 campaign schedule. The former governor has for months called the case against him politically motivated, but the Republican trial judge repeatedly refused to toss it on constitutional grounds, which prompted the appeal. McCrum has said Perry deserves to go to trial based on the evidence -- not politics. Still, the court wrote, the coercion charge \"violates the First Amendment and, accordingly, cannot be enforced.\"",

The 2-1 ruling is a victory for voting rights groups who said a U.S. election official illegally changed proof-of-citizenship requirements on the federal registration form at the behest of the three states. People registering to vote in other states are only required to swear that that they are citizens, not show documentary proof. The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia acted swiftly in the case, issuing a two-page, unsigned ruling just a day after hearing oral arguments. A federal judge in July had refused to block the requirement while the case is considered on the merits. The League of Women Voters and civil rights groups argued that the requirements could lead to the \"mass disenfranchisement\" of thousands of potential voters \u2014 many of them poor, African-American and living in rural areas The groups took issue with the actions of Brian Newby, executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, who changed the federal form shortly after he took the job last November. Newby is a former Kansas election official who had publicly supported the state's effort to make the change. The case now returns to the district court for a full hearing on the merits. But the appeals court said the voting rights groups are likely to succeed on the merits. The change requires people seeking to register to show birth certificates, naturalization papers or other documents as proof of citizenship. Kansas has been actively enforcing the requirement, but Alabama and Georgia have not. Opponents said Newby had no authority to take the action on his own. Even the Justice Department has refused to defend Newby's action and has sided with voting rights groups. The appeals court's ruling requires the commission to immediately remove the proof-of-citizenship requirement from all forms. It requires the states to treat all registration applications filed since January 29 as if they did not have the requirement. Judges Judith Rogers and Stephen Williams were in the majority and Judge A. Raymond Randolph dissented. Rogers was a Democratic appointee, while Williams and Randolph were appointed by Republican presidents. The EAC was created in 2002 to help avoid a repeat of the disputed 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore following ballot confusion in Florida. It is supposed to have four commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, but one of the Democratic seats is currently vacant. The remaining commissioners never acted to approve or disapprove Newby's action. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach had argued that the change was needed to prevent voter fraud. He rejected claims that the requirement undermined voter registration, saying Kansas voter rolls have risen overall this year.",

The announcement in federal court sets in motion criminal proceedings against the sheriff less than a month before Election Day as he seeks a seventh term as Maricopa County sheriff. The 2016 election cycle has also seen Arpaio take a prominent role on the national stage, appearing alongside Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on several occasions. A judge previously recommended criminal contempt charges against Arpaio but left it up to federal prosecutors to actually bring the case. Prosecutor John Keller said in court that the government will bring charges, with the next step being a court filing possibly in the next day that's akin to a criminal complaint. Arpaio could face up to six months in jail if convicted of misdemeanor contempt. Arpaio lawyer Mel McDonald said the sheriff will not be arrested and no mugshot will be taken. He will plead not guilty by court filing and hopes to prevail before a jury. \"We believe the sheriff, being an elected official, should be judged by his peers,\" McDonald said. The move is yet another key defeat for the sheriff who became a national political figure over the past decade by aggressively carrying out immigration patrols and attention-getting endeavors such as making prisoners wear pink underwear. Following complaints by Latino drivers about racial profiling, a judge demanded that Arpaio stop the enforcement efforts. He was later found to have violated the order, causing it to morph into a contempt of court case. Arpaio has acknowledged violating the \u00a0order to stop the immigration patrols but insists his disobedience wasn't intentional. County taxpayers have shelled out $48 million so far in the profiling case, and the costs are expected to reach $72 million by next summer.",

            "article_content": "April 28, 2016: Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's choice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court meets with Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) WASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland detailed his most significant cases in thousands of pages of documents submitted to Congress Tuesday, including his role as a federal prosecutor in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case and the prosecution of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. The lengthy questionnaire isn't likely to sway many minds in Congress, where Republicans have insisted on delaying the Supreme Court fight until after the presidential election. But the White House still had Garland fill out a questionnaire, and the committee posted the document online, as is routine with nominations. Garland is currently the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Garland's account of his most significant opinions as a judge includes one that upheld a ban on campaign contributions from federal contractors. Another affirmed the application of the Endangered Species Act to a commercial real estate project that threatened a protected toad. Two others sided with people mounting job discrimination lawsuits. In his long career on the bench and as a Justice Department official before that, Garland developed a reputation for being pro-prosecutor and pro-government. But in his listing of significant opinions, he includes one case in which he voted to throw out a criminal conviction for a drug trafficking conspiracy, a second dissenting opinion in which he would have allowed lawsuits to continue against private contractors over allegations of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and a third that sided with a Uighur detainee at Guantanamo Bay who challenged his status as an \"enemy combatant.\" He also cites his role as a federal prosecutor Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber cases as a lawyer before becoming a judge, noting that both were convicted. McVeigh was executed, while Kaczynski was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In the thousands of pages of documents, he also lists details of his work experience, his biographical background, his memberships and associations, his most significant cases, pro bono work and financial information. Garland reported that he was first called by the White House about the Supreme Court vacancy on Feb. 29 -- 16 days after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. He said he was interviewed by President Barack Obama on March 9, a week before Obama announced his nomination. The White House said the questionnaire is intended to present \"an exhaustive picture\" of Garland's service on the bench and of his \"impeccable credentials.\" The questionnaire is a standard early step in the vetting of any judicial nominee. The lengthy survey typically is drafted by the committee, completed by the nominee, and then reviewed and made public by the committee in advance of committee hearings. In this case, the Senate Judiciary Committee didn't send a questionnaire to Garland because Republicans said they have no intention of acting on his nomination. So the White House had Garland fill out what it described as a standard form and sent it, unsolicited, to the committee. So in Garland's atypical nomination, the questionnaire has become another tool in the White House pressure campaign. Senate Republicans have maintained that the next president should choose the Scalia's replacement. Shortly after the questionnaire was posted online, Senate Democrats used it to call once more on Republicans to hold hearings and vote. In a news conference, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee warned Republicans that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump could pick the next justice. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin joked that Trump might bring television personality Judge Judy out of retirement. \"I don't want to make light of the situation because it's extremely serious,\" Durbin said. \"But imagining Donald Trump picking a Supreme Court justice is something I never thought would cross my mind.\" Garland has been meeting privately with senators on so-called courtesy visits and conducted some prep sessions with the White House. He was scheduled to meet Tuesday with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, the White House said. \"We expect that upon receiving the questionnaire, Senate Judiciary Committee members will do their jobs by reviewing the information, scheduling a hearing so that the American people can hear directly from Chief Judge Garland as he answers questions under oath, and giving him a fair up or down vote,\" Hoffine said. Garland plans to continue his meetings with lawmakers this week. Garland is slated to meet Wednesday with Democratic Sens. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Tom Carper of Delaware, then Thursday with Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the White House said.",

            "article_content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a judge's order to restore a\u00a0week\u00a0of early\u00a0voting\u00a0in swing-state\u00a0Ohio. At issue are a series of Republican-backed changes that Democrats allege disproportionately burden black voters and those who lean Democratic. Such policies include the elimination of a\u00a0week\u00a0of\u00a0early\u00a0voting\u00a0in whichOhio\u00a0residents could also register to\u00a0vote, known as golden\u00a0week. Plaintiffs including the state's Democratic Party had claimed the burden on voters outweighs any benefit to the state. But the state's attorneys argued that the\u00a0voting\u00a0changes were minor and that residents have many opportunities to\u00a0vote. They also noted that the changes have been in place for two general elections. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled Tuesday that the law that made the cut still allows for \"abundant\" opportunities to\u00a0vote. The ruling comes after the state appealed a decision by U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in May. He sided with Democrats on their golden-week claim, ruling that the cut violates the\u00a0Voting\u00a0Rights Act and voters' equal protection rights. Watson had said statistical and anecdotal evidence presented in the case reflected that black voters use same-day voter registration and\u00a0early\u00a0voting\u00a0options at higher rates than whites. While the court can't predict how African-Americans will turn out in future elections, he said, \"It is reasonable to conclude from this evidence that their right to\u00a0vote\u00a0will be modestly burdened\" by the law. More than 60,000 people\u00a0voted\u00a0during golden\u00a0week\u00a0in 2008, while over 80,000 cast ballots during the period in 2012, Watson had noted in his decision. The appeals court reversed Watson's decision. The 6th Circuit said that in evaluating the law's burden, \"We find that elimination of Golden\u00a0Week\u00a0is a small part of what remains, objectively viewed, a generous\u00a0early\u00a0voting\u00a0schedule.\" Judge David McKeague wrote the opinion, joined by Judge Richard Allen Griffin. Both were appointed by Republican President George W. Bush. Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch disagreed. She was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama. The state's attorneys said scrapping the days helped alleviate administrative burdens for local elections officials while reducing costs and the potential of fraud. Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted has said if it was constitutional for lawmakers to expand the\u00a0votingperiod, it must also be constitutional for them to change it.",

(AP) Donald Trump\u2019s renewed call for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign over her critical comments on his presidential bid is really just a suggestion. Why? Like 'em or not, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. Impeachment by Congress is the only legal avenue that exists for punishing or removing a Supreme Court justice -- a historically rare option that\u2019s been tried, but has never succeeded. The congressional bar for impeachment starts relatively low -- that is, the House only needs a simple majority to vote for impeachment proceedings to begin; but the bar is raised fairly high in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to convict. The last \u2013 and only \u2013\u00a0time this happened was in 1804, when the House voted to impeach Justice Samuel Chase. He was accused of a range of offenses concerning his conduct on the bench \u2013 but the Senate voted to acquit in 1805, and Chase stayed on the bench. One other justice, Abe Fortas, resigned in 1969 amid threat of impeachment over an ethics controversy. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News last year that the Senate can barely muster 50 votes, let alone 67, to oust a Supreme Court justice. He called instead for judicial retention elections every eight years \u2013 something that does not currently exist.",

            "article_content": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that Texas' strict\u00a0voter\u00a0ID\u00a0law violates the Voting Rights Act and ordered changes before the November election. The ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals instructs a lower court to make changes that fix the \"discriminatory effect\" of the 2011 law, but to do so in a way that disrupts this year's election season as little as possible. President Barack Obama's administration took the unusual step of deploying the weight of the U.S. Justice Department into the case when it challenged the law, which requires Texas residents to show one of seven forms of approved identification. The state and other supporters say the Texas law prevents fraud. Opponents say it discriminates by requiring forms of\u00a0ID\u00a0that are more difficult to obtain for low-income, African-American and Latino\u00a0voters. \"We are extremely pleased with this outcome. This law will no longer prevent eligible\u00a0voters\u00a0from casting a ballot this November,\" attorney Gerry Herbert, a member of the legal team that challenged the law, said following Wednesday's ruling. The Texas Democratic Party also immediately celebrated, declaring that \"the most restrictive and discriminatory Republican\u00a0voter\u00a0ID\u00a0law in country has been struck down.\" The New Orleans-based 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the issue after a three-judge panel ruled last year that the law violated the Voting Rights Act. Lawyers for Texas have argued that the state makes free IDs easy to obtain. They said any inconveniences or costs involved in getting one do not substantially burden the right to vote, and that the Justice Department and other plaintiffs had failed to prove that the law resulted in denying anyone the right to vote. Opponents countered in briefs that trial testimony indicated various bureaucratic and economic burdens associated with the law \u2014 for instance, the difficulty in finding and purchasing a proper birth certificate to obtain an\u00a0ID. A brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union cited testimony in other\u00a0voter\u00a0ID\u00a0states indicating numerous difficulties faced by people, including burdensome travel and expenses to get required documentation to obtain IDs. Texas doesn't recognize university IDs from college students, but it does accept concealed handgun licenses as proof of identity. Despite being struck down by a federal district judge in 2014, the law has been enforced in recent elections. The decision came so close to Election Day that the 5th Circuit panel allowed it to be enforced that year to avoid\u00a0voter\u00a0confusion. In April, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal to stop Texas from enforcing the law pending the current appeal. But the court said it could revisit the issue as the November elections approach.",

            "article_content": "John Roberts reports from Washington, D.C. We must speak of contingencies in the presidential election year of 2016 because it has already been so strange. The Donald Trump phenomenon. A Sherman-esque non-candidacy by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. A third--party candidacy. And efforts to court Mitt Romney or Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., are prime examples. Certainly a third party could prevent the Democratic or Republican presidential nominees from earning an absolute majority to win in the electoral college. This is a primer for a contingency, which hasn\u2019t unfolded in American political history in 191 years. It might not happen this round, either but just consider the past year in politics. The country\u2019s founding fathers feared a direct, \u201cpopular\u201d election of the president. So while the founders erected a system for eligible voters to cast ballots for president, they also simultaneously constructed an astonishing three safety valves to potentially curb the will of the masses, diffusing political power when selecting a chief executive. Creating the electoral college was the first circuit-breaker. The founders distributed \u201celectoral votes\u201d based on the population of each state. They granted the smallest states a minimum of three electoral votes -- based on the standard distribution of at least two U.S. senators and one member in the House. But bigger states would command more sway in the electoral college, because, well, they were bigger. Hence, the reason New York and Virginia were power players in the early years. In essence, voters were choosing \u201celectors\u201d for their state who would cast ballots on behalf of the candidate who emerged victorious. However, electors are free to vote the way they want and not bound to the candidate who prevails in a state. That produces the periodic phenomenon of \u201cfaithless\u201d electors casting ballots in the electoral college. Washington, D.C., and 29 states have laws latching electors to candidates. But those statues are generally viewed as unenforceable. There have only been 157 instances of faithless electors for president or vice president in the history of the republic. No faithless electors have swayed the outcome of an election. The last faithless elector incident came in 2004. An unknown elector from Minnesota cast their ballot for then-Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential nominee, instead of now-Secretary of State John Kerry, the Democratic standard-bearer. Regardless, when writing the Constitution, the founders dictated that the House and Senate would serve as the ultimate arbiter of each state\u2019s electoral slate. This is the second circuit breaker. In the period between the election and inauguration, the new House and Senate would convene a Joint Meeting of Congress to tabulate and check the electoral vote. This entails an actual adjudication and certification by each body. But what happens if a dispute arises when checking the electoral college slates? A member of the House and Senate must jointly contest an individual state\u2019s electoral ballots. If that happens, the House and Senate dissolve into their separate bodies, debate the issue for two hours and then vote to accept or reject that state\u2019s electoral vote. The House and Senate later reconvene to finally settle the issue in the Joint Meeting with the speaker of the House and the president of the Senate (the vice president) presiding. In early 2001, various members of the Congressional Black Caucus aimed to challenge Florida\u2019s electoral slate from the previous fall\u2019s disputed presidential election. Then-Vice President Gore repeatedly asked each CBC member if they had a Senate sponsor to jointly contest the Florida electoral slate. None did. \u201cI don\u2019t care that it is not signed by a senator,\u201d famously proclaimed Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., when pressed by Gore if she had a Senate advocate. The irony of course is that the person who stood to benefit from a successful challenge of Florida\u2019s electoral ballot was none other than Gore -- the 2000 Democratic Presidential nominee. In other words, this was getting awkward. But not for long. \u201cThe chair would advise that the rules do care,\u201d Gore chastened Waters as he rejected her petition. The move triggered applause from congressional Republicans in the House chamber. Officials reported voting irregularities in Ohio in 2004. The late-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, raised the issue about Ohio\u2019s electoral slate during the January, 2005 Joint Meeting of Congress certifying the electoral college. Only this time around, Tubbs Jones found a Senate patron in Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The House and Senate then met separately to debate and vote on the Tubbs Jones/Boxer objection. The House and Senate eventually found the Ohio electoral votes to be in order. President George W. Bush secured a second term in the White House. Electoral college issues don\u2019t always stem from questions surrounding the veracity of a state\u2019s electoral votes. Sometimes math is the issue. 538 ballots now comprise the electoral college -- 435 House seats, 100 Senate seats and three ballots allotted to the District of Columbia. Based on D.C.\u2019s population, the electoral college distributes the three electoral votes to the district -- the same number it would have if the city were a state - two Senate seats and one House seat. So, 270 electoral votes is the magic number to win the presidency. That number was not always the winning threshold in the electoral college because the country was much smaller. The District never registered in the electoral college until the 1960s. However, the founders anticipated the possibility of a scenario in which\u00a0 nobody captured an outright majority of the electoral vote. In other words, the most votes does not guarantee a win in the electoral college. The successful candidate must secure 50.1 percent of all electoral votes tabulated. That was not the case in the presidential election of 1800. Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson tied at 73 electoral votes. Astonishingly, sitting President John Adams only marshaled 65 electoral votes. This brings us to the third safety valve designed by the founders. Something called a \u201cContingent Election.\u201d The U.S. has only witnessed two contingent elections in its history. The first occasion followed the 1800 mayhem and again in 1824. If no candidate harnesses an absolute majority in the electoral college, the Constitution pitches the election for president into the House of Representatives \u2013 and the choice for vice president is left up to the Senate. In the House, each state votes as a delegation among the top three electoral vote getters. The District, despite holding three electoral votes in the electoral college, is cut out of the picture altogether in a contingent election because it technically does not have a voting House member. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, is\u00a0 just that: the District\u2019s delegate to Congress. Not a full-fledged House member. The top three electoral college vote getters are eligible for consideration for president on the House floor in a contingent election. In 1801, it was Burr, Jefferson and Adams. That contingent election unfolded so early in U.S. history that they had yet to construct the House chamber. So House members voted in what is now the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on the Senate side of the Capitol. The exercise consumed seven days before Jefferson finally vanquished Burr and Adams on the 36th ballot. But the vote for president by state delegation in the House introduces an entirely new dynamic into the process. Consider that California -- the big-shouldered state in the electoral college with 55 electoral votes -- is reduced to just a single vote in the contingent election, the same as Delaware or South Dakota. More Democrats comprise California\u2019s House delegation than Republicans. California would be expected to repeat its long-standing trend of voting for the Democratic candidate for president. So California remains the same. But try a swing state like Wisconsin. It currently has ten electoral votes. Republicans outnumber Democrats in its House delegation five to three. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., is retiring. His district is up for grabs this fall. Let\u2019s say Ribble\u2019s seat flips to a Democrat. The Wisconsin House delegation is now even with four Republicans and four Democrats. And if the state is deadlocked, well, Wisconsin\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t count toward the total. Ryan would preside over this pandemonium -- that is, if he\u2019s still speaker. He is cognizant of his role chairing the Republican convention this summer in Cleveland. Ryan\u2019s said he wants to be \u201cSwitzerland\u201d and \u201cneutral.\u201d But in a hypothetical contingent election, would Ryan vote as part of the Wisconsin delegation? Or would he remain above the fray, tipping the balance of Wisconsin\u2019s delegation to the Democrats at four to three and breaking a possible deadlock? In the contingent election of 1825, John Quincy Adams squared off with Andrew Jackson. Adams eventually secured the presidency even though Jackson won more popular and more electoral votes in 1824. Jackson later accused House Speaker Henry Clay, of Kentucky, of engineering a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d to catapult Adams to the presidency. Jackson accused Adams of offering Clay a cabinet post in exchange for whipping the vote for president in his favor. Clay harbored a visceral contempt for Jackson over how he handled the battle of New Orleans. Ergo, there could be good reason for the House speaker to stay above the fray should a contingent election ever unfold again. The contingent election of 1825 went a lot faster than the one in 1801. The House elected Adams president on the first ballot, compared to the 36 ballots needed to propel Thomas Jefferson to the presidency nearly a quarter century before. But what happens if the contingent election drags on past inauguration day? There is a very small window in which to settle an electoral college dispute -- between the start of the new Congress in January and inauguration day on January 20? The country can\u2019t operate without a president. Well, there\u2019s a contingency for that, too. Believe it or not, the sitting Vice President from the old administration becomes acting president until the House mediates the electoral college issue. In other words, in this strange world of hypotheticals, Joe Biden has a chance to perhaps serve as President of the United States \u2026 at least for a few days.",

            "article_content": "Strategy Room: David Morey and Charmaine Yoest on how the presidential candidates respond to the decision Donald Trump thinks Justice Clarence Thomas is \"very strong and consistent\" and praises colleague Samuel Alito -- with those robed role-models in mind, the GOP nominee already has floated 21 people he thinks would be perfect companions on the Supreme Court. Democrat Hillary Clinton, for her part, spontaneously \"loved\"\u00a0the idea of a Justice Barack Obama, but has been coy on others she thinks deserve a bench nomination. Even with the Supreme Court kicking off its term Monday, it is this election-year guessing game \u2013 over whom the eventual winner will nominate to fill the court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia\u2019s death \u2013 that\u2019s captured the attention of court watchers. The uncertainty, meanwhile, has left the court itself seemingly tip-toeing around major issues, as justices wait for a nomination \u2013 and confirmation \u2013 to break what is essentially a 4-4 split. Nothing less than the ideological balance of the court is at stake on Nov. 8. Despite recent GOP trial balloons hinting otherwise, President Obama's choice of Judge Merrick Garland may not get a Senate hearing and vote, leaving it for the next White House occupant to put his or her instant legacy-building stamp on the third branch of government. A Clinton pick could signal a decisive shift to the left for the first time in decades. \"Any issue you care about, the Supreme Court is ultimately where it's going to be decided. There are a lot of people that rank this as an important issue for them during this election year,\" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. She said if Clinton is elected, \"it would have a very dramatic shift on the court, and an incredible impact for a generation.\" The Supreme Court, meanwhile, churns along gingerly with an ideologically divided 4-4 bench, preparing to kick off its term Monday with a less-than-impressive docket so far. Caution over its short-term future may leave the justices reluctant to engage for now in divisive cases, absent a long-term five-vote majority. Several appeals dealing with the death penalty, criminal law and voting districts have strong racial underpinnings, and will be argued this fall. \"When you think about the rights in the balance, whether it's racial equality, gender equality, reproductive access, religious liberty, all of these issues that go to the Supreme court, Americans care deeply about,\" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. \"So I think they care deeply about who will be appointing the next justices.\" Until then, some on the court worry an eight-member bench will shy from fully deciding contentious cases -- opting to rule on narrow aspects, or splitting evenly where no binding precedent is established. \"A tie does nobody any good,\" Justice Elena Kagan said earlier this month. \"We're there to resolve cases that need deciding, answer hotly contested issues that need resolving, and you can't do that with a tie vote.\" For issues like abortion, executive power, health care, and national security -- who sits on the Supreme Court matters. In the years between 1969 and 1993, Republican presidents placed 11 members on the high court, including two chief justices. Democrats got zero. In the two-dozen years since, one Republican leader appointed only two justices -- Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts -- while a pair of Democrats successfully named four. Garland remains a wild card. Members of the high court know that political reality all too well. \"It's likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,\" an increasingly chatty Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in July. Her recent comments on Trump drew bipartisan scorn. \"He is a faker,\" she told CNN. \"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.\" Ginsburg offered regrets for her \"ill-advised\" remarks, but not a direct apology to Trump. The GOP nominee also drew criticism for suggesting last month that \"Second Amendment people\" might not take kindly to Clinton's judicial choices if she wins in November. He denied suggesting violence against anyone for their views. As for Clinton, legal and political sources close to her campaign are privately suggesting she, if elected, could preserve the status quo and re-nominate the well-liked moderate-liberal Garland next January, avoiding a bruising confirmation in her first 100 days with a potentially more left-leaning pick. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said last month he was convinced Clinton will stick with the 63-year-old Garland. The nominee herself has said little about her options, except for one. \"I love that, wow,\" she told supporters in February when someone suggested she name her former boss, Obama. Clinton also has said she has a \"litmus test\" for a justice nominee, and emphasized any potential appointments would have to support the Voting Rights Act and campaign finance reform. Trump\u2019s list includes a mix of state and federal judges -- all conservatives. The Republican says he would appoint \"pro-life\" justices who are \"very conservative\" and \"like Judge Scalia.\"",

            "article_content": "Bias Bash: Ellen Ratner on why the media should be holding Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to task for her recent comments on Donald Trump Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ripped Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a Twitter message late Tuesday. \"Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me,\" Trump wrote on his Twitter account. \u201cHer mind is shot \u2014 resign.\" Trump has been on the defensive after Ginsburg told the Associated Press last week that she felt he was unqualified for the position. She said in an interview that she didn't want to think about the possibility that Trump would be president and predicted that Democrat Hillary Clinton would win. Ginsburg also joked that she would move to New Zealand if Trump were elected. Trump told the New York Times earlier Tuesday that her comments were \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace to the court.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly \u2026 I think she should apologize to the court. I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible,\u201d he added. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that it was \"totally inappropriate\" for Ginsburg to criticize Trump. McConnell said that members of the Supreme Court shouldn't weigh in on American elections. \"It raises a level of skepticism that the American people have from time to time about just how objective the Supreme Court is, whether they're over there to call the balls and strikes, or weigh in on one side or another,\" he said.

            "article_content": "IOWA CITY, Iowa  \u2013 Convicted\u00a0felons\u00a0in\u00a0Iowa\u00a0may be automatically stripped of their\u00a0voting\u00a0rights\u00a0for life unless those\u00a0rights\u00a0are restored by the governor, a divided\u00a0Iowa\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0ruled Thursday. The 4-3 decision permanently disenfranchises thousands of former offenders and\u00a0upholds\u00a0Iowa's\u00a0status as one of the most restrictive states for\u00a0voting\u00a0by\u00a0felons. Democrats and civil-liberties advocates expressed disappointment in a\u00a0court\u00a0known for its 2009 ruling legalizing gay marriage and other progressive decisions. \"This ruling means that\u00a0Iowa\u00a0will continue to serve as a notorious outlier when it comes to restricting people'sright\u00a0to\u00a0vote,\" said Julie Ebenstein, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's\u00a0Voting\u00a0Rights\u00a0Project. Iowa's\u00a0top elections official, Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate, praised the ruling, saying it was in line with the constitution and state law. Felons\u00a0had long been disqualified from casting ballots and holding public office, although the\u00a0court\u00a0had not ruled definitively. At issue was the interpretation of an 1857 clause in the\u00a0Iowa\u00a0Constitution declaring that no \"person convicted of any infamous crime shall be entitled to the privilege of an elector.\" The ACLU brought a challenge on behalf of Kelli Jo Griffin, who was convicted of a nonviolent drug offense. The group argued that Griffin had not committed an infamous crime and she should not be disenfranchised. Her attorneys urged the\u00a0court\u00a0to rule that only people who commit crimes that are an \"affront to democratic governance\" \u2014 such as treason and corruption \u2014 should be disqualified. The constitution's goal, they argued, was to protect the ballot box, not to punish offenders. Chief Justice Mark Cady endorsed that approach in a 2014 decision that suggested only crimes that are serious and linked to election integrity were infamous. But he disavowed that ruling in Thursday's majority opinion, writing that it had been decided hastily before an election. Cady wrote that he now sees little evidence to support that practice, saying the constitutional measure originated from common law that generally regarded all felonies as infamous. Also,\u00a0Iowa\u00a0lawmakers passed a law in 1994 that defined felonies as infamous crimes and haven't moved to change the standard, he noted. \"The legislative judgment was clearly expressed, and there is no scientific evidence or facts to undermine that judgment,\" he wrote. The decision cannot be appealed since it involves the\u00a0Iowa\u00a0Constitution, not the U.S. Constitution. Dissenting justices said the ruling would perpetuate a system that treats\u00a0felons\u00a0as second-class citizens and disproportionately limits the political power of the state's black population. The decision will \"disqualify thousands of Iowans from exercising the fundamental\u00a0right\u00a0to\u00a0vote\u00a0after they have fully satisfied their criminal sentences, even without a showing of nexus of the crime to the integrity of the electoral process,\" Justice Brent Appel wrote. More than 56,000\u00a0felons\u00a0have been disqualified from participating in\u00a0Iowa\u00a0elections. Civil-liberties advocates had hoped the case would result in most of them being able to\u00a0vote\u00a0in November, when\u00a0Iowa\u00a0could be a swing state in the presidential election. Iowa\u00a0Democratic Party Chairwoman Andy McGuire said the ruling \"keeps\u00a0Iowa\u00a0on the extreme fringe of voter disenfranchisement.\" Iowa, Florida and Kentucky are the only states with lifetime\u00a0voting\u00a0bans\u00a0for\u00a0felons\u00a0unless their\u00a0rights\u00a0are restored by the governor. About 20 ex-offenders have been restored annually since Republican Gov. Terry Branstad returned to office in 2011. On his first day, he issued an order requiring\u00a0felons\u00a0who have finished their sentences to apply to get their\u00a0rights\u00a0back, undoing an automatic restoration process that had been in place under the two prior Democratic governors. The change caused widespread confusion. Griffin was charged in a state voting-fraud investigation after she\u00a0voted\u00a0in an uncontested 2013 municipal election in her hometown, Montrose. Griffin had completed her sentence and believed her\u00a0voting\u00a0rights\u00a0were restored. Jurors acquitted her at trial, sparing the mother of four a possible prison sentence. Branstad has defended his policy, saying it encourages offenders to pay restitution. He has moved to make the application process easier, although it remains a major barrier. Appel said the decision leaves\u00a0felons\u00a0\"subject to flip-flopping executive orders depending upon the political philosophy of the executive.\"",

            "article_content": "LANSING, Mich.  \u2013 The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday declined to let Michigan's new ban on straight-party voting take effect for the November election, rejecting state officials' request to halt lower court rulings that blocked the Republican-sponsored law. The court's decision means voters will still be able to use the popular straight-ticket option, which allows them to support all candidates from one party with a single mark. In issuing a preliminary injunction in July, a federal district judge ruled the law signed by Gov. Rick Snyder would create longer lines and disproportionately burden black voters who are more likely to use the straight-ticket option. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month denied a request by Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson for a stay pending appeal. So did the Supreme Court. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, said they would have granted the request. Forty other states prohibit straight-party voting. The option is popular in Michigan cities with large black populations. It has been on the books for 125 years and has been a common choice in some counties that are steadfastly loyal to Republicans, too. Snyder and majority GOP lawmakers enacted the straight-party voting ban in January, saying the option was rare nationally and getting rid of it would lead to a better-informed electorate. Democrats accused the GOP of seeking partisan gain, particularly in down-ballot races for the state Board of Education and university boards. Some, alluding to the belief that candidates at the top of the ballot influence lower-level elections, also said Republicans were trying to inoculate themselves if presidential candidate Donald Trump is beaten badly by Hillary Clinton. The lawsuit challenging the law was filed by attorney Mark Brewer, former head of the state Democratic Party, on behalf of three people and a union-affiliated group. The case is not over. The three-judge 6th Circuit panel that declined to intervene immediately will next fully consider the state's appeal of U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain's injunction, the outcome of which will affect future elections. Separately, Drain will schedule a trial on whether he should permanently stop the law from taking effect. Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon, who accused Schuette of wasting state money on the \"Hail Mary\" appeal, said while the straight-ticket option is intact for November, \"there's no doubt in my mind that this fight is not over.\" Schuette, a Republican, said he would respect the high court's decision, but that it is his \"duty to defend Michigan's laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states.\"",

Ted Cruz's suggestion of an indefinite Supreme Court vacancy under a President Hillary Clinton raises questions about the credibility and integrity of Republicans who have said the next president should get to the choose who fills the vacancy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday. Earnest was asked during Thursday's White House press briefing about the Texas Republican's statement that there is a long historical precedent for a Supreme Court operating with fewer justices. Earnest replied that the notion of opposing any nomination put forward by a Democratic president would be inconsistent with longstanding Senate tradition. He said historically that the Senate has evaluated candidates based on their merits. \"Republicans this year have deviated from that tradition by refusing to even consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court,\" Earnest said. Cruz's comment also seemingly contradicts an earlier position he took during the GOP primary when he told CNN, \"I think 2016 should be a referendum on the Supreme Court.\" Sen. John McCain said earlier this month that Republicans would unite against any Supreme Court nominee that Clinton puts forward if she becomes president, though an aide later said that McCain would examine the record of anyone nominated for the high court and vote for or against that person based on their qualifications. Obama nominated Garland in March to fill the vacancy left by the death of former Justice Antonin Scalia, but Senate Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, declined to hold hearings as they insisted the voters choosing the next president would have the final say on the vacancy. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that McConnell \"has been clear that it will be the next president who makes the nomination for the Scalia vacancy.\" The size of the court is set by federal law and has changed over the years, but has been nine justices for most of its existence. Initially, there were six justices. The court reached its highest number, 10, during the Civil War. There has been a nine-justice court since 1869.",

            "article_content": "On 'America's Newsroom,' Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer says the president 'took sides' and politicized the process Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his combat outpost in Afghanistan and spent five years in captivity, will be court-martialed under a new commander-in-chief. A military judge decided Tuesday to delay Bergdahl's trial from August until February to provide time for resolving disputes over the defense team's access to classified documents. Bergdahl, now 30, sat attentively in his dress blue formal uniform, his infantry cord looped under the epaulet on his right shoulder, during the brief hearing. The soldier from Hailey, Idaho, faces charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The latter charge is relatively rare and carries the potential of life in prison. He was exchanged in a controversial swap for five high-ranking Taliban commanders from Guantanamo Bay in 2014. A February start would mean the court-martial could make headlines only weeks after the new commander-in-chief is sworn in as president. The judge, Col. Jeffrey Nance, also ruled that media organizations could hire a stenographer to capture courtroom discussions during the trial, and he gave Army prosecutors one week to provide reporters covering the case with online access to court documents. The judge postponed deciding a dispute that could influence how much punishment Bergdahl could face if convicted. The Army's primary investigating officer last year recommended against Bergdahl facing jail time, saying there is no evidence that any service members were killed or wounded searching for him in Afghanistan. A preliminary hearing officer recommended against a bad-conduct discharge. But those recommendations were scrapped in December by the general overseeing the case. Gen. Robert Abrams, who leads the Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, instead sided with an Army lawyer's recommendation for a general court-martial. Bergdahl's defense lawyers contend that the Army lawyer's advice to Abrams was so incomplete that it misled the four-star general. Nance did not explain why he opted against taking up the issue Tuesday. Bergdahl was quickly captured after walking off his combat post in Afghanistan in 2009, and held as a prisoner by the Taliban and its allies until President Barack Obama exchanged five Guantanamo Bay detainees for his safe return, saying the U.S. \"does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind.\" Obama's decision was harshly criticized. Some members of Congress said it jeopardized national security. Trump has targeted Bergdahl for scorn dozens of times on the campaign trail, saying among other things that he should have been thrown from a plane. The defense's complaints about Trump have no bearing on the case right now, according to Rachel VanLandingham, a former Air Force lawyer who teaches at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. But if he is elected in November and keeps up his harsh comments, the defense could more effectively argue that a President Trump is unfairly pressuring Army brass for a conviction, she said. Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have been notified that threats against Bergdahl continue. \"Given the many incendiary comments that have been broadcast and otherwise disseminated about Sgt. Bergdahl, his immediate commander at Fort Sam Houston has taken measures to ensure his physical safety when leaving the installation,\" his attorneys wrote in February. A spokesman at the Texas post declined to describe these measures, citing security considerations. But as \"a group of soldiers, battle buddies, we all look out for each other,\" Sgt. Maj. Matt Howard said. Bergdahl can come and go the same as any other soldier from Fort Sam Houston, where he works a desk job in a headquarters unit, handling \"a lot of administrative work that needs to be done. Paperwork, moving stuff from place to place, things like that,\" Howard said. Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Governor Betsy McCaughey sounds off about the balloting equipment provided by a company tied to the billionaire Newly revealed emails posted by WikiLeaks show top aides to Hillary Clinton went out of their way to keep a certain VIP happy: Uber-liberal billionaire George Soros. The emails, hacked from the account of Clinton Campaign Chairman and Soros ally John Podesta, disclose that Clinton was advised to do fundraisers simply to make Soros \u201chappy.\u201d They also indicate the 85-year-old Hungarian-born heavyweight, through his top aides, freely reached out to Podesta to make Soros\u2019 wishes clear on issues ranging from trade to migration to the Supreme Court. In one instance, trusted Clinton adviser Huma Abedin wrote to now-Campaign Manager Robby Mook on Oct. 7, 2014, to tell him Clinton was having dinner with Soros. Abedin said she expected Soros would eventually ask Clinton to appear at a fundraiser for America Votes, one of the many liberal organizations Soros helps fund, and Abedin wanted to know how to proceed. \u201cI would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy),\u201d Mook replied. NEW REPORTS REVEAL SOROS INFLUENCE During her time as secretary of state, Clinton was forwarded from Soros\u2019 aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing \u201ca serious situation\u201d in Albania. Soros even included two actions that \u201cneed to be done urgently.\u201d One of the suggestions was appointing \u201ca mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak\u2026\u201d Clinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort. Just hours after Associate Justice Antonin Scalia was reported dead on Feb. 13, 2016, the president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations also emailed Podesta. \u201cRemember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?\u201d Chris Stone asked cryptically. Podesta replied: \u201cYup.\u201d Most of the Soros-related correspondences with Podesta came via Michael Vachon, an adviser and spokesman for Soros, who frequently emailed Podesta to schedule phone calls and meetings and relay his boss\u2019 policy positions. Many of the messages were brief or mysterious. On Feb. 23, 2015, Vachon wrote to Podesta that he needed to tell him something \u201cseparately, important, timely but certainly not urgent.\u201d In a message dated Jan. 13, 2009, Vachon thanked Podesta for meeting with Soros the previous day. \u201cHe found it extremely useful,\u201d Vachon wrote. Other emails show a stream of Soros\u2019 policy beliefs being passed to Podesta: An invitation to the screening of a film about climate change at Soros\u2019 house in July 2015; a short documentary based on Soros\u2019 essays about Ukraine in January 2015; a Soros-authored piece titled \u201cRecapitalize the Banking System\u201d in October 2008. On March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding \u201cTPP and Malaysia\u2019s Corruption Crisis.\u201d The document criticized President Obama for making \u201cvisible compromises\u201d in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific. \u201cIn general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,\u201d Vachon wrote. \u201cIn a separate email I will send you George\u2019s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.\u201d While Vachon said Soros wasn\u2019t interested in discussing \u201cthe campaign per se\u201d at that dinner, his involvement in the 2016 election is extensive. As of July, Soros had donated $25 million to help elect Clinton and other Democrats, Politico reported.",

The decision will make available all of\u00a0Clinton's\u00a0minute-by-minute schedules before the presidential election. Those planning documents offer a detailed look at\u00a0Clinton's\u00a0daily routine during her four-year tenure as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. The State Department provided the AP some of the Democratic presidential nominee's official calendars from her time at the department, but some of those calendars had been edited after her events and, in some cases, names of those who met with her had been omitted. The department has so far released about half of her more complete daily schedules. \"As stated in today\u2019s court filing, the Department had no objection to shifting its resources as long as its overall processing burden was not increased,\" State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement. \"Consequently, the Department plans to complete its production of former Secretary Clinton\u2019s schedules not later than October 17.\u201d The new agreement Thursday was drawn up after government lawyers told the AP last week that the department expected to release the last of the detailed daily schedules around Dec. 30, weeks after the election. The AP had objected to the delays. The daily schedules drew attention last week after the AP reviewed the two years of schedules released so far, plus\u00a0Clinton's\u00a0official calendars. From those, the AP determined that more than half the people who\u00a0Clinton\u00a0met or spoke with \u2014 outside of members of the U.S. or foreign governments \u2014 had donated to the\u00a0Clinton\u00a0Foundation either personally or through companies or groups. The AP's review focused on\u00a0Clinton's\u00a0discretionary contacts with outside interests and excluded her meetings or calls with federal officials or foreign government representatives, because those contacts were part of her regular diplomatic obligations. Clinton\u00a0has said the AP's analysis was flawed because it did not account fully for all meetings and phone calls during her entire term as secretary. She also said the analysis should have included meetings with federal employees and foreign diplomats. The State Department's decision Thursday to turn over all of the more-detailed daily schedules by Oct. 17 means it will have to triple its pace of producing 600 pages a month. That production schedule was ordered last January by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon. The AP first asked for all\u00a0Clinton's\u00a0calendars in 2010 and again in 2013 under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, but the State Department did not release them. After further delays, the AP sued the State Department in federal court in March 2015 to obtain the planning materials and other records, leading to Leon's order.

            "article_content": "Voters are not impressed with the presumptive Republican nominee, as his rhetoric continues to panic the establishment; Carl Cameron with the GOP roundup for 'Special Report' Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been sued at least 60 times by individuals and businesses who accuse him of failing to pay for work done at his various properties, according to two published reports. USA Today also reported, citing data from the Department of Labor, that two of Trump's now-defunct businesses were cited 24 times beginning in 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage. The cases were settled when the companies \u2014 the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and Trump Mortgage LLC \u2014 agreed to pay back wages. The paper also reported that more than 200 liens have been filed against Trump or his businesses by contractors and employees dating back to the 1980s. The claimants include curtain makers, chandelier shops, cabinet makers and even Trump's lawyers who represented him in prior cases. Trump told USA Today that he only withheld payment from contractors if he wasn't pleased with their work. \"Let\u2019s say that they do a job that\u2019s not good, or a job that they didn\u2019t finish, or a job that was way late. I\u2019ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the country should be doing.\" The USA Today report cited one case involving a 1990 project at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, during which New Jersey regulators found that Trump had failed to pay at least 253 subcontractors in full or on time. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, former Trump Plaza president Jack O'Connell said Trump made withholding payment a part of his business strategy. \"Part of how he did business as a philosophy was to negotiate the best price he could,\" O'Connell said. \"And then when it came time to pay the bills,\" Trump would say \"'I\u2019m going to pay you but I\u2019m going to pay you 75% of what we agreed to.'\" O'Connell added that Trump Plaza executives used to pay vendors in full despite their boss's orders, saying \"it used to infuriate him.\" More recently, USA Today reported that the management company behind Trump National Doral Miami settled with 48 servers who sued for unpaid overtime after working a 10-day Passover event. The average settlement for each worker was $800. Also last month, a Florida judge ordered that the resort be foreclosed on and sold to pay a painter more than $30,000 for his work as part of a Doral renovation more than two years ago. In that case, the manager of the contractor behind the renovation testified that the painter was not paid because Trump had \"already paid enough.\" In his ruling, the judge noted that Trump's attorneys \"visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact\" with the witness. Those attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale. Click for more from USA Today. Click for more from The Wall Street Journal.",

Evangelicalism is no longer exclusively led by white males who are 60, 70 years old.\" He has not made an endorsement in the presidential race. (AP Photo/David Goldman) (The Associated Press) Evangelicals, deeply divided over Donald Trump, are wrestling with what the tumultuous 2016 election will mean for their future. His candidacy has put a harsh spotlight on the fractures among Christian conservatives, most prominently the rift between old guard religious right leaders who backed the GOP nominee as an ally on abortion, and a comparatively younger generation who considered his personal conduct and rhetoric morally abhorrent. \"This has been a kind of smack in the face, forcing us to ask ourselves, 'What have we become?'\" said Carolyn Custis James, an evangelical activist and author who writes about gender roles in the church. The outcome of this self-examination is as important for evangelicals as it is for the Republican Party. Christian conservatives have been among the most reliable members of the GOP coalition. Recent PRRI polls found nearly seven in 10 evangelicals backed Trump. Yet, those numbers are lower than the 79 percent who voted for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a Mormon who had struggled to win over conservative Protestants for theological and other reasons. Any election post-mortem will, of course, be shaped by who wins the White House. A Hillary Clinton victory could draw energy away from any re-evaluation of the religious right, given her support for abortion rights and gay rights, and the opportunity she will have to shape the U.S. Supreme Court. While many younger evangelicals have fought for a broad range of concerns, including fighting climate change and poverty, they are staunchly opposed to abortion, often more so than their parents. \"I think there could be a resurgence in some way of some kind of Christian right approach to politics,\" said John Fea, a historian at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, and author of \"Was America Founded as a Christian Nation: A Historical Introduction.\" \"Many evangelicals, whether 'Never Trump' or willing to support Trump, are ultimately shaped by a core set of convictions. They are still going to be \u2014 for good or for bad \u2014 one-, two- or three-issue voters primarily. I think that persists.\" And if Trump wins? Evangelicals who advocated for him, such as Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council and author and broadcaster James Dobson, would feel vindicated before their critics if Trump fulfills his promise to appoint conservative high court justices. \"Very early on he was concerned about the marginalization of Christianity,\" said the Rev. Robert Jeffress, pastor of the megachurch First Baptist Dallas, who advocated for Trump. Jeffress said the candidate reached out to him on the issue a year and a half ago. \"He believes that Christians are continuing to lose their religious freedom in America,\" Jeffress said. Yet, even if Trump proves loyal to Christian conservatives, questions would remain about whether his evangelical supporters traded their integrity for influence. The thrice-married Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women, bragged about grabbing women's genitals, mocked a disabled reporter, maligned Mexican immigrants and insulted the parents of a fallen American Muslim soldier. \"If they can support even Donald Trump, and even after we learn more and more about him, then this has actually been a charade all along designed to raise money or to grasp for power or to build institutions or personal platforms,\" said Collin Hansen, a longtime Republican and editorial director of the Gospel Coalition, an interdenominational evangelical ministry. He said he hoped leaders who opposed Trump had retained enough credibility to provide \"something to build on.\" Those leaders include Russell Moore, head of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention; Peter Wehner, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center who served three Republican presidents; editors for the influential evangelical magazines Christianity Today and WORLD; and many prominent evangelical women. Deborah Fikes, a former representative to the U.N. for the World Evangelical Alliance, endorsed Hillary Clinton. Christian conservatives had split over politics long before this presidential race. Many younger Christians had rejected the strategies of the Moral Majority and Christian Coalition as harmful to the church. A study by Brad Fulton of Indiana University found a significant decrease in recent years in conservative Protestant churches distributing voter guides \u2014 a staple of religious right mobilizing \u2014 or engaging in political activity in their congregations. At the same time, conservative churches have become home to growing numbers of Latinos and immigrants from other countries with different voting patterns. In a recent PRRI poll, nearly two-thirds of white evangelical voters said they would back Trump, while nearly two-thirds of non-white evangelicals supported Clinton. \"We are not the same community as the 1980s. We are not the same community as the 1990s. Evangelicalism is no longer exclusively led by white males who are 60, 70 years old,\" said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, an evangelical group that counts 40,000 churches as members. He did not make an endorsement in the presidential race. Still, that shift to a more diverse church with a new generation of leaders is only just beginning. Many of the older religious right figures who backed Trump continue to have an impact through their organizations and Christian radio, even though their influence has dwindled. \"There will be a segment of white evangelicals after Trump who say never again, but there will still be a significant and unfortunate vocal portion of white evangelicalism that doesn't change much,\" said Jemar Tisby, director of the African American Leadership Initiative at Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi, and co-founder of the Reformed African American Network. Moore was an early and frequent critic of Trump, to the point where the candidate hit back on Twitter, calling Moore \"a nasty guy with no heart!\" Moore puts evangelical Trump supporters in two categories: those who promoted Trump as the morally good choice and others who acknowledged Trump's moral flaws but feared for religious conservatives under a Clinton administration. David Green, a Pentecostal Christian and founder of the Hobby Lobby arts and crafts chain, had rejected Trump during the GOP primaries as unqualified and lacking humility, but then endorsed him in September, saying the nominee was the only chance to protect religious liberty. Green had successfully sued over the Obamacare requirement that employers provide coverage for birth control, winning religious exemptions for for-profit businesses two years ago in a ruling by the Supreme Court. Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention, said, \"I understand those who are lining up with Trump with great reservations. I'm not persuaded by it. But that's different than the people who have been telling us that we need this kind of strongman to save Christianity. \" That distinction may be lost on younger evangelicals disillusioned by this election. Moore said discussion is already under way about religion and political conservatism, and building new institutions to prevent younger Christians from disengaging from political life. \"That conversation will happen with new intensity after the election,\" Moore said. But Molly Worthen, a professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who studies conservative Christianity, cautioned against expecting major change from one election year. \"The inclination of many conservative activists will be dwelling on Trump's idiosyncrasies as a candidate,\" Worthen said. \"His message of taking this country back and saving it for Christians or for white people will still resonate with a huge number of people.\"",

            "article_content": "WICHITA, Kan. \u2013 A judge said Tuesday that Kansas can't require people to show proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote for federal elections at motor vehicle offices. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson ruled that the state's proof-of-citizenship requirements likely violate a provision in the National Voter Registration Act that requires only \"minimal information\" to determine a voter's eligibility. She ordered Kansas to register thousands of voters whose paperwork is on hold because they did not comply with the requirement. But she put her preliminary injunction on hold until May 31 to give the state a chance to appeal. The state immediately said it would appeal. Unless a higher court halts Robinson's order before the end of the month, it would take effect then, clearing the way for those residents to cast a ballot in the upcoming federal elections. Robinson wrote that \"even if instances of noncitizens voting cause indirect voter disenfranchisement by diluting the votes of citizens, such instances pale in comparison to the number of qualified citizens who have been disenfranchised by this law.\" The evidence shows only three instances in Kansas where noncitizens voted in a federal election between 1995 and 2013, and about 14 noncitizens attempted to register during that time. The court noted the \"magnitude of harm\" caused by 18,372 applicants at motor vehicle offices who were denied registration due to the state's proof-of-citizenship law. Although the registrations of more than 32,000 Kansans were in limbo as of last September, the injunction only applies to those people who registered at motor vehicle offices \u2014 a voter registration process that was established by the federal law popularly known as the \"motor-voter law.\" Early voting for the state's August primary begins on July 13, the judge noted. Robinson wrote that the injunction was necessary because it was unlikely that the case would be decided at trial before the elections. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of voters, said the ruling means thousands of people will be able to vote in the 2016 elections, and \"sends a signal\" to other states which may be considering these kinds of registration requirements. Three other states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia and Alabama \u2014 have passed similar proof of citizenship laws, said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's voting rights project. Arizona is the only other state that has actually implemented it, and that state has made sure eligible voters who register at motor vehicle offices make it onto the voter rolls for federal elections. \"Kansas is really the outlier here,\" Ho said. The federal \"motor-voter law\" establishes various registration methods, and this lawsuit was brought under a provision of that law that allowed people to register to vote when getting their driver's licenses. The ACLU argued Congress intended for motor-voter registration to involve the \"least possible barriers\" to allow citizens to vote in federal elections. Robinson agreed eligibility could be determined by attesting under penalty of perjury that the registrant was a U.S. citizen. Federal law does not prohibit states from requiring more information to determine eligibility to vote in state elections, and Kansas has a dual registration system that bars people who do not provide proof of citizenship from voting in local and state elections. That two-tier process has been challenged under state law, and a state judge held earlier this year in that case that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach lacked legal authority under state law to keep federal registrants from voting in Kansas elections. Kobach's request asking the state judge in that case to reconsider is pending. Kobach said he plans to appeal Robinson's ruling, saying counties would have to distinguish between people who register to vote at driver's license offices and other prospective voters. Also, he said, the state could still require proof-of-citizenship to vote in state and local elections, making the registration system more complex. \"The court's order would be a nightmare to administer,\" Kobach said.",

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) RICHMOND, Va. \u2013 An anti-Donald Trump delegate to the Republican National Committee convention won a small legal victory Monday he hopes will provide a boost to longshot efforts at derailing the billionaire businessman from formally clinching the GOP presidential nomination. But the ruling issued Monday by a federal judge in Richmond is limited in scope. It means that delegates cannot be obligated to vote in a winner-takes-all fashion, as stated in an obscure portion of Virginia election law. But the law in question was so obscure that Republicans had already decided to allocate delegates in a proportional fashion, based on the results of the state's March 1 primary, which Trump won. The ruling leaves that unchanged. Still, Virginia delegate Carroll Correll Jr., who filed the lawsuit last month, counted the ruling as a symbolic victory. \"Requiring delegates to vote for any candidate is unconstitutional and today's announcement is a blow to Trump's efforts,\" said Correll. Correll's lawsuit was backed by Citizens in Charge Foundation, which is part of a diverse group of Trump opponents still trying to find a way for the party to pick another candidate at next week's convention. But Trump supporters scoffed at the notion that the ruling will have any noticeable effect. \"It will have no impact on the Virginia delegation,\" said John Fredericks, a Trump supporter who fought the lawsuit. \"Nor will it have any long term ramification for Donald Trump's quest for the nomination on the first ballot.\" At issue in the lawsuit was a previously ignored part of Virginia election law that mandates delegates to the national convention to vote in a winner-take-all fashion, instead of proportionally as Republicans had planned. Judge Robert E. Payne said Monday the winner-take-all portion of the state law was unconstitutional and can't be enforced. The ruling means that Republicans can vote how they have always intended to \u2014 with the state's 49 delegates bound to vote proportionally based on the March 1 results \u2014 without fear of criminal prosecution. Though the changes of prosecution were always remote: state officials said before the ruling they had no plans to prosecute anyone for how they voted at the GOP convention. Trump won Virginia's March 1 primary with about 35 percent of the vote, netting 17 delegates during the first round of voting at the convention. Delegates are unbound if there is a second round of voting. The Republican National Committee's convention is next week, and Trump is the party's presumptive nominee and only candidate still running.",

            "article_content": "A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday said a lower court must take another look at whether Alabama's Republican-led legislature relied too heavily on race when it redrew the state's voting districts in a way that black leaders say limited minority voting power. The justices split 5-4 across ideological lines in ruling that a three-judge panel did not properly consider complaints that state officials illegally packed black voters into too few voting districts. Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court should have reviewed claims of racial gerrymandering on a district-by-district level, not just statewide. He also said the court didn't apply the right test when it found that race wasn't the primary motivating factor. Breyer said both the district court and the state legislature relied too much on a \"mechanically numerical\" view of whether the new plan reduced minority voting strength. Instead of asking how it could maintain the minority percentages in districts, the court should have asked what percentages the minority should have to elect their candidate of choice. \"Asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer,\" Breyer said. Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a swing vote, joined the court's four liberals in the majority. State officials say they had no choice but to concentrate black voters in some districts, making neighboring seats more white and apt to elect Republicans. African-Americans challenging the state's Republican-drawn maps said black voters should have been somewhat dispersed to increase their influence in elections. A panel of three federal judges had ruled 2-1 in 2013 that the new districts were not discriminatory and did not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution. Like other states, the Alabama Legislature had to redraw political boundaries to reflect population shifts in the 2010 Census. The process can often lead to gerrymandering -- the manipulation of district boundaries to gain a partisan advantage. In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the court's majority \"issues a sweeping holding that will have profound implications for the constitutional ideal of one person, one vote, for the future of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and for the primacy of the state in managing its own elections.\"",

The billionaire businessman and leaders of the nation\u2019s powerful gun lobby joined forces as they amplified warnings that the Supreme Court vacancy only raises the stakes for gun owners in this election. Trump, speaking to the NRA-ILA (Institute for Legislative Action) forum in Louisville, Ky., even challenged Clinton on Friday to release a list of her potential Supreme Court nominees, after he did so earlier this week. \u201cI would like for Hillary Clinton to put a list together also, and I want to see what the list consists of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be day and night, it won\u2019t be good for the people in this room and the country.\u201d He charged, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d He addressed the NRA-ILA forum moments after Executive Director Chris Cox announced the group\u2019s Trump endorsement. In a written statement, Cox also said: \"The stakes in this year's presidential election could not be higher for gun owners. If Hillary Clinton gets the opportunity to replace Antonin Scalia with an anti-gun Supreme Court justice, we will lose the individual right to keep a gun in the home for self-defense. \u2026 \u00a0So the choice for gun owners in this election is clear. And that choice is Donald Trump.\u201d The NRA's endorsement comes significantly earlier in the election cycle than previous endorsements by the group. The group did not endorse 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney until October 2012. However, officials told Fox News ahead of the announcement there is an excitement for Trump among their members that they did not see for Romney or 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump, who noted he has a concealed-carry permit (\u201cBoy would I surprise someone if they hit Trump\u201d), on Friday called for making it easier for law-abiding citizens to carry guns for self-protection, saying they could help prevent terrorist attacks and mass shootings. On the San Bernardino terrorist attack, he said, \u201cif we had guns on the other side [of the attack], it wouldn\u2019t have been that way \u2026boom,\u201d before pledging to abolish gun-free zones. He joined the NRA in warning of dire consequences for the Second Amendment if Clinton is elected president. \u201cCrooked Hillary is the most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wants to take your guns away from you, just remember that.\u201d Clinton will appear Saturday in Florida with the mother of Trayvon Martin and other parents who have lost children to gun violence. She's become a forceful advocate for restrictions meant to reduce the nation's 33,000 annual gun deaths.

On the roster:\u00a0 Hillary\u2019s bet on making 2016 about Trump looks riskier - Time Out: Ye olde Tinder\u00a0 - Trump\u2019s significant shift on illegals - Corporal Wrigglesworth, indeedHILLARY\u2019S BET ON MAKING 2016 ABOUT TRUMP LOOKS RISKIERWhat a difference a week makes. Last Thursday, Hillary Clinton led Donald Trump by an average of nearly 10 points in the Halftime Report average of national head-to-head polls. Today, her lead is down to about 7 points. Polls of a four-way-race with minor-party candidates show a similar 3-point contraction in Clinton\u2019s lead. While it\u2019s true that that 7 points is a big, big deficit \u2013 the same size as the final result in 2008\u2019s beatdown \u2013 any politician would rather be going up than going down. With more than two months to go, trends still matter more than the actual topline numbers themselves. If you want the best snapshot of the state of the race today, look no further than the brand-spanking-new Fox News poll. Treat yourself to some delightful cross-tab action and be amazed. But the shorthand is this: Clinton is still ahead, but people still don\u2019t like her and her post-convention post-Trump stumbles bounce has disappeared. The race has returned to the range where it has been mostly since Trump clinched his party\u2019s nomination in May. A week ago, Clinton\u2019s strategy to keep the focus on Trump and stay out of the spotlight herself was being roundly praised as wise. Now, the alarm bells are ringing: Trump is closing the gap! But it\u2019s not the polling that ought to worry Clinton it\u2019s the possibility that she has made a bad bet in her strategy to make the election about Trump. She did not consider, apparently, the possibility that he could improve as a candidate. Trump\u2019s acolytes are still swooning over his Wednesday double feature: A sophisticated foreign romance in Mexico City followed by a shoot-\u2018em-up action flick set in Phoenix. The \u201cgame change\u201d hyperventilation is over the top, but what Trump did ought to scare the bejeebers out of Clinton. Many expected Trump was walking into a trap in Mexico but he emerged looking like a person who could comport himself on the world stage. Trump took advantage of the massively low expectations for his decorum and won the day. His speech at night was all red meat for his base and may have undercut the outreach to skeptical suburbanites, but he definitely came out ahead on the day. Clinton was out giving a speech to the American Legion but mostly ceded the day to Trump, allowing all eyes to turn to his high-wire act. Her bet did not pay off. When the news is about Clinton, it\u2019s always bad news. A leak, a court order, a report, etc. followed by denial and equivocations. That\u2019s survivable if Trump remains broadly unacceptable to suburban white voters. But what if that changes? What\u2019s the biggest story about Clinton now? Her refusal to give press conferences. Sheesh\u2026 Talk about looking inaccessible and unaccountable. That\u2019s bad if you\u2019re an incumbent but just horrible if you are a contender, especially one dragging around so much baggage. We\u2019ll see what Clinton has in store for after Labor Day, but right now there have to be some in Clinton land wondering if they\u2019ve made a mistake in ceding so much of the calendar to Trump on the assumption that he was simply unable to get his act together.TIME OUT: YE OLDE TINDERBarely a decade after its founding in 1607, Virginia\u2019s Jamestown colony was in big trouble: there weren\u2019t enough ladies. The Atlantic: \u201cAn immediate influx of women was needed to save the floundering colony; its leaders suggested putting out an advertisement targeting wives. The women who responded to this marital request and agreed to marry unknown men in an unfamiliar land were in a sense America\u2019s first mail-order brides. The Virginia Company offered substantial incentives to the women who signed up\u2026a dowry of clothing, linens, and other furnishings, free transportation to the colony, and even a plot of land. They were also promised their pick of wealthy husbands and provided with food and shelter while they made their decision\u2026After a husband was chosen, he would reimburse the Virginia Company for the travel expenses, furnishings, and land with 120 pounds (later raised to 150) of \u2018good leaf\u2019 tobacco\u2026\u201dFlag on the play? -\u00a0Email us at\u00a0HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\u00a0with your tips, comments or questionsSCOREBOARD Average of national head-to-head presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump: Clinton +7.2Average of national four-way presidential polls:\u00a0Clinton vs. Trump vs. Johnson vs. Stein: Clinton 5.4Generic congressional vote:\u00a0Democrats +4.2TRUMP\u2019S SHIFT ON ILLEGALS Byron York was listening and caught the actual policy shift in Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy speech: the fate of the illegal immigrants in the United States would be decided after the border security and domestic enforcement measures he proposes are put in place. You might think of it as sort of a steroidal \u201cself-deportation.\u201d While Trump\u2019s enforcement plan is tougher than past GOP nominees, the overall construct of \u201cenforcement first\u201d is back.\u00a0 WashEx: \u201cThe overwhelming message of the Phoenix speech was that Trump will be strong on immigration, stronger than any president in a very long time. Given all the other proposals in the speech, the details of how Trump will handle the 12 million after a host of groundbreaking new security measures are in place is probably not a deal-breaker for Trump\u2019s supporters. But that still leaves the question: Why did Trump and his top lieutenants make things so confusing in recent days?\u201dLatino surrogates consider dumping Trump - Politico: \u201cSeveral major Latino surrogates for Donald Trump are reconsidering their support for him following the Republican nominee\u2019s hardline speech on immigration Wednesday night.

[Royal Canadian Mounted Police] spokesman Cpl. Don Wrigglesworth said officers were called to a local gas station shortly before 2 a.m. on Aug. 24 to find the victim completely naked. \u2018He was in excruciating pain and vigorously using his shirt to scrub his genitals with homogenized milk in an attempt to relieve the pain,\u2019 said Wrigglesworth. The man told police he had been attacked by three unknown men, but Wrigglesworth said an investigation revealed the spray pattern \u2018was consistent with the alleged victim carrying his own can of bear spray and it went off unintentionally.\u2019 He said the victim then became uncooperative. Later that night, police were called to a home and found five people outside rolling on the ground after they, too, were hit with bear spray. Wrigglesworth said the five were also uncooperative, but told police they were attacked over a debt.\u201dAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES...\u201cHe took a risk, and he pulled it off. Look, the big negative about Trump, the thing that the Clinton campaign plays on, is the fact that it's hard to imagine him as president...Now, here he is standing on the world stage with a world leader.

            "article_content": "MILNER, Ga. \u2013 Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee went head-to-head for evangelical votes this weekend, telling a megachurch congregation in Georgia that God favors the United States but warning that the nation is on a perilous spiritual path because of actions like the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Huckabee, who enjoyed evangelical support on his way to winning eight states in his 2008 White House bid, called the ruling \"radical\" and \"illegal.\" \"I want to serve notice that the Supreme Court is just the supreme of the court system that is one of the three equal branches of government,\" Huckabee told hundreds of members of Rock Springs Church in a rural area outside metro Atlanta. \"It is not the supreme branch, and it most certainly is not the supreme being.\" Cruz, the Texas senator, said a five-justice majority \"ignored the text of the Constitution\" and said the cascade of judicial and public support for same-sex marriage threatens religious liberty in America. He said he hopes the ruling \"serves as a spark, to start a fire that becomes a raging inferno as the body of Christ stands up to defend the values that have built America.\" Their appearance on Sunday at the megachurch about 50 miles south of downtown Atlanta is part of the early, concerted scramble for the conservative evangelicals who remain an important bloc of the GOP presidential electorate. Christian conservatives have long held considerable influence in Iowa, which hosts the first caucus of the primary season, and in South Carolina, home of the South's first primary a few weeks later. Now, Georgia and several other Southern states get more frequent visits from presidential hopefuls ahead of the planned \"SEC primary,\" named for the Southeastern Conference of college athletics. The March 1, 2016, vote falls after the traditional first four states and ahead of the usual \"Super Tuesday\" states. Huckabee, whose 2008 wins included Iowa and Georgia, has called the Southern-dominated primary date \"manna from heaven.\" But Cruz and others \u2014 Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2014 are making hard runs for the same bloc of support. The Sunday event was a belated Independence Day observance that also featured The Charlie Daniels Band and Jep Robertson, one of the members of the cable television \"Duck Dynasty\" family. For Cruz and Huckabee, it might as well have been a county fair in Iowa, with an added opportunity to speak openly and passionately in their preferred evangelical tones. Cruz told the story of an Iowa couple he said were driven out of the wedding chapel business after denying their services to two men who wanted to get married. The case, Cruz said, \"is emblematic of the persecution that religious liberty and believers across this country.\" He continued: \"I will always, always, always stand and defend the religious liberty of every American.\" Huckabee said the Independence Day observances were an opportunity to reject \"the revisionists\" who say of the American founders: \"They really were not believers.\" The ordained Baptist minister argued: \"There is simply no other explanation ... God had to bless America or we would not exist. The question is will God continue to bless America without our repentance.\" Rev. Benny Tate, pastor of the 6,000-member Rock Springs congregation, joked about the attention. \"Our zip code is E-I-E-I-O,\" he said, \"and we've got two presidential candidates. How about that?\" But the minister is also a serious player in Republican politics, with many Georgia politicians, and now national ones, courting his public approval, if not his explicit endorsement. Tate told the assembly that Huckabee, as Arkansas governor, signed \"a ban on partial-birth abortion,\" referring to the termination of late-term pregnancies. He hailed Cruz for \"standing against the Democratic Party ... and even against the Republican Party.\" Despite the emphasis on faith, Huckabee's loudest applause came when he lauded his \"fair tax\" proposal that he said \"would allow us to, once and for all, abolish the IRS.\" Cruz, meanwhile, drew some of his most enthusiastic reactions when he declared, \"I'm convinced 2016 will be a referendum on repealing Obamacare,\" President Barack Obama's signature health care law. A few minutes earlier, the assembly passed offering plates for the church's clinics, which Tate said provide \"free health care\" to residents in dozens of surrounding counties. ___ Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/BillBarrowAP .",

The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that the state's voucher-style Education Savings Accounts program, seen as the broadest school choice initiative in the country, has an unconstitutional funding mechanism that should remain blocked. Justices issued a 4-2 ruling on Thursday, Sept. 29, 2016, against the money source for the program, which has been on hold since the winter and never disbursed funds to families as it intended, but upholding some of the major tenets underlying the school voucher concept. (AP Photo/Ken Ritter, File) (The Associated Press) LAS VEGAS \u2013 The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that the state's voucher-style Education Savings Accounts program \u2014 seen as the broadest school choice initiative in the country \u2014 has an unconstitutional funding mechanism that should remain blocked. Justices issued a ruling on Thursday against the money source for the program \u2014 which has been on hold since the winter and never disbursed funds to families as it intended \u2014 but upholding some of the major tenets underlying the school voucher concept. Parties on both sides of the hotly debated issue claimed victory, emphasizing different parts of the 35-page decision. \"The state was taken to its knees by a group of people that believe in public education,\" said Rory Reid, son of Democratic Sen. Harry Reid and president of the Rogers Foundation, which supported legal challenges against the program. \"This is a tremendous victory.\" Proponents framed the ruling as a \"landmark win\" for themselves, saying it affirmed some of their most fundamental arguments and adding that the program's defects can be fixed by the Legislature. \"After today's ruling, there is only one step left to take in order to make the vision of educational choice a reality for thousands of Nevada families,\" said Attorney General Adam Laxalt, a Republican who enlisted star lawyer Paul Clement to help him defend the program. \"Fortunately, the Supreme Court has made crystal clear that ESAs are constitutional and that the Legislature can fix this funding technicality and allow for the implementation of ESAs statewide.\" With Nevada lawmakers expected to meet in coming days to consider public financing for an NFL stadium in Las Vegas, Treasurer Dan Schwartz immediately requested that Gov. Brian Sandoval include the issue on the agenda. But the governor indicated he didn't want to rush the matter. \"There may be a path for a legislative solution,\" Sandoval said in a statement. \"However, such a solution is complex and must be well thought-out to meet constitutional muster.\" Nevada lawmakers passed a Republican-backed bill on a party-line vote last year to create the ESA program. It would allow parents to access more than $5,000 in funds allocated each year for their child's public schooling and apply it toward private school tuition or other qualified education expenses. About 8,000 people have applied. Thursday's ruling says the program did not have its own dedicated funding source and runs afoul of the Nevada Constitution by drawing from the same pool of money allocated for public schools in the state's Distributive School Account. Opponents described the old model as a \"slush fund\" available to an unlimited number of applicants, from any income level. Future efforts to fund the voucher program would need to be more defined and approved separately, opening them up to another level of scrutiny. Tod Story, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, argued that taxpayers are unlikely to support future voucher programs because they would require either a tax increase or a deliberate cut from another part of the state budget. But justices affirmed some central arguments from the proponents. The majority of the court agreed that money transferred to accounts controlled by parents is no longer defined as \"public funds\" that can't be used for \"sectarian purposes;\" two justices said in a dissent that the issue wasn't fully fleshed out, even though they agreed on the other points of the ruling. One of the two lawsuits against the program argued primarily on the grounds of separation of church and state, saying the program would unconstitutionally divert money to religious schools that proselytize or can discriminate against students or staff. The justices also affirmed that the Education Savings Account program doesn't violate the Legislature's duty to \"provide for a uniform system of common schools.\" Republican Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson, who's trying to keep his party in control of the Assembly during an election cycle that favors Democrats, said his candidates will use the issue to persuade voters to choose Republicans who are likely to support reviving the ESAs. \"It's disappointing that more legislators don't believe in school choice. It should not be a Republican-only issue,\" Anderson said. But the funding problem \"is much easier to overcome than had they ruled differently on the other points.\" ___ Associated Press writer Ken Ritter contributed to this report.",

(Anthony Pidgeon/Redferns via AP) (The Associated Press) Some noteworthy cases the Supreme Court will hear in its new term that begins Monday: Church-state separation: A Missouri church is challenging its exclusion from a state program that reimburses groups for installing rubberized surfaces on playgrounds. The Trinity Lutheran Church's application for a grant was highly rated, but state officials said a provision of the Missouri Constitution bars them from giving public money to a church. Disparaging trademarks: The Obama administration is defending the decision to deny trademark protection to an Asian-American band called the Slants because the term is offensive to Asians. A lower court struck down the part of federal law on which the decision was based and the outcome of the case also could affect the Washington Redskins football team in its fight to preserve lucrative trademark protection. Texas death penalty appeals: Two inmates on Texas' death row are seeking to have their death sentences overturned. Inmate Duane Buck, who is African-American, contends his lawyers failed him by calling as an expert witness a psychologist who testified that black people were more likely to commit violence. Inmate Bobby Moore argues that he is ineligible to be executed because he is intellectually disabled. Moore says Texas courts used outdated standards to reject his claim. Insider trading: The court will settle a disagreement between lower courts about how to evaluate whether people are illegally benefiting from trading on information from corporate insiders. Redistricting: Cases from North Carolina and Virginia focus on lawsuits from African-Americans who complain that Republican-led legislatures improperly concentrated Democratic-leaning black voters in some districts to limit their influence in others, ensuring the election of more Republicans. Citizenship: A man who is facing deportation claims he can't be removed from the U.S. because he was a citizen at birth. He is challenging an unusual provision of U.S. law that applies to children born outside the country to one parent who is an American and one who is not. The law makes it easier for children whose mother is a citizen to become citizens themselves. ___ Two appeals that have been filed but not yet acted on also could be heard this term: Transgender rights: A Virginia school district is appealing a lower court ruling requiring it to allow a transgender boy to use the boys' bathroom at his high school. The Supreme Court has put the ruling on hold, pending its decision on whether to hear the case. Voter ID: Texas is asking the high court to overturn a lower court ruling that found that the state's 2011 law requiring photo identification to vote discriminated against minorities and the poor. Appeals in voter ID cases from north Carolina and Wisconsin also could reach the court, but the justices will not confront the issue until after the November elections.",

Kennedy, right, leave St. Mathews Cathedral, after the Red Mass in Washington on Sunday, Oct. 2, 2016. The Supreme Court's new term starts Monday, Oct. 3. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (The Associated Press) WASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court is opening an unusual term in an unusual way. The justices meet in public Monday for the first time since June with one seat on the nine-member court empty since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. It is the first time in 25 years the court has been at less than full strength at the start of a term, on the first Monday in October as prescribed by federal law. The court also will diverge from its usual practice of hearing cases on its first day because of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. Three of the eight justices are Jewish. The court is expected to reject hundreds of appeals that accumulated over its long summer recess. Last week, the justices accepted eight new cases. Arguments are scheduled to begin on Tuesday. But the justices will have to wait for the presidential election on Nov. 8 to have a sense of who might join them as the ninth justice. President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland, but Senate Republicans have refused to take any action, saying the next president should fill the Scalia seat. The court's calendar so far has no blockbuster cases like those of recent years dealing with health care, gay marriage and abortion rights. It does have a church's challenge to its exclusion from a Missouri state program to provide rubberized surfaces in playgrounds, a dispute over whether disparaging names can receive trademark protection from the government, two redistricting cases involving the rights of minority voters and two appeals from death row inmates in Texas. The Missouri case about the separation of church and state was granted while Scalia was still alive and has yet to be scheduled for argument, possibly because the justices think they may divide 4-4. Tie votes leave the lower court decision in place, but set no national legal rule and essentially waste the justices' time. The rights of transgender people, immigration, climate change, voter identification and religious freedom are among other cases the court might consider later in the term. These are the sorts of issues that have split the court along ideological lines before. The other big looming issue is when one or more of the older justices might retire. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83 and has said she will take it a year at a time. She could find herself in a newly powerful role if Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, making her less likely to step down, said Thomas Goldstein, an attorney who argues regularly at the court. The two other older justices are Stephen Breyer, 78, and Anthony Kennedy, who turned 80 this summer. He might see his influence diminish on a more liberal court.",

A Louisville courtroom video shows Brice Rhodes on Friday repeatedly threatening to track down Jefferson\u00a0District Court Judge Amber Wolf and her relatives during a profanity-laced tirade, WDRB-TV reported. Now authorities said they have filed additional charges of terroristic threatening and intimidating a participant in the legal process. Jefferson District Court Judge Amber Wolf (WDRB-TV) Rhodes was already charged with stabbing to death 16-year-old Maurice Gordon and 14-year-old Larry Ordway in Shawnee in May. Their burned bodies were found dumped behind an abandoned house. Rhodes was in court Friday on separate charges of attacking and injuring an inmate in August and spitting on another in September. He said he wasn't guilty of those charges. According to WDRB, Rhodes was taken into court on Friday wearing a spit mask. \"Why you all havin' me come in like this for?\" Rhodes asked from behind the mask, according to a courtroom video. \"I think you know why,\" Wolf replied. \"You know exactly why.\" \"Yeah, [EXPLETIVE] I'm going to get out,\" Rhodes said at one point. \"Don't you think I'm gonna [EXPLETIVE] find out where you live at?\" he continued. \"You got family! I'll be out!\" Rhodes is currently in jail on a $1 million bond in connection with three murders. Police claim that Rhodes shot and killed a man, identified as Christopher Jones, in early May. Later that month, they say Rhodes and two juvenile accomplices murdered Ordway and Gordon. Rhodes allegedly killed the two brothers because he feared they would snitch about his involvement in Jones' murder, according to WDRB.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump on Saturday kicked his unapologetic presidential campaign into high gear -- saying he won\u2019t apologize for his personal attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren and extending his feud with GOP establishment leader Mitt Romney. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a stone cold loser, a choker,\u201d Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said about Romney at a rally in Tampa, Fla. Also on Saturday, Romney, who this weekend is holding an ideas summit in Utah, suggested that Trump\u2019s misogynistic and racially insensitive remarks have opened the door for generations of Americans to engage in similar behavior. Trump told the crowd of about 5,000 in Tampa that Romney, the GOP presidential nominee who lost to President Obama in 2012, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what a misogynist is.\u201d Trump and Warren, a leading progressive voice in the Democratic Party, have attacked each other increasingly in recent weeks, with the exchanges appearing to intensify now that Clinton has become the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. On Thursday, Warren endorsed Clinton and accused Trump of \u201crace baiting\u201d and using \u201cracism\u201d toward the federal judge of Mexican heritage who is presiding over a civil fraud suit against the Trump University real estate school. Trump has suggested the American-born judge won\u2019t give him a fair trial, considering Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants. Trump has not apologized to the judge, despite widespread calls for him to do so. On Saturday, Trump sarcastically suggested he\u2019ll apologize for referring to Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d in response to Warren apparently attempting to use Native American heritage to further her academic and political career. Trump said he\u2019d apologize because his name calling \u201cis an insult to Pocahontas, not Warren.\u201d Romney, at his summit Saturday in Park City, likened the impact of Trump's words to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual \u201cdalliances in White House,\u201d which he said have \u201cimpacted generations.\u201d \u201cNow we have kids in elementary schools joking about the size of their hands,\u201d Romney said about one Trump comment, in a question-and-answer session with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. Romney, nevertheless, credited Bill Clinton with correctly articulating that a candidate\u2019s views on jobs and the economy largely decide elections when Clinton said: \u201cPeople vote with their pocketbooks.\u201d He appeared to give a mixed message about how he\u2019ll deal with Trump through November, saying he\u2019s not going to spend the next six months arguing his point of view. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be an attack dog,\u201d said Romney, who then made clear that he\u2019ll call out Trump for comments with which he does not agree. Trump, who also held a rally Saturday in Moon Township, Pa., \u00a0told supporters that former GOP House Speaker Rep. Newt Gingrich, Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions and former Secretary of State Condleezza Rice appear popular choices to be his running mate. He dismissed Clinton\u2019s recent line of attack that he lacks the temperament to be president and said, \u201cShe\u2019s got the bad temperament.\u201d Trump said the recent tell-all book by a former Secret Service agent referred to the former first lady as a \u201ctotal mess.\u201d \u201cWe need strong temperament,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have a strong temperament.\u201d",

            "article_content": "FILE - In this July 23, 2003 file photo, Steven Caruso sits in Middlesex Superior Court in Cambridge, Mass. Caruso, 48, is charged with murder in the January 2000 death of Sandra Berfield. Caruso is serving a life sentence for killing Sandra Berfield in 2000 with a pipe bomb in a package that exploded on her porch. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is scheduled to hear arguments in his appeal on Sept. 9, 2016. (George Martell/Boston Herald via AP, Pool) (The Associated Press) BOSTON \u2013 After Sandra Berfield was killed when a package bomb exploded in her arms, police immediately zeroed in on a man she said had stalked her for months and vandalized her car. Steven Caruso was a regular at the restaurant where Berfield worked as a waitress for 12 years. He would come in every day, sometimes twice a day, and spend hours sitting in Berfield's section, staring at her. Berfield complained that after she rejected Caruso's request for a date, he began stalking her. He was convicted in 1999 of slashing the tires on her car and pouring battery acid in her gas tank. Eight months later, in January 2000, Berfield walked out to her front porch and picked up a package addressed to her. The pipe bomb inside exploded, killing Berfield instantly. Now, 13 years after Caruso was convicted in Berfield's killing, he is asking the state's highest court to grant him a new trial. The Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments Friday in the highly publicized case, which led to new protections for women against stalkers. In his appeal, Caruso insists he is not the person who put the mail bomb on Berfield's porch. He also cites a litany of legal reasons he should get a new trial, including the testimony of a jailhouse snitch who Caruso says fabricated a story about him incriminating himself in Berfield's killing during a conversation the two inmates had in a prison hospital cell. \"So much of the evidence is so obviously unreliable that he plainly did not receive a fair trial,\" said David A.F. Lewis, Caruso's attorney. Prosecutors, however, say there was plenty of evidence for the jury to convict Caruso of first-degree murder, including his history of stalking her, a ripped-up manual on how to build a bomb found in the trash at his home and detailed dossiers he had on Berfield and her relatives. Berfield, 32, worked at a Bickford's restaurant in Medford, just north of Boston. According to testimony at his trial, Caruso, a longtime regular customer, began insisting on sitting in Berfield's section beginning in 1996. For a couple of years, they had what Berfield described as \"light conversations.\" But in August of 1998, after Berfield declined Caruso's invitation to go to a movie with him, she told her manager she felt uncomfortable because Caruso insisted on sitting in her section, where he would stare at her while smirking. The manager asked Caruso to sit in a different area of the restaurant. The next month, Berfield's car was vandalized four times. Caruso was later convicted in three of the episodes and spent several months in jail. After the vandalism of her car, Berfield obtained a civil restraining order against Caruso. In court documents, Berfield accused Caruso of stalking her at home and at the restaurant. \"He was told that I wouldn't wait on him anymore ... because he was scaring me and making me uncomfortable,\" she wrote. Caruso denied the allegations, attributing them to Berfield's \"hysteria,\" according to court documents. At the time, criminally enforceable restraining orders were only granted for people who were related to or dating their alleged stalkers. Because Berfield never had a relationship with Caruso, that option was not available to her. After Berfield's death, her family waged a decade-long campaign to change the law. In 2010, the law was changed to extend criminal protection orders to victims of stalking and sexual abuse who do not have a dating or familial relationship with their perpetrators.",

            "article_content": "Business mogul on why the Republican Party needs to unify; Presidential candidate speaks out on 'Hannity' 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump defended himself Thursday after being criticized for a speech in which he appeared to mock a reporter with a disability \u2013 although the business mogul says his mimicking had nothing to do with the reporter\u2019s condition. Jay Ruderman of the Ruderman Family Foundation in Boston said the Republican presidential contender should apologize to Serge Kovaleski of The New York Times and the public. Trump was challenging recollections by Kovaleski and many others about the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. Trump has been criticized for claiming that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey were seen celebrating the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. Trump and his supporters have cited articles written at the time that appeared to back Trump\u2019s claims, at least to an extent. In 2001, Kovaleski, then with The Washington Post, and another Post journalist wrote a week after the 9/11 attacks about authorities in New Jersey detaining and questioning \"a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks.\" Trump has pointed to the Post story as backing up his claim and took issue with Kovaleski's recent statement that he did not remember anyone alleging that large numbers of Muslims were celebrating. Kovaleski has a congenital condition that affects joint movement. In a speech Tuesday in South Carolina, Trump said: \"poor guy, you oughta see this guy,\" and gestured in a jerky fashion as he imitated the reporter. \u201c\u2018Uh, I don't know what I said, uh, I don't remember.\u2019 He's going like, I don't remember,\u2019\" Trump said, while shaking. After Trump\u2019s latest comments, The New York Times expressed outrage afterward that Trump would \"ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.\" Ruderman said Trump would benefit from a \"series of sensitivity training sessions\" and offered to provide them. \"It is unacceptable for a child to mock another child's disability on the playground, never mind a presidential candidate mocking someone's disability as part of a national political discourse,\" he said. However, in a statement released to Twitter, Trump denied that he had mocked Kovaleski\u2019s disability. pic.twitter.com/5ztxHpiCiV \u201cI have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovalski [sic] is, what he looks like is his level of intelligence,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn my speech before over 10,000 people in Myrtle Beach, SC, I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,\u201d Trump said. Trump went on to cite his respect for disabled people and how he has spent millions of dollars making his buildings handicapped accessible. He then went on to criticize the New York Times for attacking him on the issue. \u201c\u201dThis is just another example of the dishonest New York Times trying to make a story out of nothing. They should focus on the survival of their newspaper and not on dishonest and very bad reporting about me,\u201d Trump said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, File) (The Associated Press) DENVER \u2013 A group of Colorado nuns is appealing a federal appellate court ruling that found that President Barack Obama's health care law adequately protects them from having to provide coverage of contraception for their employees, potentially setting up another combustible debate over birth control and religion in the midst of next year's presidential election. Attorneys for Little Sisters of the Poor and four Oklahoma Christian colleges announced Thursday that they will appeal last week's ruling from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. A three-judge panel on that court found that the law already accommodates the nonprofits by allowing them to file for an exemption from the contraception mandate. The religious institutions argued that exemption is inadequate because a third party will still end up providing birth control coverage in opposition to their religious beliefs. \"The Sisters consider it immoral to help the government distribute these drugs,\" Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represented the nuns, said in a statement. \"But instead of simply exempting them, the government insists that it can take over their ministry's employee healthcare to distribute these drugs to their employees, while dismissing the Sisters' moral objections as irrelevant.\" Last year the Supreme Court found that \"closely-held\" businesses like Hobby Lobby were also exempt from the law's contraception mandate. Those businesses now have access to the exemption that the nuns contend is inadequate. If the Supreme Court takes up the case it would be heard and decided before the end of June 2016.",

            "article_content": "Epstein, (l.), and Clinton, (r.), flew dozens of times on the billionaire's jet, dubbed \"The Lolita Express.\" Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender\u2019s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the \u201cLolita Express\u201d -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. Clinton\u2019s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including \u201cTatiana.\u201d The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. \u201cBill Clinton \u2026 associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,\u201d said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called \"TrafficKing.\" \u201cWhy would a former president associate with a man like that?\u201d Epstein owns the entire 72-acre island. (Google Earth) Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on \u201cOrgy Island,\u201d an estate on Epstein's 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Virginia Roberts, 32, who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age 15, has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epstein\u2019s getaway in 2002, but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein's plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard Epstein\u2019s plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa. Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epstein\u2019s associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends. The flight logs are required to be filed with the Federal Aviation Administration. Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. The U.S. Secret Service has declined to answer multiple Freedom of Information Act requests filed by FoxNews.com seeking information on these trips. Clinton would have been required to file a form to dismiss the agent detail, a former Secret Service agent told FoxNews.com. In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton. A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former president\u2019s relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clinton\u2019s travel records. Martin Weinberg, Epstein\u2019s current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates \u201chave been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.\u201d Epstein's Boeing 727 was known as the \"Lolita Express.\" (John Coates, airport-data.com) However, hundreds of pages of court records, including reports from police and FBI agents, reviewed by FoxNews.com, show Epstein was under law enforcement scrutiny for more than a year. Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year-long investigation in 2005 into Epstein after parents of a 14-year-old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who they said were sexually abused by Epstein. In 2006, at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had \u201cused facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 to engage in illegal sexual activities.\u201d According to court documents, police investigators found a \u201cclear indication that Epstein\u2019s staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day.\u201d One victim, in sworn deposition testimony, said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was 13 years old and molested her on more than 50 occasions over the next three years. The girls testified they were lured to Epstein\u2019s home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse, but when they arrived, he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up. On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators. Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epstein\u2019s alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims \u201cto prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.\u201d The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal. Other politicians, celebrities and businessmen, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein. Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals. \u201cThere was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not friends and they did not socialize together.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nov. 2, 2011: In this file photo former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman talks with reporters outside the Federal Courthouse in Montgomery, Ala. (AP) Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman -- in prison on corruption charges and who got major support earlier this month for a White House pardon -- was put in solitary confinement Monday, his son says. Siegelman, the state\u2019s last Democratic governor, was transferred to solitary confinement after The Washington Post published a story in which he talked extensively about the Supreme Court this week reviewing former Virginia GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s 2014 conviction on public corruption, says son Joseph Siegelman. Siegelman, also his father\u2019s attorney, suggests the timing of the transfer to solitary confinement is suspicious. Bureau of Prison officials would not confirm the transfer but said there was no connection. \"The allegation that Mr. Siegelman was punished for talking to a reporter is false,\" said a bureau spokesman, who declined to elaborate, citing confidentiality concerns regarding disciplinary matters. Siegelman said his father had told him he was being punished for three infractions: running a business from prison, misuse of the mail and a catch-all prohibition against behavior that is disruptive of prison operations. Siegelman reportedly sold a T-shirt on eBay for $4,500 that he will use to finish a documentary about his case. According to the note Siegelman posted during the eBay auction, such T-shirts can be purchased at the prison commissary. He was convicted in 2006 for bribery and obstruction of justice. The court found Siegelman sold a board appointment to HealthSouth founder Richard Scrushy in exchange for contributions to his 1999 campaign to establish a state lottery. He is serving a sentence of six-plus years in a federal correctional institution in Oakdale, La. Scrushy has already has finished his sentence. This is not the first time Siegelman has purportedly been put in solitary confinement. He allegedly was transferred after calling into a talk show in October 2015 to argue his innocence and say he is a victim of Republican politics. The revelation this week follows more than 100 former state attorneys general asking President Obama, in a letter sent to the White House earlier this month, to pardon the 70-year-old Siegelman. Former New York Attorney General Bob Abrams said the group thinks the conviction was unjust and tarnished by politics. Presidential intervention is one of Siegelman's last hopes of getting his prison sentence cut. However, he and his son are also trying to get the Supreme Court to review their case, now that appellate courts have upheld the conviction. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

President Obama, his approval ratings in the basement, thinks his party can hold onto the Senate and plans to try sell an anemic recovery by claiming most Americans are better off six years into his tenure. For vulnerable Democrats already heavily burdened with Obama\u2019s domestic policy baggage, that sale will be tough indeed. Republicans, who have seen prospects for retaking the Senate improve in recent polls, have taken hold of the threat posed by ISIS militants, hammering the president\u2019s foreign policy mismanagement and taking Democrats to task for their part in the mess. Meanwhile, Democrats in key Senate contests are scrambling to morph from the liberal anti-war stance that got many elected, to hawks on ISIS. The only bright spot for the blue team at this point: cash. They have lots more of it, with wealthy backers pouring in dark money even as Sen. Majority leader Harry Reid and his party deride Republicans over the support of their benefactors. As the GOP pushes contributors for a late surge to even the score, voters can expect an October barrage of ads. Whether that battleground and grassroots efforts can change what appears to be a gloomy outcome for Democrats, remains to be seen.

The high court voted 5-4 to grant a request from GOP state officials to cut out a week in Ohio when people could register to vote and cast ballots.Early voting for the Nov. 4 elections in the key swing state was supposed to begin Tuesday. But the justices\u2019 order means early voting now will start Oct. 7. Republican officials tried changing state election rules to shrink the early voting window on the grounds it would help combat voter fraud and make elections less expensive. But a coalition of black churches and civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in an attempt to block the new rules. A federal judge initially blocked the law. But the Supreme Court\u2019s five conservative-leaning justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, disagreed and voted to grant Ohio's request.\u201d BOEHNER PUSHES PLAN TO RESET ECONOMYHouse Speaker John Boehner is out with a video that expressed his view that America\u2019s energy boom offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reset our economic foundation.\u00a0 But first, the speaker says, there are five things we need to do as a nation to make it happen.\u00a0\u00a0Boehner has been sharing this long-term vision throughout the year with constituents, colleagues, and most recently, in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute.\u00a0What are those five things?\u00a0 How do we do them?\u00a0 What is at stake?\u201d Watch here.

The first gum-making machine was patented by Thomas Adams in 1871. The product, \u201cAdam\u2019s Black Jack,\u201d was in the traditional stick shape and licorice flavored. Evolving a great deal in both shape and flavor since that time, there are plenty of reasons to celebrate the sticky substance. Today is the birthday of William Wrigley Jr., owner of the Chicago Cubs, namesake of their ballpark and the founder of the Wrigley Company. The company, which began by selling baking powder with chewing gum packed in each can as an added bonus, found the gum more popular and eventually transitioned to a gum-only company.\u00a0 Wrigley\u2019s has grown from those early days to 140 factories with products sold in 180 countries.

Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes, his chief opponent in November\u2019s election, are beginning advertising blitzes meant to convince voters they care about average Kentuckians. Grimes was first out of the block Monday with a social media campaign that will feature videos of people talking about her and what her election would mean to them. It features a tag line of \u2018Alison cares\u2019 and urges others to post videos.\u00a0The first ad stars Grimes\u2019 husband, Andrew Grimes.

Weekly Standard: \u201cDuVal has made ethics and lobbying reform a cornerstone of his gubernatorial campaign amid stories that state legislators were given gifts like football tickets and campaign donations from the Fiesta Bowl. \u2018As a taxpayer, I\u2019m disgusted,\u2019\u00a0 DuVal has said.\u00a0 But Republicans are quick to point out that the Democrat\u2019s consulting work looks and sounds a lot like lobbying itself. From 2001 to 2005, DuVal\u2019s firm did work in 25 states to help secure bonds. All of which might be unremarkable, except DuVal was never registered as a lobbyist in several states with tough lobbying regulations. Some of those states require those who incur minimal expenses while working to influence public officials - in Kansas, it\u2019s more than $40 on a meal, for instance - to register as lobbyists.\u201d ROMNEY TO HELP RAISE MONEY FOR COMSTOCK IN VAWaPo: \u201cFormer GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is coming to northern Virginia to help an old ally in her congressional campaign. Romney is headlining a fundraiser Tuesday night in McLean for Barbara Comstock, who served as his Virginia campaign co-chair in 2012 and was one of his more prominent surrogates in that race. Comstock, a Republican, is running against Democrat John Foust in Virginia\u2019s 10th District, which stretches from McLean neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway west to the Shenandoah Valley. The longtime incumbent in the district, Frank Wolf, is retiring after more than 30 years in office. The race has been one of the most closely watched in the nation, featuring an open seat in a district that has supported Republicans and Democrats.\u201dAD GIVES KISSING CONGRESSMAN A COLD SHOWERThe conservative Club for Growth Action PAC is releasing an ad that targets embattled Rep. Vance McAllister, R-La., attacking his liberal voting record. Hitting McAllister for his \u201cwell known\u201d personal indiscretions, the ad says in part, \u201cWhat\u2019s less known is just how liberal he\u2019s been in Washington. McAllister voted for a budget that raised taxes and increased spending. McAllister says we\u2019re past repealing Obamacare, and he supports expanding it in Louisiana.\u201d The group has previously endorsed Republican challenger Zach Dasher for the seat. BAD NEWS BEARWhen Washington State Patrol trooper Mark Francis pulled over an Everett woman for going 74 in a 60-mile per hour zone, something else that caught the officer\u2019s attention. Sure enough, when the 19-year-old driver rolled the window down the officer saw a giant stuffed bear sitting in the passenger seat. \u201c\u2018According to her,\u2019 Francis told MyNorthwest.com, \u2018there was not enough room in the back of her minivan to put the bear back there. That\u2019s what she was doing with the bear in the front passenger seat.\u2019\u00a0 Adding to the speeding ticket the driver racked up another ticket for being in violation of the HOV lane rules as the only live human in the vehicle. Throw in a citation for not having insurance and the grand tally? $818 in fines. That\u2019s one pricey stuffed animal. Check out the photo, it doesn\u2019t look like the bear had its seat belt fastened either\u2026wonder if the trooper caught that.Chris Stirewalt\u00a0is digital politics editor for Fox News.\u00a0 Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?

            "article_content": "Persistent anti-Trump movement appealing to delegates to not back presumptive nominee A determined insurgency among some of the delegates to the Republican National Convention is growing, a last ditch effort to sidetrack the nomination of Donald Trump. The efforts focus on fighting state laws and party rules that bind delegates from states with winner-take-all primaries on the first ballot at the upcoming national convention. \"If we were in a position where we didn't have a divisive or a controversial candidate going into Cleveland we probably would have been ok,\" explains Arizona GOP delegate Jarrod White. Like several states, Arizona law requires delegates to vote for the primary winner, who in this case happens to be Trump. White is part of an organization calling itself \"Free the Delegates\"which is calling on delegates to vote at the convention as their conscience dictates. Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham will have none of it. \"I have the law and the rules on my side,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it's not to be unfair it's just to manage this entire process and maintain a professional decorum.\" Graham says delegates who have decided they can't support the presumptive nominee as promised, should step aside in lieu of an alternate delegate. \"Let somebody who's enthusiastically engaged in the process to go and participate.\" \u201cThat's him saying, you know, 'sit down and be quiet,'\" White says. \"That's not who we are as grass roots activists.\" \"Here in Arizona there's a lot of infighting within the statewide GOP,\" comments a bemused Sheila Healy, Executive Director of the Arizona Democratic Party. \"I would say it's uh, it's not unhelpful for our cause,\" she adds with a hearty laugh. Yet the Arizona GOP is certainly not alone when it comes to conflict over presumptive nominee Donald Trump. On the other side of the country, a lawsuit filed in federal district court in Richmond on Friday, June 24 seeks to declare Virginia's delegate binding law unconstitutional. The suit lists Virginia delegate Carroll (Beau) Correll, a former Ted Cruz supporter, as lead plaintiff. But his attorney David Rivkin explains it was, \"brought on behalf of all of the delegates, Democrat and Republican, from Virginia.\" The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction before the conventions start, and asks that Virginia's law ultimately be stricken down as a violation of First Amendment rights to free speech and association. \"There are approximately 20 other states that have such binding laws in various versions,\u201d Rivkin points out, predicting that a win in Virginia, \"...in effect will tell everyone in the nation that these types of binding laws are unconstitutional.\u201d Yet another group calling on GOP delegates to vote for someone, anyone, other than Trump in the first round has released a television ad. The spot by Delegates Unbound called \"Follow Your Conscience\" shows clips of Ronald Reagan and Trump side by side making starkly contrasting comments. The 30 second spot ends with the written words, \"GOP Delegates: follow your conscience.\" In the face of these efforts to take the nomination away from him, Trump reminds Fox News that the largest number of primary voters in history got him where he is today. \"Listen I have millions of people out there, almost 14 million to be exact that will be extremely unhappy if that happens,\u201d he said. The GOP official heading the RNC's permanent Rules Committee agrees. \"I wasn't a Trump supporter to begin with,\" Bruce Ash says while explaining why he sent a letter calling on his fellow members to take a firm stand against the dump Trump campaign. In the letter Ash implores, \"We at the RNC must stand by our presumptive nominee's side and defend against all who would threaten our legitimacy as a national party. What is more important than anything else is uniting and defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016.\u201d Arizona delegate Talmage Pearce, also affiliated with the Free the Delegates group, says uniting to defeat Hillary is now secondary. \"If Donald Trump does become the nominee and loses to Hillary Clinton, and (yet) we're able to accomplish what we're able to accomplish, by freeing the delegates and allowing them to vote their conscience, that's something we can be proud of.\" Arizona's Chairman Graham points out that all of Arizona's delegates knew the rules going in. \"At the very beginning of our state convention we have a vote on our rules. It was unanimous...and guess what one of the rules are? That they need to sign the pledge.\u201d Arizona's 2016 Republican National Convention Delegate and Alternate Delegate Pledge of Support reads in part, \"...do hearby pledge my vote and support for the nominee who received the greatest number of votes in the Arizona Presidential Preference election...\" \"So if they go there and try to change the rules,\" Graham says, \"they are deceiving a million three hundred thousand voters that voted openly. They should actually let that weigh in on their conscience.\" He assures Fox News that, \"The state of Arizona will announce 58 votes for Donald Trump,\" at the GOP convention. And if any delegates, \"try to disrupt that or do anything along those lines the RNC has told us in writing that they will credit 58 votes to Mr. Trump.\" Unhappy delegates like White, remain undeterred. \"I don't think we're going to lose at the convention and I think it's going to be a historic moment.\"",

            "article_content": "Advocates and lawmakers on both sides used the decision to point to the importance of the fall election; Shannon Bream has the story for 'Special Report' TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2013 A federal judge late Thursday put on hold key portions of a new Florida law that would block public funding for Planned Parenthood and greatly increase inspection requirements for abortion clinics. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued his ruling just hours before the law passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature was due to take effect. Planned Parenthood challenged three parts of the law that Gov. Rick Scott signed into law earlier this year, including one that prevents any state or local funds from going to an organization if that organization also provides abortions. Planned Parenthood officials estimated that provision would prevent its clinics from receiving about $500,000 to pay for health care screenings and a school dropout prevention program. Hinkle in his ruling said the provision is \"based not on any objection to how the funds are being spent ... but solely because the recipients of the funds choose to provide abortions separate and apart from any public funding.\" \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that a government cannot prohibit indirectly \u2014 by withholding otherwise-available public funds \u2014 conduct that the government could not constitutionally prohibit directly,\" Hinkle wrote. Hinkle also blocked enforcement of another part of the new law that would have required an annual state inspection of the medical records of half of all clinic patients, which Planned Parenthood estimated would be about 35,000 people a year. Hinkle did leave intact a provision that redefines dates of gestation and pregnancy trimesters, which could affect when abortions can be performed. Hinkle said he did so because state officials insisted the change would not have any impacts, though Planned Parenthood had argued the change was yet another attempt to limit abortions. Planned Parenthood officials praised Hinkle's ruling. \"With today's ruling Planned Parenthood is more committed than ever to both serving our patients and fighting back against politicians who are bent on attacking access to women's health,\" said Barbara A. Zdravecky, President/CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida. Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, said the administration was \"looking\" at Hinkle's ruling. Similar to a Texas law struck down earlier this week by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Florida law also requires doctors who perform abortions to have privileges at a nearby hospital. But Planned Parenthood attorneys did not challenge that provision, and Hinkle's ruling did not address that part of the law. Legislators who passed the law earlier this year said they were doing so in order to protect women's health. Attorneys for the state argued before Hinkle that he should let the law stand because there was nothing in it that interferes with Planned Parenthood clinics from performing abortions or burdens \"the right of women to undergo abortions.\" The court action this week was just a new chapter in a long-running battle over abortion in the Sunshine State. Since the GOP assumed control of the Florida Legislature two decades ago, legislators have enacted a series of bills only to see many of them overturned in the courts. The Florida Supreme Court in April suspended a 24-hour waiting period for abortions while it decides whether that law is constitutional. Hinkle's injunction puts the two portions of the law on hold until he issues a full ruling on the merits of the lawsuit.",
