            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to stop the transfer of certain White House documents housed in the National Archives to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The former president appealed a decision from a three-judge panel on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which earlier this month rejected Trump's efforts to shield his records from the January 6 House select committee.\u00a0 The D.C. Circuit temporarily halted the release of the records to the committee and gave the former president 14 days to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in. In the filing asking the justices to take up his dispute, Trump's attorneys argued investigators' request for records is \"strikingly broad\" and \"untethered from any valid legislative purpose.\" The request, they continued, exceeds congressional authority under the Constitution and the Presidential Records Act, which governs the records of presidents. \"The records of a former president are not distributed freely upon the conclusion of his term of office, even to Congress,\" Trump's lawyers told the court. \"Except in extraordinary circumstances, records are protected from disclosure for a considerable amount of time after a president has left office.\" Lawyers for the former president also argued his White House records must be protected under the idea of executive privilege, which holds that certain presidential communications can be shielded from scrutiny and kept confidential.  \"Despite clear precedent and the unambiguous dictates of statute, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Committee's broad requests and refused to honor President Trump's well established claims of executive privilege,\" wrote the former president's attorneys. \u00a0 Trump's lawyers told the justices that the committee's request for his record \"should have been rejected out-of-hand.\" \"At stake is the ability of presidents \u2014 past, current, and future \u2014 to rely upon executive privilege, separation of powers, and the Presidential Records Act to protect confidential presidential records of deliberations from premature production to political rivals,\" they said. Trump sued the committee investigating the January 6 assault on the Capitol in October after President Biden rejected the former president's assertion of executive privilege over the documents sought by the panel. The House committee is seeking documents and communications connected to January 6, including records related to Trump's prepared and actual public remarks from November 3, 2020, through January 20. Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives revealed that it had identified over 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 Trump has since argued that about 750 of those documents, which are at the center of the current lawsuit, should remain confidential under claims of executive privilege.\u00a0 \"While the protections of executive privilege and restrictions on access to presidential records are qualified, it is critical that future presidents and their advisers understand the contours and perimeters of that privilege \u2014 and its exceptions \u2014 after the conclusion of a presidential term,\" Trump's lawyers said. \"Otherwise, the deliberative process of advising presidents will be chilled, as advisers will doubtless understand the audience of their deliberations is not simply the president in whose administration they serve but also Congress and their political rivals.\" The requests for information from the select committee, including Trump's White House records, have spurned numerous legal challenges, as former White House aides have refused to turn over the documents, citing the former president's claims of executive privilege. Meadows earlier this month filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to nullify subpoenas issued by the House committee for testimony and phone records, as did Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser. Both Meadows and Flynn claimed the subpoenas issued by the select committee are overbroad and lack a legislative purpose. Trump himself has in the past sought intervention from the Supreme Court in efforts to shield his financial records from congressional investigators and the Manhattan district attorney. The former president appointed three justices to the high court, expanding its conservative majority to 6-3.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A three-judge federal appeals court panel weighing whether former President Donald Trump can shield his White House records from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's claims of executive privilege on Tuesday, the latest development in a legal standoff that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Mr. Trump sued the House select committee in October in an attempt to stop the National Archives from handing over certain documents, arguing his White House records are protected under executive privilege, the legal doctrine that shields some internal executive branch material from congressional scrutiny. President Biden\u00a0rejected his predecessor's claim and permitted the National Archives to comply with the House committee's request for the documents. During Tuesday's virtual hearing, attorneys for Mr. Trump argued the federal courts are the proper venue for settling the dispute between the current and former presidents. But Judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit questioned whether they have a role in ruling on Mr. Trump's claims of executive privilege if the current president has already waived that right.\u00a0 \"This all boils down to who decides,\" Jackson told Mr. Trump's attorney, Jesse Binnall. \"Is it the current occupant of the White House or the former?\" \"Why should the former president be the one to make that determination?\" she asked, to which Binnall answered that it is \"incumbent on the courts\" to make the decision if there is disagreement between a former and an incumbent president over executive privilege claims. Binnall, who argued that previous legal precedent set following President Richard Nixon's resignation weighs in Mr. Trump's favor, argued the courts must make the final decision about whether the committee can obtain the documents, not Mr. Biden. \"All that matters is the current president and the former president. Once that disagreement occurs, an Article III court has to make a determination,\" he claimed. Determining \"whether a document is privileged or not is far more technical\" than the process used by the Biden administration and the National Archives, Binnall added. But Millett later pointed out that such an examination of individual documents and their potential privilege \"changes the analysis not a whit\" because executive privilege had already been waived by Mr. Biden. Douglas Letter, the House's general counsel, said the sitting president \"is in the best position, best by far, to determine what is in the best interest of the executive branch at that time.\"\u00a0 \"What the courts should do is say, 'The current president has spoken. That's it. We're done,'\" he added later. In previous lawsuits brought before the court over requests for documents and testimony, Letter pointed out, disagreements between the executive branch and Congress that prompted legal action. But in this case, Letter argued, \"there is no clash here between the branches.\" However, in questioning the Justice Department attorney representing the National Archives, Millett asserted that executive privilege over presidential documents is \"part of the lifeblood of the executive branch,\" and must be protected to some extent. Seemingly offering a modicum of support to part of Mr. Trump's claims, she said presidents might be reluctant to seek advice near the end of their terms, knowing that any communication may be waived the minute they leave office. The appeals court panel heard the case after the district court denied the former president's request to prevent the transfer of his White House documents, outright rejecting his claims of executive privilege and confidentiality. The committee says it needs the documents to further understand the events surrounding the January 6 assault on the Capitol.\u00a0 If the three-judge panel sides with the House and rejects Mr. Trump's claims, the former president's attorneys said they plan to ask the Supreme Court to settle the dispute. Since Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit, the National Archives has revealed that it identified more than 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has granted former President Trump's request for an \"administrative\" injunction, temporarily blocking the release of his White House records from the National Archives to the House committee Investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. \"The National Archives and Records Administration and the Archivist be enjoined from releasing the records requested by the House Select Committee over which appellant asserts executive privilege, pending further order of this court,\" the order reads. The court notes this is simply to allow time for legal arguments on a longer injunction to be made and the ruling \"should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,\" meaning they are not ruling on the validity of Mr. Trump's claims. Oral argument will be held before the three-judge panel of Judges Millett, Wilkins, and Jackson on November 30, 2021. Congressman Adam Kinizinger, one of the two Republicans on the House January 6 committee, said on CNN on Thursday that the latest ruling was not unexpected and the case is not over. \"I don't think it's a huge setback,\" he said. \"I think we expected, frankly, that there would be a stay issued by the appeals court.\" Kinzinger said that he's \"sure ultimately we'll prevail. The question is the timeline.\" He called Mr. Trump's efforts to block the turnover of the documents a \"stall tactic.\"\u00a0 In an emergency motion filed Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Trump asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to issue an injunction halting the transfer of the court documents, arguing that further time is needed for litigation and procedural questions. \"President Trump respectfully moves this Court to enter an administrative injunction enjoining release of the privileged documents while the Court considers President Trump's Motion for a Stay Pending Appeal,\" the filing read. His filing asserts that the National Archives and House Committee \"take no position\" on the request for a brief pause in the transfer of the documents, while fuller legal arguments are made before the appeals court. Mr. Trump's lawyers, in his original lawsuit against the House select committee, argued that his White House records are entitled to confidentiality and claimed they are protected by executive privilege, that a sitting president's private communications should be shielded from public scrutiny. His lawyers called the committee's subpoena for his records\u00a0a \"vexatious, illegal fishing expedition openly endorsed by Biden and designed to unconstitutionally investigate President Trump and his administration.\" They argued, \"Our laws do not permit such an impulsive, egregious action against a former President and his close advisors.\" Since Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit, the National Archives said it has identified over 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request: daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The transfer of the documents was currently scheduled to begin Friday.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Dr. Deborah Birx is speaking out about her tenure as coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force under former President Donald Trump, telling \"Face the Nation\" new details about the 11 months she spent trying to steer the federal government's response to the pandemic. In a wide-ranging interview, Birx spoke about her decision to join the task force in the first place after repeatedly declining to do so, her relationship with Mr. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, the legacy of her time in office and her upcoming retirement. A transcript of Birx's interview moderator Margaret Brennan that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" can be found here. A selection of highlights from the full interview appears below, lightly edited for length and clarity. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we're at the end of February. CDC official gives a briefing to reporters that tanks the markets when she says that within the community there may be a virus spreading and it could cause severe disruption to daily life. Dr. Fauci goes on television a few days later and says the risk to Americans remains low. You're watching this and what are you thinking? DR. BIRX: So I'm in South Africa. We have all of our countries in, from all over the world. We're going through \u2014 we're working 24 hours a day, but we have a break over dinner. And we're staying at a place where we can cook, and I love to cook. So, we're cooking, we're eating, we're watching CNN. And so over those two weeks of February, we're yelling at the CNN television saying, this is going to be a pandemic because the Chinese \u2014 what I saw from China, when you overwhelm your hospitals, you have to know that you have broad-based community spread before that happens. Yet they weren't seeing it.\u00a0 And that really worried me because what we were looking for is people with symptoms. And so when people were coming into the country, we were looking for people with symptoms. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, who do you mean?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I mean the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC.\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, the United \u2014 I think it was everybody. I don't know who was on the task force at that time, but I think multiple agencies were represented at that time. MARGARET BRENNAN: But why wasn't it obvious to them, when you're watching this on TV and saying this is so clearly a pandemic that's coming to hit us hard? DR. BIRX: I guess because I've been in a lot of pandemics, and I've learned from the things we've missed.\u00a0 This is exactly how we missed the HIV pandemic. That's how we missed it when it started. I know that it's not a respiratory disease, but it has a large asymptomatic component. And so we didn't see it until people started getting sick. And that's true about many pandemics.\u00a0 If you're only looking for sick people, you miss a lot of what is really happening under the surface. And so I was always worried that there was a big iceberg under the surface and we were just seeing the top of it. So, when we were questioning people who came into this country about symptoms rather than testing everybody who came into the country, that's when I started to get really worried. At the same time, there were individuals \u2014 there was a single individual in the White House that had been calling me since January. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Matt Pottinger \u2014 DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 \u2014 the deputy national security adviser? DR. BIRX: Because I've known him and I've known his wife for a very long time. We've worked on pandemics together. Both of us were in Asia during SARS. And so we understood how serious this can go. MARGARET BRENNAN: And he asked you, Matt Pottinger asks you to come from the State Department to the White House. DR. BIRX: And I said no about 20 times.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, from the outside, everything looks very chaotic in the White House. I had spent \u2014\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Wasn't it?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: \u2014 the first three years of this administration trying to stay out of the swirl, trying to protect the PEPFAR program. We had extraordinary cuts, obviously, every year. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is AIDS?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It's what's changed the trajectory of the pandemic around the world, both for HIV and TB.\u00a0 I had no interest in going into a political space. I'm not a political person. I'm a civil servant. I've never been a political person. I've never worked on a campaign. I've never campaigned for any of the candidates. I take the Hatch Act very seriously. I- I just am not a political person. So, it never occurred to me to go into the White House until I could see that we were missing pieces that I thought were very important in the response. And so after many weeks of saying, no, no, no, the president announced the new task force with the vice president in the lead. They said this would be very technical, and that I would have a very technical position. And because I thought that I could be helpful, which is the only reason I go and do anything. If I think I have something to add, I feel like it's my obligation to the American public to go in and do that. That's what a civil servant is supposed to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the moment, though, that moment in the spring \u2014 is that the moment you looked at the task force and you said, we have a serious problem here, this is not going according to plan? DR. BIRX: I think everyone knew that. MARGARET BRENNAN: When did that hit you? DR. BIRX: Everyone knew that. Everyone knew that from, I would say, March 8 on. Because you only had to look at the slopes of the curves in these major metropolitan cities to understand what was happening and understanding if you're seeing that rate of hospitalization, how much community spread there was. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were trying to get Americans just to wear masks. And the president himself was undermining you. He wasn't wearing one. I mean, you would go out and talk about it can be a fashion statement from the podium. I mean, you were trying to make it light so people would accept it. But all these guidelines are getting undermined by the president himself. Is there ever a way to make that scenario work? DR. BIRX: Well, you have to, because that's the president. So you have to figure out how to get that message out when you can't get it out from the head of the country. And that's our job. You don't give up. You don't say, well that didn't work so of course you know, everything is going to be terrible. You've got to try to make it the least terrible it can be. I mean, you can't ever in any moment when American lives are at stake, say, well, this is just too hard. I'm giving up. MARGARET BRENNAN: But where's the vice president in all of this? DR. BIRX: The vice president knew what I was doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean he knew that you were telling the governors privately to do things that the president publicly was making light of? When he was saying, you don't really need to wear a mask, or pushing to reopen the economy faster than your guidelines would allow, Mike Pence knew that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: He knew what I was doing because \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: And he supported it? DR. BIRX: \u2014 I don't \u2014I'm not a person who would go out on their own and not do, you know, I wouldn't go \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would you have to be sneaking around? You're the head of the COVID task force and tens of thousands of Americans are dying. Why is that a covert operation? DR. BIRX: Because if this isn't working and you're not going to get that to work, you have to find another solution. I mean, you can't just say, well, the president is saying this so I'm going to give up on the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories that we support. I couldn't do that. And others couldn't either.\u00a0 I mean, there was a team of people going out and supporting this approach. I felt all along that if we could have put 20 or 30 full-time CDC personnel in every state for long term assignments, six-month assignments, they could help states get over these barriers and understand and help support states translate their guidance. Dr. Deborah Birx on #Covid19 #disinformation inside the #Trump White House: \u201cI saw the president presenting graphs that I never made\u201d she tells @margbrennan\u201cSomeone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president\"More on @FaceTheNation pic.twitter.com/1TMlIdvnWR MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were looking at all this data. Do you think when you were in the room and briefing, even if it was with other people, do you think President Trump appreciated the gravity of the health crisis you were describing? DR. BIRX: I think the president appreciated the gravity in March. It took awhile after I arrived in the White House to remove all of the ancillary data that was coming in. I mean, there was parallel data stream coming into the White House that were not transparently utilized. And I needed to stop that, where people were \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean outside advisers?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Outside advisers, coming to inside advisers. And to this day, I mean, until the day I left, I am convinced there were parallel data streams because I \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Disinformation? DR. BIRX: I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made. So, I know that someone out there or someone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president. I don't know to this day who, but I know what I sent up and I know that what was in his hands was different from that. That worries me because at any moment \u2014 I've built my career on data transparency and accountability. It is very important to me that we all agree how the data is collected and how we use it. We don't cut it in pieces and say, we're only going to look at it in this six weeks because it makes us look better. Or, we're all going to look at it in these two weeks because we look better than Europe in these two weeks. You can't do that. You have to use the entire database. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was doing that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX:\u00a0 To this day, I don't know. I know now why watching some of the tapes that certainly Scott Atlas brought in parallel data streams. I don't know who else was part of it, but I think when the record goes back and people see what I was writing on a daily basis that was sent up to White House leadership, that they will see that I was highly specific on what I was seeing and what needed to be done. COVID Deniers inside the White House? \"There were people who definitely believed that this was a hoax,\" former Trump Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx admits to @margbrennan. Birx says she took her messaging on the road to avoid being \"censored\" pic.twitter.com/B30c44MuNM MARGARET BRENNAN: What were the biggest obstacles to you communicating that, though? I mean, were there COVID deniers in the White House? DR. BIRX: There are people in the White House and I think people around this country, because I've had the privilege to meet them and listen to them and hear them, because I wanted to hear what people were saying. There were people who definitely believed that this was a hoax. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. BIRX: I think because the information was confusing at the beginning. I think because we didn't talk about the spectrum of disease, because everyone interpreted on what they knew. And so they saw people get COVID and be fine. And then they had us talking about how severe the disease is and how it could cause these unbelievable fatalities of our American public.\u00a0 I mean, so every American life lost, I mean \u2014 I haven't slept in 10 months or 11 months because those were the numbers. That's someone's parent. That's someone's grandparent. My great-grandmother was lost in the pandemic flu. I know what that feels like from just listening to my grandmother. To have that others feel that same level of pain and loss when it was preventable or could be preventable was really excruciating. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't blame the president's own language of calling some of this politically motivated, a hoax? It was a phrase he used at one point. DR. BIRX: You know, when you have a pandemic where you're relying on every American to change their behavior, communication is absolutely key. And so every time a statement was made by a political leader that wasn't consistent with public health needs, that derailed our response. It is also why I went out on the road because I wasn't censored on the road. DR. BIRX: I was so frustrated by the end of May going into June by the lack of reaction to what I could see in the middle of May coming, that it and that \u2014 you combine that with the gating criteria not being utilized, that I realized that the only way, if I could not get a voice internally, that I could get a voice out at the state level because I could see the governors on the governor's call weekly and I could see how deeply they were concerned about every one of their citizens. Most of them were not in the middle of an election campaign.\u00a0 And so by going out and working with the governors, two things happened. One, I got to see amazing things that are best practices and really bring those back. And what I've learned from Detroit and Chicago and Arkansas and Alabama and Texas and Arizona and up through Connecticut \u2014 I mean, it's just been amazing to be able to see really great solutions and try to bring those back. But that was the place where people would let me say what needed to be said about the pandemic, both in private with the governors and then in following up, doing press to talk to the people of that state. It was difficult during the run-up to the election. That was the time when one of my daily reports \u2014 there was by that time 200 of them. That was when one of them was leaked, right before the election. So clearly there was some intentionality there. And I was talking about how severe the epidemic was in the Northern Plains states and saying if that epidemic gets into our populous states of California, Texas, Florida, New York, that this would be an early surge to what we expected in the winter with the expansion of this virus.\u00a0 And so I was very worried. But others were worried, too. I want to make it clear this was just not Debbie Birx. There was a coalition of four of us at the beginning, from Steve Hahn to Bob Redfield to myself to Tony Fauci, making it clear that we would make sure that we could get the information out to the public in one way or the other. It's why I sent the information to all of them every morning, because I never knew who would have the ability to do press. DR. BIRX: I was an N of 1. So having a team at the White House that can really respond to this is going to be really, really important, because the amount of work that needs to be done not only at the White House but also at the state level to really ensure that we come out of this in some kind of normalcy by summer will be really critical. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you were just one. You were coordinator of the task force. What do you mean, you were just one? DR. BIRX: There was only one full-time person in the White House working on the coronavirus response. There \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: How is that possible?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, that's what I was given. So what I did is, I went to my people that I've known all through the last years in government, all 41, and said, can you come and help me? And so I was able to recruit from other agencies, individuals.\u00a0 And certainly, Irum Zaidi who I brought in from PEPFAR, was my chief epidemiologist and data developer for the PEPFAR program, where we really revolutionized data to really end the- work on ending the pandemic of HIV and TB in sub-Saharan Africa. And so I would be able to wicker together a group of volunteers who really helped me.\u00a0 And I had one incredible support person, Tyler Ann McGuffee, who really helped make sure I was at meetings on time and didn't miss emails. But there was no team, full-time team in the White House working on coronavirus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ask for staff and you were denied? DR. BIRX: I did ask for staff. I think what [the Biden administration is] doing, of bringing in an expert in testing, an expert in vaccines, an expert in data and data use, not just collecting data, but how to use it successfully, I think all of those pieces are going to be critical for their success, bringing in a full-time supply chain person.\u00a0 And so, all of these individuals existed, but they existed in different pockets of government. So as a team, you're constantly having to work outward to getting everybody on board, to making sure the response is as coordinated as it can be. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever consider quitting?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Always. I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that everyday? Colleagues of mine that I had known for decades, decades in that one experience, because I was in the White House, decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever.\u00a0 I had to ask myself every morning, is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night.\u00a0 And when it became a point where I could \u2014 I wasn't getting anywhere and that was, like, right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan of what needed to happen the day after the election and how that needed to be executed. And there was a lot of promise that that would happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you knew at that point that the election was a factor in communication about the virus? DR. BIRX: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever withhold information yourself? DR. BIRX: No.\u00a0 WATCH: Birx reacts to claims that she became an \"apologist\" for Trump and *that* moment where the former president suggested using disinfectant as a potential treatment for #COVID19 \"I wasn't prepared for that. I didn't even know what to do in that moment.\" pic.twitter.com/2ddCblGllH MARGARET BRENNAN: When some of those colleagues were repressing you, I mean, some people felt you became an apologist for President Trump. They look at that moment in the briefing room, you know the one I'm talking about, when he came out and he talked about injecting bleach and you were sitting there and he looked at you and he asked about ultraviolet light and heat \u2014 DR. BIRX: See, that \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 and you start talking about fevers. You didn't say no. DR. BIRX: No, no. OK, so \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me. DR. BIRX: \u2014 so let's go back to that, because that's a really critical moment.\u00a0 He was not speaking to me. He was speaking to the DHS scientist that was two seats over from me that entire time. When he finally turned to me and said, is it a, could this be a treatment? I said, \"not a treatment.\" You can look at the transcripts. \"Not a treatment.\" That dialogue was between the president of the United States and a DHS scientist.\u00a0 I have always been respectful of offices, and you can see I don't criticize people specifically in public. I don't think that \u2014 I always think that you need to transcend that and you need to find a way to communicate effectively where you're not criticizing a person in public.\u00a0 So when he did turn to me at the very end of that dialogue, I said, \"Not a treatment.\" Now it's in the transcripts. It never got picked up by the press as, that is what actually happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your answer when he said bleach, you said, not a treatment? DR. BIRX: Not a treatment. When he turned to me and said, what do you think? Could this be a treatment? I said, not a treatment. But that moment was \u2014 that was completely lost.\u00a0 And then there's, you know, skits on Saturday Night Live. I mean, when you're a scientist who's grounded themselves in data and combating epidemics and working with communities and working with governments to change the future of people's lives for the better and then you get, this is what \u2014 when you talked about, was I prepared for that? No, I wasn't prepared for that. I didn't even know what to do in that moment.\u00a0 I think, you know, that's when you're in that, can't-let-the-floor-swallow-you-up moment. I mean, that conversation between two people was going on in front of me. And I, to this day, don't know what to do when that happens. I think now \u2014 I think there's some people who thought that I would just stand up and take over the microphone from the president. I don't know what people's expectations were in that moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sometimes people say, well, Tony Fauci, when that happened to- to him, he would sort of gently come back up to the podium and set the record straight if he disagreed with the president. DR. BIRX: Well, he was given the opportunity to do that, though. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't feel you were given the opportunity to respond? DR. BIRX: Not until he turned to me and said, could this be a treatment? And I said, not a treatment. You know, in that moment, you know, people then want to define you by the moment and I understand \u2014 I, look, I understand how perceptions go. And I understand, I understood when Matt Pottinger was calling me to go into the White House and try to support a comprehensive coronavirus response by utilizing the strength of the federal government would be a terminal event for my federal career, which is part of the reason why I didn't want to do it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: A terminal event? DR. BIRX: A terminal event. I know that I wouldn't be allowed to really continue successfully within the federal government. You can't go into something that's that polarized and not believe that you won't be tainted by that experience or how people interpret you in that experience.\u00a0 So I knew that part of it. I didn't want that to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this will be the end of your federal career? DR. BIRX: Yeah, I will need to retire probably within the next four to six weeks from CDC. MARGARET BRENNAN: An immunologist, you were appointed by President Obama to work on AIDS relief, as you mentioned, at the State Department. Yet your name in the history books is going to be associated with President Donald Trump. How does that sit with you? DR. BIRX: Well, you know, this is what worries me. When I see how partisan and divided the United States is that then gets played out in the civil service, and if we start looking at technical civil servants as belonging to a political party, we will lose the ability for highly qualified civil servants to come and help.\u00a0 And we have amazingly qualified civil servants. They're at the CDC. They're at HHS. They're at FDA. They're at NIH. And most of the White House personnel are civil servants detailed there from their home agencies. If we start saying if you come in and do this, you are then going to be part of the political apparatus, that is going to be very dangerous for this country.",

            "article_content": "Former President Trump in late December spoke with top Justice Department officials about the 2020 presidential election and told them to \"just say the election was corrupt and to leave the rest to me\" and Republicans in Congress, according to notes taken by then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue.\u00a0 Donoghue's notes,\u00a0released Friday by the Democratic-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, detail a December 27, 2020 phone conversation with Mr. Trump, former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Donoghue. The former president has repeatedly insisted that the presidential election was rigged, but the documented phone conversation suggests that Rosen and Donoghue felt that they were being asked by the president to alter the election results. Here is the relevant section of Donoghue's handwritten notes:\u00a0 -DAG - we'll look at whether have more ballots in PA than registered voters - should be able to check on that quickly but understand that the DOJ can't and won't snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election, doesn't work that way.-P: \"Don't expect you to do that, just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen.\" The president also noted, \"Not much time left.\"\u00a0 That exchange took place during a broader discussion about the election results and possible steps forward, detailed across eight pages of handwritten notes.\u00a0 According to the notes, Rosen and Donoghue told the president, \"We are doing our job. Much of the info you're getting is false.\" They refuted his claims of fraud, citing a report that claimed a \"68% error rate \u2014 but reality is it was .0063% error rate \u2014 less than 1 in 15K.\" In light of the note detailing the December phone conversation, House Oversight and Reform Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said her committee is seeking more interviews.\u00a0 \"These handwritten notes show that President Trump directly instructed our nation's top law enforcement agency to take steps to overturn a free and fair election in the final days of his presidency,\" Maloney said in a statement. \"The Committee has begun scheduling interviews with key witnesses to investigate the full extent of the former President's corruption, and I will exercise every tool at my disposal to ensure all witness testimony is secured without delay.\" In a statement Saturday, Mr. Trump called the House Democrats who run the House Oversight Committee \"corrupt and highly partisan,\" and said they \"released documents\u2014including court filings dealing with the rigged election of 2020\u2014that they dishonestly described as attempting to overturn the election.\" \"In fact, it is just the opposite,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0in part. \"The documents were meant to uphold the integrity and honesty of elections and the sanctity of our vote. The American People want, and demand, that the President of the United States, its chief law enforcement officer in the country, stand with them to fight for Election Integrity and to investigate attempts to undermine our nation.\" On the House Oversight Committee's website, Maloney said the committee\u00a0had written to the Justice Department in May to request documents related to Mr. Trump's \"efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\" In June, it released\u00a0229 pages of documents\u00a0provided by the Justice Department that it said show \"the extent of President Trump and his allies' improper efforts to interfere with the 2020 election.\"\u00a0 The committee has already requested transcribed interviews with Rosen, Donoghue, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, and other Justice Department officials. Maloney noted that the Justice Department had authorized officials to give \"unrestricted testimony\" before Congress because the committee has \"'compelling legislative interests' in understanding the 'extraordinary events' surrounding President Trump's conduct.\" She also said that the Justice Department would not assert any claims of privilege in the officials' testimony. Despite the January 6 assault on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters that came shortly after Mr. Trump held a rally in Washington, the ex-president has not given up his groundless assertions that the election was rigged or stolen. In June, he released a statement referring to \"the 2020 Presidential Election Scam.\"\u00a0 \"Whether it be voting machines, underaged people, dead people, illegal aliens, ballot drops, ballot cheating, absentee ballots, post office delivery (or lack thereof!), lock boxes, people being paid to vote, or other things, the 2020 Presidential Election is, in my mind, the Crime of the Century,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump is trying to block documents including call logs, drafts of remarks and speeches and handwritten notes from his chief of staff relating to the January 6 Capitol insurrection from being released to the committee investigating the riot, the National Archives revealed in a court filing early Saturday.  Mr. Trump has sued to prevent the National Archives from transmitting those documents, and thousands more, to the House committee investigating the attack. President Joe Biden declined to assert executive privilege on most of Mr. Trump's records after determining that doing so is \"not in the best interests of the United States.\"  The Saturday filing, which came as part of the National Archives and Record Administration's opposition to Mr. Trump's lawsuit, details the effort the agency has undertaken to identify records from the Trump White House in response to a broad, 13-page request from the House committee for documents pertaining to the insurrection and Mr. Trump's efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 The document offers the first look at the sort of records that could soon be turned over to the committee for its investigation. Billy Laster, the director of the National Archives' White House Liaison Division, wrote that among the particular documents Mr. Trump has sought to block are 30 pages of \"daily presidential diaries, schedules, appointment information showing visitors to the White House, activity logs, call logs, and switchboard shift-change checklists showing calls to the President and Vice President, all specifically for or encompassing January 6, 2021; 13 pages of \"drafts of speeches, remarks, and correspondence concerning the events of January 6, 2021; and \"three handwritten notes concerning the events of January 6 from (former White House chief of staff Mark) Meadows' files.\"  Mr. Trump also tried to exert executive privilege over pages from former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany's binders of talking points and statements \"principally relating to allegations of voter fraud, election security, and other topics concerning the 2020 election.\"  Other documents included a handwritten note from Meadows' files \"listing potential or scheduled briefings and telephone calls concerning the January 6 certification and other election issues\" and \"a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity.\"  Laster's declaration notes that the National Archives' search began with paper documents because it took until August for digital records from the Trump White House to be transferred to the agency. The National Archives, he wrote, has identified \"several hundred thousand potentially responsive records\" of emails from the Trump White House out of about 100 million sent or received during his administration, and was working to determine whether they pertained to the House request.  Mr. Biden has so far waived executive privilege on nearly all the documents that the committee has asked for, though the committee agreed to \"defer\" its requests for several dozen pages of records at the behest of the Biden White House.  In explaining why Mr. Biden has not shielded Mr. Trump's records, White House counsel Dana Remus wrote that they could \"shed light on events within the White House on and about January 6 and bear on the Select Committee's need to understand the facts underlying the most serious attack on the operations of the Federal Government since the Civil War.\"  On January 6, an armed mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to stop the certification of Mr. Biden's election victory. Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House on a charge he incited the riot but was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.  Mr. Trump called the document requests a \"vexatious, illegal fishing expedition\" that was \"untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,\" in his lawsuit to block the National Archives from turning over the documents to the committee.  The suit also challenges the legality of the Presidential Records Act, arguing that allowing an incumbent president to waive executive privilege of a predecessor just months after he left office is inherently unconstitutional. Biden has said he would go through each request separately to determine whether that privilege should be waived.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol has agreed to defer requests for some Trump White House documents that the Biden administration argued should remain sealed. The committee is seeking documents and communications related to January 6, including records related to Trump's prepared and actual public remarks from November 3, 2020, through January 20, 2021.\u00a0 The Biden White House has overwhelmingly rejected executive privilege requests and given the committee the Trump-era documents it has sought. But the Biden administration agreed to shield some documents due to concerns they could compromise national security and executive privilege.   In a letter to the committee, White House counsel Jonathan Su said President Biden \"recognizes that Congress has a compelling need, in service of its legislative functions, to understand the circumstances that led to the insurrection that took place on January 6, and the extraordinary events surrounding it, in order to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.\" \"The documents for which the Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request do not appear to bear on the White House's preparations for or of January 6, or on efforts to overturn the election or otherwise obstruct the peaceful transfer of power,\" Su wrote. \"Accordingly, the Select Committee's agreement to withdraw or defer these documents, as well as the documents subject to the prior deferral, should not compromise its ability to complete its critical investigation expeditiously.\"\u00a0 The select comittee said in a statement that it \"welcomed\" Mr. Biden's decision to \"clear the way for the production of another set of records.\" The committee noted that it has not withdrawn its request for \"relevant records.\"\u00a0 President Trump on Wednesday issued a statement claiming the committee had \"just dropped a large portion of their request for documents.\" Representative Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, tweeted Wednesday that this was \"false.\" \"In fact, we're actively litigating to obtain White House records Trump is trying to conceal,\" she said. \"We will not allow him to hide the truth about January 6th, or his conduct, from the American people.\" Trump is suing to stop the transfer\u00a0of certain White House documents housed in the National Archives. Trump asked the Supreme Court last week to overturn the decision by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejecting his attempt to block the transfer.\u00a0 \"The records of a former president are not distributed freely upon the conclusion of his term of office, even to Congress,\" Trump's lawyers told the court last week. \"Except in extraordinary circumstances, records are protected from disclosure for a considerable amount of time after a president has left office.\" \u00a0 Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives revealed that it had identified over 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 Trump has since argued that about 750 of those documents, which are at the center of the current lawsuit, should remain confidential under claims of executive privilege.\u00a0 The records requests come as Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon has been indicted for refusing to comply with a subpoena before the committee. Bannon's lawyers have argued he was acting under instructions from the former president. \"President Trump's counsel stated that they were invoking executive and other privileges and therefore directed us not to produce documents or give testimony that might reveal information President Trump's counsel seeks to legally protect,\" Bannon's lawyer said in October.\u00a0 The full House of Representatives voted this month to hold Meadows\u00a0in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena as well. The matter has been referred to the Justince Department, which will decide on charges. Meadows' attorney told the committee that he assumed a responsibility to protect executive privilege before and after his tenure. The panel is expected to ramp up its work in the new year. Public hearings are expected to start this winter and stretch into spring, according to a source familiar with the committee's rough timetable. Their aim is to produce an interim report in the summer, followed by a final report before the November midterm elections.\u00a0 \u00a0 The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, is investigating the\u00a0January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the\u00a0arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was\u00a0impeached by the House\u00a0one week later for inciting the riot, but was later\u00a0acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0 \u00a0 Robert Legare and Melissa Quinn contributed to this report.

In a letter to the archivist of the United States, David Ferriero, White House counsel Dana Remus wrote that Mr. Biden \"has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified as to any of the Documents.\" The House January 6 select committee requested the documents from the National Archives in August, including all \"documents and communications relating in any way to remarks made by Donald Trump or any other persons on January 6.\" Attorneys representing Mr. Trump had asked that the documents be withheld from the committee under the assertion of privilege, arguing that documents and communications related to a sitting president should be shielded from public oversight. But citing what it described as these \"unique and extraordinary circumstances,\" the White House said, \"Congress has a compelling need...to understand the circumstances that led to these horrific events.\" \"The Documents shed light on events within the White House on and about January 6 and bear on the Select Committee's need to understand the facts,\" the letter reads.\u00a0 The National Archives said it received the White House letter but declined further comment.\u00a0 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that Mr. Biden \"believes it to be the utmost importance for the American people to have a complete understanding of the events of that day to prevent them from happening again.\"   But she also noted that evaluating requests for privilege would take place on a case-by-case basis. It's \"an ongoing process, and this is just the first set of documents,\" she told reporters. The decision clears the way for the National Archives to release a trove of documents to the House committee. In August it issued a sweeping request to NARA and seven federal agencies. The request called for executive branch records pertaining to strategies to derail the Electoral College vote, planning for rallies leading up to January 6, as well as documents and communications related to what the former president knew about the election results and potential plans to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.\u00a0 Mr. Trump, who argued that executive privilege should be invoked in response to the committee's request, said he, too, sent a letter to the National Archives \"in defense of the Office of the Presidency.\" \"The Radical Left Democrats tried the RUSSIA Witch Hunt, they tried the fake impeachments, and now they are trying once again to use Congress to persecute their political opponents,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The Democrats are drunk on power, but this dangerous assault on our Constitution and important legal precedent will not work.\"\u00a0 The Biden administration's decision was made public soon after a former top adviser of Mr. Trump, Steve Bannon, said he would not comply with a subpoena from the committee, citing executive privilege. \u00a0 Bo Erickson contributed to this report.",

This latest blitz of subpoenas signifies that the committee is focusing in part on the connection between the promotion of false theories about election fraud and the crowd of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol and disrupted the certification of the election after they listened to speeches from the former president and his allies. From the Trump reelection effort, the committee demanded records and depositions from campaign manager William Stepien, senior adviser\u00a0Jason Miller and executive assistant Angela McCallum. The committee\u00a0 also sent subpoenas to former President Trump's attorney John Eastman, who The Washington Post reported advised Mr. Trump incorrectly that his vice president had the ability to reject electors from states and could overturn Joe Biden's victory. \u00a0 The panel is also seeking information by subpoena from Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's one-time national security advisor who is believed to have attended an Oval Office meeting where attendees discussed seizing voting machines, declaring a national emergency and invoking some national security emergency powers to keep Mr. Trump in the White House, according to multiple reports. The committee also sent a subpoena to Bernard Kerik, an associate of Rudolph Giuliani, who reportedly funded command centers for the effort to overturn the 2020 election results. \"In the days before the January 6th attack, the former President's closest allies and advisors drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,\" Congressman Bennie Thompson, the committee's chair, said in a statement. \"The Select Committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all.\" Mr. Trump has claimed executive privilege over much of the information the committee has requested and is attempting to fight the panel's subpoenas in court. Several of his associates have failed to comply with the committee's demands. Thompson said on Friday that he had rejected privilege claims from Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official, on Friday. A lawyer for Steve Bannon made similar claims of privilege and refused to cooperate, but the committee and then the full House found Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress and asked the Justice Department to prosecute him. Asked Monday whether the Justice Department would prosecute Bannon, Attorney General Merrick Garland said there is an ongoing examination of \"the facts and the law\" but did not indicate which way the department was leaning.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory.

The panel's expected vote to recommend charges of contempt of Congress would send the matter to the full House, which is likely to approve the measure and expose Meadows to criminal prosecution by the Justice Department. In laying out the case for the contempt vote, the nine-member panel released a 51-page report Sunday evening that details its questions about the documents he has already provided - including 6,600 pages of records taken from personal email accounts and about 2,000 text messages. The panel didn't release the documents but described some of them.  The report gives details about Meadows' efforts to help Donald Trump overturn his defeat in the presidential election, communications with members of Congress and organizers of a rally held the morning of the insurrection, and frantic messages among aides and others as the violent attack unfolded that day. The panel says it also wants to know more about whether Trump was engaged in discussions regarding the response of the National Guard, which was delayed for hours as the violence escalated and the rioters brutally beat police guarding the Capitol building.   The report says that the documents provided by Meadows show that he sent an email to an unidentified person saying that the guard would be present to \"protect pro Trump people\" and that more would be available on standby. The committee does not give any additional details about the email.   The committee says in the report that Trump's former top White House aide \"is uniquely situated to provide key information, having straddled an official role in the White House and unofficial role related to Mr. Trump's reelection campaign.\"   The contempt vote comes after more than two months of negotiations with Meadows and his lawyer and as the panel has also struggled to obtain information from some of Trump's other top aides, such as his longtime ally Steve Bannon. The House voted to recommend charges against Bannon in October, and the Justice Department indicted him on two counts of contempt last month.  The panel is aiming to develop the most comprehensive record yet of the violent attack, in which hundreds of Trump's supporters violently pushed past law enforcement officers, broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of Biden's victory. Meadows' testimony could be key, as he was Trump's top aide at the time and was with him in the White House as the rioters breached the building.  The committee's chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, scheduled the vote last week after Meadows failed to show up at his deposition. In a transcript of that meeting released on Sunday, a member of the panel's investigative staff details several of the questions they would have asked. Many of the questions center on Trump's efforts to overturn the election in the weeks before the insurrection, including Meadows' outreach to states and his communications with members of Congress.   Committee staff said they would have interviewed Meadows about emails \"to leadership at the Department of Justice on December 29th and 30th, 2020, and January 1st, 2021, encouraging investigations of suspected voter fraud,\" even though election officials and courts across the country had refuted the claims.   The panel said Meadows, a former Republican congressman from North Carolina, also provided text messages sent to and from members of Congress \"before, during, and after the attack on the United States Capitol.\" One exchange with a lawmaker concerned efforts to contact state legislators about the election because \"POTUS wants to chat with them.\" POTUS stands for president of the United States.  In a text exchange with an unidentified senator, the committee said, Meadows said that Trump believed that Vice President Mike Pence had the power to reject electors in his role presiding over the certification. Pence did not have that power under the law, as the vice president's function is largely ceremonial.   In other texts, sent the day of the attack, Meadows' former colleagues encouraged him to get Trump to discourage the violence, the committee said.  Similarly, in an exchange with an organizer of the rally that morning - where Trump told his supporters to \"fight like hell\" - the organizer told Meadows that they \"desperately\" needed direction from him because things \"have gotten crazy.\"   Meadows, who has balked at the committee's questions, citing Trump's claims of executive privilege, has sued the panel, asking the court to invalidate two subpoenas he says are \"overly broad and unduly burdensome.\" The lawsuit accuses the committee of overreaching by issuing a subpoena to Verizon for his cell phone records.  Thompson and the committee's Republican vice chairwoman, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, said the lawsuit \"won't succeed at slowing down the Select Committee's investigation or stopping us from getting the information we're seeking.\"   The panel has already interviewed almost 300 witnesses and lawmakers, and says it plans a series of hearings early next year to make many of its findings public.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - MICHAEL MCFAUL PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, thanks for joining us on Intelligence Matters. It's great to have you on the show. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Great to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, I want to start with with a little bit about you. For our listeners, and I'd love to hear about how you got interested in Russia and how did you find your way to the government the first time? MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, I got interested in Russia from high school debate. I grew up in Montana and my junior year, we moved to a town called Bozeman, and I tried to get the easiest English credit I could, and I was told, 'Take the debate class.' So I just I want to underscore the serendipity there. And the topic that year was U.S. trade policy. And so my debate partner and I ran a case, as it's called in high school debate, on increasing trade with the Soviet Union. This was 79-80. I don't think I would have supported that idea a couple of years later, but I didn't know better back then. And that's when I first got interested in the Soviet Union. My debate partner, by the way, is a guy named Steve Daines. He's now Senator Daines from Montana, and we both just became intrigued with the Soviet Union. And then as a freshman at Stanford, I showed up here as a 17 year old kid and I took 'How Nations Deal with Each Other' a course on international relations, and first year Russian. And then I just I had a theory that, you know, if we could just understand that society better, we might be able to reduce tensions or at least not have misperceptions in terms of U.S.-Soviet relations. And, you know, in a way, I've been kind of thinking about testing that hypothesis for the last three or four decades. So that was the initial interest in Russia. I then later studied there in '83, '85, '88 and most importantly, '90-91. So the year the Soviet Union collapsed I was at Moscow State University and became quite interested in under what conditions do regimes collapse and under what conditions do political movements, democratic movements coalesce? That's been a part of my academic research ever since then. And that really, I would say, was a formative year that made me interested not just in understanding Russia and the Soviet Union, but becoming more involved in a kind of, I guess we would call it policy, now, I would say I was more of an activist back then. Kind of an anti-communist activist. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you remember what the mood was like on the ground when the Soviet Union fell apart and you were there? MICHAEL MCFAUL: Yes, I was physically not there in August 1991. I left Moscow in June of 1991. I was there for the run up and I went to all the demonstrations and I interacted with a group called Democratic Russia. I started working for an American NGO at the time, it's called The National Democratic Institute. So I did become, you know, I wasn't just an analyst, if you will. I was writing my PhD still, but I was also becoming a bit of an activist and it was -- I then flew back in October, right after the coup failed in August 1991. And the mood was euphoric. I mean, the mood was, 'We have defeated communism, we have destroyed the Soviet empire.' -- These are my friends, right? You know, these are Russians that I was interacting with, right? - \"And we are now joining the West?\" And so, when I hear that, oftentimes it's phrased that, the United States won the Cold War. Well, yes, the United States most certainly played a big role in winning the Cold War. But these Russians that I knew they were victors as well in the Cold War and Ukrainians and Estonians and Georgians who I knew at the time as well. So it was a euphoric moment. It felt like that Russia was going to join the West and become a democratic system of government and a market society, market capitalism. And of course, we know that's not the way that story ended, but back then it was quite euphoric.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So your first job in the government? What was that? How did that happen? MICHAEL MCFAUL: So my first job was at the National Security Council. You know these words well, but I didn't know them that well. I was senior director for Russia and Eurasia Affairs, and I was an SAP, Special Assistant to the President. And I started -- President Obama was sworn in on a Tuesday, and I started that job on a Wednesday. I landed that job through, I worked on his campaign and there was a group of advisers and one of them was a friend of mine from Stanford and Oxford, where I went to school, Susan Rice. And I signed up pretty early on, Mike, back when I honestly didn't know much about Senator Obama at the time, but I trusted Susan's instincts. And she said, \"This is one of the smartest guys I've ever met and he's going to be elected president and you should get on this bandwagon.\" And I did. And that was a great ride. So that was my first job. And then as I tried to leave that job and go back to Stanford - remember, you know, academics spend, I think the average is 18 months in the government. Many universities have a requirement that you have to come back after two years. And so that was always kind of the clock in my head. But in 2011, my immediate boss at the time, Tom Donilon, he was the national security adviser at the time. This will sound funny now, but he was like, \"Mike, how can you leave now? We're in such a cooperative time with Russia, with President Medvedev.\" And we'd just gotten in the start treaty done. We just got the Iran nuclear deal done. They were about to join the WTO and they just voted with us -- or they abstained, to be clear, to allow the use of force against Libya, something Russia had never done. So the height of cooperation. And he's like, \"You can't leave now.\" And he called me back a couple of hours later, he said, \"I talked to the boss and he said, 'You can't leave either,' - President Obama.\" And that's how it was from that conversation until the end of the year that they proposed that I stay in the government but do a more family-friendly job, which turned out to be true, by the way. And that's how I became the ambassador to Russia starting in January 2012. MICHAEL MORELL: Any particular memories stand out of your time in Moscow. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Oh, well, Moscow was a fantastic job. I mean, in many ways it was a difficult time in terms of my day job, which was, you know, right as I landed in Moscow on the streets of Russia in Moscow and St. Petersburg and other big cities were the biggest demonstrations against the regime since 1991. Since that year I was describing, 1991, and that meant, you know, for Putin that that we were out to get him. And he blamed Obama. He blamed America. And when I got there, he blamed me personally for seeking to foment revolution in Russia. And you need to remember, in his mind, I've always worked for the CIA, and I want to be clear, I've never worked for the CIA. MICHAEL MORELL: I can attest to that. MICHAEL MCFAUL: You can attest to that. But, you know, in their coating of things going way back to 1991, I was a revolutionary fomenter. And so I arrived in that initial -- the weekend I arrived as the U.S. ambassador, there was a 20 minute hit job on national television describing my mission to Moscow, which was to overthrow Putin. So that was the main drama, if you will, in terms of my service there. And no matter what we said, that was a useful story for him. And it wasn't just instrumental. I used to think it was just instrumental. I came later to believe that actually, Putin is quite paranoid and thinks that we are trying to overthrow his regime. And by the way, I don't know if we are or not today. I want to be clear about that. When I was in the government, we were not. MICHAEL MORELL: We were not. We were absolutely not. Yeah. MICHAEL MCFAUL: So I got there right as U.S.-Russia relations started to deteriorate. Now they got a lot worse after I left. People blame me for the breakdown, and I like to remind people that Putin did not annex Crimea when I was ambassador, he waited until the day I left. So it's been in a negative trajectory ever since 2012, right? Because of Putin needing this narrative of the West out to get him. That was the hard story. And playing defense, trying to avoid worsening things happening. That was my my government bilateral job with the Russian government. But being the ambassador, I hope it's like this in every country, but certainly in Russia, it's a vast, incredibly complex society. I would host Russian basketball players and ballerinas and musical groups. And the other thing you get to do is you get to present America in all of its different dimensions to the Russian people, the kind of public diplomacy part of that job. And I loved that part of the job. In fact, one of my best memories, Mike, I'm from Montana, as I already mentioned. And one of the first groups ever to come to Moscow while I was ambassador was from Montana, a country western group, and my father was a country western musician. So, you know, that's a milieu I know well and I go down to the ballroom and there's no dance floor and I go to my staff, I was like, \"Where people are going to dance?\" And they said, \"Mr. Ambassador, people do not dance at Spaso House. This is a concert.\" And I said, \"No, in Montana, you don't have a group like this, come -- we will offend them. It will be culturally offensive if we don't dance.\" So we had this big standoff between the Russian staff and the new American ambassador, and we compromised. We took out three rows. And of course, nobody danced, she was right, until my wife and I got up. And then there was just this explosion of 300 Russians doing the two-step rather poorly, by the way, but with great enthusiasm. And that was a fun night because it was a really tense moment in terms of US-Russia relations. But there were senators there and members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, you know, mixing it up with a band from Montana. MICHAEL MORELL: That's great. So Mike, what are those things that Russia does that we see as inconsistent with our and our allies' interests? And why do they do those things? MICHAEL MCFAUL: Yeah, that's a big, hard question. And the first thing I would say is over time, I would answer that question differently. So if we were talking in the summer of 1992, for instance, when I moved back to Moscow to open the office of an American NGO, the government of Russia invited us. We were a democracy promotion organization, the National Democratic Institute, and our host was the Russian government, president Yeltsin. And that's because they wanted the affinity with the United States. And at least they pretended to share our values, and I don't think it was pretending. I think they wanted to be a part of the West. So I just think that's important to remind people that, over the years, Russia and the Soviet Union and even going back, you know, 200 years, that's -- you would answer that question differently at different times. But today, I think it's pretty clear. Putin, somebody I've known for a long time and written about and met for the first time in the spring of 1991 - he also has changed his views, by the way - but today he's decided that the West is out to get him, that the West wants to overthrow regimes that we don't like. And by the way, we have done that from time to time. So he's got some data to support his hypothesis. MICHAEL MORELL: Sure does. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Therefore, when we use the words \"liberal,\" \"democracy, he hears, in those words, threats to his regime. And by the way, he's right about that. At one point, are we funding opposition groups to overthrow him? The answer to that is no. But do our values undermine his legitimacy in his country and around the world? The answer to that is yes. And so he has -- initially he consolidated power inside his country, propagating a kind of nationalist, populist set of ideas, anti-democratic ideas. He would use the word \"conservative.\" He would say he's a man of conservative values, traditional values. That's the way he would describe it. And in the last decade, he's now started to export those set of ideas, looking for like-minded leaders in places like Hungary and Italy, and even here in the United States, putting a lot of money into propaganda to propagate those ideas around the world using his vast and - I don't need to tell you - but he's invested a lot in his intelligence services, again, in the service of sometimes of propagating those views. And he really does define the liberal West as his enemy today, and therefore he's pretty engaged in what he considers an ideological struggle with the West. MICHAEL MORELL: And can you describe him as a person and what's he like? What's he like to deal with? What drives him, what motivates him? He paints himself as a great chess master. Is that right? Is he that much of a strategic thinker? Spend a little bit of time talking about Putin, the man. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Sure. So the first time I met him, he was the deputy mayor for a very charismatic pro-Western leader, Anatoly Sobchak was his name. And I want to be clear, Putin made no impression on me whatsoever. If you'd asked me back in 1991, you know, name 500 people that'll be the next president to replace President Yeltsin, he would have not made my list. And I think that's important for people to understand. He was an accidental president chosen by Yeltsin. It wasn't some populist demand for who he was. And so his views and his ways have changed over the years and decades. But today, I would say a couple of things about his mannerisms. Remember, he's been in power for over two decades. So he thinks he knows everything. He doesn't listen even to his closest advisers anymore. They're all second-tier people compared to him. It kind of reminds me of what I used to read about Stalin. He has no peers inside the country anymore, in his view. So he's quite arrogant. And number two, he has that view about the world. The last great leader, in his view, that was a peer to him in the West was Angela Merkel, and now her time is coming to a close. Xi Jinping, he admires. That's real, and I think we should understand that to be real. There is a kind of affinity there ideologically, and I think on a personal level. But the rest of the world, he doesn't think he has any peers. Third, Mike, you'll appreciate this. He is a well-trained intelligence officer. Remember, he did counterintelligence. So he comes into meetings really well-briefed. And I've seen it many times with Secretary of State Clinton, with President Obama, with National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Secretary Kerry. These are various people have been in meetings with Putin, with where he will try to, you know, get people off their game, say something surprising. He wants to see how they'll react. He'll then say, \"Oh, I was just kidding.\" At one point, he said to Vice President Biden, the last time they met - they met in Geneva most recently - but the last time before then was in Moscow. I was in that meeting. And when the press break came in, he said, \"Oh, Vice President Biden and I just agreed to visa-free travel between our two countries,\" and he just wanted to see how Biden would react, right? So he does that kind of stuff. He likes to stare. He's done it to me. And believe me, it's scary, especially when you're sitting in his office on his side of the wall and your bodyguards are on the other side. He's got an intense way of looking at you. He did this once to me when he was basically accusing me of supporting the opposition in Russia, and he wants you to blink, literally and figuratively. MICHAEL MORELL: So stare without speaking or stare while you're talking or -? MICHAEL MCFAUL: The pregnant pause. He's very comfortable just staring at you and waiting, with kind of a glare, in my case. Meeting with Secretary Kerry, for instance -a the principal in the room is Secretary Kerry. I'm just the ambassador, right? I'm just there's part of the team. And at one point, he just pivoted to me and said, \"We know what your embassy is doing here.\" And he just stared right at me and he said, \"And we're going to stop it because we're really good at it.\" And it was this, you know, it was kind of macho, KGB, you know, \"We know what you guys are doing.\" And by the way - we always used to wonder about this, by the way - if he really knows what we're doing and we have no reason to not believe that, why is he so paranoid? But he wanted to elicit a reaction and and he deliberately moved away from Kerry and stared at me to create tension in the room. And he plays those kinds of psychological games. I'm talking about negative ones. He also does it in a positive way, for instance, when he met with Obama in 2009, and I need to be careful here about what I'm going to talk about. But he was trying to make the case that there can be circumstances under which Russian and American cooperation on intelligence could be good for them and good for us. You've heard that many, many times. And for many decades.. But for dramatic effect - I won't talk about the specifics, that's classified - but for dramatic effect, he dismissed all of the help staff that was there. This was at his dacha and he told them to all leave the room. And then he kind of leaned in to talk to Obama, you know, with a whisper. That was very dramatic. And I remember it made an impression on President Obama, right? It was effective theater. MICHAEL MORELL: So I want to ask you a question, and I've been thinking about this. At the end of the day, I'm wondering if history is going to look back on Putin as someone who advanced the interests of the Russian state or someone who helped lead to its decline. As an example, I'm thinking about, at, the end of the day, who was the big loser in the Ukraine crisis, right? Obviously, the Ukrainians had their ambitions dashed, the West for looking impotent. But you know, at the end of the day, it's probably the Russian economy and the Russian middle class and Russia itself, right, because of what's happened in the aftermath. And I'm just wondering how you think about how history will see this guy. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Yeah, that's a great question. And I obviously don't have a great answer. And part of it depends on who has the pen for writing that, right? Whether it's people out here at Stanford or it's people at Moscow State and what happens in the post Putin era. But I'd say a couple of things. I mean, my own view is, you know, I have no qualms with the statement of Russians that want Russia to be a great power in the world. That's fine by me, as long as it's a democratic Russia and playing by the rules of the game. And Putin very cleverly has convinced - I don't know if it's a majority, but a large segment of the Russian society - that his strategy is the strategy for making Russia great in the world. But you can run the counterfactual and remember he was an accidental president picked out of obscurity. Had there not been the 1998 financial crash around the world, I'm convinced it would have been somebody else. In fact, everybody does. It's a fairly well-known story that the heir apparent back in 1998 was a guy named Boris Nemtsov, and Nemtsov was a pro-democratic, liberal, pro-market leader from a town called Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovsk, very industrial town in the middle of the Urals, and he won re-election twice during an economic crash throughout the 1990s. By the way, he was Jewish. So this notion of ethnicity - he overcame those circumstances. And I knew him. He was an incredibly talented politician. And had that crash not happened, there's no doubt in my mind that Yeltsin would have chosen him. And run that tape - they could be one of the leading players in Europe today, as opposed to being in opposition to Europe. And I think they could be a much greater power today than the path that Putin went down them because there have been real consequences for that economy as a result of annexation of Crimea and meddling in our elections in 2016. What I don't know is who writes that history, right? Because Putin was lucky in that he was chosen by Yeltsin, then ratified by the people of Russia, right as the Russian economy began to grow. And that would have happened no matter who was chosen, they would have ridden that upside of six or seven percent growth for 10 years. But, I think he will probably be remembered as the leader that brought Russia back from state collapse in the 1990s and an economic depression of the 1990s. I just think it was a bit of an accident that it will be Putin that gets the credit for doing that. MICHAEL MORELL: So you do see the argument right, Mike, from time to time, that if Putin wasn't in the job, there'd be somebody else like Putin in the job because that's what the Russian people want. What do you think of that argument? MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, I think it's partly true and partly not. So let me explain that. So, that's what people said when Stalin died. They loved Stalin. People cried for three days when Stalin died. The massive, massive lines went to walk by his open casket. And yet, three years later, you had a guy named Khrushchev that did de-Stalinisation. So that continuity, even in the Soviet period, wasn't there. And remember, in the Brezhnev era, it was a period we called it \"Zastoi,\" it was Russian stagnation. But nobody - and I was living there in 1983. In fact, I was living there in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev came along. Nobody in '83 and '85 was saying, \"Well, this system is going to radically transform,\" let alone collapse five years later. So I'm very skeptical of the kind of trajectory, culture doesn't change, history doesn't change. I think there is an action-reaction between culture, history and individuals and political change. And when I think about Putin, I think, what's the more radical prediction: that 20 years from now, this basic, corrupt, poorly functioning system will be in place 20 years from now or that something will replace it after the end of the Putin era? I don't think Putin himself will lose power, but I'm skeptical that what he's built will last, you know, another decade or two. Now, I'm not comfortable in trying to predict what might replace it. Something even worse could replace it. But there could also be this opening for democratic renewal. And I would just say, if you look at the data - it's hard to do public opinion work in Russia. Believe me, you have no incentive in that society to express your true preferences. People need to remember that when they look at polling from places like China or Russia or Iran, right? And we know that from history that if you're sitting out there in Vladivostok and you know, Volodya from Moscow calls from a polling firm and he says, \"Hey, we want to know what you think,\" There's really only one rational answer to that: \"Of course he's doing great.\" There's no upside to expressing what you might truly think.  So with all those caveats, yes, it still is the case that that there's quite a bit of disenchantment in Russia today with the economy. They don't blame Putin, right? He's been able to separate himself from the performance of his government, but they're not excited about what's happening in their country today. And, you know, they still do support, should leaders be elected versus chosen by God or chosen by a party, they still think that leaders should be elected. So I actually think those there's a lot of volatility coming in the Russian political system in the post-Putin era. And there's one other thing I would say, you know, putting on my social science hat now, we're not - I don't know how you think about the CIA's ability to predict the future. But we in political science are pretty bad at it. MICHAEL MORELL: Everybody is. MICHAEL MCFAUL: We're not good at point predictions. But we we are pretty good at some long-term trajectory things, over hundreds of years, right? Over hundreds of years, there's a pretty strong correlation between the more well-to-do a society is, the more educated it is, the more urban it is, the more income GDP per capita, the more likely there is to be demand for democracy. And if you look at GDP per capita, eight of the top 20 countries in the world, if you kick out the oil exporters, they're all democracies. I don't think that's a spurious correlation. Russia is one of the richest countries in the world today, GDP per capita, Singapore, Russia, Kazakhstan that are not democratic. And I sometimes - if you're betting, you think that's going to last or will some, over decades, not not in two to three years, but over decades, will Russia become more like Europe? My prediction is they'll probably become more like Democratic Europe. MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, one more question on Putin. What worries him? What is he afraid of? And I'm asking that question in the context of what might deter him, what might lead him from the kind of behavior that has so worried us. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Yeah, that's a great question. I think it's the fundamental question for the Biden administration and all Democratic governments in Europe. From his perspective, he's gotten away with a lot recently, right? He annexed Crimea and he said, \"I dare you to unravel it,\" and we failed to do so, right. We played a game of chicken in Syria, still when I was in the government. And President Obama used to make the argument to him that if we don't stop this contest, this conflict, even back in 2011, when it was still peaceful, it's going to get more violent and there's going to be more radicals there. And Putin said, \"Yeah, and I know what to do with that. We have the experience of Chechnya. We'll just back a strongman until he succeeds.\" And he took that bet and he deployed his air force in 2015. And from his perspective, he thinks that that was the right course there. In 2016, when he violated our sovereignty and our elections, he dared us  to push him out and to make him pay, and from his perspective, he doesn't think that he personally has paid a price, even though many oligarchs have and most certainly the Russian people have. So I think it's hard. I want to be clear about that. Having said that, I do think there's two or three things one can do. Number one, you need to make more credible our commitments to our allies and reduce to near zero any doubt in Putin's mind that if he does use force against a NATO ally, there will be a response from that alliance. Now I applaud President Obama and President Trump for doing more with respect to our Article Five commitments as they're called to NATO. But I think we need to do more. I think there's still too much doubt and I really worry about some minor skirmish in one of our NATO allies, and then he pulls back and then we don't respond. That's my nightmare scenario, but that's number one.  Number two, for those countries we're not going to defend militarily - I'm thinking of Ukraine first and foremost. I think we have to give them as much capacity as possible to defend themselves. And that's why I applaud the recent upping of military assistance to Ukraine. And number three, I hate to sound like a cold warrior because it's not the right analogy; there's lots of things that have changed. But this is an ideological struggle with Putin. And I think we have to up our game into, one, just supporting those that support independent reporting. So that's one dimension that I just think we need to do more of as a government and as a democracy in the world. But two, I think we have to get back into the game of supporting and explaining why democracy is better than autocracy. And that is threatening to Putin. And we do do some of that, but I think we could do a whole lot more. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, your assessment of President Biden's approach so far to Russia and to Putin. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, the greatest achievement is that we have one policy towards Russia today, not two, as we did during the Trump administration, where you had basically, not entirely, but almost the entire administration had one policy that they were pursuing, and the president himself, President Trump, disagreed with that and that led to a lot of bad outcomes. So thankfully t that is not happening today and you have one policy. And I think the broad contours are correct, which is, low expectations for reversing the negative trend but trying to at least slow down the negative trend and to cooperate on matters where our interests overlap. And first and foremost, that relates to arms control. I think that's the right strategy. I would like to see more on the ideological dimension. I think there are \"small D\" democrats in Georgia, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia itself and \"small D\" democrats in the alliance and some of the frontline states - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania - who would like to see more meat on the bones to statements that President Biden rightly says.  I mean, I think he rightly has diagnosed the problem, and this is with respect to China as well, that there is a battle between democracies and autocracies. And he has said that many times and various ways, and I applaud that. I think analytically he's right about that. I think now they need to fill in, \"Well, if that's the case, what are we going to do to lean in to support \"small D\" democrats? So by that, I mean, democratic governments. But I also mean democrats fighting in these countries against autocracy. And that part, I think needs more articulation. MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, one final question. So looking at at your CV, I see that no matter where you go, you always find your way back to Stanford. And I'm wondering why?\u00a0 MICHAEL MCFAUL: That's true. I've left, I think, eight times and I've always come back, and I would leave again. I loved working in the government, by the way. It was the thrill of a lifetime both at the White House and in Moscow. A great honor to work with people like you. But in the long stretch -- actually, I'll just tell you a story from one of my colleagues here, Condi Rice. I met Condi 30 or 40 years ago, and she'd just gotten back from her first tour of government. And she said -and I was still writing my DPhil, my Ph.D. at Oxford and trying to figure out whether to go into academia or government - and she said, \"Well, if you go into government, you should go all in and make a career out of it. But if you're going to parachute in and out,\" -- as she did in her career, and this is early on in her career, she said -- \"Remember one thing, that if you're going to be one of these political appointees in and out of government, remember that you're going to spend most of your time out of government, so make sure you choose a career that you really enjoy.\"  And I love Stanford. And for lots of reasons, but two are central. One, it is my job to continue to learn here, Mike. That's a great that's a great blessing, that it is actually my job to learn. And I think sometimes people can spend too much time in government circles not learning, just treading water. So that's a great privilege. And number two, Stanford community doesn't get any older, right? I get older, but every year - because we're talking here in the fall quarter - there are all these young new people here, and they're really smart and they ask really tough, interesting questions. And  I change the courses I teach here every two or three years. I rarely teach a course more than three years because I use the classroom to learn from these students, so -- they think they're learning from me. But I know that it is a two-way street, and that's a pretty great place to spend your career. MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. Great conversation. Thank you. MICHAEL MCFAUL: Thanks for having me.",

Pape reviews the results of recent studies and polls carried out in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the Capitol and reveals troubling findings about the breadth and depth of anti-government sentiment in the United States. He also describes why more studies are needed to prevent additional violence from targeting the 2022 midterm elections.\u00a0 Highlights Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. Intelligence Matters: Robert Pape Producer: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Bob, welcome back to Intelligence Matters. You're becoming a regular. ROBERT PAPE: Well, thank you very much, Michael. I am very proud to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: And it's good to talk to you. I always learn something profound, actually, so I'm really looking forward to this. Bob, you were on our show in March, and at that time you were sharing with us the results of some fascinating research that your center had done on those individuals who had been arrested for their involvement in their insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th. So I'd love to do two things today if it's OK with you. The first is I'd love to bring our listeners up to date on that research because I know it's continued. And second, I'd love for you to walk folks through some very interesting new polling that you've done on the insurrectionist movement in the US. Does that sound OK? ROBERT PAPE: That sounds great. MICHAEL MORELL: Perfect. So let's let's start with the research that CPOST has been doing on those people who have been arrested for what they did on January 6, when you were with us in the spring. You had looked at the 290 people who had been arrested at that point. How many folks do you have in your database today? ROBERT PAPE: Six hundred and four. MICHAEL MORELL: Wow, wow. And did the new information from those additional 300 folks, did that information change your findings in any way or just make the findings that you already had more robust? And can you walk us through the findings where they stand today? ROBERT PAPE: Absolutely. It pushed the findings even further in the direction so many people thought, initially with all the pictures of Proud Boys and other militia groups that what happened on January 6 was essentially a fringe group like militia members that had come together and for sure, they were there. However, what we found is that when you study the 600, now, individuals who actually broke into the Capitol and were arrested for breaking into the Capitol, you get a very different picture. The folks who broke into the Capitol on January 6 were fundamentally coming from the mainstream in ways that previous far right extremists are not.  And why do I say mainstream? Because when you look at the 600, only 14 percent are members of militias like the Oath Keepers or extremist groups like the Proud Boys. That means 86 percent are not. Fifty one percent of those 600 are business owners or come from white-collar occupations: doctors, attorneys, I.T. specialists. This is very different than we're used to seeing from past far right extremists, where many of them are unemployed. Here, only about seven percent are unemployed, pretty close to the national average, by the way, on January 6. We're not seeing them come from those marginal stratum of society. Further, over 50 percent of those arrested for breaking into the Capitol on January 6 live in areas that are large urban areas that Biden won. That is, they're not coming from the rural areas of America that are most associated with Donald Trump and support for Donald Trump. And this tells us something very important. It means that January 6 was not just another instance of far right violence. This was a very different thing now. Different enough in degree to be different in kind. What we saw is an act of collective political violence, attacking our most cherished of symbols of our democracy, the U.S. Capitol, in order to change the results of our most cherished constitutional process, who becomes our president of the United States. And they're coming from the mainstream. They're coming from forty-four states around the United States. They're coming from California in large numbers. They're coming from New York, and not just New York, but New York City in large numbers. And so we need to understand that what the January 6 event was, was something really quite different than we've experienced before. And the number one thing that's different about it is how much it's part of the mainstream of America. MICHAEL MORELL: So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves because I think the polling is really interesting and I want to spend a lot of time on that. But what's the kind of bottom line for this? This is a much broader movement than most people think. This is deeper than most people think. How should we think about what these findings mean for where we go from here? ROBERT PAPE: Well, the most important thing is studying what happened on January 6th is not just about the past. Yes, it's very important to know who broke into the Capitol. They broke laws. Yes, it's very important to prosecute them to the extent of the law. But this is not just about history, Michael. This is about what are the prospects for other instances of collective violence, especially related to elections going forward. And that really should be our focus that today I have to say I don't think has been the focus. So yes, we have congressional hearings. Yes, we have a congressional commission, but very much these are focused on drilling into the past, which is very important. However, I think that we need to be aware that we are moving into already a politically tumultuous 2022 election season just in the last month with the events in Afghanistan, which has created tremendous amount of anger in many of our military circles, military communities; with the new mandates for COVID, which President Biden has just announced, which are already generating tremendous pushback against the federal government. We need to realize that we're moving into not just a politically tumultuous 2022 election season, but we need to understand the risks that that could break out into violence. Now, we're never going to be able to put a probability on that, but we can do things to better survey and understand and diagnose the degree and risks of political violence in America. And those tools look a lot like the tools we would do in overseas conflicts. When we want to know what are the prospects here of the stability of Afghanistan going forward, we're not just measuring counting number of Taliban. We're doing surveys of the Afghan population in order to see just how legitimate or illegitimate the average Afghan believes their government is, just how secure they feel, just what are their attitudes? Because that environment of the political, the public environment is ultimately the sea within which violent folks swim and gain sustenance, gain oxygen, if you would, from that public support. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Bob, one more question before we get to the polling. Are you tracking the outcomes of each of these arrests, you know, whether they turn into indictments, plea bargains, guilty, not guilty? Are you tracking that as well? ROBERT PAPE: We are. That end of the pipeline in terms of plea bargains, it's just now starting to populate with enough numbers that we might be able to see patterns. So about 50 today have pled guilty. And so over time, those numbers are likely to grow rather substantially, especially over the next four to five months. So that end of the pipeline is something that we're going to be able to study more, not just say but understand more clearly in the coming months. So yes, the answer is we are tracking it through the whole pipeline. But no, you don't have that many of the 600 having gone all the way through to sentencing to be able to get that much additional clarity as of today, September 13th. I think by January 6, 2022, that's going to be a different story. It takes time, not just through our due process. MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha. OK, so the new polling work, which h I think is absolutely fascinating, and which you you've shared with me already. And before we get to the to the results, though, Bob, why did you do the survey and what were the nature of the questions and what were you trying to get at? BOB PAPE: The reason we did the survey is because of what we learned from studying the 600 arrested for breaking into the Capitol. That is that the 600 are far more mainstream than previous far-right extremist violence, and that right there told us we needed to understand the degree of those insurrectionists' sentiments in the wider population, not just those who were arrested. So think about it this way. We are often, in law enforcement, looking for a needle in a haystack. But here it's very important to understand what the haystack looks like. So it's very important to get a broader understanding of the communities, the populations that these needles are coming from because they are much more reflective of the mainstream. But that means we need to understand those sentiments in the mainstream. Now, this doesn't tell us everything we want to know. So our study so far also suggests that political leaders such as Donald Trump calling for people to come to the Capitol on January 6, encouraging strength directly against the Capitol and weak Republicans in the Capitol, that may well have been quite important in terms of how that collective violence occurred. But what we want to understand is what is the degree of the sentiments in the population that political figures may be able to incite. And if that's very, very tiny and trivial, then it's not really going to matter very much. If it's sizable, however, then we need to realize that the ability to have replays of January 6- like events could be far more possible than we think. MICHAEL MORELL: So is it fair to say that what you're trying to measure here is the tinder, right? And whether that fire gets lit is is another issue, right, and we can think about that. I think what you're trying to measure here is how much dry fuel there is here. ROBERT PAPE: I think that's a great analogy. So when we look at wildfires on the West Coast, we know it takes a lightning strike typically to be in the match that sets off the fires. But it's the tinder underneath that are drying out during global warming that's really creating the possibility of wildfires in some places and not others.  So yes, there may well be specific matches that are also going to be important as triggers. But it's the underlying hay in the haystack that's actually going to do the part. And that's why we need to understand what that tinder, the scope of that tinder, and what it looks like if we're going to really get a sense of our vulnerability to those fires. MICHAEL MORELL: Bob, how many people were surveyed and when were they surveyed? ROBERT PAPE: Yeah. So our survey was fielded by NORC at the University of Chicago, which is one of the oldest and most respected polling agencies in the United States. It is based on a nationally representative sample, so it's not just a handful of undergraduates dialing phones or sending emails. It's done with a very well-constructed panel at NORC called AmeriSpeak, which is 40,000 strong. That is, NORC spends enormous sums of money to create nationally-representative pools of 40,000. And they refresh that. They repopulate that. And that's used by The Washington Post, that's used by the White House for COVID. In fact, the White House has recently, over the last several months ,talked about some of the COVID polling studies. These kind of panels are the strength that are also very expensive. So it's not just the five hundred hour poll.  Now from that 40,000, the draw is a random draw of a thousand. In our case, it was a 1,070 and they're a random sample from that carefully put together panel of 40,000. And then these statisticians at NORC, they, of course, look at what the results are and they then know and can tell you if in fact, the random sample is biased in certain ways or not compared to the national average. So all of that is to say that the methods underneath the poll that we did are the gold standard. There is no better standard. It's the standards that are used by the top media in the in the United States, by the federal government in the United States; we're using those very same gold standard polling methods to get at the sentiments related to political violence in the United States. MICHAEL MORELL: And because you're drawing your 1,000from this, this representative sample of 40,000 that 1,000 can give you give you robust results on the overall population. Is that fair? ROBERT PAPE: It allows us to have the confidence within about two percent. So the margin, there's still a margin of error, but it's actually a very respectable plus or minus two percent and allows us to extrapolate from the1,000 to the entire population of adults in the United States. So there are about 255 million adults in the United States. This process allows us to, with our survey, do a nationally representative sample, which then can be extrapolated to the population as a whole with about plus or minus two percent. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, so that's great background, Bob. So walk us through the results. ROBERT PAPE: So the key issues we wanted to understand are what are the scope and drivers of insurrectionists' sentiments in the United States? And so we asked questions directly on point number one. We asked whether people believed the use of force was justified to restore former President Trump to the White House. We also asked whether people believed that the 2020 election was stolen and Joe Biden was an illegitimate president. That is, we asked tougher questions than you typically see in political surveys of these topics. We're not asking just about support for Donald Trump in a political way. \"Would you vote for him?\" We're asking, \"Do you believe force is justified to restore him to the White House?\" We're not asking, \"Do you have some doubts or concerns about the 2020 election?\" We're asking, \"Do you believe Joe Biden is an illegitimate president?\" These are the harder edged questions. And again, I want to liken them to the background that we have in asking tough questions like this in, say, Afghanistan, where we want to know does the Afghan population believe the Afghan government that we installed is legitimate or illegitimate? And we're asking the same kind of tough questions here in the United States. MICHAEL MORELL: And what did you learn? ROBERT PAPE: What we discovered was something really quite astounding. And we decided to spend a little bit of time before releasing it to the public because we went back to our NORC folks wanting to make sure we've got this story exactly right because what we're finding here surprised us as much as anybody else. This was [done] at the end of June. So it was done six months after the insurrection. It was done after people have been arrested by the hundreds and hundreds for the insurrection. And what we discovered was that nine percent of American adults, which equates to 23 million people, believed that force was justified to restore Donald Trump to the presidency. Within that nine percent over half - that is, five percent of all American adults - strongly agreed that force was justified to restore Donald Trump to the presidency. That's 12 million American adults. That's much larger than any of us would have thought before this poll. We further discovered that effectively 65 million Americans, that's 26 percent of American adults, believe that Joe Biden is an illegitimate president. And that, again, over half of that number strongly agree. Now, when you put both of those beliefs together - that is, do you both believe that force is justified to restore Donald Trump to the presidency and believe that Joe Biden is an illegitimate president - you get eight percent of American adults having both of these radical beliefs. These are truly adamant insurrectionist beliefs because they agree on both. And that equates to 21 million adults. So that's really quite a worrisome pool of insurrectionist sentiments in the country. And it's something that then we've gone further and we ask further questions about the drivers because we wanted to know, What are the drivers of what put you in that 21 million compared to the other, say, 200 plus million who are not in that; are those adamant insurrectionists? What's the big separator?  And there are two things, Michael, that really jumped out. Sixty three percent, the number one factor, 63 percent of the 21 million adamant insurrectionists in the country believe in the \"Great Replacement.\" The idea that the rights of Whites will be overtaken by the rights of Blacks and Hispanics.  The second most important driver was a QAnon belief, where 53 percent of the 21 million believed that our government is run and controlled by a satanic cult of pedophiles. Those are the two radical beliefs that are really underneath, drive the key drivers of the insurrectionist sentiments in the country today. MICHAEL MORELL: So the first one, right, the replacement theory - that makes sense, right? That makes sense to me. The second one is just so far outside of reality that you wonder how people in that large number can believe such a thing. ROBERT PAPE: That's exactly right, Michael. And by the way, that's how why we're now moving forward to still further deeper analysis of those sentiments in the U.S. public, much the way we use testing to understand the degree of COVID and different variants of COVID in the general population. We need to do similar testing or surveys of the degree of insurrectionist sentiments in the United States and the variants on those sentiments. That is how science works and how science adds clarity so that we can really develop useful tools here that can help inoculate us in the future. So understanding where we are today, we now know that there are, just like with COVID, that there were certain subpopulations that were especially vulnerable. We now understand that. So the next step is for us to do more work. So as we speak, we are getting ready to field not just surveys, but focus groups, which are essentially deep conversations with people who hold these beliefs. Because my work has been a combination over the last 30 years of qualitative and quantitative social science. So I definitely understand that we don't just want to have a broad understanding. We want to have deep and rich understanding. And so rather than just though, make guesses here, we really want to do this based on empirical knowledge. And so I am with you. I want to know. I also want to know more about the \"Great Replacement\" because I want to know, well, what fear is exactly are underneath this? Is this a fear of economic loss? Is this a fear of physical safety? There's a number of different possibilities about why someone might be so concerned with the \"Great Replacement\" they'd want to overturn our Constitution, you see. So this isn't just a degree of prejudice the way we normally seem to understand it, right? Based on the QAnon - like bizarre beliefs, the more we understand it, these are beliefs that are motivating people to want to overturn the Constitution that we really need to do some more work to understand that. And we're actually making quite quite rapid progress here as the way science goes. You might remember it took us a long time to get a grip on COVID, and we're still wrestling with that. And so we're doing the same thing here. So at the moment, we now understand much more clearly the scope and the core drivers of the phenomenon. We also understand something else that really opens the door to a potential helpful future because we also asked people about how they think about different levels of government in terms of friend or enemy. And what we discovered is, not surprisingly, about half of folks who have these adamant insurrectionist beliefs see the federal government as an enemy. So of course, overturning the Constitution, you might not be too surprised about that. But what we were surprised to find is that 75 percent of those saw the local government, their local government, as either a friend or at least neutral. That is, this was not just a generalized hatred or animosity toward any type of government. And what that tells us is that we may well be able to work more with mayors and local governments here than we thought. So that's one of the one of the issues here is, well, just what level would you try to cut into this? And we're we've learned something very important this summer. MICHAEL MORELL: Bob, one of the things that struck me about the survey was you actually looked at both the views of people regarding political violence and their capacity to engage in it. Can you talk about that a little bit? ROBERT PAPE: Yes. So it's very important to take into account not just somebody's willingness to be either aggressive or to have angry sentiments against the U.S. government and U.S. Constitution, but their capacity - and capacity in this situation means relationship to gun ownership or relationship to the US military. And what we discovered is that about 15 percent of those with these insurrectionist sentiments have military service, and that may seem at first like a relatively small amount. But what that means is that we actually have a core where there some skills in violence in this rather large pool of adamant insurrectionists. So what does that mean for us as we go forward? Well, now that we know that, we know that there is a significant capability component to these insurrectionists sentiments. We are going forward - and I've been asked this summer by the Pentagon to study what makes individuals with military service susceptible to insurrectionist sentiments or recruitment by militia and extremist groups. And we are about to go forward with that survey in just the very near term. But that, too, is just the natural next step. So this is how science progresses. So we learn something about the sentiment, something about the capability. Now we have real reason to focus on those more difficult diagnostics to really drill into the size of those particular tumors. And the capability side is important because it's not just a will that leads to the actual activity of insurrection, it's will plus capability. And so it's very important that we tackle both sides of that at the same time. MICHAEL MORELL: One of the things that struck me is that there's a difference, right, between someone saying violence is justified and that same person being willing themselves to engage in violence. And I'm just wondering how you think about that. ROBERT PAPE: That is for sure. And that is true also when we study political violence overseas so that we know that only a small fraction of people who are willing to engage in violence will ultimately engage in violence. What's important to see is that the size of the pool matters tremendously. So internationally, it matters tremendously whether an international terrorist group has 300 and whether that 300 is a part of an iceberg that's all above the waterline, say, 10 percent of the waterline. And so we want to know the size of the underlying iceberg, not just simply the part that's actually mobilized. Same here. So we can't really say, \"I wish we had really precise metrics to say, 'Oh, it's 1 in 10 or 1 in 15 that we really have,' to, we can really say, could be, would be actually mobilized. I'm afraid we can't quite go that far, but what we can do is we can look at things like how far people had to travel to D.C. to be engaged in the insurrection itself on January 6. Going back to our first set of studies and what we discover is that we can actually make some capability assessments. And that's important as we go forward because we could also then extrapolate that to more localized areas in the 2022 election, where we can say, \"Oh, so the distance to a state capital may be much shorter than the distance to Washington, D.C.,\" and that can help us establish real risk assessments for different states in the 2022 election.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Bob, do you have any sense, if you survey Muslims worldwide, what percent of them would say that violence is justified to defend their religion? I'm trying to make a comparison here at the end of the day between the insurrectionist movement and Islamic extremists. ROBERT PAPE: So we have at particular points in time done exactly those kinds of studies. Let me use a case that many of your listeners will be familiar with. That is the Palestinians in Israel in the 90s and then in the Second Intifada. So in that situation, that conflict went on long enough that we had quite good opinion polls of Palestinian attitudes toward violence and particularly suicide terrorism over a period of time from, say, the 1990s through 2005, the height of the Second Intifada. And what you can see in those polling numbers is that in the 90s, relatively small numbers of Palestinians believe that suicide attacks were justified to end Israeli occupation. But during the Second Intifada, those numbers spiked up. They spiked up to well over 50 percent, and that went side by side with the growth in the actual violence. So it's not like what you saw was the growth of the violence separately from the rise of support, public support for that violence. You saw them go up together side by side. Let's understand there's many things that also happened to trigger those. We have leaders of Hamas. We have terrorist leaders. I don't mean to say that understanding the general public's attitudes to violence is the only predictor of the future of violence. However, I do think that it is an important part of context, and it's the part of the context we often overlook because these require tools of social science. These require tools that are not simply investigative tools of individual cases. So it's a different kind of understanding of intelligence that is not really tactical. It's more at the strategic level, but it is a very important part of the picture. And I dare say, had we had such polls back in December of 2020, we might have been much better positioned to expect violence on January 6. I believe the key missing ingredient, if I had a time machine, and we could redo this, was not to get better tactical intelligence on what was going to happen on January 6. It was to get better strategic understanding of the sentiments here that that political leaders could touch off, and it wouldn't take much to touch them off because the sentiments were already dry kindling ready to be set of fire. So I think the same thing happens here with Palestinians and terrorism, and that's a documented case where we have many, many years of data. And your listeners, many of them will actually know this from what I'm saying, we'll be able to see a tremendous amount of evidence to support what I'm saying in the Palestinian case. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. The reason I asked the question, Bob, is I was having a drink with with a foreign ambassador on the 10th of January, and we were, of course, talking about January 6th and he said to me, \"Michael, this is your al Qaida.\" And that really struck me. Let me just just finish up with with a kind of big picture question here, Bob. How dangerous is this, do you think, in the end, and in particular, you know, in the context of American history, have we seen times like this? How dangerous is this? ROBERT PAPE: Well, we have not seen a mob, anything like the mob we saw on January 5, attack the Capitol in our country ever. Because it's a domestic mob. When people point back to events that might be similar and say, the War of 1812 -that's a long time ago, of course, but it was also the British. This was not America attacking our own most cherished symbol of democracy. So back to Al Qaida. So on 9/11, we'll remember that fourth plane, the one that went down in Shanksville thanks to the bravery of those passengers - many believe that that target was the US Capitol, and why the US Capitol? Because that in many ways is the undeniable symbol of our American democracy. And so this is historically unprecedented If you look at other democracies around the world, the last time the Israeli Knesset had a mob attack, it was 1952. So a long time ago. If you look at the British parliament, never since World War II. If you look at the German parliament, the Bundestag, never since World War II. So we are not seeing in mature democracies like the United States, Britain, others and Western Europe, anything like this behavior as a routine matter. And we need to understand that since January 6, there's been a tremendous effort to legitimate the the actions of those in who acted on January 6, right? In fact, we have television channels now, One America, Newsmax that routinely are legitimating these actions as legitimate acts of patriotism. And that's really something that we need to understand is also very different and very new. We're not used to thinking that a patriot means overturning the existing constitutional process in the United States. That's something that we we really don't want to see evolve any further. And the only way I think that we can be confident is by doing this, by really having real science and social science come in to monitor insurrectionist sentiments over time. See how these are ebbing and flowing? Are they getting worse? How can we act before the next event before our 2022 election? Should we be deploying the National Guard to different state houses around the country? Well, these surveys of insurrectionist sentiments are going to be our best strategic information to help mayors, governors and our national leaders make those very, very difficult decisions. They won't be the only piece of information. But short of those events happening again, this is our best way to monitor those possibilities. And they're important because what would have happened? Could we imagine what would have happened had Joe Biden not been certified by the Congress here on January 6? What life in our country would have been like it if it hadn't only taken three days to certify? This is really not something we want to confront. MICHAEL MORELL: Bob, thank you so much for joining us. When you get those focus group results, we'd love to have you back on and walk us through them. This is obviously an extraordinarily important issue, but thank you so much for joining us today. ROBERT PAPE: Well, thank you, Michael, and thank you as always for allowing a very full discussion of the information that we have. Your podcast is one of the most valuable things we have for our security on many issues going forward. And it's a privilege to be part of it. Thank you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Thursday she would rule \"expeditiously\" on whether former President Donald Trump can keep certain records from his tenure in the White House out of the hands of the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \u00a0 Attorneys representing Mr. Trump, the House of Representatives and the National Archives argued in federal court Thursday over the House select committee's requests for the records held by the National Archives and Records Administration that pertain to the Capitol riot.\u00a0 The former president sued the committee and the National Archives in an attempt to halt the transfer of records from his presidency, over 750 of which he has claimed executive privilege.\u00a0 The lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's records are subject to a certain level of confidentiality and, in requesting access to these documents, \"the Committee is attempting to damage the republic itself, and the citizens of the United States, for executive privilege 'safeguards the public interest in candid, confidential deliberations within the Executive Branch; it is 'fundamental to the operation of Government.'\" President Biden has already rejected his predecessor's claim of executive privilege and permitted the National Archives, which holds the records, to comply with the House committee's request for the documents. The committee says it needs the documents to further understand the events leading up to, during, and following the January 6 assault on the Capitol.\u00a0 Judge Tanya Chutkan is now tasked with deciding whether the claim of privilege made by the former president outweighs the incumbent president's waiver of that same principle. In court on Thursday, Mr. Trump's attorney Justin Clark argued the documents requested are not only subject to executive privilege, but that the requests are also extremely broad and do not lend themselves to a valid legislative purpose for the House.\u00a0 The request from the House and the National Archives' decision to release the documents amounts to a \"broad document dump,\" Clark alleged, which has \"turn[ed] into a partisan exercise.\"\u00a0 The judge seemed unconvinced by much of his argument, but granted that some of the included records, like campaign polling data, are \"alarmingly broad.\"\u00a0 Nevertheless, as Clark argued that the committee has other means of investigating the January 6 attack outside of obtaining the archived records like subpoenas and depositions, Chutkan again rejected his claims.\u00a0 \"Your client has instructed others who have received subpoenas not to comply,\" she told Mr. Trump's attorney, so the records may, in fact, be necessary.\u00a0 The judge later pressed general counsel for the House of Representatives, Douglas Letter, on the breadth of the House's request for documents, particularly those that seem to predate the 2020 election.  \"We want to see who did President Trump talk to, who was he consulting with ... what really led up to this,\" Letter responded, explaining an additional job of the committee is working to rebuild public confidence in the electoral system.\u00a0 Chutkan, however, pressed on, saying, \"There has to be a limit ... where is the line drawn?\"\u00a0 And as for the National Archives, Elizabeth Shapiro of the Justice Department also argued that deference should be granted to Mr. Biden's decision to waive privilege over the Trump White House records. \"These are not documents where privilege and confidentiality will survive forever. Far from it,\" she added.\u00a0 Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives has revealed that it identified more than 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is an extended transcript of Dr. Deborah Birx's interview with \"Face the Nation\" that aired Sunday, January 24, 2021, on CBSN and the new\u00a0\"Facing Forward with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0podcast.\u00a0\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on some of the news of the moment where we are with this virus. President Biden rolled out a number of actions on day one: executive order to wear a mask on federal property or traveling interstate, requiring everyone on White House grounds to be tested, quarantining after international travel, forcing agencies to share data. What do you think of what he's done so far? DR. BIRX: Well, certainly I'm fully supportive of all of those elements. I'm a strong supporter of masks and even mask mandates. I think mask mandates are really critical because you need that constant reminder. I mean, we're talking about our primary tools right now, in addition to the vaccine, is behavior change. And when you're asking people to change their behavior, you need those constant reminders. And when I was on the road, being reminded that I had to wear my mask was very helpful in the mask mandate states. And so fully I- and anything that has to do with data I'm thrilled by. We have some very old databases. We've used a lot of modeling rather than improving the collection of real-time data. I think that's absolutely crucial. And I think the other innovations around really bringing people together, I think having what he didn't- well, one of the executive orders was around the White House coronavirus response coordinator and a deputy. I was an N of 1.\u00a0 So having a team at the White House that can really respond to this is going to be really, really important, because the amount of work that needs to be done not only at the White House but also at the state level to really ensure that we come out of this in some kind of normalcy by summer will be really critical. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you were just one. You were coordinator of the task force. What do you mean, you were just one? DR. BIRX: There was only one full-time person in the White House working on the coronavirus response. There-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How is that possible?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, that's what I was given. So what I did is I went to my- my people that I've known all through the last years in government, all 41, and said, can you come and help me? And so I was able to recruit from other agencies, individuals. And certainly, Irum Zaidi who I brought in from PEPFAR, was my chief epidemiologist and data developer for the PEPFAR program, where we really revolutionized data to really end the- work on ending the pandemic of HIV and TB in sub-Saharan Africa. And so I would be able to wicker together a group of volunteers who really helped me. And I had one incredible support person, Tyler Ann McGuffee, who really helped make sure I was at meetings on time and didn't miss emails. But there was no team, full-time team in the White House working on coronavirus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ask for staff and you were denied? DR. BIRX: I did ask for staff. I think what they're doing of bringing in an expert in testing, an expert in vaccines, an expert in data and data use, not just collecting data, but how to use it successfully, I think all of those pieces are going to be critical for their success, bringing in a full-time supply chain person. And so all of these individuals existed, but they existed in different pockets of government. So as a team, you're constantly having to work outward to getting everybody on board, to making sure the response is as coordinated as it can be. MARGARET BRENNAN: On vaccines, the president says 100 million doses within 100 days. That's not 100 million Americans vaccinated. What do you think is actually possible? Is that too limited a goal? DR. BIRX: Well, I know we- we haven't talked a lot, but I am very- I'm very, very hard-driving and relentless on where I think we need to go. And I- I would be thrilled to have 100 million people protected in 100 days.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Actual shots in arms? DR. BIRX: Actual shots in arms, individuals in arms. I- I think it's really important to move vaccines forward as fast as possible. I understand- and as I told them right after the election, there's not a lot of infrastructure behind a lot of these initiatives in the federal government right now. And- and I know that they will bring in the infrastructure around that. And so I think things will begin to accelerate, but we shouldn't hold ourselves back. And so we really need to ensure that states that are doing well can even do better. Learn from those states, get that to other states. I think getting more on-the-ground learning- it's why I went out in the field is to really understand what's working at the ground level. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you think it's a little modest as a goal. But the Biden coronavirus czar, for lack of a better term, told reporters, \"When it comes to the vaccine, what we're inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined.\" Is that a political statement? Is that accurate? DR. BIRX: You know, I've been trying to process all the last 11 months because I- it's really important that we understand what worked and what didn't work. And I think I've tried to pull all of this together. And I took extensive notes during the entire process because I didn't want to lose track of what we need to do to make our response better in the future. One of those critical areas, and you're really getting to that essential point, is this idea of federalism on which the United States was built. But that can be taken to extremes. And so the mantra always was federally supported and state-managed, locally executed.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Trump plan? DR. BIRX: That was- that was the mantra. But what does support mean? And what does federal support mean? And I think really an understanding of what states need to translate guidance into implementation, what state needs- states need in interpreting data together. They only are seeing their data. But it's really important that they understand what's happening in their entire region because people have been mobile. When we were out on the road, the interstates were filled with people traveling. And so I think this idea of how the- can the federal government be more supportive of the states not just delivering things, but delivering new ideas and new innovations about how to make those things work better. And I think their intent- I hope their intent is to do exactly that. It's why Arum Zaidi and I went on the road. We went on the road because we wanted to figure out what states needed as far as federal support, how they were interpreting that guidance, how communities were interpreting the CDC guidance.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We kept hearing time and again from the Trump administration, Secretary Azar in particular, that they were getting that information from the states, that they were being responsive, that all of this was just playing politics when governors complained. DR. BIRX: So we did work very hard to build a comprehensive database, not without a lot of scars over that last 11 months. It was really important to me personally because in order to have data that's reliable, it's not only the actual number but what the trend lines around that number is. And are there inflection points in the slope of the development of that number? And so really what we tried to bring together is all the testing data, all the case data, all the hospitalization data and certainly all the fatality data to be able to constantly be triangulating data down to the most granular level, because I think that's very important. It's the- where you see success and you really see counties doing extremely well, metros doing extremely well. You've got to get to them then and learn from them because, remember, they're in the middle of trying to stop a pandemic. So they're working very hard with their citizens to stop a pandemic. If you want to learn to- from them, you need to physically go, see what they're doing, and bring those learnings back to other states. I think that's the approach that they're going to take. I think the past administration was focused very much on when we see a data problem- when we see a problem that's illustrated by the data like out of N95 masks, we ship them N95 masks. But when you're talking about translating testing more proactively or strategically, you need real examples about how to do it better. You can't just send more tests. And I think that's the kind of learning, that bidirectional learning between the states and the federal government that I hope is going to increase with the new administration. Test positivity even going up to 0.1 to 0.3 to 0.5%, tells you that you have expanding community spread. That's the moment to tell that population, that local population, we are seeing more community spread. We need you to do these things. The trouble is, we still are reacting late and that by the ti me we react, the community spread is so widespread that then you have two to three to four weeks of really significant hospitalization rates. And that always concerns me that we don't stop the virus early enough. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC director said that the health infrastructure is \"frail and poorly tended.\" She seems to be saying this is a problem that goes beyond President Trump. That sounds like she's saying the infrastructure was rotting. Is that how you describe it?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, that's such an insightful point. It should be--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree? DR. BIRX: It's a very insightful point, because after federalism, one of our biggest problems is we have a complete disconnect between what we call our clinical data systems, what happens at laboratories and hospitals and our public health data systems. And they don't interact in any way. So when we had to build these databases and data streams, we had to bring together public health data with clinical data. And that does not naturally exist in the United States and that has to be fixed. MARGARET BRENNAN: But we're the richest country in the world. How are we calling the CDC, which is supposed to be the premier agency, frail? DR. BIRX: Because we haven't valued prevention. And we haven't taken on the difficult task of prevention early enough to really prevent some of these comorbidities. We're very good at identifying them, And the CDC has been great about saying this is where hypertension exists. This is where obesity exists. This is where diabetes exists. This is where our overlapping comorbidities exist. But to really tackle that, you've got to have granular data and you've got to have it really frequently so you can see if your interventions are working. So we've- we have serious problems, but we're not tackling them in this deliberative, data-driven way to really make changes. And I think what the new CDC director is recognizing we have to really bring together are clinical and preventive responses and really be able to show impact. Because if you can show a governor, which is what we- why we also went on the road, when you can show the governor that within two weeks of a mask mandate, Phoenix's cases began to drop dramatically. Then I can take that to another city and say, this is what the mayor of Phoenix did. Look at the impact it had. This is the data. They can see that then. And then they can say to their population, the reason we're asking you to do this is because it works and it worked in Phoenix. So we think it will work here in Tucson. And that's- that's the kind of information that we need around obesity, hypertension, diabetes. We- we just can't keep ignoring these comorbidities that put Americans at significant risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: Some would hear you say that and say it sounds like you're blaming Americans-- DR. BIRX: Oh gosh no-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --for their own health problems.\u00a0 DR. BIRX:\u00a0 Never. Never. These health- yes, certain health problems are genetic for sure. But we have created a system that didn't value giving Americans the clear information and the clear ability to respond in a preventive way. We like to treat illness. We're not as good at prevention. And that was very much illustrated in this pandemic. And I would never blame an American because I suffer from the same things. And I- I guess I should be blaming myself. I mean, I was on the road. I gained 15 pounds. I mean, I can tell you, if you eat some of our food that's available to us regularly, you will gain weight. If you're immobile and you're driving around and you're eating McDonald's French fries all the time, it's not a good situation. I'm a direct experience of what that situation looks like. And now I'm going to have to work at that. But encouraging people and showing that work results in outcomes and impact- people will change their behaviors if they know what to do and they get positive reinforcement. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were often at odds with the CDC, is what I've been told. Is that true? DR. BIRX: I know the CDC well, so it was diff- let me just be very clear, it was more difficult for them because I knew where the gaps were. And so when I came in, I really asked for those gaps to be addressed. And a lot of it has to do with real-time data and real-time data acquisition and data revolution and data modernization to make things better so that the CDC, the premier public health agency, has daily information on how Americans are doing. Not just in this pandemic, but in general down to the zip code level, so they can be very clear about what needs to be done. So I was very pushy on that. I was also very pushy, and the one thing that's been taken completely out of context is when I was talking about not trusting the CDC data, it had to do with the ethnicity and race of the fatalities early on because of the delay in that reporting. So I was using the information from my European colleagues, and I'm still deeply grateful to them, of understanding who was most at risk for serious outcomes in this virus, because our delay for death certificates that have all that information on can be up to 30 days.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. DR. BIRX: So when you're in the middle of a pan-- and it's gotten better. So that was the argument. They never talked about what was being discussed before and what was being discussed after. I really like to make real-time data better. And the way you make real-time better- data better is you use it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that you thought there might be an American strain of this virus circulating and the CDC says they don't have evidence of that. Are they wrong? DR. BIRX: Well, there's two pieces of that, to be completely clear. So we certainly in this country had all the setup to develop the same kind of what we call more transmissible strains of the UK, Brazil and- and South Africa. In fact, we had more capacity because we had more ongoing cases and infections continuously in the United States. So, this virus naturally mutates. It's constantly changing, because it's an RNA virus. Some of it is just a mistake and it's a failure and that virus can no longer replicate. Other changes may make a competitive advantage. It's not like it's intellectually trying to make itself more fit. It just by accident makes these mutations. They happen then to be more fit, more able to spread, and then you see this escape. So the way you find them is you constantly are sequencing the underlying cases so you can look for what we call a nodal escape. Where it's enriched, where you see more of these sequences in this area. It's what we've done in molecular biology forever. We didn't have enough of those sequences. So what I was looking at is the rate of rise in the fall--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. BIRX: --and the case fatality rate. So what I said and what I- so, anything that I do personally, I increased my mitigation in October because I could see this rate of rise. So, I wanted the governors to know what I was concerned about, and I said this could be. I didn't say we had one because of course, until you have all the sequences, you can document it. But certainly the slope of the fall surge was twice as fast and it's lasting longer and, critically, it's been more difficult to mitigate. So Texas and Arizona are doing exactly what they did in the summer that was able to control the spread. And it's not having the same impact. You saw the same thing in L.A. So, what I wanted the governors to be able to know is we could have it,--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DR. BIRX: --but we should act like we do have it. On two sides, we should be sequencing more to actually find if we do have it. But at the same time, we should be enhancing our mitigation and going to our communities and saying what's happening in the UK could be happening here and we just aren't seeing it yet. So let's act like we could-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. DR. BIRX: --and let's mitigate more. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about when you joined the COVID Task Force. So, we're at the end of February. CDC official gives a briefing to reporters that tanks the markets when she says that within the community there may be a virus spreading and it could cause severe disruption to daily life. Dr. Fauci goes on television a few days later and says the risk to Americans remains low. You're watching this and what are you thinking? DR. BIRX: So I'm in South Africa. We have all of our countries in from all over the world. We're going through- we're working 24 hours a day, but we have a break over dinner. And we're staying at a place where we can cook, and I love to cook. So, we're cooking, we're eating, we're watching CNN. And so over those two weeks of February, we're yelling at the CNN television saying this is going to be a pandemic because the Chinese- what I saw from China, when you overwhelm your hospitals, you have to know that you have broad-based community spread before that happens. Yet they weren't seeing it. And so from the minute I saw the hospitals in China, I was worried that there was large spread, asymptomatic component to this coronavirus pandemic. And that really worried me because what we were looking for is people with symptoms. And so when people were coming into the country, we were looking for people with symptoms. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, who do you mean?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I mean the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC.\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, the United- I think it was everybody. I don't know who was on the task force at that time, but I think multiple agencies were represented at that time. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Matt Pottinger,--\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the Deputy National Security Adviser? DR. BIRX: Because I have- I've known him and I've known his wife for a very long time. We've worked on pandemics together. Both of us were in Asia during SARS. And so we understood how serious this can go, and I think- I think there was a level of belief that our technology would really save us from this, you know, that we would be able to find all the infections or stop all the infections. But when you have an asymptomatic component, the only way you find them is proactive testing. MARGARET BRENNAN: And he asked you, Matt Pottinger asks you to come from the State Department to the White House. DR. BIRX: And I said no about 20 times.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, from the outside, everything looks very chaotic in the White House. I had spent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Wasn't it?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: --the first three years of this administration trying to stay out of the swirl, trying to protect the PEPFAR program. We had extraordinary cuts, obviously, every year. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is AIDS?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It's what's changed the trajectory of the pandemic around the world, both for HIV and TB. And I'm very proud of the work that the community and I say that community, Global Fund, UNAIDS, WHO, PEPFAR together, along with our HIV advocates and community groups around the- around the world. We've been able to tackle this, but it took all of us together, working together. And I had spent three years just trying to protect the program and keep my head down and get my work done. I had no interest in going into a political space. I'm not a political person. I'm a civil servant. I've never been a political person. I've never worked on a campaign.\u00a0 I've never campaigned for any of the candidates. I take the Hatch Act very seriously. I- I just am not a political person. So, it would- it never occurred to me to go into the White House until I could see that we were missing pieces that I thought were very important in the response. And so after many weeks of saying, no, no, no, the president announced the new task force with the vice president in the lead. They said this would be very technical, and that I would have a very technical position. And because I thought that I could be helpful, which is the only reason I go and do anything. If I think I have something to add, I feel like it's my obligation to the American public to go in and do that. That's what a civil servant is supposed to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel you made a difference?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: How?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I think the biggest difference was over the testing. So as soon as I- I arrived March 2nd, I talked to the vice president. I said these are the three gaps I think we have. They have to be addressed this week. Every day that goes by, we get further behind. You cannot confront this epidemic by primarily testing, as we have in flu, by small conformational testing in public health labs. When they were approaching it as a flu pandemic, because that is what we expected to happen in the United States, testing is utilized to confirm about every thousands or every hundred thousand case. Flu is diagnosed by symptoms. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield from the CDC, they were there. DR. BIRX: But, you know, when you're in the midst of it and they were very much focused on preventing infections from coming into the United States. They were very focused on that, looking for those symptomatic cases. I thought what I could bring, I had a lot of experience in RNA viruses, RNA virus testing development, vaccine development, but most importantly, experience in trying to get government to work and government to work efficiently and effectively, and change management in government. And I can tell you, change management in the federal government is very different than change management in the public sector- in the private sector. And so I want to- I thought I could bring some of those skills and my focus on being able to read data and being able to see changes early so that people could be alerted early. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you, as you mentioned, have been a public servant. You were a colonel in the Army? DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: An immunologist, you were appointed by President Obama to work on AIDS relief, as you mentioned, at the State Department. Yet your name in the history books is going to be associated with President Donald Trump. How does that sit with you? DR. BIRX: Well, you know, this is what worries me. When I see how partisan and divided the United States is that then gets played out in the civil service, and if we start looking at technical civil servants as belonging to a political party, we will lose the ability for highly qualified civil servants to come and help. And we have amazingly qualified civil servants. They're at the CDC. They're at HHS. They're at FDA. They're at NIH. And most of the White House personnel are civil servants detailed there from their home agencies. If we start saying if you come in and do this, you are then going to be part of the political apparatus, that is going to be very dangerous for this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like your work is misunderstood as political? DR. BIRX: I don't- I think pandemics are always political. That's what, I mean, I've worked in 60 countries. Every pandemic is political because you have to make policy changes to confront them, and policies are often political. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, you worked on AIDS, which is a highly politicized virus--\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in sub-Saharan Africa. But did any of that prepare you for the politics you encountered here with this pandemic in this White House? MARGARET BRENNAN: No. No. And I feel like- it's still difficult for me because I pride myself in being able to always find a way, find a way or make one. When this doesn't work, you go this way. When that doesn't work, you go this way. You find another set of alliances. White Houses function in a pretty- a pretty bureaucratic way, and most of the agencies function in a very predictable and bureaucratic way. But when you remove the infrastructure of the civil servants, then you end up with a lot more very quick right turns, left, turns, right turns, left turns, and that- that becomes less predictable and less able to manage that kind of response and change. And so I think in some ways people will say, you know, disrupting and change is very important. And yes, disruption and change and inflection points in American history are important. And it's important to recognize those and build on those. But it also in a pandemic can be very, very difficult then to get us back always to the response that we need to have and being able to point out here's where the problems are coming from. That said, I was privileged to work with a whole series of both political and technical people from all of the agencies. CDC was enormously helpful. FDA, NIH and the teams that were working on vaccines, these are dedicated civil servants who gave everything to this pandemic. And so I think as- the other thing I knew is this was historic. And so that's why I kept extensive notes from every meeting, daily reflections to really understand what I was seeing. I wrote a daily report, over 310 of them that went to senior leaders. We created-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did President Trump read them? DR. BIRX:\u00a0 I don't know. I don't know. I sent them up through to the vice president. I had very little exposure to--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you did brief President Trump?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I had very little exposure to President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were looking at all this data. Do you think when you were in the room and briefing, even if it was with other people, do you think President Trump appreciated the gravity of the health crisis you were describing? DR. BIRX: I think the president appreciated the gravity in March. It took a while after I arrived in the White House to remove all of the ancillary data that was coming in. I mean, there was parallel data stream coming into the White House that were not transparently utilized. And I needed to stop that where people were-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean outside advisors?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Outside advisers, coming to inside advisors. And to this day, I mean, until the day I left, I am convinced there were parallel data streams because I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Disinformation? DR. BIRX: I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made. So, I know that someone- or someone out there or someone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president. I don't know to this day who, but I know what I sent up and I know that what was in his hands was different from that. That worries me because at any moment- I've built my career on data transparency and accountability. It is very important to me that we all agree how the data is collected and how we use it- use it. We don't cut it in pieces and say we're only going to look at it in this six weeks because it makes us look better. Or we're all going to look at it in these two weeks because we look better than Europe in these two weeks. You can't do that. You have to use the entire database--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was doing that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX:\u00a0 To this day I don't know. I know now why watching some of the tapes that certainly Scott Atlas brought in parallel data streams. I don't know who else was part of it, but I think when the record goes back and people see what I was writing on a daily basis that was sent up to White House leadership, that they will see that- that I was highly specific on what I was seeing and what needed to be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the chief of staff is not saying, wait a second, this is our official coordinator listen to her and her only? Listen to you? No one was saying that? DR. BIRX: No one said that to me. MARGARET BRENNAN: To the president?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I- I don't know if they were saying it to the president.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the president was just distracted by the political implications and the campaign? DR. BIRX: You know, I always wonder that, and, I mean, the worst possible time you can have a pandemic is in a presidential election year. I just want to be frank. There's politics and there's policies and there's pandemics. But in an election year, everything takes on a different perspective. I think the White House personnel were very focused on this pandemic in March and April. I think once the country began to open and it was clear to me that they weren't going to follow my really gated criteria that I had worked hard on. And the reason that gating criteria was so important to me is it combined the insights of Tom Frieden with Zeke Emanuel and Scott Gottlieb. I took- they had the three sentinel papers on how to open America safely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How to open restaurants, how to let people dine indoors--\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I combined all of that together for these great gating criteria. So in calculating everything with the slow reopening, I didn't think anyone could get to Phase 3 until August. And you can see in the states that followed either that criteria or similar criteria, that's how long it took them. And by then, we had the fall surge coming. I wanted to keep the summer quiet so that we could build capacity to get to what we all knew would be a much more difficult fall. MARGARET BRENNAN: What were the biggest obstacles to you communicating that, though? I mean, were there COVID deniers in the White House? DR. BIRX: There are people in the White House and I think people around this country, because I've had the privilege to meet them and listen to them and hear them, because I wanted to hear what people were saying. There were people who definitely believed that this was a hoax. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. BIRX: I think because the information was confusing at the beginning. I think because we didn't talk about the spectrum of disease, because everyone interpreted on what they knew. And so they saw people get COVID and be fine. And then they had us talking about how severe the disease is and how it could cause these unbelievable fatalities of our American public. I mean, so every American life lost, I mean, I haven't slept in 10 months or 11 months because those were the numbers- that's someone's parent. That's someone's grandparent. My great grandmother was lost in the pandemic flu. I know what that feels like from just listening to my grandmother. To have that others feel that same level of pain and loss when it was preventable or could be preventable was really excruciating. So-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't blame the president's own language of calling some of this politically motivated, a hoax? It was a phrase he used at one point. DR. BIRX: You know, when you have a pandemic where you're relying on every American to change their behavior, communication is absolutely key. And so every time a- a statement was made by a political leader that wasn't consistent with public health needs, that derailed our response. It is also why I went out on the road because I wasn't censored on the road. I was able to speak freely about mask mandates, closing bars when you're in the middle of a surge, closing indoor spaces where people are going to take off their mask and be inside. We know those are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You felt censored? DR. BIRX: --spreading events. MARGARET BRENNAN: You felt the White House was censoring you? DR. BIRX: Well, if you noticed, I was not able to do national press. The other thing that was very important to me is I was not going to go outside of the chain of command. And so if our White House comms group did not put me out, I didn't ask to go out. I- because there was so much leaking and so many parallel stories being leaked to the press that did not have grounding in truth that I didn't want to ever be part of that slippery slope. I know people started it with good intentions of trying to inform the American people, but then it became a way that they could silence those who didn't agree with them. And so I knew that every time I had a significant disagreement in the White House that within days a story would be planted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was doing that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I think a lot of people were doing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And meanwhile, Americans are dying. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands at this point. I mean, there was a long stretch of time right before the election where we didn't hear from you. We didn't hear from Dr. Fauci. We didn't hear in the public space from Dr. Redfield in the midst of this national crisis. Do you think the administration was suppressing vital information to win the election? DR. BIRX: I don't know what their motivation was. I know that I was so frustrated by the end of May going into June by the lack of reaction to what I could see in the middle of May coming, that it and that- you combine that with the gating criteria not being utilized, that I realized that the only way, if I could not get a voice internally, that I could get a voice out at the state level because I could see the governors on the governor's call weekly and I could see how deeply they were concerned about every one of their citizens. Most of them were not in the middle of an election campaign. And so by going out and working with the governors, I- two things happened. One, I got to see amazing things that are best practices and really bring those back. And what I've learned from Detroit and Chicago and Arkansas and Alabama and Texas and Arizona and up through Connecticut- I mean, it's just been amazing to be able to see really great solutions and try to bring those back. But that was the place where people would let me say what needed to be said about the pandemic, both in private with the governors and then in following up, doing press to talk to the people of that state. They also would let me do regional press. And really, I want to thank the comms team who let us go out regionally to speak to people in the States when I could see changes coming and the comms team every week would ask me for a list where were- where were my concerns? And then 10 individuals or so went out that week and did- and just blanketed regional press to really say these are the things you need to do. It was difficult during the- during the run-up to the election. That was the time when one of my daily reports- there was by that time 200 of them. That was when one of them was leaked, right before the election. So clearly there was some intentionality there. And I was talking about how severe the epidemic was in the Northern Plains states and saying if that epidemic gets into our populous states of California, Texas, Florida, New York, that this would be an early surge to what we expected in the winter with the expansion of this virus. And so I was very worried. But others were worried, too. I want to make it clear this was just not Debbie Birx. There was a coalition of- of four of us at the beginning, from Steve Hahn to Bob Redfield to myself to Tony Fauci that- making it clear that we would- we would make sure that we could get the information out to the public in one way or the other. It's why I sent the information to all of them every morning, because I never knew who would have the ability to do press. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever consider quitting?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Always. DR. BIRX: I mean, why would you want to put yourself through that, um- every day? Colleagues of mine that I had known for decades- decades in that one experience, because I was in the White House decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever. I had to ask myself every morning is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night. And when it became a point where I could- I wasn't getting anywhere and that was like right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan of what needed to happen the day after the election and how that needed to be executed. And there was a lot of promise that that would happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you knew at that point that the election was a factor in communication about the virus? DR. BIRX: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever withhold information yourself? DR. BIRX: No.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Some people felt you became an apologist for President Trump. They look at that moment in the briefing room, you know the one I'm talking about, when he came out and he talked about injecting bleach and you were sitting there and he looked at you and he asked about ultraviolet light and heat-- DR. BIRX: See, that,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and you start talking about fevers. You didn't say no. DR. BIRX: No, no. OK, so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me. DR. BIRX: --so let's go back to that, because that's a really critical moment. He was not speaking to me. He was speaking to the DHS scientist that was two seats over from me that entire time. When he finally turned to me and said, is it a- could this be a treatment, I said, not a treatment. You can look at the transcripts. Not a treatment. That dialogue was between the President of the United States and a DHS scientist. I have always been respectful of offices, and you can see I don't criticize people specifically in public. I- I don't think that- I always think that you need to transcend that and you need to find a way to communicate effectively where you're not criticizing a person in public. So when he did turn to me at the very end of that dialogue, I said, not a treatment.\u00a0 Now it's in the transcripts. It never got picked up by the press as that is what actually happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your answer when he said, bleach, you said not a treatment? DR. BIRX: Not a treatment. When he turned to me and said, what do you think? Could this be a treatment? I said, not a treatment. But that moment was- that was completely lost. And then there's, you know, skits on Saturday Night Live. \u00a0I mean, when you're a scientist who's grounded themselves in data and combating epidemics and working with communities and working with governments to change the future of people's lives for the better and then you get- this is what- when you talked about, was I prepared for that? No, I wasn't prepared for that. I didn't even know what to do in that moment. I think, you know, that's when you're in that can't let the floor swallow you up moment. I mean that conversation between two people was going on in front of me.\u00a0 And I- I to this day don't know what to do when that happens. I think now- I think there's some people who thought that I would just stand up and take over the microphone from the President. I don't know what people's expectations were in that moment. MARGARET BRENNAN Well, sometimes people say, well, Tony Fauci, when that happened to- to him, he would sort of gently come back up to the podium and set the record straight if he disagreed with the President. DR. BIRX: Well, he was given the opportunity to do that, though. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't feel- you don't feel you were given the opportunity to respond? DR. BIRX: Not until he turned to me and said, could this be a treatment? And I said, not a treatment. You know, in that- in that moment, you know, people then want to define you by the moment and I understand- I, look, I understand how perceptions go. And I understand- I understood when Matt Pottinger was- was calling me to go into the White House and try to support a comprehensive coronavirus response by utilizing the strength of the federal government would be a terminal event for my federal career, which is part of the reason why I didn't want to do it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: A terminal event? DR. BIRX: A terminal event. I know that I wouldn't be allowed to really continue successfully within the federal government. You can't go into something that's that polarized and not believe that you won't be tainted by that experience or how people interpret you in that experience. So I knew that part of it. I didn't want that to happen. But, you know, I had to psychologically prepare myself for that event because- and that was the discussion I was having in South Africa with my colleagues, that if I go and do this, there will be really no option to return to PEPFAR, or to return to my home agency, the CDC. I had always planned on retiring after 40 years. I ended up staying a little bit longer to get through this. Transitions are always very interesting. I actually love transitions because it puts new people's eyes on your program. It makes you better and makes you better as a program to have to explain the strategy to others and to have others' insights into your program.\u00a0 But it's also sometimes a difficult time and I did want to shepherd the PEPFAR program through that. But that was not a choice now, I- and I knew that in that moment. But I didn't know- I- I didn't really know how the White House functioned until you get inside of it and see it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this will be the end of your federal career? DR. BIRX: Yeah, I will need to retire probably within the next four to six weeks from CDC. MARGARET BRENNAN: And how have you made peace with that, that this pandemic, this once in 100 years pandemic that is projected to kill half a million Americans by the middle of next month that you're leaving in the midst of this, that you will be associated with it? Have you thought and digested that? DR. BIRX: Well, what I do know and what was reassuring to me all along is I knew this would be studied. I knew that the emails, the reports that I wrote, the request to expand testing, the how to improve therapeutics, all of that, all of that would eventually come to light. Maybe not in my lifetime. MARGARET BRENNAN: You feel you'll be vindicated? DR. BIRX: I'm not looking to be vindicated. I'm looking to be able- in that moment I think my service was important. I think it was important to make progress in testing. I think it was important in making progress with some of the therapeutics. And I think it was important to really- we had great innovation in vaccines. I also wanted to make sure that we had some of the tried and true vaccines under development. And I think that the history will show my real commitment to ensuring that the subunit vaccines continue to move forward. It's really important because those subunit vaccines can be made in high volumes and would be very important for a potential booster in the future, but also important to the global community. And so there- there are places where I know I had an impact, but that's not- I never allowed myself- I was focused solely on the mission, and the mission was to try to save as many American lives during this pandemic as possible. And so I couldn't get distracted on vindicating myself or getting the information or telling the, you know, coming back to the press and saying that's not what happened. That would waste my energy in that moment of staying focused completely on that data and ensuring that I was seeing everything that was going on so that I could convey that not only to the federal leadership, but convey it directly down to the states. It's why we started writing the governors' report. There were just four of us that wrote that. It took us all weekend, but it was worthwhile because it said to the governor, this is what we're seeing nationally and this is what we're seeing specifically in your state. And it was a dialogue that allowed us to come to a common understanding of what we were seeing and what they were seeing of how to work together more effectively. MARGARET BRENNAN: I read a Washington Post profile of you from back in 2019 before this, and it said, \"When she's working on a vital public health issue, Birx will do whatever is necessary as long as she thinks she can make a difference.\" DR. BIRX: True. And it hurt my family. You know, all of this- I have two daughters in their 30s who had to live through this and watch their mother, these things said about their mother, to become a skit, I mean. I have two grandchildren, daughters. You know, I think, I felt the whole time that I also had to be serious to be taken seriously, and I couldn't ever let emotion come into this, that no matter how frustrated I got, no matter how beaten down I got, I had to keep pushing as hard as I could. And I think Matt Pottinger knew that I'm very resilient, but this tested my resilience. Because it tested my family and the things that were said that were so untrue, all of that about Thanksgiving. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were accused of gathering with people outside your household because you went to a beach house with them? DR. BIRX: Yeah, there- there was no one outside of my household. I have one household. We happen to live between two houses because I had to protect them from me when I was out on the road. I couldn't let myself because I- when I came back I quarantined. Yes, I relied on testing at day five, six and seven, which eventually CDC came to part of the guidance. But if I had an emergency at that house, I wore a mask the whole time because I had to protect that household at all costs. I have a 92-year-old mother and a 96-year-old father and a- a daughter that's 38 weeks pregnant. I had to do what was necessary for the country, but I also had to protect my family. And so the implication that I wouldn't follow CDC guidance- I followed CDC guidance and that's what protected me. I mean, I was on the road for six and a half months. I was in the White House during the hot- one of the hottest hot spots of viral transmission and I remained negative because I followed the CDC guidelines. That's why I know they work and that's why I take it very seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did any of your children ask you to quit? DR. BIRX: No, I think they've always- they knew what I was trying to do. You know, I'm very lucky to have two daughters that believe their mother can make a difference. And so they would never ask me to do that because they know that I would leave if I felt I was ineffectual. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this summer, you gave an interview. Then you went silent for a while. But you gave an interview on CNN and you said the virus was extraordinarily widespread.\u00a0 And then President Trump tweeted. He blasted you for saying that. Did you ever speak to him after that? DR. BIRX: I hadn't seen him for months before that or months after that, but that was like-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're the coordinator of the COVID Task Force. DR. BIRX: --that was a- that was an extraordinary moment because I also got yelled out by the speaker, who I have tremendous I mean, obviously,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi? DR. BIRX: --women have gone through a lot to get in their positions. I have tremendous respect for women and women leadership. I know what they've had to go through to get to where they are. I also have now much more respect for women who are involved in journalism because when I was on the road, I could see that dynamic. It's also why I started calling on all the women first, because, you know, they would be out-shouted sometimes by their male colleagues. I mean it's difficult out there. Gender is still a very real and very difficult piece. But I wanted women to know that you can work. You can be a scientist. You can hold your head high, and you can help. And I think we do bring a different piece to the puzzle because we're always concerned about our families and that community piece in a way that sometimes our male colleagues aren't. And that's not a criticism. It's just how fundamentally we function in the American society. MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi said she didn't have confidence in you because you were working for President Trump. DR. BIRX: And so that was very hard because I have known her from the HIV world, and I have tremendous respect for what she brought early on. She was one of the few who stood up along with Barbara Lee and said, this is a problem and America needs to do more. She stood up in San Francisco. She stood up and- and understood that people were at risk and need to be supported and not traumatized and stigmatized. So in my mind, she's a political hero for what she has done in HIV, which, you know, I've spent a lifetime on, along with TB-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So that stung?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Oh, that was hard. But she's not the only one, I think she gave voice to what a lot of people were thinking of, how could you? I think they looked at going into the White House as somehow supporting a political party or a political individual. There are technical people that are brought in for their technical expertise. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you often were perceived as explaining some of the things President Trump said rather than correcting him.\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, when people asked me a question, I feel like I have to respond with what my perception of that moment was. And so there were three sentinel- or four sentinel events that I think I'm highly criticized for. One of them is the 40,000 ventilator issue. And-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a- this was the governor of New York saying he needed 40,000. You said, no, you don't. You need something like 4,000. So this is in the- in the heat of the moment in the spring. DR. BIRX: Yeah. But that started the whole cascade of the- in the- that's when I had to stop looking at Facebook and Instagram, because in that moment they interpreted that as me supporting the president when what I was saying was, you're using an unmitigated model. And yes, that's how bad things could be if you weren't mitigating. But you were mitigating. So your need is going to be significantly less. And the reason that was important in that moment is in that moment we had 12,000 ventilators in the stockpile.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it? DR. BIRX: We had 16,000. Four of them were in maintenance- 4,000. We had 12,000 ventilators. Now I just want to thank the ana- the head of anaesthesia who called me, who is head of the Association of Anesthesiologists, and called me and said, you know, Dr. Patter- I think it's Dr. Patterson, we can convert our ventilators. Well, that opened up a potential for 60,000 potential- 40 to 60,000 additional ventilators. But when New York said they needed 40,000, at the same time then governors started calling from all over the country saying, well, I need 10 and I need 20. By the end of that first week with that one Governor Cuomo announcement there was a request for almost 100,000 ventilators. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we had a fraction of that in the US stockpile. DR. BIRX: And so what I was worried about is people would start to panic about not having access to the care that they needed, and so it was our job to try to figure out what other options there were from splitting access to ventilators. So two people on one ventilator, utilizing anesthesia ventilators, utilizing high throughput, high volume O2 outside of ventilation. We had- that was a very critical, mad scrambling event for myself and I think many others. And I just want to thank many people who came forward and said, this is- this is a solution, this is a solution, and that is a solution. But we also remodeled what people would absolutely need. And then we realized that we could move ventilators potentially from states that weren't having an outbreak to states that needed them and backfill them with additional-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that the moment, though, that that moment in the spring, is that the moment you looked at the task force and you said we have a serious problem here, this is not going according to plan? DR. BIRX: I think everyone knew that. MARGARET BRENNAN: When did that hit you? DR. BIRX: Everyone knew that. Everyone knew that from, I would say, March- March 8th on. Because you only had to look at the slopes of the curves in these major metropolitan cities to understand what was happening and understanding if you're seeing that rate of hospitalization, how much community spread there was. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were trying to get Americans just to wear masks. And the president himself was undermining you. He wasn't wearing one. I mean, you would go out and talk about it can be a fashion statement from the podium. I mean, you were trying to make it light so people would accept it. But all these guidelines are getting undermined by the president himself. Is there ever a way to make that scenario work? DR. BIRX: Well, you have to, because that's the president. So you have to figure out how to get that message out when you can't get it out from the head of the country. And that's our job. You don't give up. You don't say, well that didn't work so of course you know, everything is going to be terrible. You've got to try to make it the least terrible it can be. I mean, you can't ever in any moment when American lives are at stake, say, well, this is just too hard. I'm giving up. MARGARET BRENNAN: But where's the vice president in all of this? DR. BIRX: The vice president knew what I was doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean he knew that you were telling the governors privately to do things that the president publicly was making light of? When he was saying you don't really need to wear a mask, or pushing to reopen the economy faster than your guidelines would allow, Mike Pence knew that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: He knew what I was doing because-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And he supported it? DR. BIRX: --I don't- I'm not a person who would go out on their own and not do, you know, I wouldn't go-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would you have to be sneaking around? You're the head of the COVID Task Force and tens of thousands of Americans are dying. Why is that a covert operation? DR. BIRX: Because if this isn't working and you're not going to get that to work, you have to find another solution. I mean, you can't just say, well the president is saying this so I'm going to give up on the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories that we support. I couldn't do that. I mean I- and others couldn't either. I mean, there was a team of people going out and supporting this approach. I felt all along that if we could have put 20 or 30 full-time CDC personnel in every state for long term assignments, six- six months assignments, they could help states get over these barriers and understand and help support states translate their guidance. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the CDC didn't do that. They didn't want to do that? DR. BIRX: They sent people out for short- short term. And these are the kinds of things because that's what they're historically used to doing. I think these are the things we have to work on in the long run of how we really respond to a pandemic, which is part of the reason why I'm going to take time to really reflect on this, organize all my thoughts and put together what really worked, what could be expanded, what kind of legislative fixes do we need? Are we in a- do we accept federalism when a public health- being able to save Americans with a comprehensive national public health response is critical. MARGARET BRENNAN: Leaving it up to the states, is that the way it should be in a pandemic, is the fundamental question? DR. BIRX: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were going out there to the governors, I mean, tell me about some of the restrictions that- some of the resistance from governors, because you're going out there and you're telling them to wear a mask, to limit indoor dining. And for some of these Republican governors, that would mean going against the head of their party to do what you're telling them to do. DR. BIRX: You know, I don't know if that was as much as the dynamic as they were dealing with Republican legislatures and legislators that really didn't- and it's why I started meeting with the legislature and it's why I started meeting with county commissioners, because you needed every single level of government then to work together to ensure that, again, we're talking about behavioral change of American citizens. And everyone then had to endorse it. The governors, the mayors, the county commissioners. I was in states in the middle of this country where the senior public health person, the senior public health person, said to me, why don't you believe that we should go for herd immunity? MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning just let everyone get sick and see how it plays out. DR. BIRX: Because in the- many of the farmlands, you do that sometimes when you have a really bad swine virus or- you let it run through the herd and rebuild the herd with resistant, um-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said we're dealing with human beings and lives? DR. BIRX: Yes, but I mean, you have to- you have to let people talk about what they're thinking. You have to be able to provide an environment where people can honestly say what they are thinking because then you can't confront it. If we keep pretending that everything is fine and we're not listening to people and listening for where they're coming from, we're not going to make the changes that we need in order to be successful. And so I think, you know, that was the other reason of going out to really understand what governors and mayors and local public health and rural public health individuals and community members were seeing and thinking. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Sturgis, this motorcycle rally in the middle of South Dakota, thousands of people gathered with no mask. How much responsibility lies on the shoulders of the governors running these states like that in South Dakota? DR. BIRX: A lot. A lot. But let's recognize what's happening right here, right now in the District of Columbia. There are National Guard troops here from every state in the Union, probably, young individuals who are most likely to have asymptomatic infection if they do get infected. And they're congruently living and eating maskless, 25 to 30,000 of them from all over the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think this inaugural gathering is a massive super-spreader event? DR. BIRX: It could be. When you bring 30,000 people together where you know that they're most likely to have asymptomatic infections and you haven't prescreened, pre-tested, and serially tested all of these troops. These are dedicated troops. They're going to do their mission. I can promise you that they will sacrifice their own health to do their mission, because that's the- that's what I came from. You sacrifice for others out of the military. They will do their mission. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then, I mean, you compare this where people may or may not be tested, but they're wearing masks. You compare that to the super-spreader event that was held-- DR. BIRX: They are not wearing masks. Did you see the pictures of the National Guard? They can't wear masks. They're communally eating and communally sleeping-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When they're eating and sleeping-- DR. BIRX: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --I hear you. \u00a0 DR. BIRX: --so we have to be careful in every single thing. There shouldn't be it's okay here and not ok there. We have to be consistent. Sturgis was not okay. Birthday parties, not okay. Bringing together family members indoors, maskless, none of this. We have to be very clear to the community. And yes, we're going to make mistakes. We all make mistakes, we're human. If you made a mistake, if you had a gathering, at least get tested, wear a mask around those vulnerable, assume you got exposed and are infected and wear a mask around those vulnerable. So if you went to Sturgis, you should have worn a mask when you came home. If you got exposed potentially here when you go home until you're 10 days out and you avoid getting with your vulnerable family members. We- that's what I do to really ensure that you're protecting each other. MARGARET BRENNAN: How did the task force, which you led, and those around the president, President Trump, who-- DR. BIRX: I was the coordinator, I didn't lead the task force. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were the coordinator. But how did the task force allow the president, who calls himself germaphobe, to get COVID himself? How did that happen? DR. BIRX: There were only two people who regularly wore a mask in the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Two people? DR. BIRX: Myself and Tyler Ann McGuffee.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was that?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: My- the support person that I had from HHS.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So the staff around the president was not wearing a mask?\u00a0 [Pause] MARGARET BRENNAN: He's the commander in chief. This is a national security risk. How is that possible? DR. BIRX: I think people believed wrongly that testing- testing would be adequate.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So how is that possible? DR. BIRX: I think they believe that testing is a surrogate for a public health intervention. Testing, I think, is part of your public health arm- armamentarium. And I always want to be clear about that. I think testing is critically important and equal to masking and physical distancing and handwashing, because I think testing allows you to see the silent epidemic and you can't find them unless you're proactively testing. So I am a strong proponent of testing, more testing, and testing people who have no symptoms. MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you say, \"The President of The United States needs to wear a mask.\" Did you press Mike Pence on that? Did you press Mark Meadows, his chief of staff? DR. BIRX: There are multiple communications about masking. And this gets into the data issue. Remember when I was talking about the stream of data coming in? People were interpreting the hospital mask data, the difference between an N95, a KN95,\u00a0 surgical mask and cloth mask, to say that cloth masks don't work because in this hospital setting, it didn't work. That was different. Remember, in a hospital setting, you're trying to protect the nurse or the doctor from what's out here. We were asking people to wear a mask to protect others from them. So it was a very different context. And so they were mixing data that didn't have anything to do with the relevance of masking as a public health measure to changing into masking as a personal protective measure. MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you ever say you're misunderstanding this? You need to wear a mask. These are close quarters and you're way too close to the President of the United States? You're nodding, yes, you had that argument? DR. BIRX:\u00a0 Not with the president, I mean, I- I didn't have that kind of access, but to certainly people around the president. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they just didn't take it seriously? DR. BIRX: They believed that the testing protocol would be adequate to protect the president. Pe- I just want to make it clear people were concerned about the president and wanted to protect the president. I don't want to think- have the understanding that there were frivolous people in the White House, that people were very concerned about the president. Mask- they believed that testing would be a reasonable substitution for people masking. MARGARET BRENNAN: How sick did the president actually get? DR. BIRX: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, but I can say that certainly they thought he was sicker than the first lady because they wanted to get him additional therapy.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think his life was in danger? DR. BIRX: You know what I know- just to be very clear, what we know in the data, for people over 70 even today, about 18 and 19% of people over 70 who get this virus are hospitalized. And of all people over 70 who get this virus, 10% of them succumb to this virus. One in 10. To me, that's a very, very serious illness. If you knew that your parents had a one in 10 chance of dying from a virus, as I do, you would do everything to protect them. The president was over 70. So, do I believe that adequate, constant public health surveillance and measures were put into place based on his age alone, not even taking into account everything else? No. But they weren't put in place for the entire country, and that was what my message was. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did anyone ever say this is a national security risk and we need to nail down who brought this in and who infected the commander in chief?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I never heard those conversations. MARGARET BRENNAN: There was no serious contact tracing that happened after the fact?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I don't know if there was contact tracing or not. I- you know, it's not something that I was responsible for. The health and welfare of the president falls to the White House medical team. I know many of those individuals. They are very serious individuals. I am sure that they took this seriously. I know they took his care very seriously. I know they took the care of the first lady very seriously. This virus, I think people really just couldn't wrap their heads around that you could have a virus that caused almost no disease, such mild disease that the person didn't think they were even infected and they were spreading the virus to others, and such severe disease that it could kill your grandparents. And I think that's still hard for people to wrap their head around because they have the experience of losing a parent or grandparent, they understand the severity of the disease. If they only see the disease from their college students who got it and there were no consequences in the moment, we still don't know what kind of chronic, what we would call morbidity could come from this when they are 20 or 30 years older, we don't know. And we just should be really honest. We don't know that mild disease might not lead to significant long term health crisis or health consequences. We don't know that. So we just have to be honest. We don't know that. But from their perspective, they saw their 18-year-old get infected and it was no big deal. So when you have that experience, being able to effectively communicate that spectrum of disease so that people understand that their behavior impacts the vulnerable individuals in their community at the same time that they themselves may not develop severe disease is really important. And I feel like that communication piece was never really understood at a level to- to really push people to action. MARGARET BRENNAN: And last question to you, what was your biggest mistake? DR. BIRX: Well, I'm categorizing- I'm going back through all of my notes from 11 months to really try to understand where I could have been better when. I think there is- I- I always feel like I could have done more, been more outspoken, maybe been more outspoken publicly- publicly. I didn't know all the consequences of all of these issues. When you're put into a new situation and you only know one person in the White House, you know, and you don't understand the culture of the White House, it's very difficult to get your footing. I'm not making excuses. I'm just saying I didn't know how far I could push the envelope. I'm known for doing that, particularly in private. But it was very difficult for me at day one to really understand that. And that's the kind of piece we needed from day one.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You wish you pushed harder?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: On anything in particular?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well, fundamentally testing, I mean, I- I really believe that proactive testing, as we've seen happen in universities- universities that tested weekly, at a minimum, of every student, required testing, not voluntary testing, required testing independent of symptoms, had infection rates of about 10% of what the universities that tested the way we do in the United States, focused on people who have symptoms, letting people who want to come in and get a test, get a test, where you're testing a lot of worried-well that may not even have exposure, but not routinely making sure that young people in the community are repetitively tested so you can find the asymptomatic infections. Young people are responsible, and they will isolate if they know they have the virus. But you cannot expect them to be isolated as young adults if they don't have the virus. And it's our job to figure out how to make testing available for them. I think still there's not enough testing of people under 40. We need to make testing kind of fun and interesting. It's why I pushed so hard to get those antigen tests out there, because even for all of their faults, if they find 50 or 60% of the asymptomatic individuals who are spreading the virus, that is an enormous public health impact. So sometimes we let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And I think a lot of the issues that we have, in addition to the other public health, behavioral change. And then the final piece is making things too complicated. I went out right before Christmas to six states because I was worried that the- this highly sophisticated tiering of individuals was going to be really difficult for states to execute-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean, how states are setting the guidelines on who gets the vaccine when?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think it's overly complicated?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: I think it's very complicated.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But that came from federal guidelines. DR. BIRX: I- it came from the ACIP. I think they had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is part of the CDC.\u00a0 Dr. BIRX:\u00a0 I think- well, it's an independent body, but I think they had- they certainly had the best of Americans at heart. But in a pandemic, you have to simplify things. You have to make it so states have an easy way to do it and document it that the right people are getting the immunizations. And we knew, it's not that we didn't know who was at greatest risk for severe disease. We knew that. We know that. We know that today. And I think we were trying to balance the fabric of society with those at greatest risk. But when you're in the middle of a surge and you know that before Christmas, we had an unbelievable surge across the entire country. Yes, the Northern Plains and the Heartland was improving and the Rocky Mountain states, but the whole rest of the country had rising cases. And then we put out- so the governors, the public health individuals are focused on talking to the hospitals, making sure they have PPE, saving as many lives that they can, and then we put out this very complex guidance. So I went out right before the holidays to talk to governors and say, if you're willing to think about simplifying this. Think about immunizing everybody over 65. Just do your health care workers. Absolutely. They're on the front lines. But then everybody else do by age, because we know that that's the risk of severe disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you tell governors now, do that, throw out whatever new federal guidelines the Biden administration issues and just go with large portions of the population?\u00a0 DR. BIRX: Well we see states that are being successful in doing that. One of my first states I went to was West Virginia, because they're rapid adopters. You know, they really look at their population. The other thing that wasn't taken into account is every state has a different population of percent of their population that's over 65, and it ranges from 11% to over 22%\u00a0 And so not only do you have to like, ensure that they can have access to vaccine, but you need to then redo how you're putting out vaccines so that the states that have a higher proportion of individuals over 65 get more vaccine than the states by population that have only 11%. I mean you've got to really adjust to make sure that there's equity. And so I think some of the states have figured this out. They're- they- and the proof will be in the pudding. Did they save more lives? I am very- I am encouraged that our numbers are going in the right direction. It says to me that Americans are trying their best to follow the guidelines. And I- I hope and I believe that they will continue to understand that masks work. And if we have more contagious virus, masking more will have even a greater impact and a critical impact, along with the physical distancing and handwashing. But we need to do more testing and we really need to ensure that we can support the states in their vaccine delivery. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for- for your time.\u00a0",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the challenges facing America continue to grow as Democrats in Washington's window of opportunity to make bold changes continues to narrow. After yet another cringeworthy display of partisan politics over the nation's ability to pay its bills, a disappointing jobs report. Growing fears about inflation and supply-chain problems and sharpening battle lines on the vaccine, President Biden continues to be upbeat yet realistic. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Things in Washington, as you all know, are awfully noisy. Turn on the news and every conversation is a confrontation. Every disagreement is a crisis. We're making consistent, steady progress though. MARGARET BRENNAN: But time is of the essence because this is in the President's rear-view mirror. DONALD TRUMP: Our nation's comeback begins in November 2022 when we're going to reclaim the House and we're going to reclaim the United States Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have fresh insights into what Americans are thinking in our new CBS news poll. Then we'll ask St. Francisco FED President Mary Daly what's slowing our jobs recovery. With the Pfizer vaccine for children between 5 and 11 nearing FDA fast-track approval, we'll get an update on how soon that shot could be available from former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Plus, a closer look at disinformation, misinformation, and their threat to democracy. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's new book is \"Midnight in Washington.\" Former Trump administration Russia expert Fiona Hill has just written, \"There Is Nothing For You Here.\" Rounding out our conversations, CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning. And welcome to FACE THE NATION. After last week's disappointing jobs report and the latest round of budget battles on Capitol Hill, we are reminded yet again that covid continues to be the biggest drag on our economic recovery. We begin with CBS News Senior National Correspondent Mark Strassmann in Atlanta this morning. (Begin VT) WOMAN #1: (Expletive Deleted) people. WOMAN #2: Hey, can you watch your language? You, there are around kids. MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): More than a moment, short of a disorder, COVID America has functioning anxiety, day after day, living with this lingering virus. CROWD (in unison): We will not comply. We will not comply. MARK STRASSMANN: Upset, uncertain, on edge, frustrated other people who ironically feel the same way won't come to their senses. MAN: We want to end this pandemic. We're all exhausted by it. MARK STRASSMANN: Including most vaccinated Americans. Our new CBS poll found 56% of them said they were at risk because of the unvaccinated. The virus with no end in sight has killed more than 700,000 Americans. There is some hope, cases now declining in 32 states. WOMAN #3: One, two, three. MARK STRASSMANN: And Pfizer is hoping its vaccine for kids, ages 5 to 11, gets emergency approval by the end of the month. Not a moment too soon as the Delta variant remains pitiless. Our relationship status with America's economy also complicated, cash-happy consumers want to spend, but too often the message in stores: We're out of that. Empty grocery shelves in North Carolina, food shortages for school. And yet off the coast of Southern California a half million shipping containers wait for unloading. Even good news seems to come with a catch. Take America's new jobless rate: Less than 5%. Fewer than 200,000 new jobs were created last month, a major disappointment. Even with millions of openings, employers can't find good help these days or any help. Millions of jobless people now stay home. Why risk working and catching COVID, especially for mediocre money. WOMAN #4: What do we want? CROWD (in unison): (INDISTINCT). WOMAN #4: When do we want it? CROWD (in unison): Now. MARK STRASSMANN: At Buffalo's Mercy Hospital, this strike has drifted into its second week. Hundreds of health care workers demanding more staffing and better pay. They are stressed and they've had it. Sound familiar? (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: More pandemic stress is on its way for private employers. Osha is still working on issuing emergency guidance for mandatory vaccinations and testing for any company that employs at least a hundred people. At least 24 states have promised to fight it. Margaret? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, thank you. We want to take a look at America's views on some of those challenges facing the country, and particularly how President Biden is handling them. Our CBS News poll out today indicates that the President's approval rating is at 50%. It has stabilized following the chaotic Afghanistan pullout, and is underpinned by positive views on handling the COVID outbreak and distribution. But Americans' view of the economy has steadily decreased since this summer. Less than 40% now think it's in good shape. Joining us now is CBS News Director of Elections and Surveys Anthony Salvanto. Good morning to you, Anthony. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, time and again we hear it is the virus that determines the direction of the economy. So, with that in mind, what are Americans telling you about whether or not they're willing to vaccinate their children when it becomes available for 5 to 11 year olds? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, not everybody would. And I think that sets up one of the key numbers to track as we go forward in the next phase of fighting this pandemic. You've got just over a third who say immediately yes they would. You've got almost as many who immediately say no they would not. And then you've got folks in the middle who are maybes. I should add that there is a strong connection between whether the parents themselves are vaccinated and whether they would get their kids, 5 to 11, vaccinated. That's a majority of vaccinated parents who would, and it's a majority of unvaccinated parents who say they would not. We've been tracking this in our polling, in this and throughout the year. It's a mixture of very personal reasons, but also some that have a political tinge to it. So there are folks, the majority of them unvaccinated, who say they're worried about the side effects for themselves. But there is also a majority that say they don't trust the government. Some who are skeptical that they don't think that the vaccine works. MARGARET BRENNAN: So given all of that, what are Americans telling you about what they're willing to do right now when it comes to going out and spending? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. And this is so important for the economy going forward. First of all, as the holiday season approaches, people are thinking about who they're going to visit, who they gather with, right? There's a quarter of folks who tell us that this holiday season they're only going to gather with other vaccinated people, that they're vaccinated. And there are some who think it will be a mixture of gathering both vaxxed and unvaxxed. But there is a third who say they're not sure or they won't check. Maybe that's an awkward conversation to have. Maybe they don't know how to raise it. So that's something to watch in terms of behavior and how people go out and who they hang out with. Then there is the economy in terms of where people go and spend money. Well, for the vaccinated people, they say they'd would be more comfortable if they knew there were vaccine requirements to, for example, get on a plane, go to a restaurant, even go back to their workplace. And that's the majority of people, so that economic impact could be pretty strong if they feel comfortable. Maybe that puts more pressure on businesses to put those kinds of requirements in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, President Biden said that it was the virus impacting the jobs and hiring, but also said that if his spending packages are passed, that it will help to alleviate all of this. How is his effort to get this passed resonating? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, first and foremost, a lot of people say they don't know what's in the proposal. In fact, it's only one in ten that thinks they feel they-- they know a lot of the specifics. Then we went and we tested individual items in this, and what we learned was that people are more familiar with the potential costs and the spending aspects in dollar figures than they are with any of the particular policies that might end up in it. So, have a look at this: you've got a majority of people who say they've heard something about that it might be 3.5 trillion in spending. You've got a majority of people who say they've heard something about potential tax increases for higher-income people. But that really outweighs the number of people who've heard about things like lowering Medicare drug prices or Medicare coverage being expanded to dental and eye and hearing. Now, there is good news for Democrats in this, too, even though there is this lack of knowledge, and that is that those pol-- those policy proposals are popular in principle. Where does that all leave you, though? Well, there aren't a majority of people who feel like this bill right now would help them and their family or help the economy. That's part of that disconnect and that lack of awareness, and this is going to be, I think, the big measure to watch going forward. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, thank you. We go now to California Democrat Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he is also on the panel investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol. And the author of a new book, \"Midnight in Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could.\" We'll get into all of that shortly. But, Congressman, I want to start on the economy. You just heard the public doesn't really know what's in this massive spending bill Democrats are trying to muscle through along party lines. Isn't this a significant problem for the party? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/Chair, Intelligence Committee/Author, \"Midnight in Washington\"/@RepAdamSchiff): I can't quarrel with any of the polling results. I think I hear the same thing that not enough Americans know what's in this bill, but when they find out they really applaud what's in it, in particular, expanding Medicare to cover hearing and dental and vision care, lowering prescription drug prices, expanding family and paid medical leave, as well as childcare and lifting children out of poverty. So the provisions of the bill are hugely popular, but there's been so much fixation on what's the number that the House and Senate are going to agree to, what's the number that Democrats can come together on? I do think this is a very short-lived problem. We're going to get both of these bills passed. They're going to be enormously important to the economy. And once we do, we're not going to make the mistake I think we did with the Affordable Care Act. We're going to go out and we're going to promote this and let people know how it's directly impacting them. MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't Democrats need to get ahead of that messaging now? I mean, you have unified control. This is going-- you need to show you can govern. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, that's exactly right. And-- and we do. And one thing that I think President Biden has been pitch perfect on that all of us need to amplify is, this is, you know, first and foremost about helping Americans get through this awful pandemic and helping their families cope and survive economically. But it is also key to the pro-democracy agenda that we have, and that is we have to show that our democracy can deliver. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that's the challenge is when you're doing it only on party lines, it once again looks to people at home like, they can't get along, Washington's not working again. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, look, we have a Republican Party that is now an autocratic cult around Donald Trump. It is not interested in governing. It's not interested in even maintaining the-- the solvency and the credit worthiness of the country. And we have to recognize that they're not interested in governing. And so, we're going to govern, we're going to have to do it. And if we have to do it with our own votes, we will do that. But we need to show that democracy delivers, that it can help people put food on the table, that it can address these huge disparities in income. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: There's so much reason why our democracy is at this fragile point right now, and we need to foremost deliver on the economy, but also on-- on voting rights and stop these efforts to disenfranchise people. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just made an incredible statement about an autocratic cult. This is one of the themes in your book. You aren't often compared to conservative writers like Robert Kagan, but you come to basically the same conclusion he just did in a very widely read essay where he says essentially that it's the Republican Party that is trying to lay the groundwork to challenge the next few elections. You say preparing the battlefield for the struggle to overturn the election, should they regain majorities in Congress, they might be successful. You're saying we're on the cusp of a constitutional crisis? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Yes. And this is really why I wrote the book because I want it to sound the alarm that our democracy is hanging by a thread right now. As a member of the January 6th committee, you know, I have to acknowledge there may be another violent attack on the Capitol, but what is even more pressing a threat is what we see Republicans doing around the country taking this big lie about the last election and running with it. And I wanted to tell the story in this book about how-- how does that happen, how in four short years does our democracy become so threatened? And one of the terrible realizations for me is that so many of the people I worked with across the aisle, who I admired and respected because I believe that they believed what they were saying, turned out not to believe it at all. That the only thing that they cared about was the maintenance of their power or position. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: And I want to show people how that happens, how-- how people start by making small compromises of their morality and their values and their ideology and end up completely capitulating because one of the things we discovered in-- in the impeachment trial, but really both trials is that there's nothing wrong about our Constitution. The provisions are brilliant. But unless they're animated by people who-- who give content to their oath that-- that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --understand the importance of right and wrong, none of it works. And right now, we saw Grassley in Iowa yesterday, unable to condemn the President's effort to-- to get the Justice Department to overturn the election. Scalise this morning, another Republican leader-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --unable to acknowledge that the election wasn't stolen. It's these personal capitulations that are putting our country at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and that's a shift from where Senator Grassley, who accepted the President-- former President's endorsement, was right after the events of January 6th. But I want to come back to where you lay blame because you say it's \"we, the country who made Donald Trump possible. We-- he would not have been able to batter and break so many of our Democratic norms had we not let him, had we not been capable of endless rationalization, had we not forgotten why we came to office in the first place\u2026\" What responsibility do you think Democrats have for damaging the faith of the country, as well? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Look, I think Democrats have been defending our democracy for the last five years. We have put up a valiant fight for the heart and soul of this country, so I really can't lay the blame at the Democratic Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't take any responsibility. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, look, I-- as I acknowledge in my book, there are lots of things I could have done differently or better. But at the end of the day, one of our two great parties has completely abandoned its ideology. It has made itself an anti-truth, anti-Democratic cult of the former President, and the responsibility is on that party to once again become a party of ideas. And there are some hopeful signs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: And-- and one of the-- the things I want to emphasize in the book, too, is there are also some great profiles in courage that emerge from this period. One of them you're going to have on your show later today, Fiona Hill. But Marie Yovanovitch and Alexander Vindman, people like Dan Coats-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --you know, Republicans like Dan Coats, who-- who did their duty, defended-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The former-- REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --the intelligence community wouldn't carry out the President's big lies. And we need to be inspired by those examples because we all have a role to play right now in the preservation of this democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I need to ask you about the January 6th committee. When will you get hold of the documents that the White House has said they're okay with Congress taking the Trump era documents? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, very soon, I hope, and I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you looking for? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --I applaud the Biden administration for not asserting executive privilege, not trying to, because it's protecting its own prerogative, deprive the American people of the full facts. So-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --hats off to the administration. We should, I think, get those documents soon because the sitting President has the primary say in executive privilege. We also want to make sure that these witnesses come in and testify-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --and we are prepared to go forward and urge the Justice Department to criminally prosecute-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --anyone who does not do their lawful duty. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch that carefully. Congressman, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to look now at the economy. Mary Daly is president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. Good morning to you. MARY DALY: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is job growth stalling? MARY DALY (President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco/@marydalyecon): It is a volatile period we're in right now, COVID is not behind us, so I don't expect the job market to just be continuous. It is going to have these ups and downs, especially with the Delta variant. So, I think it's too soon to say it's stalling, but certainly we're seeing the pain of COVID, and the pain of the Delta variant impact the labor market. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think you underestimated Delta's impact? MARY DALY: Well, I always expected Delta to take a toll, just not put us into another recession, and we're seeing that toll. We're seeing this disrupt families, disrupt schooling, disrupt people's ability to get to work and feel safe about it. And you're-- you see this in the monthly data, but you also see it in-- in any community you walk around. Delta has-- has taken a toll. But it hasn't yet derailed us, and I-- and I don't have a different view than I had on it when we first started. It's going to be hard and as goes COVID, so goes the economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, women are driving this decline. If you look at the numbers, last month, twenty-six thousand jobs lost, more than men. Women are taking themselves out of the market. The participation rate is down. Black women in particular are suffering. What is behind these losses? And when do we reach the point where the damage is long term? MARY DALY: Well, it's way too early to say the damage is long term, but we have to recognize that women, in particular women with children who are caring for elderly parents or caring for anyone, they're under siege. They've been at this since COVID came to our shores and now they're dealing with this. We thought school might save it, right? People would go back to school; kids would go back to school and women could take a deep breath. But what we see is that when a kid gets COVID because they're not yet vaccinated and not able to get vaccinated, the classrooms are quarantined. A friend of mine has a business herself, her husband has a business. She has a kid who gets quarantined. Now she's got to home school one kid. And send the other kid to school. That is hard. And ultimately, it's exhausting and women withdraw and say, I need to take care of my family. And when we're past COVID, we'll get through this. So I know they're all out there saying, let's get vaccinated and let's get this COVID thing completely behind us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Since the beginning of the pandemic, U.S. taxpayers have pumped about six trillion dollars into trying to stabilize the economy through some of these congressional packages. Our CBS News poll, I want to show you two things here: sixty percent of those polled think the President is not doing enough to combat inflation and forty-six percent think that his new social spending plan would hurt inflation. In other words, it would push up the prices they pay. Should Americans be concerned? MARY DALY: Well, right now, Americans are feeling it in their pocketbooks. Everyone's feeling the rising prices for energy, food, basic services, and that's painful because they-- they aren't-- we aren't used to seeing it. It's-- it's eye popping in some categories. And of course, that's challenging, especially for low and moderate-income families who were-- they spend most of their money on food and energy. So, this is really hard. And it's also really directly related to COVID. It's related to the supply bottlenecks, to the disruptions. That we can't get in the global economy people fully back to work. We can't in the U.S. get people fully back to work. We have these really anxious to get out there and spend consumers-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARY DALY: --hitting the wall of supply constraints and of course, the prices are going to-- to rise. But I don't see this as a long-term phenomena. And the issue again comes back to, if we can get through COVID, we'll get back to the normal conditions where we're more used to and the ones we all want. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't see the spending-- the emergency spending as inflationary? MARY DALY: Well, any time you spend, it's going to add additional pressure to the demand that's going on in the economy. So the-- the key is if the spending that we do as consumers is coupled with the expansion of supply, then we're going to be fine. But if it-- if we continue to have supply bottlenecks and we keep spending, then we're going to have more inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, I-- I was pointing there to the President and the flak he might take based on our poll. But I want to ask you, since you are out in California, we mentioned all those ships off the coast, container ships unable to come to ports in Los Angeles, in Long Beach. How will these kind of delays impact holiday spending? MARY DALY: Well, right now we see consumers trying to get out early and spend their money to get their goods before they run out. What I really see happening is that people are going to have longer wait times. If you're trying to buy something for the holidays, people are buying it now and they're being told oftentimes they can't get it until after the holiday has passed. So there are going to be delays. There are going to be continued bottlenecks. There's probably going to be some pressure on holiday item prices, and we're going to have to continue to get through that. The key again, is just get more supply to the labor market, to the goods market so that we can get through this. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mary Daly, thank you for your analysis and for joining us today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Don't go away. Doctor Scott Gottlieb is coming up next. And he's got an update on when the Pfizer vaccine might be available for children under twelve. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including a look at Facebook under fire and misinformation on social media. If you're not able to watch the full FACE THE NATION, you can set your DVR or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount Plus app. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who also sits on the board of Pfizer and is the author of \"Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID 19 Crushed US and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic.\" Doctor, Pfizer applied for emergency approval for children ages 5 to 11 to be able to get a vaccine. Is it reasonable to assume that by Thanksgiving, we could see children fully vaccinated? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): I think that's certainly reasonable in terms of when this would be available. FDA is meeting October 26th, their advisory committee to discuss this application. Assuming that they authorize the use of the vaccine, CDC's Advisory Committee is going to meet on November 2nd and 3rd and make a final decision about who should be eligible for the vaccine. And assuming both of those events go well, and you get a positive recommendation out of both the FDA and CDC, this should be available almost immediately after the CDC makes a final recommendation and be available in pharmacies and perhaps pediatricians' offices as well. Pfizer plans to ship this vaccine in smaller vials and also smaller trays that could make it more accessible to more pediatric-- pediatric practices. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting, so perhaps more readily available than when the adults went through the process. According to the poll that we started our program with today, more than a third of parents say they will vaccinate their 5 to 11 year olds right away. A quarter of them will wait and see. I'm wondering what that says to you and what you would be looking for in the language from the CDC when they explain this to the public? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Yeah, look, I was actually encouraged by the results of that survey, there's a lot of parents like me that as soon as the vaccines available for their children are going to go out and get their kids vaccinated, that see the benefits of vaccination. There's a lot of-- parents that still have a lot of questions around vaccination. I think for them, they should have a conversation with their pediatrician to try to get comfortable with the idea of vaccinating kids. We now have the opportunity by the availability of this vaccine to more fully vanquish this virus and protect a broader swath of the population in terms of what CDC is likely to do. I think the question is whether or not they're going to say that this vaccine should be used in kids ages 5 to 11 or may be used in kids ages 5 to 11 and then perhaps innumerate kids who are at higher risk for whom a strong consideration should be made about deploying the vaccine. I think CDC is likely to take a very cautious approach in children ages 5 to 11, in part because they're at less risk from COVID, in part because this is a new vaccine. We're still collecting data about it and it's a novel virus. And so, there's still some things we don't know. But I think there's a lot of information available. It certainly makes me confident about vaccinating my kids. And for those parents are still have a lot of questions. I would urge them to have a discussion with their pediatrician about the pros and cons of vaccination. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is a third of the size of the-- of the dose given to adults. Correct? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: That's right. And for younger kids, kids ages six months to four years, which is still in development, it's going to be even a smaller dose, one tenth the dose that's used in adults. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, parents of young kids like me will still have to wait. That's an update on the timeline there that you just gave us. Is it going to be more difficult to get approval for the smaller-- the smallest of children for the infants? I mean, are we looking really far down the line? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Not really far down the line, I think there is some indication based on the experience with this vaccine where FDA asked for additional information, as well as some feedback that Pfizer has gotten from the agency, that the clinical trials in kids ages six months to two years and then two years to four years. So, it's two different trials, could be a little bit larger and a little bit longer in terms of the follow up period that's required and that could push it into 2022. Previously, we had talked about trying to have that data available before the end of this year, which could have prompted an authorization, perhaps by the end of the year, at least in kids ages two to four. I think it's more likely that it slips into the first quarter of next year, at the very least, but not too far into next year. Ultimately, this is going to be discussed at the advisory committee that FDA has on the 26th. So, a final recommendation about how large those trials need to be and how long the follow up period needs to be is going to be made at that point. I think, look, the agency has been moving cautiously here, but you know, with speed recognizing the importance of getting a vaccine available for children. I think ultimately, if we can derive more information, it gives more people confidence about using this vaccine and puts CDC in a better position to make a more confident recommendation. Ultimately, the public health is going to be served better by that, even if it means that it ends up slipping a month or two. So that might be the outcome here. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've said previously on this program that eventually you do think that the COVID vaccine will be added to the-- the list of requirements for kids to walk into the school room. The CDC puts it together, governors are the ones who mandate what your children need to be vaccinated with. When do you expect it to be mandated for elementary school children? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Yeah, look, I think it's a very long way off. Certainly, CDC is going to look at children ages 12 to 17 differently than 5 to 11 and the older kids, the high school kids and middle school kids, do seem to get into trouble more with COVID. It's harder to control in those settings, so that's going to be considered separately. But even that's, I think, a multi-year effort. I don't think that it's going to happen any time soon. CDC is going to want to see the post-pandemic experience, how much virus is going to be circulating after the pandemic and how much of a risk it poses to children. They're also going to want to collect a lot more long-term data in kids. And so, you know, twelve to seventeen could be a couple of years away, perhaps a little longer. I think five to eleven is even longer than that. You're going to want to get more experience in those children. And that's barring anything unexpected. I mean, if we do get a new variant and this becomes very hard to control in children, if we get something that is causing more problems in kids, you could see an earlier decision. But given our current trajectory, where we are, that we are starting to get control of this virus, I think that CDC is going to act very cautiously. And just final point on this, if you look historically at past vaccines, the time between when they're licensed and when CDC incorporates them into the childhood immunization schedule is a multi-year effort. HPV was first licensed in 2006 and wasn't recommended until 2016. Hepatitis A was first licensed in 1995 and wasn't recommended until 2000. So, you've seen it be a multi-year effort between when these things get licensed initially and when CDC ultimately puts them into the recommended schedule for children. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you told us that the youngest of kids won't likely have a vaccine by the time we gather at Christmas time. Something that caught my eye this week was the Biden administration's announcement. A billion dollars that they're announcing in at-home testing. Is that the practical plan for people over the next few weeks? Do they need to go out and buy at-home tests to know whether they can get together with their loved ones? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Yeah, I do think so. Look, I think every household should have a supply of at-home tests, that's what they're doing in the U.K. and for people who are priced out of the market, these tests are not cheap. I think the government can be doing a lot more to subsidize the availability of those tests, perhaps distributing them, for example, in the Medicaid program. It looks to be what the Biden administration is aiming to do. I think when you're gathering around the holidays, you have to assess the circumstances. If you have younger kids who are unvaccinated with older relatives who are vaccinated, but still could be vulnerable from a breakthrough infection, using testing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --to try to protect that setting, I think, makes a lot of sense. That's certainly what I try to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for the advice. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Last week, a former Facebook employee told lawmakers that the company knew its products were harmful to children and teens, stoked political division and spread disinformation. To help explain it all, we now go to CBS News cybersecurity analyst Chris Krebs. Good morning to you. CHRIS KREBS (CBS News Cybersecurity Expert and Analyst/@C_C_Krebs/Partner, Krebs Stamos Group): Morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: What I thought was so interesting about this whistleblower is how clearly she communicated some things that are frankly often misunderstood or just too opaque. And one of the things that she highlighted was that social media is complicit, frankly, in knowingly allowing their platforms to be used this way. Under current law, internet companies are exempt from liability for what's posted on their platforms. Should that be reformed? CHRIS KREBS: Oh, absolutely. I think there were three takeaways that I had, at least, from her testimony and then the 60 MINUTES piece last week. First was yes, in fact, she was very well prepared and-- and was very articulate in the way she communicated the issues. The second is that effectively what we're talking about, Facebook and others, are data monopolies. They-- they control the information, and they control what's released and available to the public. And-- and the third piece, as you point out, the Communications Decency Act of 19-- what is it '96 or '97, Section 230 that provides immunity to these data companies, these tech platforms and others needs to be reformed and that the algorithms and the-- the advertisements and the other ways that the companies generate revenue should-- should very likely be-- those protections should be stripped away. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the things that she described was how outrage generates more engagement, that it is literally embedded in the technology to feed the extremes and continue to feed them. Who takes on a bigger role to try to offset some of that? CHRIS KREBS: Well, when you step back and you look at whether it's disinformation, misinformation or just online discourse, you have to split it up into a supply and demand problem as I see it. On the demand side, there is still a significant amount of, you know, interest in uptake for a lot of the rage that you-- that you mentioned. But the platforms, as you know, as we've been talking about, have, you know, they-- they generate revenue, they get more engagement for them is a good thing. And those are the sorts of things that-- that we need to-- we need to take a harder look at. But as I had already mentioned, the biggest issue here is that we do not have enough insight and information around these algorithms and what drives the-- the sprawl of information. And so, yeah, I've likened it to we're-- we're in a post-Enron moment where we don't have enough visibility, there's not enough transparency. And so, we're going to need some equivalent of Sarbanes-Oxley that requires these platforms to provide access to security researchers, to journalists, to regulators. And yes, regulation is absolutely-- should be on the table for Congress. And I think this is one of those few areas right now where we have an opportunity for bipartisan engagement. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and it's interesting because an AP poll done recently shows that there is recognition that misinformation is a problem and there is bipartisan support. It's just kind of figuring out how to do it that's the challenge. You know, one of the other places that I know you've looked at that there is some misinformation is on TV, on cable news. And there was a report done by Reuters this week saying that the network AT&T helped build a far-right channel. AT&T denied this, that they had no financial interest in this. But how significant do you think these other platforms are in spreading information that is manipulative? CHRIS KREBS: I think that's got to be part of the conversation, the online platforms, because today we might be talking about social media platform-- platforms. You know, tomorrow who knows what the technology is going to be. And so, we really have to think through the legal frameworks that provide the-- the, you know, the unfettered opportunities out there to-- to spread inform-- misinformation. But to the-- the point about AT&T and OAN and whether in fact that is true, it is in a-- you know, it's in court documents, but it's-- that's why it's so important for researchers and journalists to have access so the market can make decisions. With imperfect information, we make imperfect decisions. But this allows the market to vote with their dollars and, you know, I'm probably switching off AT&T personally to another wireless carrier. So, these are the sorts of, and this is the sort of information we need more broadly so that the market can make decisions and that we can make informed sound policy going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, talking about politics, you ran the rumor control site for the 2020 election in your previous role when you were within Homeland Security. What you said and the work you did on that is one of the reasons why President Trump fired you. Last night, he again stood at a rally in Iowa and called for the complete overhaul of our election systems. These calls are not going away. Do you think that there is an active effort underway to undermine elections as Congressman Schiff started off our program saying? CHRIS KREBS: Without question, it's happening at four different levels. Both state legislatures and state elected officials, some of the folks running for secretary of state in Arizona and Georgia, but we're also seeing it in the U.S. Congress. The minority whip was on Fox News this morning with Chris Wallace, and he was talking about how the-- the election was-- was effectively stolen. He will not admit that Biden won-- that President Biden won fair and square. And so, what we're seeing is-- as Congressman Schiff mentioned, is this constant erosion of confidence in the elect-- the electoral system. And it is ultimately anti-Democratic and we're-- we're frankly in a death spiral as I see it. And, you know, two years, four years at the ballot box isn't good enough, and there have to be other accountability measures for those that are going to continue to proliferate these lies. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's an incredible statement. You're a lifelong Republican, and-- and you are acknowledging and pointing to leadership encouraging some of these things. How is that possible that this continues to happen? CHRIS KREBS: I mean, it's-- it's base-- it's captured by the base, right? I mean, they're-- they're afraid to speak up because they're afraid the former President is going to try too primary them. And then the other piece is that they've activated and lost control of their-- their voting base, the people that are going to put him in power. And they know that if they go against the former President that not only will he speak out against them, but they're going to-- you know, they're going to start seeing people show up at their town hall. I mean, you've actually seen Republican members of Congress stop holding town halls because they've over activated their base and it's gotten out of control. And so the-- again, this is a death spiral. They've lost control and they don't have the ability to-- to rein it back in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Krebs, thank you very much for your analysis, though you've given me some heartburn. Thank you. It's always good to talk to you. We will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to bring in another former Trump White House adviser, Fiona Hill. She was the senior director at the National Security Council and a key witness in President Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019. Her new book is called \"There Is Nothing For You Here: Finding Opportunity in the 21st Century.\" Good morning to you. FIONA HILL (Former NSC Senior Director for European & Russian Affairs/Author, \"There is Nothing For You Here\"): Morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that title comes from something that your father, a coal miner in the north of England, told you when you were coming of age. And I wonder what you would say looking at this country to some coming of age right now, is there anything for them here? FIONA HILL: Well, I think it's the question that everyone's asking themselves, right? I mean, this could be taken as even a political observation. A lot of people are feeling somewhat alienated from, you know, the politics, as we've been hearing through the segments. But there's also in so many parts of the United States, a lot of questions that people are having about their education and their educational future, particularly with COVID and all of the economic problems that we're seeing everything you've been covering in all of the segments. People wondering how they're going to get a job. Are they going to be able to make a better life-- a life for themselves than their parents had, which is always the expectation in America. I mean, I think that's the whole premise that the country's been-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. FIONA HILL: --based on is the idea that your children, your grandchildren, will live better than you. And I think that that's the big issue we're grappling with right now is whether that's still possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that I think is interesting is that you were an intelligence analyst, so you can apply that eye, that critical eye to this country, just like you would a foreign country. So when you apply it to the United States right now, you use terms like \"the politics of cultural despair,\" \"fertile ground for populist politics.\" How dangerous is this moment? FIONA HILL: I think this dangerous-- the moment is incredibly dangerous. I mean, we are in a dangerous moment. People are talking about a prospective constitutional crisis, we're already in it. I mean, I was listening very attentively to what Chris Krebs was saying, somebody who I worked with extremely closely. And when Chris had to basically call out domestic threats to the election, during the 2020 presidential election, it should have been obvious to everyone. He was the Department of Homeland Security. His whole job was to push back against external threats, not against domestic actors who were trying to undermine the integrity of the election or to cast a doubt on it. When he had to speak out in public in the way that he did, it should have been an alarm bell to anyone watching. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had the National Security eye as well. When you look at the politics of the moment, that you describe as dangerous, do you see a difference between populism on the right and populism on the left? Do you see them as equally potentially threatening? FIONA HILL: Unfortunately, I'm seeing the populism on the right is the most threatening at the moment. The populism on the left contributes to the overall atmosphere of polarization, you know, but very sadly, it's on the right that we're seeing the main threats. It's actors on the right, not just in Congress and in the Senate, you know, places where you'd actually expect people to be upholding their oath of office to the Constitution and to the people, but it's actors on that right who are also basically calling for violence against fellow Americans and at all times are talking down the integrity of the election system. And of course, we've just had the rally that President Trump conducted in Iowa, clearly prepping for his return to the presidency, a presidency he says that he's never left because he's saying that the election was stolen away from him and you know, in the poll of the rally, about eighty-five percent of his speech at the rally was all about the stealing of the election. I mean, basically perpetrating a lie. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's exactly why I've been asking that is the groundwork being laid question, because certainly that seemed to be the message here. You know, in the book Peril, Robert Costa-- FIONA HILL: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and Bob Woodward wrote, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, at the end of it, is quoted as comparing the January 6th, siege of the Capitol, to The Great Dress Rehearsal. You're a Russia analyst,-- FIONA HILL: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: --you know immediately what that phrase is, which is what Lenin called an uprising that preceded the revolution. I read that and I said, \"Dear God.\" FIONA HILL: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, he, the general, is saying that this is a precursor potentially to further violence? Is this overstating things in a historical sense? FIONA HILL: He's not overstating it at all because-- I mean, we all saw in real time what happened on January 6th at the Capitol building, and General Milley was absolutely right. Any student of history, but any observer of even American politics over the last decade-- I mean, when have we seen something like this before? We haven't. Not in our lifetimes. We've seen episodes, you know, particularly during the Civil Rights Movement and of course, during Vietnam, where there were protests. But storming the Capitol building of the United States? I mean, this is exactly the thing that you think of in historical revolutions. Storming the Bastille during the French Revolution, storming the Winter Palace during the Russian Revolution that General Milley was alluding to. And as he was saying, we've seen many historical episodes where there is violence, people discount it. They think that this is just a passing occurrence. You know, Vice President Pence has been downplaying it, even though he would have been targeted. He was targeted. They wanted to lynch him. And then, you know, people sweeping this away, saying nothing happened here. And the next time around, you get the real thing where people actually do seize those major buildings. And I said that also in the book that this was, in effect, a dress rehearsal for something that could be happening near term in 2022, 2024. We've got election cycles here that will heighten the tensions. And once people start talking about violence, once the threshold is crossed, we're in a danger zone. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are so many people who will look at the investigation Chairman Schiff is working on and say that's just politics, that's just political messaging. They'll look at the violence-- I've heard people tell me this on Capitol Hill and just say, \"That's a riot. A few crazy people.\" Not the precursor or a-- a dry run of a coup, as the general put it, in the terms of that you are right now. I mean, how do you respond to people saying you're overreacting essentially? FIONA HILL: Well, people are saying that because they don't have any personal experience of these kinds of events. But I can certainly tell you as an immigrant, as somebody who came to the United States in 1989 against the backdrop of the crumbling of the Berlin Wall and the backdrop of the end of the Cold War, I also know immigrants, you know, like myself who came from war zones, who came from places like the former Yugoslavia or places like, you know, Sri Lanka, which is being pulled apart by civil war and conflict. Afghanistan, Syria, you know, you name it. All of the people that I know who are immigrants are looking around and saying, can't people see this? We've come from war torn societies. All of the hallmarks are here. So perhaps, you know, Americans should talk to some of their neighbors who've come from somewhere else-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. FIONA HILL: --and who came to the United States to flee just this kind of occurrence and have them tell them what their personal experience was. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. All right. Fiona Hill, thank you for your analysis. We'll be back. FIONA HILL: Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Congressman Adam Schiff that aired Sunday, October 10, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he is also on the panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. And the author of a new book, Midnight in Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could. We'll get into all of that shortly. But Congressman, I want to start on the economy. You just heard the public doesn't really know what's in this massive spending bill Democrats are trying to muscle through along party lines. Isn't this a significant problem for the party? REP. ADAM SCHIFF : I can't quarrel with any of the polling results. I think I hear the same thing that not enough Americans know what's in this bill, but when they find out they really applaud what's in it, in particular, expanding Medicare to cover hearing and dental and vision care, lowering prescription drug prices, expanding family and paid medical leave, as well as childcare and lifting children out of poverty. So, the provisions of the bill are hugely popular, but there's been so much fixation on what's the number that the House and Senate are going to agree to, what's the number that Democrats can come together on? I do think this is a very short-lived problem. We're going to get both of these bills passed. They're going to be enormously important to the economy. And once we do, we're not going to make the mistake I think we did with the Affordable Care Act. We're going to go out and we're going to promote this and let people know how it's directly impacting them. MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't Democrats need to get ahead of that messaging now? I mean, you have unified control. This is going- you need to show you can govern. REP. SCHIFF: Well, that's exactly right. And we do. And one thing that I think President Biden has been pitch perfect on that all of us need to amplify is, this is- you know, first and foremost about helping Americans get through this awful pandemic and helping their families cope and survive economically. But it is also key to the pro-democracy agenda that we have, and that is we have to show that our democracy can deliver MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that's the challenge is when you're doing it only on party lines, it once again looks to people at home like, they can't get along, Washington's not working again. REP. SCHIFF: Well, look, we have a Republican Party that is now an autocratic cult around Donald Trump. It is not interested in governing. It's not interested in even maintaining the solvency in the credit worthiness of the country. And we have to recognize that they're not interested in governing. And so we're going to govern, we're going to have to do it. And if we have to do it with our own votes, we will do that. But we need to show that democracy delivers, that it can help people put food on the table, that it can address these huge disparities in income. There's so much reason why our democracy is at this fragile point right now, and we need to foremost deliver on the economy, but also on voting rights and stop these efforts to disenfranchise people. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just made an incredible statement about an autocratic cult. This is one of the themes in your book. You aren't often compared to conservative writers like Robert Kagan, but you come to basically the same conclusion he just did in a very widely read essay where he says essentially that it's the Republican Party that is trying to lay the groundwork to challenge the next few elections. You say preparing the battlefield for the struggle to overturn the election, should they regain majorities in Congress, they might be successful. You're saying we're on the cusp of a constitutional crisis? REP. SCHIFF: Yes. And this is really why I wrote the book because I want it to sound the alarm that our democracy is hanging by a thread right now as a member of the Jan. 6 committee. You know, I have to acknowledge there may be another violent attack on the Capitol, but what is even more pressing a threat is what we see Republicans doing around the country taking this big lie about the last election and running with it. And I wanted to tell the story in this book about how- how does that happen, how in four short years does our democracy become so threatened? And one of the terrible realizations for me is that so many of the people I worked with across the aisle, who I admired and respected because I believe that they believed what they were saying, turned out not to believe it at all. That the only thing that they cared about was the maintenance of their power or position. And I want to show people how that happens, how people start by making small compromises of their morality and their values and their ideology and end up completely capitulating because one of the things we discovered in the impeachment trial, but really both trials is that there's nothing wrong about our constitution. The provisions are brilliant. But unless they're animated by people who- who give content to their oath that- that understand the importance of right and wrong, none of it works. And right now, we saw Grassley in Iowa yesterday, unable to condemn the president's effort to- to get the Justice Department to overturn the election. Scalise this morning, another Republican leader unable to acknowledge that the election wasn't stolen. It's these personal capitulations that are putting our country at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a shift from where Sen. Grassley, who accepted the president- former president's endorsement, was right after the events of Jan. 6. But I want to come back to where you lay blame because you say it's \"we, the country who made Donald Trump possible. We- he would not have been able to batter and break so many of our democratic norms had we not let him. Had we not been capable of endless rationalization, had we not forgotten why we came to office in the first place.\" What responsibility do you think Democrats have for damaging the faith of the country as well? REP. SCHIFF: Look, I think Democrats have been defending our democracy for the last five years. We have put up a valiant fight for the heart and soul of this country, so I really can't lay the blame at the Democratic Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't take any responsibility.\u00a0 REP. SCHIFF: Well, look, I- as I acknowledge in my book, there are lots of things I could have done differently or better. But at the end of the day, one of our two great parties has completely abandoned its ideology. It has made itself an anti-truth, anti-democratic cult of the former president, and the responsibility is on that party to once again become a party of ideas. And there are some hopeful signs. And one of the things I want to emphasize in the book too is there are also some great profiles in courage that emerge from this period. One of them you're going to have on your show later today, Fiona Hill. But Marie Yovanovitch and Alexander Vindman, people like Dan Coats, you know, Republicans like Dan Coats, who- who did their duty, defended the intelligence community wouldn't carry out the president's big lies. And we need to be inspired by those examples because we all have a role to play right now in the preservation of this democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I need to ask you about the Jan. 6 committee. When will you get hold of the documents that the White House has said they're okay with Congress taking the Trump era documents? REP. SCHIFF: Well, very soon, I hope, and I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you looking for? REP. SCHIFF: --I applaud the Biden administration for not asserting executive privilege, not trying to, because it's protecting its own prerogative, deprive the American people of the full facts. So, hats off to the administration. We should, I think, get those documents soon because the sitting president has the primary say in executive privilege. We also want to make sure that these witnesses come in and testify, and we are prepared to go forward and urge the Justice Department to criminally prosecute anyone who does not do their lawful duty. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch that carefully. Congressman, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a minute.",

            "article_content": "Former President Trump's White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, says he will not comply with a House committee's demand for records and testimony related to the January 6 Capitol riots. The January 6 select committee issued subpoenas in late September to four of Mr. Trump's former aides and close allies, including Bannon. The witnesses were given a Thursday deadline to reply to the request for documents, while depositions are scheduled next week. In a response to the panel obtained by CBS News, Bannon's attorney said he was following the direction of the former president's legal team. A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Justin Clark, instructed the four witnesses to defy the committee's demands, contending it sought information that was \"unquestionably protected from disclosure by the executive and other privileges.\" It's unclear whether Bannon's records and testimony would be shielded under such privilege claims. Bannon left the White House in August 2017 and was a private citizen during efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and in the months leading up to the January 6 riot. In a statement, committee Chair Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and Vice Chair Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, accused Bannon of attempting to \"hide behind vague references to privileges of the former President\" and threatened to recommend criminal charges. \"[W]e will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral,\" the statement said. Thompson and Cheney also said two of the other subpoenaed witnesses \u2014 Mark Meadows and Kash Patel \u2014 have \"so far\" engaged with the committee. Meadows was White House chief of staff during the final year of Mr. Trump's presidency. At the time of the January 6 attacks, Patel was serving as chief of staff to then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. The committee has reportedly not been able to serve a subpoena to the fourth witness, former White House deputy chief of staff for communications Dan Scavino. News of Bannon's refusal to comply with the subpoena emerged hours before the White House said it won't assert executive privilege over an initial series of documents from the Trump administration that have been requested by the House select committee.\u00a0 In a letter to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) obtained by CBS News, White House Counsel Dana Remus said President Biden determined that asserting executive privilege was \"not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified. The decision clears the way for the National Archives to release a trove of documents to the House committee. In August it, sent a request to NARA and seven federal agencies for executive branch records pertaining to strategies to derail the Electoral College vote, planning for rallies leading up to January 6 as well as documents and communications related to what the former president knew about the election results and potential plans to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge late Wednesday denied former President Trump's appeal of her earlier decision denying his request to block the release of documents that were requested by the House select committee investigating the\u00a0January 6 Capitol attack.\u00a0 \"This court will not effectively ignore its own reasoning in denying injunctive relief in the first place to grant injunctive relief now,\" Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote. She added that Mr. Trump can look to the appeals court for any relief he seeks. \"Plaintiff can seek appellate relief in the interim.\"\u00a0 Last month, Mr. Trump sued the committee\u00a0and the archives in an attempt to halt the transfer of his records, citing executive privilege.\u00a0 Late Tuesday, Chutkan ruled against him, allowing the records transfer to go forward as scheduled on November 12. Attorneys for the former president immediately appealed Tuesday's ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case now sits before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The former president alleged in his lawsuit that his White House records are subject to a certain level of confidentiality. Mr. Trump has alleged they are protected under executive privilege, the idea that a sitting president's private communications should be shielded from public scrutiny. He also argued the request by Congress was an invalid fishing expedition.\u00a0 The committee says it needs the documents to further understand the events leading up to, during, and following the January 6 assault on the Capitol. Citing that reasoning, President Biden has already rejected his predecessor's claim of executive privilege and permitted the National Archives to comply with the House committee's request for the documents. As a result of Mr. Biden's decision, Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit.\u00a0 \"At bottom,\" Chutkan wrote in her ruling Tuesday,\u00a0 \"this is a dispute between a former and incumbent President. And the Supreme Court has already made clear that in such circumstances, the incumbent's view is accorded greater weight.\"\u00a0 Therefore, she reasoned, Mr. Biden's decision to allow the release of the records take precedence.\u00a0 \"Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President,\" she wrote about Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Addressing the issue of presidential confidentiality, Chutkan wrote, \"the Constitution does not expressly define a President's right to confidential communications ... the privilege is not absolute.\" The former president's claims of confidentiality in this case, she ruled, do not hold water.\u00a0 And while the judge agreed that Congress' request for the Trump White House documents \"cast a wide net\" in its breadth, she ultimately concluded, \"the court will not second guess [the Committee's request] by undertaking a document-by-document review that would require it to engage in a function reserved squarely for the Executive.\" Mr. Biden had already made the decision.\u00a0 Notably, Chutkan also identified many of the valid reasons the House Committee may need the archived records to prevent an attack like that of January 6 from happening again. Those reasons included\u00a0 \"enacting amending criminal laws to deter and punish violent conduct targeted at the institutions of democracy ... imposing structural reforms on executive branch agencies to prevent their abuse for antidemocratic ends ... and reallocating resources and modifying processes for intelligence sharing by federal agencies charged with detecting, and interdicting, foreign and domestic threats to the security and integrity of our electoral processes.\" In her opinion, Chutkan, who has in her court many of the cases involving defendants accused of participating in the January 6 riot, described the event as an \"unprecedented attempt to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\" She added later that \"for the first time since the election of 1860, the transfer of executive power was distinctly not peaceful.\" The \"public interest,\" she decided, weighed in favor of releasing the documents to the Committee charged with investigating the attack. Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives has revealed that it identified more than 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The matter now heads to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ahead of the November 12 deadline for the document transfer.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday on a bill that would admit Washington, D.C., as the 51st state, although the measure is likely to fail in the evenly divided Senate. The legislation passed along party lines with a vote of 216 to 208, with no Republicans voting in favor. For the bill's advocates, D.C. statehood is a civil rights issue. The district has a population of more than 700,000 people, larger than the population of Wyoming or Vermont. But while those two states each have two senators and a representative in the House, D.C. has no voting representation in Congress. Eleanor Holmes Norton represents D.C. in Congress as a non-voting delegate. Statehood advocates also point out that D.C. pays more in federal taxes than 21 states and more per capita than any state, according to 2019 IRS data. The district is also diverse, with a population that is 46% Black and majority nonwhite. If admitted, it would be the first state with a plurality Black population. The legislation, titled H.R. 51, would create the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, named after Frederick Douglass. It would give D.C. two U.S. senators and a voting representative in the House, like every other state. The bill would also cordon off the White House, U.S. Capitol and National Mall to remain under federal control as the seat of the U.S. government. The House approved a D.C. statehood measure by a vote of 232 to 180 last year, but it did not get a vote in the Senate, which was then controlled by Republicans. Although Democrats now hold a 50-seat majority, most legislation requires 60 votes to advance, and this bill is unlikely to garner support from 10 Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to bringing the measure to the floor for a vote, but a motion to move forward with the legislation would almost certainly fail. \"Today's victory was historic, both for D.C. residents and for the cause of D.C. statehood,\" Norton said in a statement after the bill was passed, noting that this is only the second time statehood had received a vote on the House floor. Many D.C. statehood supporters are pushing the Senate to eliminate the filibuster, which would allow measures to advance with a simple majority. But this would require support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. Two Democrats say they won't support it \u2014 all but dooming the prospects for H.R. 51. In a press conference Wednesday promoting H.R. 51, Norton expressed confidence that the legislation has a chance in the Senate, saying that she does \"believe that the filibuster is on its way out.\" Appearing at the press conference Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that the Senate will \"have a decision to make a good judgment\" when the legislation comes to the floor. \"We believe in good policy for our country and hope that the Senate will act on behalf of the people,\" Hoyer said. Senate Democrats\u00a0introduced a companion bill\u00a0to the House measure in January, which has 44 cosponsors in the Senate, including Schumer. However, it's unclear whether all Senate Democrats would support D.C. statehood, even if the filibuster was eliminated. The two Democrats who oppose eliminating the filibuster, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have not signed onto the Senate bill as co-sponsors. Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Mark Kelly, and independent Senator Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats, have also refrained from co-sponsoring the bill. Dr. Ravi Perry, the chair of the political science department at Howard University and a board member of D.C. Vote, an advocacy group supporting statehood, noted in an interview with CBS News that many of the Black families who live in the district have been here for generations. Perry noted many of the iconic federal buildings in Washington, like the White House and the Capitol, were built by Black workers and slaves \u2014 but the District-dwelling descendants of those laborers don't enjoy all the privileges represented by those \"beacons of democracy.\" \"They look at those buildings built by Black folks, built by slaves, and they see hope,\" Perry said about the district's Black residents. \"And they know every single day when they wake up that they don't have those same rights [as other Americans].\" Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over Washington, which means local legislation, including the D.C. budget, must be approved by Congress. This can have controversial side effects when D.C. residents make decisions that are blocked or overturned by Congress. D.C. voters approved Initiative 71 in 2014, which allows adults to grow, possess and gift marijuana. However, Congress has blocked the district from allowing marijuana sales by attaching a rider to D.C.'s appropriations bill to prevent it from using funds to legalize or regulate cannabis sales. The idea of D.C. statehood is growing in popularity nationwide. A March poll conducted by Data for Progress and the progressive advocacy coalition Democracy for All 2021 Action and shared first with CBS News found that 54% of likely voters think D.C. should be a state.\u00a0 Advocates also point to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 as a reason the district should be admitted as a state. Unlike other National Guard units, the D.C. National Guard doesn't fall under local control, and can only be mobilized by the White House. Lawmakers have questioned why it took so long for the National Guard to act during the assault on the Capitol on January 6. If Washington, D.C., had been given local control of its National Guard, then the Guard might have deployed sooner. The fight for D.C. statehood is not new \u2014 it's been around since the country's creation, with both parties spearheading the charge at different times. But the modern fight for statehood is led by Democrats. The District is heavily Democratic \u2014 92% of its residents supported President Biden in the 2020 election. The partisan balance of the district is, in large part, why admitting D.C. as a state garners so much opposition from Republicans. If admitted as a state, it is highly likely that the two senators and one representative from D.C. would be Democratic, tipping the balance of Congress further into Democrats' favor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been one of the most vocal opponents of D.C. statehood, referring to it in 2019 as \"full-bore socialism.\" In his speech at the 2020 Republican National Convention, McConnell argued that Democrats wanted to admit D.C., which he called \"the swamp itself,\" in order to impose their agenda. \"With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they've done,\" McConnell said. House Republicans also oppose admitting D.C. as a state. In a House Oversight Committee hearing on the bill last month, ranking member James Comer said \"D.C. statehood is a key part of the radical leftist agenda to reshape America.\" The bill is not expected to win any Republican votes in the House. The House Oversight Committee advanced the bill last week with a vote of 25 to 19, entirely along party lines. In a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, Schumer said that arguments against D.C. statehood were motivated by \"bigotry,\" given the diversity of the district. \"I shouldn't have to remind my colleagues that it's shockingly inappropriate to imply that lives and occupations and rights of D.C. residents are somehow less than their fellow citizens in other, more real, quote-unquote, and almost always more white parts of the country,\" Schumer said. \"We all know that the minority party opposes D.C. statehood because it fears giving political power and representation to American citizens that might not vote for Republicans.\" House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, who helped shepherd the bill to a vote, also argued in a speech on the floor ahead of the vote that any opposition to statehood was rooted in partisanship. \"They would rather deny voting rights for hundreds of thousands of American citizens than even consider the possibility that representatives from the new state could be Democrats,\" Maloney said. \"They are willing to violate the core principles of our democracy merely because the new state might elect representatives from a different political party.\" Democratic Congressman Mondaire Jones called arguments against statehood \"racist trash\" in a speech on the House floor ahead of the vote on Thursday. After an uproar from Republicans at this characterization, he voluntarily withdrew his words. Some Republicans have suggested retroceding the district into Maryland as a compromise, which would theoretically provide district residents with a voting representative in the House, but would not add two new senators. Several House Republicans endorsed retrocession in the debate over the bill ahead of the vote on Thursday, and a bill has been proposed to incorporate the district into Maryland. But this solution is unpopular with residents of the District and of Maryland. In a statement on retrocession in February, Norton noted that 86% of D.C. residents voted for statehood in a 2016 referendum. \"Retrocession would be inconsistent with that referendum vote and the District's pursuit of self-determination,\" Norton said. The referendum petition was sent to Congress, which took no action on it. Retrocession is also opposed by Maryland's congressional representatives. \"The people of D.C. have made it very clear they want self-determination. This is supposed to be a democracy,\" Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen told reporters on Wednesday. Statehood advocates argue that the partisan balance of the district shouldn't be a factor in the decision. They believe that every American should care that 700,000 of their fellow citizens do not have voting representation in Congress, and should want statehood for the sake of equal rights. \"We're not talking about giving rights to people simply because of what their descriptive characteristics may be, we're saying they deserve these rights because they too are American,\" Perry said.

Anyone who wants to cooperate with our investigation can do so. Nearly everyone has.\" Meadows had earlier cooperated in part with the committee, handing over some email and text message records, but he failed to sit for a deposition last week and refused to turn over a slew of other documents, citing former President Donald Trump's claims of privilege.\u00a0 The panel's vice chair, Congresswoman Liz Cheney said in her opening remarks that the contempt vote was mainly related to Meadows' \"refusal to testify about text messages and other communications that he admits are not privileged.\" She noted that although he didn't claim privilege based on this material, he was still refusing to testify about it.\u00a0 Cheney then read aloud some of the texts that Meadows received in what she referred to as the \"187 minutes\" when Trump \"refused to act when action by our president was required, essential.\" There were text messages from Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and Fox News hosts Brian Kilmeade, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity \u2014 all imploring the president to act. The White House, she said, \"knew exactly what was happening here at the Capitol.\" They knew because all those messages were being sent by \"members of Congress, the press and others\" to Mark Meadows while the attack was happening. According to Cheney, Trump Jr. \"texted again and again, urging action by the president: 'We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.'\" She read the Fox News hosts' quotes:\u00a0 \"Quote, 'Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,'\" Laura Ingraham wrote. \"'Please get him on TV. Destroying everything you have accomplished,'\" Brian Kilmeade texted. \"'Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol,'\" Sean Hannity urged. There were other texts, too, that appeared to have been written by people in the Capitol during the assault. \"'We are under siege up here at the Capitol,'\" said one. Another read, \"'They have breached the Capitol.'\" A third text, said Cheney: \"'Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol. Breaking windows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump going to say something?'\" \"A fourth: 'There's an armed standoff at the House Chamber door.'\" \"And another, from someone inside the Capitol, 'We are all helpless.'\" Cheney said that \"dozens of texts,\" including some from Trump administration officials, urged Trump to act.\u00a0 \"Quote, 'POTUS has to come out firmly and tell protestors to dissipate. Someone is going to get killed,'\" Cheney said. \"In another, 'Mark, he needs to stop this. Now.' \"A third, in all caps, 'TELL THEM TO GO HOME.' A fourth, and I quote, 'POTUS needs to calm this [sh*t] down.'\"\u00a0 She said that as the violence went on, she took note of another text exchange between Trump Jr. and Meadows:\u00a0 \"'He's got to condemn this [sh*t] ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,' Donald Trump, Jr. texted. \"Meadows responded, quote, 'I'm pushing it hard. I agree.' \"Still,\" Cheney said, \"President Trump did not immediately act.\" She called the texts \"evidence\" of his \"supreme dereliction of duty.\" The nine-person, Democrat-run committee recommended that the House of Representatives find Meadows in contempt of Congress, as they did in October with Steve Bannon, who had not cooperated at all.\u00a0 Meadows appeared on Fox News on Monday night and said he found the vote \"disappointing but not surprising.\" Representative Pete Aguilar, who is on the committee, said Monday night that the contempt vote will likely be brought before the full House for a vote on Tuesday. \u00a0 If the Democratic-controlled House votes to find him in contempt of Congress \u2014  \u00a0as they did with Bannon \u2014  the case would then be turned over to the Justice Department. If the Justice Department charges him, he could face up to a year in jail if found guilty.\u00a0 \"History will record that in a critical moment in our democracy, most people were on the side of finding the truth, of providing accountability, of strengthening our system for future generations,\" Thompson said before the committee's vote. \"And history will also record, in this critical moment, that some people were not.\"\u00a0 Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, argued in a letter to the committee on Monday that a contempt referral for Meadows \"would be contrary to law, manifestly unjust, unwise, and unfair.\" He wrote that the contempt of Congress statute was never intended to apply to \"good-faith\" assertions of executive privilege, and that prosecuting a senior presidential aide would be \"unwise\" because it could damage the institution of the presidency. But the committee's contempt report dismisses the privilege argument on the grounds that the sitting president, President Biden, has not exerted privilege over the records in question. They also noted that several of the documents Meadows already turned over would be in violation of the privilege claims if they were legitimate.\u00a0 Among the documents Meadows gave the committee was a PowerPoint presentation prepared by an outside adviser entitled \"Election Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for JAN 6,\" which was initially intended to be distributed to members of Congress, Thompson noted in a letter to Terwilliger last week.\u00a0 Meadows also wrote in a January 5 email that the National Guard would be present in Washington the following day \"to protect pro Trump people,\" according to the contempt report. The contempt report also described a January 5 email in which Meadows said the National Guard would be present in Washington the following day \"to protect pro Trump people.\" The committee wrote that Meadows said many more Guardsmen would be on standby, but it did not offer other details about the exchange.\u00a0 The committee also attached to the report a transcript of the questions they would have asked Meadows had he shown up. The transcript cited text messages between Meadows and a senator in which they discussed then Vice President Mike Pence's \"power to reject electors\" thereby potentially changing the outcome of the election. In one of the texts, Meadows \"recounts a direct communication with President Trump who, according to Mr. Meadows in his text messages, quote, 'thinks the legislators have the power, but the VP has power too,' end quote.\" Democratic leadership plans to bring the contempt resolution to the floor for consideration by the full House as soon as Tuesday.\u00a0 The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, is investigating\u00a0 the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the House.",

His first priority: COVID-19. America came together last Wednesday to honor its forty-sixth President in somewhat subdued and heavily fortified inauguration festivities. The day coincidentally marked the one-year anniversary of the first coronavirus diagnosis in the U.S. (Lady Gaga performing during inauguration) MARGARET BRENNAN: There were some bursts of color in the much smaller and mostly masked ceremonies. Some old traditions were reimagined due to the pandemic. Memorable moments have gone viral. But in the chilly Washington setting the sense of history in the making was powerful. President Biden wasted no time addressing the herculean challenges ahead. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Four hundred thousand Americans have died. That's more than have died in all of World War II. Four hundred thousand. This is a war-time undertaking. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our last President also waged war on the coronavirus, but the new administration says its war effort will be different. There are new guidelines on mandatory mask-wearing, lower vaccination goals, and a promise to revamp a confusing and chaotic vaccine rollout. ANTHONY FAUCI: Please, wear a mask. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk to the President's top medical adviser Doctor Anthony Fauci. Plus, we'll take a stunning look back at the dysfunctional handling of the pandemic during the Trump administration, with a key figure in that effort, Doctor Deborah Birx. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think President Trump appreciated the gravity of the health crisis you were describing? DEBORAH BIRX: I think the President appreciated the gravity in March. MARGARET BRENNAN: But where is the vice president in all of this? DEBORAH BIRX: The vice president knew what I was doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean he knew that you were telling the governors privately to do things that the President publicly was making light of. DEBORAH BIRX: He knew what I was doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctors Fauci and Birx, they're just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. The country has a new administration, though, we're still facing a crisis of monumental proportions. Nearly twenty-five million Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus so far. Right now the rate of new infections is starting to slow but the death toll is not. Last week an American died of COVID-19 every thirty seconds. And experts are now warning that in addition to being more contagious, the new variants could also be more lethal. We begin with the President's chief medical adviser, Doctor Anthony Fauci. Good morning to you, Doctor. Good to have you back. ANTHONY FAUCI, M.D. (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden/Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, said Friday the B111 strain that was first detected in the U.K. may be associated with a higher degree of mortality. The day prior you said it did not. So, which is it? Is it more deadly? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, the data that came out was after they had been saying all along that it did not appear to be more deadly. So that's where we got that information. But when the British investigators looked more closely at the death rate of a certain age group they found that it was one to-- per thousand we'll say, and then it went up to 1.3 per thousand in a certain group. So, that's a significant increase. So, the most recent data is in accord with the Brits are saying. We want to look at the data ourselves, but we have every reason to believe them. They're a very competent group. So, we need to assume now that what has been circulating dominantly in the U.K. does have a certain degree of increase in what we call virulence, namely the power of the virus to cause more damage, including death. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is projected to be the dominant strain here in the U.S. by March, according to the CDC. Your organization, the NIH, has just started testing to see if the existing vaccines prevent infection from some of these variants. What do we know about whether the vaccine works against B117 or B1351, which is coming out of South Africa? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, there-- there are actually two different ones. When you look at the effect of the change, this lineage that is the U.K. lineage that is now in at least twenty states in the United States. The vaccine induced antibodies, namely the vaccines that some of us have gotten and that we're rolling out. Moderna and Pfizer vaccines seem to continue to be protective against the mutant strain. It is a very minor diminution. But the cushion that you have of efficacy is so large that it's not going to negatively impact. A little bit more concerning with the South African isolate, namely the mutant that is now prevalent in South Africa, particularly its negative impact on some of the monoclonal antibodies that have been given for treatment, that it can, in some respects knocks out their efficacy. It looks like it does diminish more so the efficacy of the vaccine. But we're still within that cushion level of the vaccines being efficacious against these mutants. Having said that, Margaret, we look at this and follow this very, very carefully because these things do evolve. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY FAUCI: And what we will do and are doing already is making preparations for the possibility that down the pipe, down the line, we may need to modify and upgrade the vaccines. We don't need to do that right now. The best way to prevent the further evolution of these mutants is to vaccinate as many people as possible with the vaccines that we have currently available to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. ANTHONY FAUCI: That's the best protection against this evolution. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that in a second. But just to clarify, the Biden administration says in its new plan it wants to increase surveillance and sequencing of viruses, basically, do more research to figure out what's actually swirling around in the population. Do we know for a fact that the South African strain, B1351, is not in the United States right now? ANTHONY FAUCI: I can't say definitively, Margaret, that we know as a fact. What has been looked at thus far, it has not come up on any of the surveillance, but we need to expand greatly our genomic surveillance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ANTHONY FAUCI: We know that it had not been at the level that we would have liked. But there's a lot of movement right now at the CDC level, including some input from the NIH and other organizations to dramatically increase the what we call genomic surveillance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. So, we just don't-- we don't know yet. On the vaccine-- ANTHONY FAUCI: It is unlikely but we can say definitively, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. On the vaccines you just drove home that point of how important it is to get this out there. I want to play some tape here for you and get you to clarify when U.S. taxpayers can expect to get their vaccine. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (December 8): At least one hundred million COVID vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first hundred days. A hundred million shots in the first hundred days. (Begin VT) ANTHONY FAUCI (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): You know, the goal that's been set, which I believe is entirely achievable, is to have a hundred million people vaccinated in the first hundred days. TED KOPPEL (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): Both vaccines? ANTHONY FAUCI (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): Primary and boost, yes. TED KOPPEL (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): Primary and boost? ANTHONY FAUCI (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): And boost, yes. TED KOPPEL (CBS SUNDAY MORNING): In a hundred days? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. Yes. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Doctor, in that exchange you seem to be promising a bit more than the President is. Can you just bottom line it? How many people will be fully vaccinated within a hundred days? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah. Yes, so-- so let me clarify that, because there was a little bit of a misunderstanding. What we're talking about is a hundred million shots in individuals. So, a shots-- as in other words, when you get down to, let's say, a certain part of the hundred days. At the end of a hundred days, you're going to have some people who will have gotten both shots and some will still be on their first shots. What the President is saying a hundred million shots in the arms of people within a hundred days. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, reportedly the trans-- transition team projections are that, that's more like sixty-seven million people by April, by the end-- ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: of a hundred days. ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that an accurate number? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah. Right. If-- yeah. Yeah, that is-- well, I-- I haven't done the math myself-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. ANTHONY FAUCI: --but it sounds very much like the accurate number where you're having people who will have gotten two doses and then some that are still on their first dose. When you add them all up and you look at shots, it's a hundred million shots in the arms of people within the first hundred days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So, the Trump administration's Health and Human Services secretary said on this program in December that just with Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine, they could get to a hundred million shots by the end of February. President Biden's goal puts that benchmark out in April. Are you deliberately setting expectations low? ANTHONY FAUCI: No. No, that's not the case, if you go back and look at the facts of actually what had been done in the first like thirty-eight days I believe that in the former administration, I think maybe two out of those days had reached a hundred million. And the average along that period of time was about four hundred and fifty thousand per day. This is hard. Now what we've got to realize that although more recently there have been a couple of days where you've had a million, that has been predominantly in areas that are relatively easy from the standpoint of getting that done in a nursing home or in a situation in a hospital setting. If you look forward with the challenges that we'll be having getting it out into the community, that is not easily accessible, getting it to people that are not uniform in the sense-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY FAUCI: --of being health care providers or people in nursing homes, I still think that that challenge is really, first of all, it's going to be a floor-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ANTHONY FAUCI: --not a ceiling. It's-- it's not going to be easy to do that. I think there is this misperception out there, Margaret, because we've hit one million a day for a couple of days that when we get out into the community, it's going to be really easy to do that. That's not the case. It is going to be a challenge. I think it was a reasonable goal that was set. We always want to do better than the goal you've set -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ANTHONY FAUCI: --but it is really a floor and not a ceiling. The most important thing, the message that gets lost in this -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANTHONY FAUCI: --back and forth, Margaret, is that we've got to vaccinate as many people as we possibly can as quickly as we possibly can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. ANTHONY FAUCI: And that's what President Biden made as the point. I mean that was the -- MARGARET BRENNAN: I want -- ANTHONY FAUCI: --major point that he was making. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. And-- and we just want to help clarify that. I want to ask you, as you know, we spoke to your former colleague, Doctor Birx, on Friday for this program. She laid out problems that, yes, we're attached to President Trump, but go far beyond that, deep problems within that health care infrastructure of this country that will contribute to continued problems. Do you think there needs to be a 9/11-type commission to look at what went wrong? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I'm not you know, Margaret, it's not up to me to say that. I think we really do. I mean, whether you want to call it a 9/11 commission, but we really need to look into some of the deficiencies in our health care systems at the local level. One of the things that I believe I had mentioned to you in a previous appearance here, Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY FAUCI: --that I felt we should do much better is a greater collaboration and coordination-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. ANTHONY FAUCI: --between the federal government and the local, the state. MARGARET BRENNAN Yes. ANTHONY FAUCI: We've got to do that in a coordinated way. Instead of just telling the states-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ANTHONY FAUCI: --you're on your own, do it on your own. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. ANTHONY FAUCI.: That clearly does not work very well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Fauci, thank you for joining us. We look forward to having you again. Up next, a candid interview with the former coordinator of President Trump's coronavirus task force. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Deborah Birx, the former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, is now at the CDC as a special adviser to the Center for Global Health. We sat down with her Friday. She had wanted to wait until after President Biden had taken office to talk about her time in the Trump administration. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden coronavirus czar, for lack of a better term, told reporters, \"When it comes to the vaccine, what we're inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined.\" Is that a political statement? Is that accurate? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX, M.D. (Former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator/CDC Special Adviser to the Center for Global Health): You know I've been trying to process all the last eleven months because I-- it's really important that we understand what worked and what didn't work. I took extensive notes during the entire process because I didn't want to lose track of what we need to do to make our response better in the future. One of those critical areas is this idea of federalism on which the United States was built. But that can be taken to extremes. And so the mantra always was federally-supported and state-managed, locally executed. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the Trump plan? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: That was the mantra. But what does support mean? And what does federal support mean? And I think really an understanding of what states need to translate guidance into implementation, what state needs-- states need in interpreting data together. They only are seeing their data. But it's really important that they understand what's happening in their entire region because people have been mobile. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it's just bad architecture being handed off to the Biden administration? Are they being set up for failure? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Oh, I don't believe-- and I-- I-- if I thought that was true, I wouldn't be sleeping right now because what was very important to me is from even before the election is to make sure that people had access to data and the data that we were seeing. And I think the more people can understand where the virus is where it's increasing where it's decreasing and react to even the slightest uptick. And that's a place where we're still slow. MARGARET BRENNAN: Surveillance? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: We're still slow in reaction. You need to react when you first see that tiniest little uptick in test positivity. That's the moment to tell that population, we need you to do these things. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were often at odds with the CDC, is what I've been told. Is that true? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I know the CDC well, so it was diff-- let me just be very clear, it was more difficult for them because I knew where the gaps were. And so when I came in, I really asked for those gaps to be addressed. I was also very pushy, and the one thing that's been taken completely out of context is when I was talking about not trusting the CDC data, it had to do with the ethnicity and race of the fatalities early on because of the delay in that reporting; our delay for death certificates that have all that information on can be up to thirty days. MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're at the end of February. CDC official gives a briefing to reporters that tanks the markets when she says that within the community there may be a virus spreading and it could cause severe disruption to daily life. Doctor Fauci goes on television a few days later and says the risk to Americans remains low. You're watching this and what are you thinking? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: So I'm in South Africa. We're yelling at the CNN TV-- television saying this is going to be a pandemic because the Chinese-- what I saw from China, when you overwhelm your hospitals, you have to know that you have broad-based community spread before that happens. Yet they weren't seeing it. And that really worried me because what we were looking for is people with symptoms. And so when people were coming into the country, we were looking for people with symptoms. MARGARET BRENNAN: But why wasn't it obvious to them, when you're watching this on TV and saying this is so clearly a pandemic that's coming to hit us hard? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I have learned from the things we've missed. This is exactly how we missed the HIV pandemic. If you're only looking for sick people, you miss a lot of the-- what is really happening under the surface. And so I was always worried that there was a big iceberg under the surface and we were just seeing the top of it. So, when we were questioning people who came into this country about symptoms rather than testing everybody who came into the country, that's when I started to get really worried. At the same time there was a single individual in the White House that had been calling me since January. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Matt Pottinger? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Deputy National Security Adviser? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Because I have-- I've known him and I've known his wife for a very long time. We've worked on pandemics together. Both of us were in Asia during SARS. And so we understood how serious this can go. MARGARET BRENNAN: Matt Pottinger asks you to come from the State Department to the White House. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: And I said no about twenty times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, from the outside, everything looks very chaotic in the White House. I had spent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Wasn't it? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --the first three years of this administration trying to stay out of the swirl, trying to protect the PEPFAR program. We had extraordinary cuts, obviously, every year. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is AIDS? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It's what's changed the trajectory of the pandemic around the world, both for HIV and TB. I had no interest in going into a political space. I'm not a political person. I'm a civil servant. It never occurred to me to go into the White House until I could see that we were missing pieces that I thought were very important in the response. And so after many weeks of saying, no, no, no, the President announced the new task force with the vice president in the lead. They said this would be very technical, and that I would have a very technical position. And because I thought that I could be helpful, which is the only reason I go and do anything. If I think I have something to add, I feel like it's my obligation to the American public to go in and do that. That's what a civil servant is supposed to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a colonel in the Army? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: An immunologist. You were appointed by President Obama to work on AIDS relief, as you mentioned, at the State Department. Yet, your name in the history books is going to be associated with President Donald Trump. How does that sit with you? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, you know, this is what worries me. If we start looking at technical civil servants as belonging to a political party, we will lose the ability for highly qualified civil servants to come and help. If we start saying if you come in and do this, you are then going to be part of the political apparatus, that is going to be very dangerous for this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like your work is misunderstood as political? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think pandemics are always political. That's what, I mean, I've worked in, you know, sixty countries. Every pandemic is political because you have to make policy changes to confront them, and policies are often political. MARGARET BRENNAN: You worked on AIDS, which is a highly politicized virus-- AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in sub-Saharan Africa. But did any of that prepare you for the politics you encountered here with this pandemic in this White House? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: No. No. White Houses function in a pretty-- a pretty bureaucratic way, and most of the agencies function in a very predictable and bureaucratic way. But when you remove the infrastructure of the civil servants, then you end up with a lot more very quick right turns, left turns, right turns, left turns, and that-- that becomes less predictable and less able to manage that kind of response and change. And so that's why I kept extensive notes from every meeting, daily reflections to really understand what I was seeing. I wrote a daily report, over three hundred and ten of them that went to senior leaders. We created-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did President Trump read them? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I don't know. I don't know. I sent them up through to the vice president. I had very little exposure to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you did brief President Trump? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I had very little exposure to President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think President Trump appreciated the gravity of the health crisis you were describing? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think the President appreciated the gravity in March. It took a while after I arrived in the White House to remove all of the ancillary data that was coming in. I mean there was parallel data stream coming into the White House that were not transparently utilized. And I needed to stop that where people were-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean outside advisers? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Outside advisers, coming to inside advisers. And to this day, I mean, until the day I left, I am convinced there were parallel data streams because I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Disinformation? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I saw the President presenting graphs that I never made. So, I know that someone-- or someone out there or someone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the President. I know what I sent up and I know that what was in his hands was different from that. You can't do that. You have to use the entire database -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was doing that? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: To this day I don't know. I know now by watching some of the tapes that certainly Scott Atlas brought in parallel data streams. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the chief of staff is not saying, wait a second, this is our official coordinator, listen to her and her only? Listen to you? No one was saying that? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: No one said that to me. MARGARET BRENNAN: To the President? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I-- I don't know if they were saying it to the President. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got a lot more of our interview coming, so don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more from Doctor Deborah Birx. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with Doctor Birx. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the President was just distracted by the political implications and the campaign? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: You know, I always wonder that, and, I mean, the worst possible time you can have a pandemic is in a presidential election year. I think the White House personnel were very focused on this pandemic in March and April. I think once the country began to open and it was clear to me that they weren't going to follow my really gated criteria that I had worked hard on. MARGARET BRENNAN: How to open restaurants, how to let people dine indoors -- AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I combined all of that together for these great gating criteria. So in calculating everything with the slow reopening, I didn't think anyone could get to Phase 3 until August. And you can see in the states that followed either that criteria or a similar criteria, that's how long it took them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Were there COVID deniers in the White House? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: There are people in the White House and I think people around this country, because I've had the privilege to meet them and listen to them and hear them, because I wanted to hear what people were saying. There were people who definitely believed that this was a hoax. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think because the information was confusing at the beginning. I think because we didn't talk about the spectrum of disease, because everyone interpreted on what they knew. And so they saw people get COVID and be fine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't blame the President's own language of calling some of this politically motivated, a hoax? It was a phrase he used at one point. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: When you have a pandemic where you're relying on every American to change their behavior communication is absolutely key. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: And so every time a-- a statement was made by a political leader that wasn't consistent with public health needs that derailed our response. It is also why I went out on the road because I wasn't censored on the road. MARGARET BRENNAN: You felt the White House was censoring you? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, if you've noticed, I was not able to do national press. The other thing that was very important to me is I was not going to go outside of the chain of command. And so if our White House comms group did not put me out, I didn't ask to go out. I-- because there was so much leaking and so many parallel stories being leaked to the press that did not have grounding in truth that I didn't want to ever be part of that slippery slope. I know people started it with good intentions of trying to inform the American people, but then it became a way that they could silence those who didn't agree with them. And so I knew that every time I had a significant disagreement in the White House that within days a story would be planted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who was doing that? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think a lot of people were doing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the administration was suppressing vital information to win the election? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I don't know what their motivation was. I know that I was so frustrated-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --that I realized that the only way, if I could not get a voice internally, that I could get a voice out at the state level because I could see the governors on the governor's call weekly and I could see how deeply they were concerned about every one of their citizens. Most of them were not in the middle of an election campaign. I want to make it clear this was just not Debbie Birx. There was a coalition of-- of four of us at the beginning, from Steve Hahn to Bob Redfield to myself to Tony Fauci. We would make sure that we could get the information out to the public in one way or the other. It's why I sent the information to all of them every morning-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --because I never knew who would have the ability to do press. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever consider quitting? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Always. I mean why would you want to put yourself through that, every day? Colleagues of mine that I had known for decades-- decades in that one experience because I was in the White House decided that I had become this political person, even though they had known me forever. I had to ask myself every morning, is there something that I think I can do that would be helpful in responding to this pandemic? And it's something I asked myself every night. And when it became a point where I could-- I wasn't getting anywhere and that was like right before the election, I wrote a very detailed communication plan of what needed to happen the day after the election and how that needed to be executed. And there was a lot of promise that that would happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you knew at that point that the election was a factor in communication about the virus? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever withhold information yourself? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Some people felt you became an apologist for President Trump. They look at that moment in the briefing room. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (April 23, 2020): Then I see the disinfectant which knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or-- or almost a cleaning? MARGARET BRENNAN: You were sitting there and he looked at you and he asked about ultraviolet light and heat-- AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: See, that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and you-- and you start talking about fevers. You didn't say no. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: No. See, this is the-- no. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (April 23, 2020): Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX (April 23, 2020): Not as a treatment. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: He was not speaking to me. He was speaking to the DHS scientist that was two seats over from me-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --that entire time. When he finally turned to me and said, is it a treat-- could this be a treatment, I said, not a treatment. You can look at the transcripts. Not a treatment. But that moment was-- that was completely lost. And then there's, you know, skits on Saturday Night Live. HEIDI GARDNER (SNL/Broadway Video): We all mess up sometimes. You threw the ball wrong. I didn't say, don't drink the bleach. It happens. KATE MCKINNON (SNL/Broadway Video): Right. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: When you're a scientist who's grounded themselves in data and combating epidemics and working with communities and working with governments to change the future of people's lives for the better and then you get-- this is what-- when you talked about, was I prepared for that? No, I wasn't prepared for that. I didn't even know what to do in that moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes people say, well, Tony Fauci, when that happened to-- to him, he would sort of gently come back up to the podium and set the record straight. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, he was given the opportunity to do that, though. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't feel-- you don't feel you were given the opportunity to respond? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Not until he turned to me and said, could this be a treatment? And I said, not a treatment. You know people then want to define you by the moment-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --and I understand-- I under-- look, I understand how perceptions go. I understood that to go into the White House and try to support a comprehensive coronavirus response by utilizing the strength of the federal government would be a terminal event for my federal career, which is part of the reason why I didn't want to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: A terminal event? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: A terminal event. I know that I wouldn't be allowed to really continue successfully within the federal government. You can't go into something that's that polarized and not believe that you won't be tainted by that experience or how people interpret you in that experience. So I knew that part of it. I didn't want that to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this will be the end of your federal career? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yeah. I will need to retire probably within the next four to six weeks from CDC. MARGARET BRENNAN: And how have you made peace with that, that this pandemic, that you're leaving in the midst of this, that you will be associated with it? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: What was reassuring to me all along is I knew this would be studied. I knew that the e-mails, the reports that I wrote, the request to expand testing, the \"how to improve\" therapeutics, all of that, all of that would eventually come to light. Maybe not in my lifetime. MARGARET BRENNAN: You feel you'll be vindicated? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I'm not looking to be vindicated. In that moment, I think my service was important. I think it was important to make progress in testing. I think it was important in making progress with some of the therapeutics. And I think it was important to really-- we had great innovation in vaccines. I was focused solely on the mission, and the mission was to try to save as many American lives during this pandemic as possible. And so I couldn't get distracted on vindicating myself or getting the information or telling the, you know, coming back to the press and saying that's not what happened. That would waste my energy in that moment of staying focused completely on that data-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --and ensuring that I was seeing everything that was going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: I read a Washington Post profile of you and it said, \"When she's working on a vital public health issue, Birx will do whatever is necessary as long as she thinks she can make a difference.\" AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: True. And it hurt my family. You know all of this-- I have two daughters in their thirties who had to live through this and watch their mother, these things said about their mother, to become a skit, I mean. I have two grandchildren, daughters. You know, I think, I felt the whole time that I also had to be serious to be taken seriously, and I couldn't ever let emotion come into this, that no matter how frustrated I got, no matter how beaten down I got, I had to keep pushing as hard as I could. This tested my resilience because it tested my family and the things that were said that were so untrue, all of that about Thanksgiving. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were accused of gathering with people outside your household because you went to a beach house with them? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: There was no one outside of my household. I have one household. We happen to live between two houses because I had to protect them from me when I was out on the road. When I came back I quarantined. But if I had an emergency at that house, I wore a mask the whole time because I had to protect that household at all cost. I have a ninety-two-year-old mother and a ninety-six-year-old father and a-- a daughter that's thirty-eight weeks pregnant. And so the implication that I wouldn't follow CDC guidance-- I followed CDC guidance and that's what protected me. I mean I was on the road for six and a half months. I was in the White House during the hot-- one of the hottest-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --hot spots of viral transmission and I remained negative because I followed the CDC guidelines. That's why I know they work and that's why I take it very seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this summer, you gave an interview. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX (August 2, 2020/Selbyville, Delaware): What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread. MARGARET BRENNAN: And then President Trump tweeted. He blasted you for saying that. Did you ever speak to him after that? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I hadn't seen him for months before that or months after that, but that was like-- that was a-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You were the coordinator of the COVID task force. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: That was an extraordinary moment because I also got yelled out by the speaker, who I have tremens-- I mean, obviously-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --women have gone through a lot to get in their positions. I have tremendous respect for women and women leadership. MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi said she didn't have confidence in you because you were working for President Trump. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (August 3, 2020/CNN): Because I don't have confidence in anyone who stands there while the President says, swallow Lysol, and it's going to cure your virus. You know it will kill you, and you won't have the virus anymore. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: And so that was very hard because I have known her from the HIV world, and I have tremendous respect for what she brought early on. So, in my mind, she's a political hero for what she has done in HIV, which, you know, I've spent a lifetime on, along with TB-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So that stung? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Oh, that was hard. But she's not the only one, I think she gave voice to what a lot of people were thinking of, how could you? I think they looked at going into the White House as somehow supporting a political party or a political individual. There are technical people that are brought in for their technical expertise. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you often were perceived as explaining some of the things President Trump said rather than correcting him. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, when people asked me a question I feel like I have to respond with what my perception of that moment was. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: When we come back, Doctor Birx talks about masks, or the lack thereof, in the White House. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to pick back up with Doctor Birx, talking about the moment last spring when she and the task force realized they had a serious problem. (Begin VT) AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Everyone knew that. Everyone knew that from, I would say, March-- March 8th on. Because you only had to look at the slopes of the curves in these major metropolitan cities to understand what was happening and understanding if you're seeing that rate of hospitalization, how much community spread there was. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were trying to get Americans just to wear masks. And the President himself was undermining you. He wasn't wearing one. Is there ever a way to make that scenario work? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Well, you have to, because that's the President. So you have to figure out how to get that message out when you can't get it out from the head of the country. And that's our job. You don't give up. You can't ever in any moment when American lives are at stake, say, well, this is just too hard. I'm giving up. MARGARET BRENNAN: But where's the vice president in all of this? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: The vice president knew what I was doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean he knew that you were telling the governors privately to do things that the President publicly was making light of. When he was saying you don't really need to wear a mask, or pushing to reopen the economy faster than your guidelines would allow, Mike Pence knew that? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: He knew what I was doing because-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And he supported it? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: --I don't-- I'm not a person who would go out on their own and not do, you know, I wouldn't go-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why-- why would you have to be sneaking around? You're the head of the COVID task force and tens of thousands of Americans are dying. Why is that a covert operation? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Because if this isn't working and you're not going to get that to work, you have to find another solution. MARGARET BRENNAN: Leaving it up to the states, is that the way it should be in a pandemic, is the fundamental question? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me about some of the resistance from governors because you're going out there and you're telling them to wear a mask, to limit indoor dining. And for some of these Republican governors, that would mean going against the head of their party to do what you're telling them to do. AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: You know, I don't know if that was as much as the dynamic as they were dealing with Republican legislatures and legislators. You needed every single level of government then to work together to ensure that, again, we're talking about behavioral change of American citizens. MARGARET BRENNAN: How much responsibility lies on the shoulders of the governors running these states? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: A lot. A lot. We have to be consistent. Sturgis was not okay. Birthday parties, not okay. Bringing together family members indoors, maskless, none of this. We have to be very clear to the community. And, yes, we're going to make mistakes. We all make mistakes, we're human. If you made a mistake, if you had a gathering, at least get tested, wear a mask around those vulnerable, assume you got exposed and are infected and wear a mask around those vulnerable. MARGARET BRENNAN: But how did the task force allow the President, who calls himself a germaphobe, to get COVID himself? How did that happen? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: There were only two people who regularly wore a mask in the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Two people? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Myself and Tyler Ann McGuffee, the support person that I had from HHS. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the staff around the President was not wearing a mask? He's the commander in chief. This is a national security risk. How is that possible? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think people believed wrongly that testing-- testing would be adequate. MARGARET BRENNAN: So how is that possible? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I think they believe that testing is a surrogate for a public health intervention. MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you say-- the President of the United States needs to wear a mask. Did you press Mike Pence on that? Did you press Mark Meadows, his chief of staff? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: There are multiple communications about masking. Remember when I was talking about the stream of data coming in? They were mixing data that didn't have anything to do with the relevance of masking as a public health measure to changing into masking as a personal protective measure. MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you ever say you're misunderstanding this? You need to wear a mask. These are close quarters and you're way too close to the President of the United States? You're nodding, yes, you had that argument? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Not with the President. I mean I-- I didn't have that kind of access, but to certainly people around the President. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they just didn't take it seriously? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I just want to make it clear people were concerned about the President and wanted to protect the President. They believe that testing would be a reasonable substitution for people masking. MARGARET BRENNAN: How sick did the President actually get? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I don't know. I don't know. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did anyone ever say this is a national security risk and we need to nail down who brought this in and who infected the commander in chief?  AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I never heard those conversations. MARGARET BRENNAN: There was no serious contact tracing that happened after the fact?  AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I don't know if there was contact tracing or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: What was your biggest mistake? AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: I always feel like I could have done more, been more outspoken, maybe been more outspoken publicly-- publicly. I didn't know all the consequences of all of these issues. When you're put into a new situation and you only know one person in the White House, you know, and you don't understand the culture of the White House, it's very difficult to get your footing. I'm not making excuses. I'm just saying I didn't know how far I could push the envelope. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wish you pushed harder?  AMBASSADOR DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We spent nearly ninety minutes talking to Doctor Birx. We'd been tested, and we were seated ten feet apart in a well-ventilated facility. An extended version is available through our digital network, and in a special edition of our new podcast, Facing Forward. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to check in with senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer in London. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. Here's a sobering statistic: Although the number of infections is at last coming down here, England now has the worst per capita coronavirus death rate in the world. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: Gravediggers in North London were hard at work this week, making more room. Hospitals are full of people sick with the so-called U.K. mutation, which new data suggests does kill more people. Stark public warnings like this one reinforce the national lockdown. MAN: Look them in the eyes and tell them you're doing all you can to stop the spread of COVID-19. ELIZABETH PALMER: But there is good news here, too. Britain's vaccine rollout is the third fastest in the world, about to hit the six million mark. Europe by contrast is having a rough time. Vaccinations there got off to a slow start, and now supplies are running low, thanks to manufacturing problems. So lockdowns in some places are getting stricter. The Netherlands has imposed a curfew for the first time since the Second World War, though dog walkers are exempt. The fastest vaccine rollout is in Israel. It started with the elderly, but now even teenagers are getting their COVID shots. (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: And, finally, there was huge international relief this week when the U.S. rejoined the World Health Organization, where it will add real muscle to the efforts to get vaccine to the developing world. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be talking to Doctor Scott Gottlieb later today. You can see it on our website or listen through our Facing Forward podcast. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former White House counsel Don McGahn is expected to answer questions from the House Judiciary Committee behind closed doors \"as soon as possible\" after Democrats on the panel and the Justice Department reached an agreement this week in a long-running dispute over enforcement of a subpoena for his testimony. Lawyers for the Justice Department, who are representing McGahn, and House Democrats on Wednesday requested the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia postpone oral arguments in the case, set for May 19, because the two sides reached \"an agreement on an accommodation.\" Under the agreement, the Judiciary Committee will conduct a transcribed interview with McGahn, resolving the years-long dispute over the subpoena for his testimony. The interview will be limited to information from McGahn, who worked in the Trump White House, in the publicly available parts of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 The former White House counsel voluntarily met with Mueller's investigators about his interactions with former President Donald Trump and was cited extensively in the special counsel's report, including about possible instances of obstruction of justice by the former president during the FBI's investigation. The agreement, filed with the D.C. Circuit, notes that McGahn's communications with other executive branch officials not disclosed in the public portions of Mueller's report are outside the scope of his interview with the Judiciary Committee. However, executive privilege cannot be asserted with regard to the information McGahn provided to Mueller and attributed to him in the public report. The Justice Department and House Democrats notified the court in a filing Tuesday that the two sides reached an agreement and noted that \"former President Trump, who is not a party to this case, is not a party to the agreement in principle regarding an accommodation.\"\u00a0 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, said he is pleased a deal with the Justice Department could be reached that satisfies the subpoenas and protects the committee's duty to conduct oversight. \"When the former president vowed to fight 'all of the subpoenas' aimed at his administration, he began a dangerous campaign of unprecedented obstruction,\" Nadler said in statement. \"We begin to bring that era of obstruction to an end today.\" The Judiciary Committee said it will provide additional information about McGahn's interview when available. The separation-of-powers dispute between Democrats on the Judiciary panel and the Trump administration began in April 2019, when the committee approved its subpoena for testimony from McGahn after Mueller issued his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller and his team identified 10 instances in which Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice during the FBI's probe, but they did not make a determination on whether the former president did so.\u00a0 The Trump White House blocked McGahn from complying with Democrats' subpoena, arguing he was \"absolutely immune\" from testifying. The Judiciary Committee went to court in August 2019 to enforce the subpoena, but a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit last year ordered the case to be tossed out on technical grounds and said it didn't have the authority to enforce congressional subpoenas. Democrats then asked the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, and the court was scheduled to hear arguments May 19. Once McGahn's interview with the Judiciary Committee is complete, the Justice Department and House Democrats agreed to ask the D.C. Circuit to dismiss their case and request the court to toss out the earlier opinion from the three-judge panel in favor of McGahn.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Mark Meadows, who served as White House chief of staff to former President Donald Trump, did not appear for a scheduled deposition Wednesday before the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, one day after he said Tuesday he would no longer cooperate with the committee.\u00a0 Congressman Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, told Meadows' lawyer in a letter dated Tuesday that a failure to appear would mean the committee is \"left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution.\" Thompson said that the documents Meadows turned over when he was partially cooperating included an email discussing the appointment of alternate electors in some states and a Powerpoint entitled, \"Election Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for JAN 6.\" Thompson wrote that the committee also received a text exchange apparently encouraging a member of Congress to try to appoint alternate electors in some states.\u00a0 Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, told Thompson in a letter earlier Tuesday that Meadows assumed a responsibility to protect executive privilege before and after his tenure, and \"his appreciation for our constitutional system and for the separation of powers dictates that he cannot voluntarily appear under these circumstances.\"\u00a0 CNN first reported that Meadows wouldn't work with the panel on Tuesday. Meadows confirmed his stance in an interview with the streaming news network Real America's Voice, saying the committee intended to ask about items that he considers protected by executive privilege, despite his efforts to reach an accommodation to share non-privileged information. \"In addition we found that in spite of our cooperation in sharing documents with them, they had issued, unbeknownst to us and without even a courtesy call, issued a subpoena to a third-party carrier trying to get information,\" Meadows said. \"At this point, we feel like it's best that we just continue to honor the executive privilege and it looks like the courts are going to have to weigh in on this.\" Thompson and Congresswoman Liz Cheney, its Republican vice chair, said in a statement that Meadows informed the committee he does not intend to cooperate with their probe further.\u00a0 The two committee leaders said investigators still have \"numerous questions\" for Meadows about documents he gave the committee, including real-time communications with numerous individuals as the events January 6 took place. Meadows' decision comes one week after Thompson said the former congressman was\u00a0engaging with the committee and had turned over reams of documents. Thompson said last week Meadows was expected to appear for an initial deposition \"soon.\" Terwilliger, Meadows' attorney, at the time said he and his client were working with the select committee and staff to reach an accommodation that did not require Meadows to waive executive privilege. The full House has already voted to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a subpoena for testimony and records. A federal grand jury then indicted Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress. He pleaded not guilty, and federal prosecutors are pushing for a trial to take place by mid-April. The January 6 panel last week also voted to recommend Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official, be held in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for records and testimony. Thompson, though, said the committee reached an agreement with Clark's attorney to allow him to appear at a deposition Saturday, during which he was expected to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The deposition was postponed to December 16, the committee said, because Clark has a medical condition that precluded his participation. An investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed Clark and Trump communicated in the run-up to January 6, and Clark raised doubts about the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. He also pushed claims about election irregularities in Georgia and suggested the Georgia legislature consider appointing a new slate of presidential electors. The January 6 select committee has publicly acknowledged issuing subpoenas to 45 individuals and groups it believes have knowledge about the events surrounding the attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which a mob of Trump's supporters attempted to stop Congress from tallying each state's electoral votes. Meadows was in the earliest group of former White House aides and allies of the former president to receive a subpoena from the House panel, which wants documents and testimony. In a September letter asking Meadows to turn over information, Thompson said he has \"critical information regarding elements\" of the committee's investigation, as he was with Trump on January 6 and communicated with him and others about events at the Capitol. Documents filed with the committee, as well as records made public as part of separate probes from the House and Senate, also show Meadows communicated with top officials at the Justice Department about allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and pushed for states to investigate fraud claims.

The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed Wednesday asks a federal court in Washington, D.C. to nullify subpoenas issued by the committee for Meadows' testimony and his phone records, which are held by Verizon. Meadows, who was former President Donald Trump's chief of staff, is arguing that the demand for his cooperation with Congress is \"overly broad and unduly burdensome.\"\u00a0 The lawsuit comes on the heels of Meadows' refusal to appear for a scheduled deposition Wednesday before the committee Pelosi has tasked with investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, an apparent preemptive strategy to potentially delay contempt proceedings.\u00a0 Meadows informed the committee Tuesday that he would no longer cooperate with its investigation, as he faced the threat of criminal contempt of Congress charges if he didn't appear for his deposition. In the court filing, Meadows argues the committee's demands, \"absent any valid legislative power,\" may result in \"grave harms\" \u2014 namely that he could be \"illegally coerced into violating the Constitution\" in failing to comply with former President Trump's claims of executive privilege.\u00a0 The former president has called on the dozens of former staffers called to testify before the Committee to exert executive privilege and refuse to cooperate, based on the idea that presidential communications should remain confidential.\u00a0 \"Mr. Meadows, a witness, has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims that are of constitutional origin and dimension and having to either risk enforcement of the subpoena issued to him\" the complaint reads, \"or, alternatively, unilaterally abandoning the former president's claims of privileges and immunities.\" The former White House chief of staff claims he has worked in \"good faith\" since receiving the select committee's subpoena in September. \"Despite the need to maintain executive privilege and concerns about the breadth of the subpoena, Mr. Meadows continued to pursue the possibility of an accommodation that would allow the Select Committee to obtain non-privileged information,\" the lawsuit alleges.\u00a0 Meadows pointed out that he had handed over thousands of records to the committee, including \"1,139 documents and 6,836 total pages\" \u2014 all non-privileged \u2014 and \"2,319 text messages and metadata from his personal cell phone.\"\u00a0 Nevertheless, Congressman Bennie Thompson, the Committee's chairman, told Meadows' lawyer in a letter dated Tuesday that a failure to appear Wednesday's deposition would mean the committee is \"left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution.\" Meadows' lawsuit, however, questioned Thompson's power to issue subpoenas. The subpoenas at issue, Meadows contends, are \"an unconstitutional attempt to usurp the Executive Branch's authority to enforce the law and to expose what the Select Committee believes to be problematic actions by a political opponent. Congress has no authority to issue subpoenas for these purposes.\" As for the committee's subpoena of records held by Verizon, the \"subscriber information and cell phone data associated with Mr. Meadows's personal cell phone number,\" Meadows argues the committee's demand for this material \"violates his right to free association and chills the exercise of free speech rights.\" The January 6 select committee has issued subpoenas to 45 individuals and groups it believes have knowledge about the events surrounding the attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which a mob of Trump's supporters attempted to stop Congress from affirming the tally of each state's electoral votes. Meadows was in the earliest group of former White House aides and allies of the former president to receive a subpoena from the House panel, which has asked for documents and testimony. In a September letter asking Meadows to turn over information, Thompson said Meadows has \"critical information regarding elements\" of the committee's investigation because he was with Trump on January 6 and communicated with him and others about events at the Capitol.\u00a0 Documents filed with the committee, as well as records made public as part of separate probes by the House and Senate, also show Meadows communicated with top officials at the Justice Department about allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and pushed for states to investigate fraud claims.\u00a0 Ellis Kim and Zachary Hudak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Trump on Monday filed a civil lawsuit against the House January 6 committee in an effort to block the release of documents related to his actions on that day.\u00a0 In the filing, Mr. Trump referred to the committee's investigation as an \"illegal fishing expedition.\"\u00a0 President Biden last week rejected Mr. Trump's assertion of executive privilege for the documents requested by the committee, and the White House said it would give the panel access to federal records connected to the Trump White House and the January 6 insurrection.\u00a0 \"The former President's clear objective is to stop the Select Committee from getting to the facts about January 6th and his lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct our probe. Precedent and law are on our side,\" Representatives Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson, who chair the January 6 committee, said in a statement Monday night. \"The Select Committee's authority to seek these records is clear,\" the statement continued. \"We'll fight the former President's attempt to obstruct our investigation while we continue to push ahead successfully with our probe on a number of other fronts.\" The lawsuit comes on the eve of the committee's voting on whether to hold Mr. Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in criminal contempt for defying a subpoena to appear. On Monday night, the committee released the resolution asking for Bannon to be held in criminal contempt, saying documents and testimony for Bannon are \"critical to the select committee's investigation.\"   If the committee votes in favor of holding Bannon in criminal contempt, the whole House will vote on it. If a majority of the House votes to do so, it will send a criminal contempt referral to the U.S. attorney.\u00a0 \u00a0 The resolution also said the reason Bannon's lawyer has given for his failure to comply with the committee's subpoena \u2014  executive privilege \u2014\u00a0 would not apply here and has not even been invoked via communication with the select committee.\u00a0  Mr. Trump's lawsuit names the committee chair Bennie Thompson, the entire committee, the National Archives   and David Ferriero, the director of the National Archives. The suit accuses the committee of sending an \"an illegal, unfounded, and overbroad records request\" to the National Archivist, and says the records are protected by \"numerous legal privileges.\" The lawsuit cites several of the requests of the committee, including its request for \"all documents and communications related to prepared public remarks and actual public remarks of Donald Trump\" between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021.\u00a0 \"Issued public statements are one thing, but the notion that Congress is somehow entitled to ask for and review any and all private conversations, remarks, or drafts of public statements considered by the President of the United States and his close advisors, without limitations on (among other things) subject matter, would destroy the very fabric of our constitutional separation of powers and invade fundamental privileges designed to maintain the autonomy and functioning of the Executive Branch,\" the lawsuit says. The lawsuit also takes issue with the request for for \"[a]ll documents and communications within the White House on January 6, 2021 relating in any way to\" the president, the vice president, over two dozen of the highest-ranking officials in the federal government and members of Congress. The lawsuit alleges the committee is \"no way entitled\" to these records.\u00a0 On January 6, Mr. Trump spoke at Stop the Steal rally ahead of Congress' convening to count the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Mr. Trump encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol to protest the results of the election.\u00a0 Chaos erupted at the Capitol a few hours later as thousands of Mr. Trump's supporters descended on the Capitol, breaking windows and ransacking the building. Lawmakers, including former Vice President Mike Pence, fled the floor amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the\u00a0arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump was\u00a0impeached by the House\u00a0one week later for inciting the riot but was later\u00a0acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to \"establish the truth\" of what happened that day. Despite the initial attempts to make it a bipartisan committee, Representatives Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, two of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump, are the only two Republicans on the nine-person committee. In addition to Bannon, the committee has subpoenaed the organizers of the Stop the Steal rally, as well as former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, communications director Dan Scavino and Pentagon chief of staff Kashyap Patel.\u00a0 Robert Legare and Zak Hudak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Tuesday that former President Donald Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows\u00a0has been engaging with the committee and has produced records.  In a statement, Thompson said Meadows has been working with the committee \"through an attorney,\" and has \"produced records to the committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition.\" He said the committee expected all witnesses, including Meadows, to provide all the information the panel has requested and is entitled to receive. \"The committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition,\" Thompson said.\u00a0 It's unclear how far Meadows' initial cooperation with the committee will go. On Tuesday, Thompson told reporters the former congressman had turned over around 6,000 emails. He said the committee has taken the threat of recommending Meadows in contempt of Congress \"off the table for the time being.\" George Terwilliger, Meadows' attorney, said in a statement to CBS News that he and his client are working with the January 6 panel and staff to see if they can \"reach an accommodation that does not require Mr. Meadows to waive Executive Privilege or to forfeit the long-standing position that senior White House aides cannot be compelled to testify before Congress. \u00a0 \"We appreciate the Select Committee's openness to receiving voluntary responses on non-privileged topics,\" he said. Earlier this month, the committee threatened to seek a contempt referral for Meadows if he did not work with them. Meadows failed to appear for a deposition on November 12, escalating the standoff between the two sides. The committee has already recommended that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon be held in contempt after he refused to appear. The full House of Representatives\u00a0voted in October to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress\u00a0after the committee's recommendation.\u00a0Bannon was then indicted\u00a0by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress.\u00a0 The committee\u00a0will meet on Wednesday\u00a0\u00a0 to discuss a contempt recommendation for former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who Thompson said has continued to resist his subpoena.. The meeting comes as the committee interviews more witnesses on Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was pressured by Mr. Trump to change his state's election results, told CBS News on Tuesday that he had spoken with the January 6 committee. Raffensperger said the committee had reached out to him. \"My conversation with the president was out there,\" Raffensperger said about his conversation with the committee. \"And so I wrote a book about that \u2014  \u00a0'Integrity Counts.' We just talked about the 2020 election, post-election issues.\" Among the Trump associates and allies subpoenaed by the committee are Stephen Miller, Kayleigh McEnany and Dan Scavino. Meadows was among the first tranche of White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump to receive a subpoena from the select committee. The panel is seeking both documents and testimony from the former North Carolina congressman related to his involvement in events surrounding the January 6 assault on the Capitol. In a letter sent in late September seeking information from Meadows, Thompson said that as the former president's chief of staff, Meadows has \"critical information regarding elements\" of the select committee's inquiry.\u00a0 In addition to being with Mr. Trump on January 6 and communicating with him and others regarding events at the Capitol, Thompson cited reporting by ProPublica that Meadows was engaged in elements of the planning and efforts to delay the counting of electoral votes by Congress during the joint session on January 6.\u00a0 Meadows also communicated with top officials at the Justice Department about alleged voter fraud in several key states and pushed for states to investigate fraud claims, according to documents filed with the committee and made public as part of separate House and Senate investigations. Since the formation of the select committee earlier this year, the panel has issued 45 subpoenas to a wide range of individuals who may have knowledge about the events surrounding the January 6 assault. In addition to former White House and Trump campaign aides and staff, the committee is seeking information from organizers of the rally held outside the White House on January 6 and far-right extremist groups who are linked to violence at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is involved in his own legal battle with the committee in an effort to stop the National Archives from turning over reams of White House documents related to the January 6 assault. The former president sued the committee in October after President Biden rejected his claim of executive privilege for documents requested by the panel from the National Archives. Mr. Trump lost an initial bid to shield the records before a federal district court, but appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeals court temporarily blocked the release of the records while litigation continues, and a three-judge panel on Tuesday held oral arguments in the dispute. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the January 6 committee earlier this year to investigate the attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot, but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol unanimously voted Wednesday to recommend former Trump administration official Jeffrey Clark be held in contempt of Congress for defying his subpoena. But the vote by the nine-member panel came after Chairman Bennie Thompson revealed the panel reached an agreement with Clark's attorney to allow Clark to appear at a previously unscheduled deposition on Saturday. Clark is expected to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Thompson said. \"We will not finalize this contempt process if Mr. Clark genuinely cures his failure to comply with the subpoena this Saturday,\" vice chair Liz Cheney said Wednesday evening. \"It is important to note, however, that Mr. Clark is not excused from testifying simply because President Trump is trying to hide behind inapplicable claims of executive privilege.\" The Rules Committee will likely take up the contempt resolution Thursday, but the full House doesn't plan to vote on it until after Clark's scheduled deposition this weekend, according to a spokesperson for the select committee. If a majority of the House votes in favor of the measure, Clark will become the second witness in the panel's inquiry to face the specter of criminal prosecution, following former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. The committee subpoenaed Clark for his records and testimony in September, saying it believed he used his position as a high-level Justice Department official to aid former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A Senate Judiciary committee report released in October said he was in contact with former President Trump in the days leading up to January 6, when Congress would conduct its formal count of the Electoral College. Clark at the time proposed sending a letter to officials in Georgia and other states to encourage them to delay certifying their results, according to the report. The Senate committee said he also urged Justice Department leaders to hold a press conference to announce the agency would investigate allegations of voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. Clark did not testify before that panel. The select committee has said Clark has so far refused to produce any documents or answer any substantive questions.\u00a0 Earlier this month, Clark's attorney, Harry MacDougald, sent a letter to the select committee, contending executive privilege issues prevented his client from complying. In a statement, Thompson slammed the argument, calling Clark's defiance \"unacceptable.\" \"It's astounding that someone who so recently held a position of public trust to uphold the Constitution would now hide behind vague claims of privilege by a former President, refuse to answer questions about an attack on our democracy, and continue an assault on the rule of law,\" Thompson said, adding, \"As prescribed by the House Rules, I have considered Mr. Clark's claim of privilege and rejected it.\" If the House votes to hold Clark in contempt, he could face criminal charges, and possibly jail time. In October, the House voted to hold Steven Bannon in contempt. A federal grand jury weeks later charged Bannon with two counts of contempt of Congress. Each count carries up to a year of jail time.\u00a0 But the legal case against Clark may prove less straight-forward than Bannon's. Though Bannon raised similar privilege issues to avoid testifying before the committee, he was not a federal official in the days leading up to the January 6 attack. Clark was. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, Democratic Representative Pete Aguilar of California argued Clark must nonetheless comply. \"Even executive privilege is a qualified privilege and it can be overcome with the demonstration of need,\" he said. \"Clearly, the need is protecting democracy.\" The committee has issued 45 subpoenas in its inquiry so far, spanning former Trump administration officials and allies, those involved in planning and organizing rallies on January 6, and right-wing groups. According to committee members, the vast majority of witnesses who have been subpoenaed have complied.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The January 6 House select committee's latest round of subpoenas reveals its desire to know more about a private company calling itself Stop the Steal sent, which was created after the 2020 election and helped plan a rally outside the Capitol that day. \"Over the course of that day, demonstrations escalated to violence and protesters became rioters,\" Congressman Bennie Thompson, the committee's chair, wrote in letters accompanying the subpoenas.\"The Select Committee needs to understand all the details about the events that came before the attack, including who was involved in planning and funding them.\" The panel sent a subpoena to Ali Abdul Akbar, also known as Ali Alexander, a Stop the Steal organizer who had found prominence online as a conspiracy theorist arguing the election had been stolen from former President Trump. On January 5, Alexander led crowds at Freedom Plaza in chants of \"victory or death.\"\u00a0 The committee also subpoenaed Nathan Martin, whom it also believes was involved in Stop the Steal. Martin's and Alexander's names appeared on permit applications for a \"One Nation Under God\" rally on the Capitol Grounds on January 6. The committee also sent a subpoena to George B. Coleman, the custodian of records for the limited liability corporation.\u00a0 In their permit applications, Alexander and Martin did not disclose any connection between their rally and the one at the Ellipse, where Mr. Trump encouraged supporters to march to the Capitol and embolden Republicans to \"take back our country\" and show their discontent with the affirmation of the electoral count,which showed Mr. Trump had lost to Joe Biden.. Alexander and Martin said they expected only about 50 people to attend, not the hundreds who marched from the first rally to the Capitol \"The rally on the Capitol grounds on January 6, like the rally near the White House that day, immediately preceded the violent attack on the seat of our democracy,\" Thompson wrote.\u00a0 The committee will likely issue more subpoenas after this batch, said Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, who sits on the panel. They have already compiled a trove of documents. \"We have received thousands and thousands of pages of documents, and there is more to come,\" Lofgren said. \"Not every person has yet responded, but we've had a tremendous response overall.\"\u00a0 The select committee has asked telecommunications companies to preserve data on several sitting members of Congress. Last week, it sent subpoenas to 11 organizers of rallies and events before the attack on the Capitol, including the one at the Ellipse. Last month, it sent subpoenas to four of Mr. Trump's closest former advisors and aides with a deadline of October 7 for a response.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's legal team sent a letter to those subpoenaed that emphasizes that some of the material requested is subject to executive privilege. The letter, reviewed by CBS News, encourages to \"where appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges\"; \"not produce any documents\" concerning \"official duties in response to the subpoena\" and \"not provide any testimony\" concerning official duties. \"Executive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of President Trump and his administration, but also on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our nation,\" said Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for Mr. Trump, in a statement. In an interview with CBS News, Lofgren said executive privilege doesn't apply to Mr. Trump or his former administration. \"If they are innocent individuals, they'll come forward,\" Lofgren said, \"Former President Trump is not the president. The executive privilege, if it exists, is for the president, not the former president.

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives voted Thursday to find former adviser to President Trump Steve Bannon in criminal contempt for defying a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was called to appear before the committee last week but failed to appear. The matter now lands at the Justice Department, which will weigh whether to prosecute the former White House chief strategist. Bannon's lawyer denied his absence was an act of \"defiance\" against the subpoena, and pointed to instructions from Mr. Trump's legal team stating that they were invoking \"executive and other privileges\" and directed Bannon \"not to produce documents or give testimony that might reveal information\" that the former president's lawyers are trying \"to legally protect,\" according to a letter to the committee from Bannon's attorney obtained by CBS News.\u00a0 Jonathan Shaub, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky law school, said the Justice Department has \"traditionally not prosecuted individuals who are relying on executive privilege for criminal contempt of Congress.\" But Shaub also described Bannon's claims of privilege in this case as \"weak.\"\u00a0 \"Executive privilege only applies to official duties - conversations the president has about his official duties as president, and it seems highly unlikely that Bannon was advising President Trump about those from what we know so far,\" Shaub said. Bannon had not been in the Trump administration for over three years since his firing in August 2017. Last week, President Biden denied his predecessor's attempt to assert executive privilege for the documents the committee requested as part of its review, and the White House said it would give the panel access to federal records connected to the Trump White House and the January 6 insurrection.\u00a0 On Monday, Mr. Trump's attorneys filed a lawsuit in federal court against the committee, its chair, the National Archives and its director, in an effort to stymie the release of documents. The matter now falls to the U.S. attorney in D.C., who will receive the criminal referral from Congress and will be tasked with deciding whether to bring charges. Congress is unable to impose any punishment on individuals who are not members. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday morning, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers that it would handle the Bannon case and other potential referrals from the House select committee as \"it always does in such circumstances.\" It will, he said, \"apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution.\"\u00a0 The referral to the Justice Department is one of two procedures adopted by Congress in 1857 as a way of penalizing reluctant witnesses. The other option would be \"inherent contempt,\" a largely dormant congressional power that would call on the sergeant-at-arms to detain Bannon. However, the Capitol campus does not have a jail cell. (The last time anyone was taken into custody in the Capitol was in 1889, when a Senate committee witness was arrested.)\u00a0 If the U.S. attorney in D.C. decides to bring charges against Bannon, he will face a misdemeanor charge. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and would face a maximum fine of $100,000.\u00a0 Should the Justice Department decline to bring charges, the committee can sue Bannon to try and compel his testimony. While that avenue would take more time, there are more recent examples, such as the House Judiciary Committee's 2019 lawsuit to compel former White House Counsel Don McGahn's testimony related to the Mueller Report. The years-long legal battle was not resolved until after the following election when the Justice Department and the committee reached a deal. Rob Legare contributed reporting. This story has been updated to correct the maximum financial penalty Bannon could face. It is $100,000. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The House January 6 select committee is preparing to advance a contempt of congress charge against a former Trump administration official, the panel announced Monday. The select committee investigating the deadly attack on the Capitol plans to meet Wednesday to vote on whether to recommend if the full House should hold Trump ally Jeffrey Clark, in contempt of Congress. He would be the second Trump ally to be found in contempt of congress for failing to comply with a subpoena from the panel. Clark, who ran the Environment and Natural Resources division of the Justice Department under former President Trump, attempted to use federal resources to delay the certification of 2020 election results, according to a report released in early October by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The January 6 select committee issued him a subpoena shortly after that report was released. Clark has refused to answer questions from the committee, claiming the information they sought was protected by executive privilege. \"It's astounding that someone who so recently held a position of public trust to uphold the Constitution would now hide behind vague claims of privilege by a former President, refuse to answer questions about an attack on our democracy, and continue an assault on the rule of law,\" the panel's chairman, Congressman Bennie Thompson, said in a statement earlier this month. The committee plans to hold a \"business meeting\" on Wednesday where its nine members will outline the case for holding Clark in contempt and vote on whether to advance it. The Democratic-controlled House will then likely pass the measure, referring the matter to the Justice Department for prosecution. The House voted in October to do so to former White House advisor Steve Bannon. Earlier this month, the Justice Department charged Bannon with two counts of contempt of Congress, each which could carry up to a year in prison. Clark is believed to be central to the efforts of the Trump administration to delay the certification of the election results and convince the public without evidence that President Biden had not legitimately won the election. Clark was in contact with Mr. Trump in the days leading up to January 6, according to the Senate Judiciary committee's report. The report found that as an assistant attorney general, Clark proposed urging state legislators in Georgia to delay the certification of the Senate election there. The committee also said he pleaded with Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, to hold a press conference and say \"there was corruption\" in the election despite no evidence there was. Clark is one of many Trump allies to be subpoenaed by the committee, including Stephen Miller, and Kayleigh McEnany, and the committee's leaders have hinted that more contempt charges could be in the pipeline for those who don't comply. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows refused to sit with the committee earlier this month. In a statement at the time, Thompson and Congresswoman Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, said Meadows was unwilling to answer even basic questions about January 6. \"Mr. Meadows's actions today\u2014choosing to defy the law\u2014will force the Select Committee to consider pursuing contempt or other proceedings to enforce the subpoena,\" Thompson and Cheney said in a statement at the time. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.

            "article_content": "Former President Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, did not appear for a Friday morning deposition with the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, daring the panel to invoke contempt proceedings against him. In a statement, Meadows's attorney, George Terwilliger, indicated Meadows would not testify, absent a court ruling to do so. In a statement, he described a \"sharp legal dispute\" that centered around whether Meadows, who was chief of staff on January 6, could be compelled to testify, and whether he could be forced to answer questions involving privileged communications. \"Legal disputes are appropriately resolved by courts. It would be irresponsible for Mr. Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues,\" Terwilliger said. The committee disagrees. On Friday, the panel's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, and vice chair, Representative Liz Cheney, released a statement accusing Meadows of \"choosing to defy the law\" and failing to answer \"even the most basic questions.\"\u00a0 Thompson warned Meadows and Terwilliger in a letter Thursday of the consequences of his absence and failure to cooperate with the panel.\u00a0 \"Such willful noncompliance,\" he wrote, could result in a criminal referral to the Justice Department, as well as civil action \"to enforce the subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows in his personal capacity.\"\u00a0 Thompson pointed out Meadows' failure so far to produce any documents sought by the committee. He had\u00a0 instructed the former North Carolina congressman to turn them over by Friday morning, including a log of any records he'd seek to shield from the committee with the basis for withholding them. It's unclear whether Meadows complied in any with that request, although Thompson and Cheney in their statement said that he had joined a very small number of witnesses \"who believe they are above the law and are defying a Select Committee subpoena outright.\" Meadows's no-show came the same day a federal grand jury indicted former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, stemming from his defiance of a subpoena from the committee. The House voted to hold Bannon in contempt in October, after he declined to be interviewed by the committee. Congressional Democrats believe the Justice Department's prosecution of Bannon could discourage other witnesses from refusing their subpoenas. The select committee is currently weighing whether to pursue a contempt finding against Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who the committee said last week failed to cooperate with investigators. The committee claims there's evidence Clark used his position at the Justice Department to try to aid the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\u00a0 The panel is particularly interested in Meadows' testimony and records because committee members believe he has information that's critical to many parts of its inquiry. Meadows was said to have been around former President Trump on January 6, and to have also communicated with state-level and Justice Department officials in Mr. Trump's quest to overturn the 2020 election results. Meadows was first subpoenaed by the committee in September. He was due to turn over records and sit for a deposition in October but was granted an extension. A committee aide at the time cited his engagement with the panel. But in recent weeks, some committee members acknowledged they're growing frustrated with Meadows.\u00a0 \"It's not a game of cat and mouse. This is not hide-and-go-seek,\" Representative Jaime Raskin told CBS News. \"The committee can be reasonable in terms of adjusting people's schedules and addressing serious concerns they have but at a certain point, I assume our patience will run thin.\"\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory.

            "article_content": "U.S. Capitol Police officers who were attacked and beaten during the Capitol riot filed a lawsuit Thursday against former President Trump, his allies and members of far-right extremist groups, accusing them of intentionally sending a violent mob on January 6 to disrupt the congressional certification of the election.  The suit in federal court in Washington alleges Mr. Trump \"worked with white supremacists, violent extremist groups, and campaign supporters to violate the Ku Klux Klan Act, and commit acts of domestic terrorism in an unlawful effort to stay in power.\"  The suit was filed on behalf of the seven officers by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. It names the former president, the Trump campaign, Trump ally Roger Stone and members of the extremist groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who were present at the Capitol and in Washington on January 6.  Two other similar cases have been filed in recent months by Democratic members of Congress. The suits allege the actions of Mr. Trump and his allies led to the violence siege of the Capitol that injured dozens of police officers, halted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's electoral victory and sent lawmakers running for their lives as rioters stormed into the seat of American democracy wielding bats, poles and other weapons. \u00a0A House committee has started in earnest to investigate what happened that day, sending out requests Wednesday for documents from intelligence, law enforcement and other government agencies. Their largest request so far was made to the National Archive for information on Mr. Trump and his former team.  The requested documents are just the beginning of what is expected to be lengthy, partisan and rancorous investigation into how the mob was able to infiltrate the Capitol and disrupt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory, inflicting the most serious assault on Congress in two centuries.   In a statement Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump accused the committee of violating \"long-standing legal principles of privilege.\"   \"Executive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my Administration and the Patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our Nation,\" Mr. Trump said.  Committee members are also considering asking telecommunications companies to preserve phone records of several people, including members of Congress, to try to determine who knew what about the unfolding riot and when they knew it. With chants of \"hang Mike Pence,\" the rioters sent the then-vice president and members of Congress running for their lives and did more than $1 million in damage, and wounded dozens of police officers.  The demands were made for White House records from the National Archives, along with material from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security and Interior, as well as the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  The committee so far has heard from police officers who were at the Capitol on January 6. In emotional testimony, those officers spoke of how afraid and frustrated they were by the failure of law enforcement leaders to foresee the potential for violence and understand the scope of planning by the Trump backers.   A Capitol Police officer who fatally shot protester Ashli Babbitt was cleared months ago of criminal wrongdoing and was cleared internally by the department this week, and was planning to reveal his identity in an NBC interview to air Thursday. \u00a0",

The committee told Meadows it was interested in talking to him because it has documents showing he had requested that the DOJ conduct election fraud investigations in several states and that he was in the vicinity of Mr. Trump on January 6.\u00a0 Patel was issued the subpoena because he was involved in discussions with senior Pentagon officials about Capitol security before and on January 6, according to defense department documents cited in the letter. Scavino is a focus of attention because of his proximity to the former president that day and his reported knowledge of the communications strategy of the president and his allies before and on January 6.\u00a0 The committee last month additionally asked for detailed information about the former president's whereabouts throughout that day.\u00a0 In a statement responding to news of the subpoenas, Mr. Trump called the committee \"highly partisan\" and pledged to \"fight the Subpoenas on Executive Privilege and other grounds, for the good of our Country.\" Congressman Adam Schiff, who sits on the select committee, told CBS News earlier this week that the panel was prepared to move directly to subpoenas for witnesses who don't comply with requests, breaking the precedent of giving potential witnesses weeks to comply before issuing them subpoenas.\u00a0 \"As we begin moving to interviews and depositions, we expect that some will be hostile with those requests and with some we may go directly to subpoenas,\" he said. \"Most are cooperating but not all.\" In a statement to CBS News, Patel wrote that he was \"disappointed, but not surprised, that the Committee tried to subpoena me through the press and violated longstanding protocol\u2014which I upheld as a congressional staffer\u2014by resorting to compulsory process before seeking my voluntary cooperation.\"\u00a0 \"I will continue to tell the truth to the American people about the events of January 6th,\" he said.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the House.",

I am humbled that you would entrust me with the honor of your vote and the privilege to serve you in Congress. A simple thank you doesn't fully encapsulate the depth of my gratitude.\" Letlow was endorsed by both former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Steve Scalise. Potential 2024 Republican candidate and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley also endorsed her.\u00a0 Her husband was on track to succeed Representative Ralph Abraham for the large northeastern Louisiana seat after he won the GOP runoff in early December 2020. He had previously worked as a campaign manager and chief of staff to Abraham. He died December 29, 2020 at 41 years old. In her campaign announcement, Letlow said she was \"running to continue the mission Luke started \u2014   to stand up for our Christian values, to fight for our rural agriculture communities, and to deliver real results to move our state forward.\" She has\u00a0signaled\u00a0that she would run to keep the seat in 2022. In Louisiana's 2nd District, CBS News projects that Democratic State Senators Troy Carter and Karen Carter Peterson are heading towards a runoff on April 24, after no candidate got a majority of the vote. The winner will succeed Democrat Cedric Richmond, who was appointed by President Biden as a White House senior adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement. Carter was endorsed by Richmond and has played up his connection to the White House adviser. House Majority Whip James Clyburn has also backed Carter. \"When you think of 535 members of Congress and they're all competing for resources, those who have better relationships are those who have a better shot at bringing resources home,\" Carter said after the runoff was set.\u00a0 Peterson was endorsed by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, women's group Emily's List and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC. She would be the first Black woman to represent Louisiana if elected.\u00a0 \"A substantial number of voters decided today that they want bold and courageous leadership, they don't want the status quo,\" Peterson said Saturday night. \u00a0 Both ran for this Congressional seat in 2006.

            "article_content": "House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment against President Trump on Monday for incitement of insurrection after last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol. The article of impeachment accuses the president of \"willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\" While Congress was gathering to count the Electoral College votes, the article says that Mr. Trump, addressing supporters nearby, \"willfully made statements that encouraged \u2014 and foreseeably resulted in \u2014 imminent lawless action at the\u00a0 Capitol.\"\u00a0 \"Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress and the Vice President, interfered with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results, and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts,\" the article says. As a result, he \"gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\" For this, the article says, Mr. Trump should be impeached, removed and disqualified from holding public office again.\u00a0 The House will vote on Tuesday on a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and the majority of the president's Cabinet to remove a president if he is deemed unfit for office. If Pence does not respond within 24 hours of the House passing this resolution, it will proceed with taking up the article of impeachment. This development comes the week after a mob of Trump supporters overran the Capitol on Wednesday in riots that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol policeman who was trying to help reestablish control at the Capitol complex. The bill has over 210 cosponsors, a sign of the broad support among House Democrats to take action in the wake of the violence at the Capitol. It was authored by Democratic Representatives Ted Lieu of California, and David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who began drafting it while sheltering in place Wednesday in the Capitol complex. Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin also helped write the article. The White House called the impeachment article \"politically motivated\" and repeated Mr. Trump's assertions in a video Thursday that he was calling for \"healing and unity.\"\u00a0 A House impeachment resolution would move to the floor and could get a vote quickly, because there would be no hearings to present evidence. The Judiciary Committee has not yet been constituted for the 117th Congress, so an impeachment resolution would go directly to the floor under what's known as a \"privileged resolution.\" A simple majority of members in the House is required for impeachment, so it seems likely to pass. However, this is where the proceedings could be an impediment to Mr. Biden: the impeachment article would then move to the Senate for consideration, monopolizing the calendar just ahead of Mr. Biden's inauguration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted last week that the earliest the Senate could consider any articles of impeachment would be January 19, the day before inauguration. Once the Senate receives articles of impeachment, it is required to consider them before acting on any other business \u2014 including confirming any nominees for the incoming president's Cabinet. Congressman Jim Clyburn has suggested that the House may choose to hold on to the article of impeachment during Mr. Biden's first 100 days so that his presidency is not derailed. Two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 67 senators \u2014 would be required to convict Mr. Trump. He is on track to be the first president in U.S. history to undergo impeachment proceedings twice. The House impeached Mr. Trump in December 2018 on charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, although he was acquitted by the Senate in early February 2019. Only one Republican senator, Mitt Romney, voted to remove Mr. Trump from office.\u00a0 Here is the article that has been introduced: Rebecca Kaplan covers the 2012 presidential campaign for CBS News and National Journal.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court wrestled Tuesday with the legality of two election rules from the battleground state of Arizona \u2014 one involving the return of absentee ballots and the other, out-of-precinct provisional ballots \u2014 in a case that could impose new limits on the landmark Voting Rights Act. Voting rights advocates fear that if the high court sides with Arizona Republicans, it could dismantle Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, one of the remaining enforcement mechanisms in the 1965 law, after striking another provision eight years ago.\u00a0 \"Some things that are really quite obvious burdens, which you just know looking at them is going to lead to real difficulty for some, for Black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters, and then other restrictions where you can say, well, you know, that's kind of an inconvenience, but they could overcome that inconvenience if they really wanted to,\" Justice Elena Kagan said. \"There's a spectrum of restrictions and a spectrum of the effects that those restrictions cause.\" At issue in the dispute are\u00a0two election rules\u00a0challenged by Democrats in 2016 as violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. The first, known as the \"out-of-precinct\" policy, discards provisional ballots cast by a voter in the wrong precinct. The other, a ban on so-called \"ballot harvesting,\" allows only a voter's family member or caregiver to return an absentee ballot and imposes criminal penalties on those who break the rule. Arguments stretched just under two hours in the legal battle, which presented an early test of voting rights before the Supreme Court's expanded 6-3 conservative majority.\u00a0 Much of the argument centered around the proper test for determining whether voting rules discriminate on the basis of race, in violation of Section 2. Michael Carvin, a lawyer representing the Arizona GOP, argued that the laws still provide voters with opportunities to cast ballots and are a measure to safeguard against potential fraud. \"The question is not the outcome. The question is the opportunity and if the state has provided everyone the same opportunity,\" Carvin said. \"Everyone has a complete opportunity to vote. The state has not erected any barrier.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor pushed back against that idea, saying there are Native American voters, as well as those in parts of the state where car-ownership rates are low or lack access to the postal system, who may need help returning a ballot or may inadvertently show up at the wrong precinct. \"If you just can't vote for those reasons and your vote is not being counted, you've been denied the right to vote, haven't you?\" Sotomayor asked. Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh noted the prevalence of the two policies nationwide, including in states that do not have a history of racial discrimination in voting. A commission spearheaded by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, for example, recommended in 2005 that so-called \"ballot harvesting,\" where party officials or candidates collect and return completed mail-in ballots, be eliminated because it is susceptible to fraud. And more than two dozen states have rules on the books that disqualify ballots cast in the wrong precinct. \"When a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in the favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent,\" Kavanaugh said. Later, he said that in examining the totality of circumstances, there must be \"good justification\" for the rules at issue. On the ballot-collection law, Kavanaugh said, \"you have the Carter-Baker recommendation. On the out-of-precinct, you have it being commonplace in other states. That on its face, at least to me, suggests a strong justification for doing these rules.\" Gorsuch, meanwhile, questioned whether Arizona would need to wait to enact policies that mirror what other states have implemented in order to prevent potential fraud. \"Does Arizona have to wait for fraud to occur in Arizona using a practice before it can outlaw it?\" he asked Jessica Amunson, who argued on behalf of Secretary of State Kate Hobbs, a Democrat. Amunson, however, noted the state has criminalized one neighbor assisting another with returning their ballot. \"I am saying that criminalizing non-fraudulent ballot collection simply does not get at the state's interest in preventing fraud,\" she said. Justice Samuel Alito expressed a concern that Hobbs and Democrats' positions would make \"every voting rule vulnerable to attack under Section 2.\"\u00a0 Bruce Spiva, a lawyer representing the Democratic National Committee, responded that challenges to laws have been denied when courts found there wasn't a disparate racial impact.\u00a0 \"The test used by the majority of circuits has not undermined a large swath of neutral voting restrictions,\" he later said. \"Rather, it has been used to carefully review and, where necessary, strike down discriminatory voting laws.\" Both rules at issue in the case remained in effect during the 2020 election, as the dispute was winding its way through the courts. President Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since 1996. A federal district judge initially rejected Democrats' claims of racial discrimination, saying they failed to demonstrate that the election procedures \"impose[d] meaningfully disparate burdens on minority voters as compared to non-minority voters.\"\u00a0 A panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling, but last year the full court reviewed the decision and reversed the lower court.\u00a0 Casting a shadow over the arguments \u2014 and the forthcoming decision by the justices expected by the summer \u2014 are sweeping efforts in dozens of states to impose more stringent voting rules in the wake of the 2020 general election. State lawmakers have introduced more than 250 bills that would restrict voting access, according to the Brennan Center. If the Supreme Court were to limit challenges brought under Section 2, voting rights groups fear it could be more difficult to protect voters from racial discrimination and harder to prove violations of the law occurred. Democrats and voting rights advocates have in recent years been sounding the alarm about growing new rules that restrict access to the ballot box following the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder. In that case, a majority of the court gutted a portion of the Voting Rights Act that required states and counties with a history of race-based voter discrimination to receive federal approval before they could change voting procedures. But the Democrat-led House is working to reinstate the preclearance requirement through legislation that aims to expand voting rights. One measure, H.R. 1, would create automatic voter registration systems, expand access to early and absentee voting and curtail partisan gerrymandering. Senate Republicans, though, are expected to block the bill if the House approves it.\u00a0 Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked Carvin, the Arizona GOP lawyer, why Republicans were involved in the case and what their interest was in keeping the laws on the books. \"It puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Democrats,\" Carvin said. \"Politics is a zero sum game, and every extra vote they get through unlawful interpretations of Section 2 hurts us.\" CBS News political reporter.",

Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted Thursday that he looked \"forward to signing this bill into law.\" House Democrats left the state in July in an effort to deny the Republican majority a quorum and defeat the bill during the first special session. Many Democratic lawmakers did not return to the Capitol at the start of the second session earlier this month, continuing the quorum break, but enough Democrats returned in recent days to end the stalemate.\u00a0 The Texas Senate passed its version of the bill earlier this month after Democratic state Senator Carol Alvardo filibustered the bill for 15 hours. The House made some changes, so the bill will either go to conference committee, where the two chambers could work on a new version of the bill, or the Senate could approve what the House passed and send it to Abbott's desk. As it stands, the bill would eliminate drive-thru and 24-hour early voting, both of which were widely used in the Houston area last year during the pandemic. It would also expand early voting hours in some smaller and medium-sized counties; add ID requirements for voting by mail; ban officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballots requests; give more powers to partisan poll watchers; and create new rules, with potential criminal penalties, for election workers and people who assist voters.\u00a0 Democrats have fought against GOP-led efforts to change Texas' election laws since the bills were introduced in March. They say the bill is a solution in search of a problem, arguing there's no evidence of widespread fraud in Texas' elections, and say some provisions could make it harder for some people to vote.\u00a0 \"The likelihood of fraud in a Texas election is a rounding error of a rounding error,\" declared Democratic Representative Rafael Anchia. \"There's no reason for this bill and no reason why we had to come back and no reason why you had to be here. This is all about furtherance of the big lie.\" But Republicans pushed back, contending the bill strengthens Texas' election system against potential fraud and is unrelated to the 2020 election. \"Texas has consistently reviewed its election law policy over time, making changes and updates as needed,\" Republican state Representative Andrew Murr said. \"It is the intent of the legislature that the application of this code and the conduct of elections be uniform and consistent throughout the state to reduce the likelihood of fraud in the conduct of elections, protect the secrecy of the ballot, promote voter access, and ensure that all legally cast ballots are counted.\" Many Democratic amendments were defeated during Thursday's session, but lawmakers did approve some changes to the bill during the lengthy debate. One major amendment removed provisions that required election judges to warn poll watchers that they were violating a law before a poll watcher could be removed and required officials to notify voters requesting a mail ballot if their application doesn't contain the correct information. That amendment also stiffened the penalty for election workers who refuse to allow poll watchers into a voting site. A late-night amendment supported by Republicans requires the Texas secretary of state to conduct monthly citizenship tests of voter rolls, adds a form for people who drive seven or more voters to the polls and makes counties with at least 100,000 people add video surveillance systems to record areas with voted ballots. The changes brought the bill closer in line with the Senate's version of the bill.\u00a0 Texas' fight over its election laws has been one of the most contentious battles in a statehouse this year. Democrats walked out of the Capitol in the closing hours of the regular session in May to defeat a different, more sweeping election bill. In July, more than 50 lawmakers left the state to break quorum during the first special session. The walkout continued until last week.\u00a0 On Thursday, in the early part of the floor session, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan asked members not to use the term \"racism\" during debate over the bill. It came after Republican Representative Matt Shaheen, whose grandparents were immigrants, said he would \"never obviously suppress my own vote.\" \"This chair would appreciate members not using the word racism this afternoon,\" Phelan said. Shortly after, Democratic state Representative Gina Hinojosa tested the limits of the rule when she asked Anchia, \"intentional discrimination against people of a different race. Is that racism?\"\u00a0 \"Ms. Hinojosa,\" Phelan interjected. \"We can talk about racial impacts of this legislation without accusing members of this body of being racist.\" \"Respectfully, I'm not accusing members of this body,\" Hinojosa responded.\u00a0 Later in the evening, Democratic state Representative Erin Zwiener introduced a bill to amend an oath for people who help voters to include that the person providing assistance has never \"participated in or encouraged an act of insurrection.\" Republican Kyle Biedermann challenged Zwiener on the provision, leading to a heated exchange about the January 6 attack at the United States Capitol. \"Do you believe the events of January 6 were an insurrection?\" Zwiener asked Biedermann, who was in Washington, D.C., on January 6.\u00a0 \"Of course not,\" Biedermann replied.\u00a0 Abbott praised the legislation on Twitter and said it will make Texas' \"elections process fair & uniform.\"\u00a0 The bill passed by the House has many similarities to SB1, the election bill that Democrats defeated during the regular session. That move ultimately led to Abbott calling lawmakers back for a special session.\u00a0 But the current bill doesn't include the two most controversial provisions from that bill. One of the proposals would have pushed the start of early voting on Sundays to 1 p.m., which critics said would hurt Souls to the Polls, a voter mobilization tradition in Black churches. The other provision omitted from the old bill would have lowered the standard for overturning election results based on claims of fraud. There has been no proof of widespread voter fraud in Texas during the 2020 election. The Houston Chronicle reported in December that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office spent 22,000 hours investigating voter fraud in 2020 and resolved just 16 minor cases.\u00a0 Several other states, including Florida, Georgia\u00a0and Iowa, have also passed sweeping laws to overhaul their election systems. Democrats, civil rights and voting rights groups have challenged many of the new voting laws in court and lawsuits are expected in Texas. The Justice Department is suing Georgia over an election bill signed by Governor Brian Kemp earlier this year. CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department filed suit against the state of Texas on Monday over the state's redistricting of congressional maps, saying the plans violate the voting rights of minority voters. The 45-page suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges that Texas has \"again diluted the voting strength of minority Texans and continued its refusal to comply with the Voting Rights Act, absent intervention by the Attorney General or the federal courts.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Vanita Gupta announced the lawsuit at Justice Department headquarters in Washington. \"These redistricting plans will diminish the opportunities for Latino and Black voters in Texas to elect their preferred representatives. And that is prohibited by federal law,\" Gupta said Monday.\u00a0 Every 10 years, the number of congressional seats in each state changes based on population figures gathered by the census, with states that have grown getting more seats and states that have shrunk getting fewer. Each state is responsible for drawing its own map to define their congressional districts. Based on the results of the 2020 census, Texas' congressional delegation increased by two, from 36 to 38 seats.\u00a0 Texas' population grew by 4 million people over the past decade, 95% of whom were non-White, the suit said. That growth has changed the demographics of its metro-suburban areas and resulted in more competitive races for incumbent Republicans. Texas' Republican-controlled legislature passed the state's new map in October and took those competitive seats off the map by extending them to include more rural and Republican-leaning areas.\u00a0 The Justice Department's suit said the state \"refused to recognize the State's growing minority electorate,\" and passed the new maps through an \"extraordinarily rapid and opaque legislative process.\" Gupta noted that Texas' two new congressional districts comprise areas where White voters are in the majority, despite the state's growth being driven by minorities. The map decreased the number of districts with a majority of Hispanic voters from eight to seven by \"surgically excis[ing] minority communities\" from the new district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by \"attaching them to heavily Anglo rural counties, some more than a hundred miles away,\" the suit said.\u00a0 In a statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the \"lawsuit against our state is the Biden Administration's latest ploy to control Texas voters. I am confident that our legislature's redistricting decisions will be proven lawful, and this preposterous attempt to sway democracy will fail.\" Citing the 2020 census and other citizenship data, the complaint said that \"proportional representation for Black voters in Texas would be 5 Congressional seats and 20 Texas House seats.\" But under the new redistricted map, Black voters are the majority in just 3 congressional seats and 13 Texas House seats. \"The 2021 Congressional Plan has the purpose of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\" the complaint alleged.\u00a0 Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, states were required to get \"pre-clearance\" for their maps from the federal government to ensure they don't discriminate against protected minorities. The Supreme Court struck down that requirement in a 2013 case known as Shelby County v. Holder, finding it unconstitutional and saying it violates states' rights. On Monday, Garland urged Congress to revive the Justice Department's pre-clearance authority. If it were still in place, he said, \"we would likely not be here today announcing this complaint.\" Noting that Texas has a \"lengthy history of discrimination in redistricting,\" the Justice Department asked the court to declare the redistricting plans in violation of the Voting Rights Act, halt their implementation and establish \"interim redistricting plans for the Texas Congressional Delegation and the Texas House that remedy unlawful components of the 2021 Congressional Plan and 2021 House Plan.\" In a series of public hearings before the maps passed, Republican State Senator Joan Huffman, who led the redrawing process, said she didn't look at racial data when drawing lines. Political data and numbers on previous elections were taken into account, she said. Bob Stein, a redistricting expert at Rice University in Houston, said he doesn't expect that the federal government will be able to prove the maps were racially gerrymandered, since Republicans used partisan data instead of racial data. \"We all know there is a high correlation between partisanship and race and ethnicity. But the court has held that partisan redistricting is not unconstitutional,\" he said. \"I think [the lawsuit] is like waving the flag. It's saying to the Democrats in Texas, 'We're going to try and help you.'\"",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who holds the key Democratic vote in the evenly divided Senate, said Sunday he will oppose a sweeping election and campaign finance reform bill and instead encouraged his colleagues to pass voting rights legislation that can garner bipartisan backing. In an op-ed for the Charleston Gazette-Mail published Sunday, Manchin said he plans to vote against the House-passed For the People Act, which is set to be taken up by the Senate at the end of June, because it is too partisan. Manchin's decision not to support the bill effectively dooms its passage in the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans hold 50 seats each, and Vice President Kamala Harris casts tie-breaking votes. Instead, in an interview with \"Face the Nation,\" the West Virginia Democrat said he believes Republicans will work with their Democratic counterparts to craft a voting rights bill that can pass the upper chamber with support from both parties. \"I'm going to fight for this, and I think the Republicans will fight for this and understand we must come together on a voting rights bill in a bipartisan way,\" he told \"Face the Nation.\" \"You can't divide our country further by thinking you've given leeway to one or the other, and if they think they're going to win by subverting and oppressing people from voting, they're going to lose. They will lose.\" While Manchin opposes the For the People Act, he does support another voting rights bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. Manchin suggested the preclearance requirement be applied to all 50 states and said this voting rights measure already has support from at least one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. It's unclear, however, whether any other GOP senator would vote in favor of the proposal. \"The fundamental purpose of our democracy is the freedom of our elections,\" he said. \"If we can't come to agreement on that, God help us.\" Congress has moved swiftly on legislation addressing election reforms as legislators in 48 states have introduced more than 380 bills that would restrict voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Changes to voting procedures in several states, including Georgia, Arizona and Florida, have already been signed into law, while a bill overhauling elections in Texas\u00a0has stalled. Asked why Republicans would support federal legislation that could dismantle voting rules approved at the state level, Manchin warned GOP lawmakers could face negative consequences from the changes. \"Someone's got to fight for this,\" he said. \"We've got to say, listen, the divided country that we're in today, the insurrection that we saw on January the 6th, if we don't try to heal that, if we don't make every effort and go beyond the call of duty, than what are we and who are we?\" Even before Manchin announced his decision to vote against the For the People Act, the measure was unlikely to advance in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to end debate on a bill and overcome a filibuster. The Republican opposition to that legislation and others poised to be brought to the Senate floor has led Democrats to call for an end to the legislative filibuster, which would allow bills to advance with a simple majority and clear hurdles to implementing President Biden's agenda.\u00a0 But Manchin has repeatedly come out against eliminating the filibuster and said doing so could come back to hurt Democrats in the future if Republicans gain control of Congress and the White House. \"We need to work within the framework of what we have. There's ways we can move forward,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "In response to the weakening of the federal voting rights law by the Supreme Court in 2013, Attorney General Merrick Garland made a commitment to expand the Justice Department's efforts to protect voting rights, announcing a series of actions aimed at confronting state and local efforts that he said \"will make it harder to vote.\"\u00a0 \"We are scrutinizing new laws that seek to curb voter access, and where we see violations of federal law, we will not hesitate to act,\" Garland said at a speech at the Justice Department Friday. \"We are also scrutinizing current laws and practices, in order to determine whether they discriminate against Black voters and other voters of color.\" Since over a dozen states have passed new laws making it more difficult to vote, Garland pointed to some jurisdictions that, \"based on disinformation, have utilized abnormal post-election audit methodologies that may put the integrity of the voting process at risk and undermine public confidence in our democracy.\" To counter this, he said that the Justice Department will increase the size of the enforcement unit that tracks state and local efforts to enact voter restrictions and vowed to prosecute those responsible for the rise in violent threats against election workers.\u00a0 In the next 30 days the department will be doubling the Civil Rights Division's enforcement staff. The addition of more attorneys and resources comes in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, which saw\u00a0 an uptick in threats targeting state and local election officials and poll workers and rising disinformation around access to the ballot box.\u00a0 Garland pledged the department would \"investigate and promptly prosecute\" any threats that violate federal law, and committed to partnering with other federal agencies to combat disinformation surrounding elections, which he said \"intentionally tries to suppress the vote.\" There are currently several Republican-led states considering legislation that would add limits to voting access in the wake of President Trump's electoral loss and a rise in mail-in voting in the 2020 elections due to the coronavirus pandemic. As of mid-May, state legislators have enacted at least 22 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 14 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Congress is considering two major pieces of voting rights legislation, the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon. At the end of the month, the Senate will take up the For the People Act, an expansive but controversial voting and elections reform bill, but it is expected to be blocked by Republicans who argue that it is a federal overreach. The House is currently working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, or H.R. 4, which has yet to be introduced. The bill would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013.\u00a0 The Voting Rights Act established a formula to determine which areas should be covered by Section 5, which required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to submit any changes to voting laws to the Justice Department or a panel of federal judges for approval, a practice known as preclearance. But the Supreme Court struck down the formula in Shelby County v. Holder in a 5 to 4 decision along ideological lines. The House subcommittee that oversees federal elections is currently conducting field hearings to compile evidence on whether racial discrimination in voting is occurring in certain jurisdictions, and create a new formula. Once those hearings are concluded, the bill will be written and considered later this year. But, like the For the People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act faces significant opposition from Senate Republicans and faces an uphill battle to passage. NAACP President Derrick Johnson praised Garland's announcement in a statement on Friday, but said that it is \"a race against time\" to protect voting rights as more restrictive state laws on voting rights are implemented. \"From the appointment of Kristen Clarke (to lead the Civil Rights Division) to the ongoing fight to pass the For The People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we are encouraged by the new tone on voting rights set by the Biden-Harris Administration,\" Johnson said. \"But the uphill battle to protect our most sacred and fundamental right, the right to vote, is far from over. Today's announcement from the Attorney General speaks to the level of urgency that is needed to protect our democracy and ensure that our voices are heard.\"",

            "article_content": "Widespread Republican opposition to two major pieces of voting rights legislation is leading some Democratic lawmakers and activists to fear that Congress will be unable to pass either bill this year, even as several state legislatures enact restrictive voting measures. Later this month, the Senate is set to take up S. 1, or the For the People Act, an expansive but controversial voting and elections reform bill. The measure was already unlikely to pass, as Democrats hold a razor-thin 50-seat majority in the Senate, and 60 votes are required to advance most legislation. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin also announced Sunday that he opposes it, hammering another nail in its legislative coffin. But Manchin does support another voting rights bill, one that has yet to be introduced in this session of Congress \u2014 the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon. This bill, also known as H.R. 4, would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. The Voting Rights Act established a formula to determine which areas should be covered by Section 5, which required certain jurisdictions to submit any changes to the Justice Department or a panel of federal judges for approval. The law was reauthorized in 2006, but the formula for dictating which jurisdictions should be subject to preclearance had not been significantly updated. The Supreme Court struck down the formula in the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, a 5 to 4 decision divided along ideological lines. Lawmakers \"reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts, having no logical relationship to the present day,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his decision. \"Congress \u2014 if it is to divide the States \u2014 must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past,\" Roberts wrote. \"Our country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\" The high court did not strike down Section 5, but without a formula to determine which jurisdictions are subject to preclearance, it is entirely unenforceable. The federal Commission on Civil Rights released a report in 2018 that found that several states had enacted \"newly restrictive statewide voter laws\" in the wake of the Shelby County v. Holder ruling, including closing polling places, limiting early voting, purging voter rolls and implementing stricter voter ID laws. Advocates argue that it is even more important to pass both For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act now because of the recent efforts by Republican-led states to enact more restrictive voting measures. As of mid-May, state legislators have enacted at least 22 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 14 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Changes to voting procedures in several states, including Georgia, Arizona and Florida, have already been signed into law, while a bill overhauling elections in Texas has been temporarily stalled. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act seeks to create a new formula for determining how jurisdictions should be subject to preclearance. But bill has to be both airtight constitutionally and provide evidence that certain jurisdictions are employing practices that specifically discriminate against minority voters. A version of the bill was introduced by Democratic Congresswoman Terri Sewell in 2019 and passed in the House, but stalled in the Senate, which was then controlled by Republicans. It would have subjected a state to preclearance for 10 years if 15 or more voting rights violations occurred in the state during the previous 25 years. A political jurisdiction would have been subject to preclearance for a 10-year period if three or more voting rights violations occurred there during the previous 25 years. Sewell, who will be the lead sponsor for the bill again in this Congress, said in a statement to CBS News that \"never did I think that the cause for which the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights movement marched so many years ago would become new again.\" \"Leading the introduction of this bill on behalf of John Lewis is a great honor and comes with even greater responsibility. We know that this legislation will face court challenges which is why we must ensure that it is on solid constitutional ground before passing it. Nothing short of our democracy is at stake,\" Sewell said. Some Democrats have suggested pivoting focus to the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act instead of the Voting Rights Act, as it may be more likely to garner Republican support. GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski was an original cosponsor of the bill when it was introduced in 2019, and is expected to support it again. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi dashed any hopes of prioritizing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the House, saying in a letter to Democratic colleagues on Tuesday that \"H.R. 4 must be passed, but it will not be ready until the fall, and it is not a substitute for H.R. 1,\" referring to the House number for the For the People Act. \"When we pass H.R. 4, we must do so in a way that is ironclad constitutionally.\u00a0 This is what Congressman Butterfield and the House Judiciary Committee are hard at work on now,\" referring to Congressman G.K. Butterfield, who chairs the House Administration subcommittee overseeing federal elections. Butterfield's subcommittee is conducting field hearings to compile evidence of discriminatory practices that will then be shared with the Judiciary Committee, which will do the markup for the bill. He said in an interview with CBS News that he expected his subcommittee to complete its work and provide \"thousands of pages\" of evidence by the end of June. \"We have evidence that there is widespread discrimination that is continuing in many states across the country,\" Butterfield said. He added that the voting restrictions enacted in several states across the country had a \"devastating impact on democracy.\" He said it was necessary to pass both the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act, saying that \"each one accomplishes a different outcome.\" Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, told reporters on Tuesday that it was a \"false choice\" to prioritize the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act over For the People Act.\u00a0 \"I'm glad that we have the John Lewis bill, appropriately named in his honor. But let's be clear, John Lewis spent his last 10 years fighting for the provisions in the For the People Act,\" Warnock said. \"It's not an either or proposition. We've got to pass John Lewis in order to protect voting rights. We've got to pass the For the People Act to provide some basic standards for our elections.\" Like For the People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  has very little chance of passing in the Senate. It is highly unlikely that nine other Republicans will join all Democrats in supporting the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came out Tuesday in opposition to the bill, indicating that it is incredibly unlikely that the bill will garner sufficient Republican support. \"There's no threat to the voting rights law,\" McConnell told reporters, arguing that the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would give the Justice Department too much power over states. \"I think it's unnecessary.\" Some progressives inside and out of Congress have pushed for eliminating the filibuster, which would allow legislation to advance with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. But ending the filibuster would require support from all 50 Democrats, and Manchin has emphatically said he would never agree to do so. Manchin is not alone in his opposition either. Although he and Senator Kyrsten Sinema are the most vocal opponents of eliminating the filibuster, other Democrats have privately raised concerns about ending the practice as well. With the filibuster likely to remain in place, Democrats have no choice but to continue to put pressure on Republicans. Although Butterfield said that \"we at this moment don't have any reason to believe that 10 or more Republicans will join with the 50 Democrats\" to support this bill, he nonetheless hoped that it would be able to garner support in the same way that the 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act did. Butterfield said that he expected H.R. 4 to be brought to the House floor and passed by the end of September, and then hopefully be considered by the Senate by October.\u00a0 \"I sincerely believe that there are more than 10 Republicans that understand the urgency of updating the Voting Rights Act,\" Butterfield said.

The measure in Georgia, approved along party lines, was the first major voting law to move through state legislatures in the wake of the November election, which former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence was rife with voter fraud. Like Georgia, which has now faced backlash for its new election rules, lawmakers in dozens of states have put forth their own proposed voting changes, with Texas, Arizona and Florida next in line to consider reforms to their election systems.\u00a0 But these overhauls are likely to bring with them legal battles over voting rights, with Georgia's law already challenged in several disputes mounted by civil rights groups and voting organization in the state. Resting at the heart of those challenges, legal experts told CBS News, will be Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits voting policies that discriminate on the basis of race. \"These can be litigated under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which says in statute what the 15th Amendment says, you can't discriminate [based on race] and any action, whether it is directly discriminating or has the effect of making it harder for the racial minority to vote versus the racial majority, would be illegal,\" Atiba Ellis, a professor at Marquette University Law School, told CBS News. \"From that context, if plaintiffs can demonstrate that these kinds of provisions around absentee voting, innovations from the pandemic like dropbox voting and all of these kinds of voter-friendly issues, if plaintiffs can show these things have a harsher impact on minority communities, than it's an easier case to win for those people of color.\" For challenges to the measures to succeed under the Voting Rights Act, Ellis said groups bringing the cases have to show that their effects would be more detrimental to the voting opportunities for people of color. \"If the provisions can be seen as targeting, and what's more likely, impacting voters of color in this way, a court will be far more skeptical about them under the Voting Rights Act,\" he said. \"The question that was at issue in the 1960s and has been ever since is, do the laws make minority voters worse off at the end of the day? If they do, Section 2 provides a remedy.\" Lawmakers in Georgia argue the more stringent rules were needed to protect the integrity of the state's elections and prevent voter fraud. But voting rights groups and civil rights activists argue in their lawsuits that several of the law's measures disproportionately harm Black and Latino voters, such as an ID requirement for voting by mail, new rules for ballot drop boxes and a shortened time frame for requesting and returning mail ballots. But the measure also expands early voting, which supporters say disprove claims the law restricts voting access. \"Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,\" a suit filed by the Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations alleges. \"In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end.\" Michael Kang, a law professor at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, said many portions of the election laws are likely to be upheld by the courts, as states have wide discretion over administration of their elections. \"Excluding VRA considerations, the state has the ability to offer the amount of early voting it thinks is appropriate and it can change the voting process to take into account its administrative concerns with a relatively free hand,\" he told CBS News. But the most serious challenges raise claims under Section 2, though he noted the provision has traditionally been applied in vote dilution cases, such as those involving redistricting, rather than vote denial cases. \"Federal courts have only been looking at these in volumes since Section 5 was taken out of action,\" Kang said.\u00a0 Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required certain jurisdictions with a history of race-based voter discrimination, many in the South, to receive approval from the Justice Department before changing their voting policies. But in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled the formula to determine which places were covered by Section 5 was unconstitutional, effectively gutting that provision. Texas, Arizona and Georgia were among the states subject to preclearance from the federal government before changing their voting rules, but the Supreme Court's decision in the 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder, freed them of that requirement.\u00a0 While the House in the last Congress passed legislation that would restore the preclearance formula in the Voting Rights Act that determined the jurisdictions covered under Section 5, the bill hasn't been reintroduced this term, though there is an appetite among Democrats and President Biden for legislation. \"At the end of the day, the democracy belongs to all of us, and actions that suggest that barriers that we can reasonably see can harm some voters more than others shouldn't exist,\" Ellis said. \"The Voting Rights Act gives some protection in that regard in terms of race, but it can give more, and it's up to Congress to authorize the formula for Section 5 preclearance in order to provide that greater level of protection.\" Success for the groups challenging Georgia's law and potential fights over measures under consideration elsewhere could hinge on the result of a fight currently before the Supreme Court involving two Arizona elections rules. Democrats argued the rules \u2014 one involving the return of absentee ballots and another out-of-precinct provisional ballots \u2014 violate Section 2 and fear a sweeping ruling from the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the provision. While the high court appeared likely to allow Arizona's two rules to stand, the justices struggled to define a standard for determining when voting rules discriminate on the basis of race in violation of Section 2. \"I don't think there is any question whatever the law that comes out of Brnovich will be applied to these challenges,\" Kang said, referring to the Arizona case. \"It's going to set the law here in some way, but whether it makes it harder for the plaintiffs to win or is going to move the law much is unclear.\"",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling this month that placed new limits on a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act could hamper efforts by Democrats and voting rights advocates in the courts to derail new voting rules enacted by Republican-led states and force them to mount their battles in other arenas. In its decision, the Supreme Court upheld two voting rules from the battleground state of Arizona. One rule bans third-party collection of mail-in ballots, or so-called \"ballot harvesting,\" and a second discards ballots cast in the wrong precinct. In the 37-page opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the six-justice majority laid out several factors for lower courts to consider in future challenges to voting rules under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. These \"guideposts,\" as Alito called them, make it more difficult for voting rights activists and groups to succeed in invalidating more stringent rules that have already been enacted or are being considered by GOP-led states, which activists argue erect barriers to voting. \"The reason we have the federal Voting Rights Act is because there was a problem that needed to be solved on the national level, and if you look at the list of all the restrictive voting laws proposed, it's clear that problem has not disappeared, but our solution has,\" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and CBS News legal contributor. \"The court has pulled our solution out from under us.\" Lawsuits that depend on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the \"results test\" \u2014 whether a provision results in the denial of the right to vote based on race \u2014 as Arizona's dispute did, face high hurdles to prevail, now that the Supreme Court has ruled. \"Any other lawsuit that's dependent on Section 2 and the effects side, it's really difficult to see how the Arizona case is anything other than a full body blow to those cases,\" Levinson said. \"Depending on how judges want to apply the factors, it's maybe not a death knell for any case, but it certainly gives judges more cover and arguably more than cover, it gives judges almost mandatory guidance that these will be very difficult to win.\" Already this year, several lawsuits targeting a sweeping elections law passed in Georgia have been filed, including one from the Justice Department that argues several of its provisions run afoul of the Voting Rights Act. In announcing the Biden administration's challenge to Georgia's new rules last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the changes were enacted \"with the purpose of denying or abridging the right of Black Georgians to vote on account of their race or color.\" The Justice Department's case, though, may not be doomed to fail in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision because, unlike Arizona's, it claims Georgia's legislature enacted the voting law with intent to discriminate against Black voters. \"The main significance of [the Arizona case] lies in disparate impact claims,\" said James Gardner, a professor at the University of Buffalo Law School and elections law expert. \"But disparate treatment, an intentional discrimination case, is not strictly within the reach of last week's decision.\" The Justice Department's legal challenge targets four sections of the new voting law and argues that state lawmakers enacted the law \"with knowledge of the disproportionate effect that these provisions, both singularly and together, would have on Black voters' ability to participate in the political process on an equal basis with white voters.\" But cases that claim discriminatory intent come with their own hurdles, Levinson said. \"They're extraordinarily difficult to prove unless someone has done something insanely stupid, like written down, 'We're just doing this because we don't want Black people to vote,'\" she said. \"It's hard to get into somebody's mind to show intent.\" The Supreme Court's decision in the Arizona dispute was its first major voting rights ruling since 2013, when the high court effectively gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a key provision that required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive federal approval before changing their election rules. After the Supreme Court's ruling in that case, known as Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights advocates began leaning on Section 2 as the main enforcement mechanism. But now, experts argue the court's conservative majority blunted that tool as well. \"This case makes it harder for plaintiffs to prevail,\" Gardner said. \"Why? Because they have to have very clear facts and they have to demonstrate a pretty significant disparity between the impact on white and Black voters.\" The 6-3 decision from the high court, delivered on the final day of its term, came as GOP-led states debate changes to their voting rules. The November 2020 presidential election and concerns about election integrity after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence there was widespread voter fraud served as the catalyst for legislative proposals tightening voting procedures. In addition to Georgia's sweeping elections measure, Florida also enacted a law that changed its elections procedures, and Republicans in Texas have renewed a legislative effort to impose restrictions on voting, though Democrats there are attempting to thwart their attempts. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday called proposed laws restricting ballot access \"authoritarian\" and \"the worst challenge to our democracy since the Civil War.\" President Biden is set to deliver remarks on voting rights in Philadelphia on Tuesday. While the Biden administration has pledged to fight efforts to impose new restrictions on voting, those battles may have to be waged not in the federal courthouses, but in state courts, where judges can review voting laws under state constitutions. \"There's really nowhere else to go, because with the federal law as it's been interpreted, it's not just an uphill climb, you're climbing three mountains back-to-back,\" Levinson said. \"You're really dependent on what the state law is and how protective the state law is.\" Fights to expand, rather than restrict, ballot access can also take place in state legislatures, through ballot initiatives and in Congress. \"The federal courts are increasingly disinterested in patrolling these things,\" Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Iowa who focuses on election law, said. \"We've been in such a litigation-focused approach to voting rights for a long time that people have neglected the lawmaking process.\" Congress attempted to pass a sweeping elections reform bill, called the For the People Act, but Republicans blocked the measure from advancing in the evenly divided Senate. Lawmakers now have an eye on legislation that would restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act dismantled by the Supreme Court in 2013. Any voting bill will need support from at least 10 Senate Republicans to advance, though Levinson said she hopes the Supreme Court's decision in the Arizona case will mobilize lawmakers to act. \"It's not just that we're without our shirt without Section 5, now we're without our shirt and our pants,\" Levinson said. \"Do you really want us out here naked in the wind?\"",

            "article_content": "2021 was a year of ups and downs in the minds of the American public. The year began with public concern about the state of U.S. democracy, yet positive ratings for newly-elected President Joe Biden; ratings that would turn more negative over the course of the year. In the spring, there was some optimism about the pandemic as vaccine rates rose and then some concern as a new COVID variant emerged at year's end.\u00a0 Many of the political divisions we've seen in recent years endured throughout 2021 but, all in all, Americans are feeling pretty good about 2022. CBS News polled thousands of people across the country this year getting their opinions on a range of issues. Here's a look back at some of the highlights from CBS News polling in 2021:\u00a0 After a contentious presidential election that saw record turnout during a pandemic, 2021 did not start off quietly, but instead, with an attack on the U.S. Capitol. Supporters of then- President Trump attempted to disrupt Congress' counting of the electoral votes.\u00a0 Amid the attack and the objection by 147 Republican lawmakers to the counting of the Electoral College votes,\u00a0 a majority of Americans were optimistic about him as the next president.\u00a0Fewer than a third called it secure.\u00a0 In response to the events at the Capitol on January 6, the House of Representatives introduced and later adopted one article of impeachment of \"incitement of insurrection\" against Trump, alleging that he had incited the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 Similar to the first impeachment proceedings brought against Trump in 2019, views on the matter split along partisan lines: Most Democrats, along with independents, favored impeachment. Most Republicans opposed impeaching Trump and believed he did nothing wrong to deserve removal or resignation.\u00a0 Meanwhile, just ahead of Joe Biden being sworn into office, a majority of Americans were optimistic about him as the next president. Most Republicans, however,\u00a0 were not, as two-thirds did not view Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election, a view that would persist throughout 2021. The CBS News poll took its first measure of President Biden's overall job rating in February.\u00a061% of Americans approved of his job performance,\u00a0much of it boosted by the good marks he received on his handling of the coronavirus outbreak.\u00a0 His overall approval rating was higher than Trump's at the start of his presidency, while similar to Barack Obama's at the start of his first term. Still, most Republicans disapproved of the job Biden was doing, and as\u00a0Trump's second impeachment trial began, rank and file Republicans remained strongly behind the former president. By more than 2 to 1,\u00a0 they called any Republican vote in Congress to impeach or convict Trump as disloyal, rather than principled. March 2021 marked one year since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and after a year of the outbreak, Americans were feeling a range of emotions as it related to the coronavirus, including exhaustion and stress, but also gratitude. For many, their lives had been transformed over the past year. At the time, 1 in 5 Americans reported that a close friend or relative had died from COVID-19. \u00a0 Many said the virus outbreak had a negative impact on their finances, as well as on their mental and emotional health.\u00a0 But they expressed some optimism about the future, as many expected these things to improve. And 63% of Americans expected the coronavirus situation overall to get better in the next few months. Vaccines were driving optimism about containing the pandemic. At this point, more than half of U.S. adults said they planned to get vaccinated or had already gotten at least one shot. Still, a portion of the public was hesitant about the vaccine and that hesitancy was - and continues to be - related to partisanship.\u00a0 Republicans were less likely than the broader public to say they would get vaccinated, something that remains today.\u00a0 Along with this bit of public optimism, the president continued to get high marks for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. George Floyd's death in the spring of 2020 sparked protests across the country by Black Lives Matter and other groups concerning the treatment of racial minorities by police.\u00a0 Nearly a year later, former police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering Floyd - a verdict that\u00a03 in 4 Americans believed was the right one. This majority view spanned racial, age and partisan groups. As the country celebrated Earth Day, most Americans continued to believe climate change is something that needs to be addressed urgently, and 7 in 10 said their generation has at least some responsibility to make sacrifices and take care of the environment.\u00a0 Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a vocal critic of Trump's actions on January 6 and one of the few Republicans who voted to impeach him over the matter, was removed from her House leadership post, an action supported by most rank and file Republicans. Eight in 10 Republicans who were aware of Cheney's removal agreed with her ouster, saying she was off-message, unsupportive of former president Trump, and that she was wrong about the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 Six months after Trump was defeated in his re-election bid for president, two-thirds of Republicans nationwide said it was important for Republicans to be loyal to Trump.\u00a0 And a similar percentage continued to say that Mr. Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election, little changed since January shortly before Mr. Biden was sworn into office. Ahead of President Biden's\u00a0 summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin most Americans wanted him to take a tough stand with Putin rather than a cooperative approach.\u00a0 Majorities of\u00a0 Republicans, Democrats and independents held this view.\u00a0\u00a0 While Mr. Biden and Putin met face to face, some Americans were still meeting and working remotely. \u00a0 As they look to the future, more working Americans said they preferred a hybrid work model -\u00a0 a mix of some days at work and some at home - or work remotely all the time, for the next year.\u00a0 As the country marked Pride month nearly 8 in 10 said the last 50 years had brought progress in ending discrimination against LGBTQ people, although a majority said discrimination still exists in society today. Since the 2020 election, some states have tried to change their voting rules but most Americans said they'd prefer the voting process be left alone or made easier. Relatively few wanted it to be harder. And while Congress has made little headway on the issue of voting rights, a majority of Americans feel federal oversight is indeed necessary today to make sure minorities have the same access to voting as White people do. Although fewer Republicans (most of whom think voting should be made harder) think that's necessary.\u00a0 Six months into his presidency,\u00a0 Mr. Biden continued to get good marks for his handling of the coronavirus.\u00a0 And more Americans were feeling hopeful than scared about things over the next year.\u00a0 But as the president continued to urge\u00a0 people to get a COVID vaccine, most Republicans \u2014  more of whom are vaccine hesitant compared to the public overall \u2014   told us the Biden administration was focusing too much on trying to get people\u00a0 vaccinated.\u00a0 Nearly 20 years after the U.S. war in Afghanistan began, it ended with a much-criticized withdrawal of U.S. troops. Americans supported troops getting out, but public reaction to how the withdrawal played out was decidedly negative. 74% of Americans said it went badly, including majorities across political lines. Americans gave Mr. Biden negative marks for his handling of the removal of U.S. troops. Also, most did not think he had a clear plan for evacuating U.S. civilians nor did they feel the U.S. was doing enough to help Afghan people trying to leave (including most Democrats). \u00a0\u00a0 The president's overall approval rating took a hit \u2014\u00a0  dropping eight points in a month \u2014   and in CBS News polling to date \u2014   that approval rating has not rebounded.\u00a0 Here at home, the school year was beginning to get underway and debates over mask mandates in schools were taking place across the country.\u00a0 Nationally, a majority of parents favored requiring students to wear masks as most expressed at least some concern about their children contracting the coronavirus in school. Like views related to the coronavirus among the broader public, parents' opinions also divided largely along political lines. Parents who are Republican expressed less concern than Democrats about their children getting COVID, and these partisan views extended to opinions on masks: Most Democrats supported a mask requirement in their children's school, but most Republicans did not.\u00a0 This September marked 20 years since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001 and two-thirds of Americans believe the country was forever changed on that day. Americans see a mix of good and bad when looking at ways the country may have changed: most see the enhanced airport security measures as changes for the better. Stricter security measures may have come at a cost, however, as more feel personal privacy and freedoms have changed for the worse, rather than better, as result of the attacks. Thinking about 9/11 continues to be emotional for most Americans.\u00a0 They told us \"Sad\" describes the way they most often feel when they think or hear about that day. Many still expressed \"disbelief,\" even two decades later.\u00a0 As Congressional Democrats negotiated within their own party over the President's \"Build Back Better\" plan, Americans were more likely to have heard about the cost of the plan than the specific policies that could be in it.\u00a0 Yet some of what could potentially be in the bill was quite popular, in principle, particularly items like expanded Medicare coverage and lowered prescription costs \u2014 but these were the\u00a0 least heard about items. \u00a0 On the coronavirus, we continued to see splits in views by vaccine status. The vaccinated strongly favored mandates and proof of vaccines to enter some public places, while the unvaccinated opposed those measures. The vaccinated also voiced frustration with the unvaccinated. When asked to pick ways to describe the unvaccinated, the fully vaccinated often chose \"they're putting people like me and my family at risk\" and \"they're being misled\" as descriptors. As prices for goods and services were going up, Americans' ratings of the economy and President Biden were going down.\u00a0 In November, the public's assessments of the national economy were the most negative since the summer of 2020 and their overall approval rating of Biden dropped to the lowest of his presidency.\u00a0 President Biden was able to tout the passage of a bipartisan infrastructure bill which drew backing from a majority of Americans, but 67%\u00a0 disapproved of this handling of inflation. And this dragged down his overall approval rating to 44%.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's ratings for handling coronavirus generally, and vaccine distribution remained positive, but when asked specifically which issues mattered most in how they evaluate Mr. Biden, the economy stood out. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in an abortion case that represents a direct challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Ahead of those arguments, a majority of Americans told us that they support keeping Roe in place and by two to one said overturning it would represent a step backward for women rather than a step forward. As the year was winding down, another COVID variant was popping up. In our polling conducted in early December, before Omicron became the dominant variant in the U.S., most Americans were proceeding with their holiday plans, including gathering with family and friends, although 58% of Americans were at least somewhat concerned about Omicron.\u00a0 Overall, when Americans look back over the past year, feelings are mixed. 42% said 2021 was mostly filled with happiness for them personally, 20 points higher than the number who described 2020 that way when we polled the public last year. \u00a0 But almost as many American said 2021 was mostly a sad year for them. \u00a0 Still, as they look ahead, most Americans feel hopeful about 2022, regardless of whether 2021 was a sad or happy year for them.\u00a0 Looking to next year,\u00a0 2022 will be full of events to cover from the COVID-19 pandemic to the midterm elections to a Supreme Court ruling on abortion. Who will win control of Congress? How much of a factor will President Biden be in the midterms? After optimism earlier this year, will the coronavirus be contained?\u00a0 The CBS News polling team will continue to measure the views of the American public on the key issues and events that arise. Stay tuned. This analysis is based on CBS News polls conducted in 2021. Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus and Kabir Khanna contributed to portions of this analysis.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Republicans on Tuesday blocked a procedural vote to advance a sweeping voting reforms bill in the Senate, sinking Democrats' attempt to begin debate on their landmark legislation overhauling the nation's election laws. With a 50-50 vote, the effort, which garnered last-minute backing from Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, fell far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. All Republicans oppose the voting rights bill and voted against taking up the legislation, which is Democrats' answer to restrictive voting measures enacted in GOP-led states following the 2020 presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the Biden administration's efforts on voting rights, presided over the vote. After the vote, she told reporters \"the fight is not over.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made similar comments, saying that \"this vote, I'm ashamed to say, is further evidence that voter suppression has become part of the official platform of the Republican Party.\"  The Senate's failure to advance the bill is likely to further fuel calls from progressive Democrats to do away with the filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation.\u00a0 Ahead of the vote, Schumer reiterated the effort was to open debate on voting rights legislation, saying \"protecting voting rights is worthy of debate. This is what this next vote is about.\" \"Are we going to let the most dishonest president in history continue to poison our democracy from the inside?\" the New York Democrat said. \"Or will we stand up to defend what generations of Americans have organized, fought, marched and died for: the sacred, sacred right to vote?\" \u00a0 The bill, known as the For the People Act or S. 1, would be the greatest overhaul of election laws in a generation, revamping government ethics and campaign finance laws while seeking to strengthen voting rights by creating automatic voter registration and expanding access to early and absentee voting. It also includes some measures that would require states to overhaul their registration systems, limit states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process. President Biden on Tuesday urged Congress to send the bill to his desk for signature. \"We can't sit idly by while democracy is in peril \u2014 here, in America,\" Mr. Biden tweeted before the test vote. \"We need to protect the sacred right to vote and ensure 'We the People' choose our leaders, the very foundation on which our democracy rests. We urgently need the For The People Act.\" In the wake of Republicans' filibuster, the president called their opposition \"the suppression of a bill to end voter suppression \u2014 another attack on voting rights that is sadly not unprecedented\" and pledged more action on voting rights. \"This fight is far from over \u2014 far from over,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"I've been engaged in this work my whole career, and we are going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again \u2014 for the people, for our very democracy.\" While Manchin said this month he opposed the initial version of the elections overhaul, raising concerns about passing such sweeping legislation without any bipartisan support, he announced earlier Tuesday that he would vote to proceed to debate on the bill.\u00a0 Manchin eased his initial opposition last week, circulating a list of demands for the voting legislation. The list\u00a0included provisions banning partisan gerrymandering and mandating at least 15 consecutive days of early voting for federal elections. Manchin's list also included areas of compromise relating to ethics and campaign finance. In a statement ahead of Tuesday's vote, Manchin said the updated bill would expand early voting and vote by mail, and implement \"voter ID requirements that aim to strengthen the security of our elections without making it harder for Americans to vote.\" It would also require the disclosure of donors who make campaign contributions of $10,000 or more. The expansive voting rights bill derailed by Republicans has backing from former President Obama, who urged Congress on Monday to pass legislation before the 2022 midterm elections. \"The violence that occurred in the U.S. Capitol on January 6, just a few months ago, should remind us that we can't take our democracy for granted,\" Mr. Obama said on a call with grassroots supporters. Even though Democrats coalesced around the bill, Republicans remained adamant in their opposition. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said states, not the federal government, should retain control over their elections and called the measure \"a solution in search of a problem.\" The bill, GOP Senator Roy Blunt said, \"is not about more democracy. It's about more Democrats.\" In anticipation of the Senate vote, Harris spoke with Schumer over the weekend about the path forward, a White House official said. The vice president also has spoken with a number of senators and House members, as well as voting rights advocates, including the head of the NAACP.\u00a0 Manchin has pinned his hopes for election reform on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which so far has the support of a single Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, who voted against S. 1. The bill has not yet been introduced, but would restore a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. But the act, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon, will likely not be considered until the fall, as the House is still gathering the evidence sufficient to prove that jurisdictions have patterns of voting discrimination.

            "article_content": "The family of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was shot and killed by Cleveland police in 2014, asked the Justice Department on Friday to reopen the case into his death after it was closed in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. In late 2020, federal prosecutors said they would not bring charges\u00a0against the two police officers involved, saying video of the shooting was too poor quality for them to conclusively establish what occurred. There were no other prosecutions in the case. In December 2015, a grand jury\u00a0declined to bring criminal charges against the officers. Rice's family said in a letter to the Justice Department that it believes Trump officials were uninterested in seeking justice for him for political reasons and made the case needlessly complicated. \"The truth is this case is tragically simple. Tamir Rice was a boy. On November 22, 2014, he was doing something many boys enjoy: playing with a toy gun in a park near his house,\" attorneys for the family wrote in the letter. Rice was Black, and the police officer who shot him is white. The shooting sparked community protests about the police treatment of Black Americans, especially after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer or his partner. \"I'm still in so much pain because no one has been held accountable for the criminal act that took his life,\" Rice's mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement. \"I'm asking DOJ to reopen the investigation into my son's case; we need an indictment and conviction for Tamir's death.\" The family's request puts pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Biden administration to begin publicly delivering on a commitment to combat racial discrimination in policing. Garland has said America doesn't \"yet have equal justice.\" But reopening the case could be complicated. \"The election of President Biden, your appointment, and your commitment to the rule of law, racial justice, and police reform give Tamir's family hope that the chance for accountability is not lost forever,\" the family said in the letter. The Justice Department declined to comment. Rice was playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center in Cleveland on November 22, 2014, when he was shot and killed by officer Timothy Loehmann seconds after Loehmann and his partner, officer Frank Garmback, arrived. The officers had been dispatched to the recreation center after a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus called 911 to report that a \"guy\" was pointing a gun at people. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that it was probably a juvenile and the gun might be \"fake,\" though that information was never relayed to the officers. To bring federal civil rights charges in cases like these, the Justice Department must prove that an officer's actions willfully broke the law and are not simply the result of a mistake, negligence or bad judgment. It has been a consistently tough burden for federal prosecutors to meet across both Democratic and Republican administrations, with the Justice Department declining criminal charges against police officers in other high-profile cases in recent years, including in the deaths of Eric Garner in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In Rice's case, the Justice Department said poor-quality surveillance video recorded in the area where the shooting took place prevented prosecutors from being able to conclusively determine whether Rice was or was not reaching for his toy gun just prior to being shot. The two officers who were investigated told authorities soon after the shooting that Rice was reaching for the gun prior to being shot and was given multiple commands to show his hands. But the video, while grainy, shows what prosecutors need to know, said Zoe Salzman, an attorney with Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel, which is working with Rice's family. \"It is very clear on the most important points,\" she said, adding that the officers' claims they gave Rice commands were proven untrue, and prosecutors included them as fact. The letter from the Rice family's attorneys said the Justice Department's explanation was designed to make the case seem as \"complicated as possible,\" in an effort to run out the clock on certain federal charges. The letter asks that federal prosecutors convene a grand jury to consider charges against the police officers. Salzman said the family hopes Cleveland would also reconsider charges but feels its best chance is with the federal government. \"All the Rice family is asking for here is a chance for justice,\" she said. \"Again and again politics trump justice. All they asked for is an honest investigation and a fair presentation of the evidence to a grand jury.\"",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has circulated a list of demands for voting legislation among his Democratic colleagues, indicating he may be willing to consider a revised version of the sweeping voting and elections reform bill that the Senate will take up at the end of the month. Manchin\u00a0previously expressed his opposition to S. 1, known as the For the People Act, raising concerns about passing partisan voting legislation. Supporters of the bill note that several Republican-led states are advancing laws that would restrict voting rights along party lines, and say that S. 1 is necessary to counter these actions. Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he had shared with his colleagues \"things I can support and vote with\" in the For the People Act. \"People were assuming that I was against S. 1, because there was no Republicans supporting it. That's not the case at all,\" Manchin said. \"I said basically, you should not pass any type of a voter bill in the most divisive time of our life unless you have some unity on this thing, because you just divide the country further.\" According to a copy of the list obtained by CBS News, these areas of support include provisions banning partisan gerrymandering and mandating at least 15 consecutive days of early voting for federal elections. Manchin's list also includes areas of compromise relating to ethics and campaign finance. However, he supports some provisions that could be unpopular with progressive Democrats, such as requiring a voter ID with \"allowable alternatives\" for providing proof of identity to vote and allowing elections officials to purge voter rolls. He also does not appear to support no-excuse mail-in voting, although he would want to require states to send absentee ballots to eligible voters ahead of an election. The list also does not address one of the most controversial campaign finance portions of the bill, which would provide public financing for congressional elections. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday began the process to bring the legislation to the Senate floor for consideration next week. In a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, Schumer said that \"we Democrats wish a voting rights bill would be bipartisan,\" but added that \"Washington Republicans seem dead set against all remedies.\" \"The idea that we can have some kind of bipartisan solution to this partisan attack on democracy befuddles me,\" Schumer said. Schumer told reporters later on Thursday that the Senate would vote on a motion to proceed with the bill next Tuesday. Manchin is currently the lone Democrat who is not a co-sponsor of the bill. He told reporters on Thursday that he had been in contact with Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist, to discuss the bill, along with other stakeholders.\u00a0 \"I've been working across the aisle with all the Republicans trying to get people to understand that that's the bedrock of our democracy \u2014 an accessible, fair, and basically secured voting,\" Manchin said. Abrams threw her support behind the bill on Thursday, but Republican Senator Roy Blunt said this endorsement was proof that even an amended bill would be too liberal. \"Stacey Abrams immediately endorsed Sen. Manchin's proposal, it became the Stacey Abrams substitute, not the Joe Manchin substitute,\" Blunt said in a press conference. Some Senate Democrats appeared encouraged by Manchin's list, seeing it as proof that the moderate Democrat is willing to work with his colleagues on the issue. Senator Jeff Merkley, who introduced the bill, told reporters on Wednesday that he believed Manchin was \"making a really valuable contribution by being engaged on such important issues like defending the right of freedom of every American to vote.\" Senator Raphael Warnock said that he supported Manchin's changes, adding that \"we are making considerable progress.\" The Democrat from Georgia has been a harsh critic of the restrictive voting measure passed in his state by the Republican legislature and signed into law by the Republican governor this year. \"We might squabble about one or two things but I am not about to sacrifice the good in pursuit of the perfect,\" Warnock said. Senator Brian Schatz told reporters that he believed it was a \"thoughtful proposal\" and \"a move in the right direction.\" However, he and other Democrats have previously raised concerns about any amended bill being blocked by the filibuster. Manchin has repeatedly said he would not support eliminating the filibuster, which would allow legislation to pass in the Senate with a simple majority of votes. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told reporters Thursday that he was concerned about provisions that weren't included in Manchin's list. \"What he includes is by and large, good. What he excludes is troublesome,\" Durbin said. Manchin's list also included demands for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which has not yet been introduced, but would restore a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. Manchin's demands for this bill include decreasing the attorney general's authority in determining whether a state or jurisdiction violated voting rights and establishing \"objective measures\" for determining whether a state or jurisdiction has a pattern of discrimination. Manchin presented his proposal to his fellow Democrats in a meeting on Thursday afternoon, in a conversation that Senator Tim Kaine said was \"very promising.\" \"He gave a really good presentation about it,\" Kaine said. But even if Manchin's changes to S. 1 were implemented, it's unclear whether that bill would garner any support whatsoever from Republicans, who are unilaterally opposed. Since the bill would require 60 votes to advance in the Senate and Democrats only hold 50 seats, the measure would fail even with Manchin's support unless it got support from 10 Republicans \u2014 which seems increasingly unlikely. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Thursday that he would not support a revised bill, saying \"it still retains S. 1's rotten core.\" But Manchin seemed unfazed by McConnell's opposition, telling reporters that \"McConnell has a right to do whatever he thinks he can do.\" \"I would hope that there's enough good Republicans who understand the bedrock of our society is having an accessible, fair open, election,\" Manchin said. Manchin also noted to reporters earlier on Thursday that Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski had expressed support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, meaning that only nine more Republicans would be needed in order for it to advance. \"The bottom line is you just got to keep working, you can't give up on this stuff and you just can't separate our country any further,\" he said.

            "article_content": "With voting rights legislation that passed the House this week marching toward a likely death in the Senate, activists are readying for a fight to save it: they're taking on the bill-slaying filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 votes to end debate on a measure. In an evenly split 50-50 Senate, it will always be a struggle to win over 10 senators from the other side.\u00a0 \"Those who won the election, who have the majority are going to be faced with a choice: do they protect voting rights or do they protect the filibuster rule?\" said Stephen Spaulding, senior counsel for public policy & senior adviser at Common Cause. \"I don't think saying, 'Oh, but the filibuster,' is going to cut it.\" The \"For the People Act,\" known as HR1,\u00a0 is a broad bill that would create automatic, same-day, and online voter registration nationwide. It includes some measures that would require states to overhaul their registration systems. It would expand absentee voting, limit the states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process.\u00a0 Democrats argue that efforts underway in Republican state legislatures to tighten voting laws in the wake of the 2020 election \u2014 along with the looming possibility that the conservative-heavy Supreme Court could weaken a key provision of the Voting Rights Act this summer \u2014 make federal legislation imperative.\u00a0 \"The major effort to change state laws to limit access to the ballot needs to be protected by legislation,\" says Robert Brandon, president of the Fair Elections Center. \"Beyond that, there are probably some things the [Biden] administration can do, but it's really the law...that's why legislation like HR1 is so important.\"\u00a0 Republicans unanimously oppose the measure, arguing that it amounts to a federal takeover of state-run elections. Opposition to HR1 is one issue uniting the GOP at this point, even as they disagree about how to move forward as a party in the post-Trump era. It was a key topic of conversation at CPAC last week, and moreover, former Vice President Mike Pence, who has taken pains to remain out of the fray, broke his silence by writing an op-ed urging his party to vote against the measure.\u00a0 On Thursday, Pence cheered Republicans for sticking together in their opposition, tweeting: \"Election Integrity is a National Imperative.\" The legislation is unlikely to garner support from any Republicans, let alone the 10 needed to override a filibuster. And as other legislative debates have shown, the Democratic majority is fragile. A group of 20 U.S. senators have urged President Biden to take executive action. But even their prescriptions acknowledge that there isn't much he can do to beef up voting laws. \"The ability for the executive branch to act in a way through executive action is pretty limited,\" said David Becker, the executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. \"If we want to see new policies regarding access to the ballot, election integrity, funding for elections and election security, that will likely have to come through legislation either at the federal level or like we're seeing in the states.\" As for what Mr. Biden can do, the Brennan Center for Justice wrote in October 2020 that the president could improve cybersecurity and direct more federal agencies to offer voter registration. Spaulding said that the president could also provide more resources for the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act and other voting rights legislation. He applauded the White House for supporting the bill and said the administration needs to \"really use the bully pulpit\" to help pass legislation. South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, the House Democratic Whip and close ally of Biden, told CBS News that while he hasn't spoken with the president recently about issuing an order on voting rights, \"I did say to him more than once that Abraham Lincoln freed slaves with an executive order. Harry Truman integrated armed services with an executive order, so Congress never passed a law to integrate the armed services. Never. So I just think that that is something he must keep in mind going forward.\" He added, \"If Congress refuses to erect the safeguards for voting rights, I just think that executive authority ought to be used to do what can be done.\" The fate of HR1 in the Senate is a reminder of the limits of the Democrats' control of the upper chamber. \"Democrats are not in charge. You've got these filibuster rules and the filibuster seems to be in charge,\" Clyburn said. \"I don't believe we can afford for racial issues to be filibustered.\"\u00a0 Clyburn is hoping the House can pass another piece of voting legislation, The John Lewis Voting Rights Act, around Labor Day. The measure, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon, would restore a key provision in the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013: it required states with a history of discrimination to seek federal approval to change election laws.\u00a0 \"Hopefully, the Senate will not filibuster that. If they do, there is going to be one hell of a price to be paid in next year's elections,\" Clyburn said.\u00a0 In his eulogy for Lewis in July, former President Obama proposed abolishing the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation, calling it \"a Jim Crow relic.\" But President Biden has been reluctant to support eliminating it. When asked Thursday about getting rid of the Senate rule in order to pass HR1 and other measures, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the president's \"policy has not changed on that issue\" and that he wants to find a path forward to work with both parties.\u00a0 It's also true that filibuster reform faces its own uphill battle in the Senate within the Democratic caucus. Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Rules Committee which has oversight over federal elections, supports reforming the filibuster to pass HR1. But West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin on Monday said he's not changing his opposition to killing the filibuster. Without his support, Democrats won't be able to muster the simple majority they would need to eliminate it. \"Never!\" Manchin told reporters who asked if he'd change his mind if the Senate was holding up Democratic legislation. \"Jesus Christ, what don't you understand about 'never'?\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina that aired Sunday, May 2, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina gave the Republican response to President Biden's address to Congress, he joins us now from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Good morning, Senator. SEN. TIM SCOTT: Morning, JOHN, I hope you're doing well. JOHN DICKERSON: I am. Last time we were talking, we got cut a little tight there in conversations about your effort to pass some police reform through the Senate. So we're going to start there today. When we talked, it was in the summer, you were pessimistic. You have recently said you are optimistic about the course of negotiations. What gives you that optimism? SEN. SCOTT: Well, John, let me just say this, one of the reasons why I asked to lead this police reform conversation on my side of the aisle is because I have- I personally understand the- the pain of being stopped 18 times driving while black. I also have seen the- the beauty of when officers go door-to-door with me on Christmas morning delivering presents to- to kids in the most underserved communities. So I think I bring an equilibrium to the conversation. One of the reasons why I'm hopeful is because in a way, this time my friends on the left aren't looking for the issue. They're looking for a solution. And the things that I offered last- last year are more popular this year. That gives me reasons to be hopeful. And frankly, JOHN, I was thinking about this. Think about the parts of the two bills that are in common, data collection. I think through negotiations and conversations, we are now closer on no-knock warrants and chokeholds. And there's something called Section 10.33\u00a0 that has to do with getting government equipment from the military for local police. I think we're making progress there, too. So we have literally been able to bring these two bills very close together. And if we remember, the goal isn't for Republicans or Democrats to win, but for communities to feel safer and our officers to feel respected. If we can accomplish those two major goals, the rest will be history. JOHN DICKERSON: A lot sunnier picture than when we talked during the summer. Let me ask you about the question of qualified immunity. Just to remind people this is a legal framework that on the one hand, some people say protects police who are acting in good faith. Critics say that it's a shield when police cross the line. That has been a major sticking point. You have offered a proposal that says allow civil suits to sue the department and not the individual police officer. Are you finding Democratic support for that? SEN. SCOTT I am actually, which is another reason why I'm more optimistic this time, what we want to do is make sure that the bad apples are punished. And we've seen that through convictions from Michael Slager in 2015 when he shot Walter Scott in the back. And too recently just last several days on the George Floyd convictions. Those are promising signs. But the real question is how do we change the culture of policing? I think we do that by making the employer responsible for the actions of the employee. We do that with doctors. We do that with lawyers. We do that in almost all of our industries. And if we do that in law enforcement, the employer will change the culture. So as opposed to having one officer change or not change, we'll have all officers transforming because the departments are taking on more of that burden. And frankly, as I spoke with the family members on Thursday, they were very receptive to that proposal because what they're looking for is something that shows progress. I think that does it. JOHN DICKERSON: When- when you talk about changing the culture, I wonder what your assessment is of in your own party. How many people think that there is a need for police reform at all? Tucker Carlson is very influential with Republicans. And he quoted you and many others who said after the Chauvin verdict, there's more work to be done. You're talking about changing that culture. And he seemed to think that was not a legitimate position. What's your feeling about that? SEN. SCOTT: Well, one of the reasons why I started our conversation John with reality that as a United States Senator, I've been stopped several times in the last three years in the Capitoll and on the streets throughout the country. So I'm not having a conversation about some theory or philosophy. I'm saying that there is a way for us to restore more confidence from communities of color and say to our officers, we want character-driven officers responding to crises in neighborhoods. Those are two things that we can accomplish. I think my party, significant numbers in my party have already said to me, we will go where you go on this issue as long as I can explain my position. And we're going to do that. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your- your theory about race. You said America is not a racist country. And your response to the president. The president has subsequently said he agrees with you,-- SEN. SCOTT: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON:\u00a0 but you've also said so there's some common ground there. You've also said to suggest there aren't racial challenges and patterns is for someone to be blind.\u00a0 SEN. SCOTT: Yes.\u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: And you've also said that- that the system is breaking the back and breaking the spirit of millions of people in our country. And you're talking about Black Americans who are being affected by that system. So help people understand when you say it's not a racist country, but then you do talk about a system that targets Black Americans. You've talked about it today, help people square those two statements. SEN. SCOTT: Sure. Well, first, let me say thank goodness that finally our president, our vice president and one of the leaders in the Democrat- Democrat caucus in the House, Jim Clyburn, have all come forward and said exactly what I've been saying for a long time. America is not a racist country. The question is, is there a lingering effect after a couple of centuries of racism and discrimination in this nation? The answer is absolutely. The question we should be debating and fighting over is how do we resolve those issues going forward. One side says I'm going to take from some to give to others. Fighting bigotry with bigotry is hypocrisy. It just doesn't work. The second- our side, what I've suggested is let's expand opportunity and make sure that we are fully equipped for the challenges of the future. One of the reasons why we have fought for and won the highest level of funding for historically black colleges, Republicans leading that fight is because I understand that if I could level the playing field in education, we will actually see human flourishing like we've never seen before. JOHN DICKERSON: And senator-\u00a0 SEN. SCOTT: --we focus our attention on health care as we have on sickle cell anemia or on opportunity zones for bringing resources into poor communities. We'll see what we have seen, which is the unemployment rates hitting all time lows for African-Americans, Hispanics, 70 year low for women. Those things actually matter, JOHN. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, but-\u00a0 but when you say there's- one side is talking about taking from one side to the other. I mean, this is, you know, people pay taxes and there's an argument that that the taxes that are paid should go to communities that- that we've seen, especially under COVID-19 have been disproportionately affected and that that's laid bare a lot of the inequities. So you're- you're not saying that then making sure that there's money that goes to those Black communities is a bad thing? SEN. SCOTT: Well, JOHN, let me say it differently. When you pass the Covid package with two trillion dollars of spending and in your package, you hide in there if you are a Black farmer, we will give you resources. But if you are a white farmer, you are excluded from those same resources that's taking from one to give to the other. That's one of the reasons why in the 1990s, the USDA had to pay out the Pigford settlements to Black farmers for taking from them to give to the white farmers. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- SEN. SCOTT:\u00a0 So we're going to reverse that and call that a way of creating fairness in our country? That doesn't really work.\u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Of course, they would argue that- that- that they're trying to deal with that system and the inequities you talk about. But let me ask you about taxes here, because that's a part of this argument too. SEN. SCOTT: Sure. JOHN DICKERSON: The president says 55 of the largest corporations pay no corporate taxes. Polls consistently show 70% of the country thinks that- that the system is tilted towards the powerful. Why is it not- why isn't it just making corporations pay their fair share to inch up the corporate tax rate, as the president has suggested? SEN. SCOTT: Well, the real reason, JOHN, is a simple reason, and this is what I think is kind of stunning that we're missing in the conversation and you asked that of the White House chief of staff recently. Or earlier. We have competition. America has global competitors whose tax rates are lower than we are right now at 21%. Therefore, by taking it to 28%, you actually rebalance the world against American workers. It's one of the reasons why the Biden plan makes wages, suppresses wages long term and slows the growth of our economy because our competition is significantly lower than ours. You cannot compete in a global competition with higher taxes versus lower taxes and expect to win more of the contracts. That's kind of simple. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get your- you on the record about one final thing, if I may, Senator.\u00a0 SEN. SCOTT: Yes, sir. JOHN DICKERSON: You talked about having an honest conversation about common sense and common ground. Seventy percent of your- your party think that Joe Biden is illegitimate because the election was stolen. How do you have common ground with that belief? SEN. SCOTT: Well, by moving on. The election is over. Joe- Joe Biden is a president of the United.\u00a0 And now, what we have to wrestle with-- JOHN DICKERSON: The legitimate president? SEN. SCOTT: Of course he is! Well, now, what we have to wrestle with is can we spend six to six and a half trillion dollars and raise taxes by four to four and a half trillion dollars and create a better America?\u00a0 JOHN DICKERSON: Alright, Senator. SEN. SCOTT: My answer is no, because the American government-- JOHN DICKERSON: We're going to have to-- SEN. SCOTT: --can't be responsible for everything. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator, thank you so much. We got to go there and we'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Congressman John Lewis' death last year\u00a0galvanized many Democrats to honor the memory of the civil rights icon by working to pass comprehensive voting rights legislation, and inspired some to endorse eliminating the filibuster to allow these measures to be approved by a simple majority. During his\u00a0eulogy at Lewis' funeral, former President Obama said it was necessary to end the filibuster, calling it a \"Jim Crow relic.\" While the use of the filibuster long predates the Jim Crow laws of the 20th century, it was used extensively by senators from the South\u00a0to block civil rights legislation. \"You want to honor John? Let's honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for,\" Mr. Obama said, referring to the Voting Rights Act. As a young civil rights activist, Lewis was beaten and nearly killed while leading a peaceful march for voting rights across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965. Now, exactly one year after Lewis' death, voting rights legislation remains stalled in Congress, despite Democrats holding a narrow majority in the Senate. The fight to strengthen voting rights has gained more urgency among Democrats in recent months, as several\u00a0Republican-led states\u00a0have\u00a0considered\u00a0or\u00a0enacted\u00a0a raft of bills limiting voting access in the wake of former President Trump's electoral loss and his repeated false claims about voter fraud. Although the bills' supporters argue that these restrictive measures are necessary to counter voter irregularities, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, and critics note that these bills disproportionately affect poorer and minority voters. The Supreme Court last month also\u00a0upheld voting restrictions\u00a0in Arizona, finding that\u00a0two voting rules\u00a0in the battleground state do not violate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. This decision also\u00a0reignited calls\u00a0for Congress to pass meaningful legislation protecting voting rights. The House in March approved the For the People Act, a sweeping voting and elections reform bill, but it was blocked in the Senate last month. Lewis had helped to craft several of the provisions of the For the People Act, which would have been the greatest overhaul of election laws in a generation. The bill, if passed, would revamp government ethics and campaign finance laws and seek to strengthen voting rights through measures such as automatic voter registration and expand access to early and absentee voting. Another bill in the works, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was named for Lewis, would restore a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the Justice Department before making changes to their voting rules. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act has not yet been written or introduced, but members of a House subcommittee have held multiple field hearings in recent months to gather evidence of discrimination. The bill is expected to be considered as early as this fall. So far, it only has support from one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski. \u00a0 Lawmakers and activists are continuing to press for passage of the two bills. Ohio Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, was\u00a0arrested on Thursday\u00a0along with eight activists while demonstrating for voting rights on Capitol Hill. Beatty will also participate in a vigil honoring Lewis on Saturday evening, organized by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, MoveOn and other activist groups, calling on Congress to pass voting legislation in his honor. \"You can arrest me. You can't stop me. You can't silence me,\" Beatty\u00a0wrote on Twitter\u00a0after her arrest. Attorney General Merrick Garland also called on Congress to act, in a statement remembering Lewis on Saturday. He said the Justice Department is \"using all the tools at its disposal to protect the voting rights of all citizens, but that is not enough.\" \"We need Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would provide the Department with important tools to protect the right to vote and to ensure that every vote is counted. There is no more fitting way to honor the profound legacy of Congressman Lewis,\" Garland said. Legislation must receive 60 votes in the Senate in order to advance, and Democrats only hold a 50-seat majority. This means that any voting rights legislation would require support from 10 Republicans. Some Democrats have called for eliminating the filibuster altogether, or creating a carve-out to filibuster rules specifically for voting rights legislation, which would allow the measures to pass with a simple majority. However, at least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have expressed public opposition to ending the filibuster. Without support from all 50 Democrats, there is no way to enact the rule change. Manchin met on Thursday with a group of Texas House Democrats who\u00a0fled their state\u00a0in an effort to block controversial bills restricting voting rights. The Texas legislators have been meeting with lawmakers in Washington to convince them to pass federal voting rights protections. \"We work with the Voting Rights Act that we had, started in 1965, and what we've evolved into, and basically make a piece of legislation, one piece of legislation that protects the rights of voting, the procedure of voting, democracy, the guardrails on democracy, that's all,\" Manchin told reporters after the meeting. \"And there shouldn't be a Republican or Democrat who should oppose it.\" Manchin argued that the universal Republican opposition to the For the People Act was because it was too broad, and said that he believed they would be willing to support a narrower voting bill. However, it appears unlikely that the bill will garner any more particular support, particularly since Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has come out in opposition to it. Meanwhile, President Biden has stopped short of calling for eliminating the filibuster, even as he has highlighted the importance of passing voting rights legislation. In a speech in Philadelphia last week, he called the fight against restrictive voting measures the \"most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.\" \"The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real,\" the president said. \"It's unrelenting. We're going to challenge it vigorously.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping elections and ethics reform bill on Tuesday, dealing a significant blow to Democratic efforts to secure voting rights protections on the federal level. But the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that the fight to pass voting rights legislation is not over. The bill, known as the For the People Act, failed along party lines in a 50-50 vote, far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The legislation was Democrats' answer to restrictive voting measures enacted in Republican-led states following the 2020 presidential election. Despite its failure and Republicans' staunch opposition, Democratic leaders say they have several options to move forward with strengthening voting rights. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is\u00a0leading the Biden administration's efforts\u00a0on voting rights, said in a statement on Tuesday that \"we will not give in, and we will continue the fight to strengthen the right to vote.\" \"We will fortify and expand the nationwide coalition on voting rights, and promote voter engagement and registration nationwide. We will lift up leaders in the states who are working to stop anti-voter legislation, and work with leaders in Congress to advance federal legislation that will strengthen voting rights,\" Harris said. \"I want to be clear that our Administration remains determined to work with Congress to pass the For The People Act, and we will keep working with Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\" Harris said ahead of a meeting with voting rights activists on Wednesday that \"the fact is our fight does not look very different than it did yesterday.\" \"It's about what we can do to uplift all the voices around stopping legislation that is in process, but also addressing what must happen in those states where legislation has already passed to empower voters, and to navigate the system that has been tampered with,\" she said. In a speech on the Senate floor after the vote on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"the fight to protect voting rights is not over.\" \"In the fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish line,\" Schumer said, adding that \"it will not be the last time that voting rights comes up for a debate in this Senate.\" He noted that all 50 Democrats in the Senate voted to advance the bill, saying that it showed the party was \"unified.\" Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced he would support advancing the legislation just hours ahead of the vote, after some of his suggested changes were added to the bill. \"We have several serious options for how to reconsider this issue and advance legislation to combat voter suppression. We are going to explore every last one of our options,\" Schumer said. \"So we will not let it go. We will not let it die.\" President Biden also vowed to fight on in a statement on Tuesday. \"This fight is far from over \u2014 far from over,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've been engaged in this work my whole career, and we are going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again \u2014 for the people, for our very democracy.\" Some progressives have pushed for eliminating the filibuster in order to pass voting rights legislation, which would lower the threshold for advancing legislation from 60 votes to a simple majority. However, some Democrats have expressed an unwillingness to end the filibuster, including Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters on Wednesday that he was not yet ready to support changing filibuster rules to pass voting rights legislation. \"We are still working on a bill with Joe Manchin that scales back some of the items in S1 that were objectionable to the Republicans. I'd still like to find a bill where we can find some consensus,\" King said. \"I think we're going to give them a few more chances to try to solve a problem.\" With the filibuster in place, Democrats have the option of breaking the massive For the People Act into smaller bills, some of which may receive sufficient support from Republicans. In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who voted against advancing the bill, nevertheless said that she believed it had some \"noteworthy goals\" and provisions that she \"absolutely\" would support, such as expanding early voting and making absentee voting and voter registration easier. Murkowski will also be a sponsor of the\u00a0John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. But the bill, named for the late congressman and civil rights icon, will likely not be considered until the fall, as the House is still gathering the evidence sufficient to prove that jurisdictions have patterns of voting discrimination. Democrats plan to write and introduce it after that evidence is gathered, and House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries said Wednesday that the House will likely vote on the bill this fall. It is also unclear whether any other Republicans will join Murkowski in supporting the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has vehemently opposed it, calling it \"unnecessary.\" There are also other, smaller bills related to elections that may be considered this year. Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock introduced a bill on Tuesday to strengthen protections for election workers and limit arbitrary removals of election officials. Warnock's bill is a direct response to a controversial voting restrictions law enacted in his state, which includes a provision allowing for election officials to be removed by a state board whose members would be appointed by the Republican-led state legislature. As of mid-May, state legislators have enacted at least 22 bills with restrictive voting provisions in 14 states, according to the\u00a0Brennan Center for Justice.

            "article_content": "Congressional Democrats are facing increasing pressure to enact voting rights legislation after the Supreme Court on Thursday upheld voting restrictions in Arizona. This comes as several Republican-led states have considered or enacted a raft of bills limiting voting access in the wake of former President Trump's electoral loss. The decision from the court, which split 6-3 along ideological lines, found that\u00a0two voting rules\u00a0in the battleground state of Arizona do not violate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. The opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, also outlined several factors to be considered when weighing future challenges under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which could make it more difficult to challenge restrictive state election laws. In several key battleground states controlled by Republicans, many with changing demographics, bills restricting voting rights were introduced amid Mr. Trump's repeated lies that the presidential election was stolen. Although the bills' supporters argue that these restrictive measures are necessary to counter voter irregularities, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, and critics note that these bills disproportionately affect poorer and minority voters. President Biden condemned the Supreme Court's decision in a statement on Thursday, calling on Congress to pass measures to shore up the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was largely undone by the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 and further weakened by the Arizona ruling. \"The Court's decision, harmful as it is, does not limit Congress' ability to repair the damage done today: it puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength,\" Mr. Biden said. Congressional Democrats also swiftly condemned the ruling, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that the opinion \"only further underscore the need for Congress to act to preserve democracy.\" \"It is simply unconscionable that the Court's conservative majority chose to double down on their gutting of the Voting Rights Act, failing to properly respond to a wave of restrictive and discriminatory laws in the wake of Shelby and a flood of suppressive laws that have followed President Trump's Big Lie about the November election,\" Schumer said. However, any efforts to overhaul voting rights in Congress will face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow majority with 50 seats. Republicans last month blocked a procedural vote to advance a sweeping voting reforms bill in the Senate, with the 50-50 vote falling far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The bill, known as the For the People Act or S.1, would be the greatest overhaul of election laws in a generation, revamping government ethics and campaign finance laws and seeking to strengthen voting rights through measures such as automatic voter registration and expanding access to early and absentee voting. But Republicans have assailed the bill as a power grab by Democrats, and argued that it would amount to federal overreach. Democrats have also pinned their hopes for election reform on the\u00a0John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which so far has the support of a single Senate Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski. The bill has not yet been introduced, but would restore a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the Justice Department before making changes to their voting rules. In a statement on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to counter the Supreme Court's rulings on voting rights and on campaign finance. \"The For The People would be a remedy for the assault on the vote and on our democracy, and would prevent the disasters in both cases. We also need H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to combat the brazen voter suppression threatening to erode our democracy,\" Pelosi said. Congressional Democrats are already moving quickly to get the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act written and passed by the fall. A House subcommittee is conducting field hearings to compile evidence of discriminatory practices that will then be shared with the Judiciary Committee, which will do the markup for the bill. \"Congress must act where the Court has failed voters across the country. The House Judiciary Committee will expeditiously complete its work on an updated John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and move to bring legislation to the House floor as quickly as possible,\" House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler and Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Chair Steve Cohen said in a statement on Thursday. The Congressional Black Caucus earlier this week pushed for the hearings on the bill to be completed this month so that it can be taken up by early fall.\u00a0 \"The U.S. Supreme Court decision is another attempt to disenfranchise American voters. The CBC, the conscience of the congress, will not be silent, and we will use every legislative avenue we have to pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, to strengthen our voting laws and expand ballot access for eligible voters,\" the caucus said in a statement on Friday. Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who introduced the bill in the last Congress and is expected to do so again for the updated bill, also said in a statement that she is \"hard at work crafting with the House Judiciary Committee and stakeholder groups.\" But Republicans have also raised concerns about the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, arguing that it would result in undue federal interference in states' election administration. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has come out against the bill, calling it \"unnecessary.\" Nikole Killion and Melissa Quinn contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "A group of Democratic state lawmakers from Texas on Tuesday pressured U.S. senators to pass two major voting bills that have been stalled.\u00a0 The Texas Democrats who traveled to Washington this week were part of a group of lawmakers who staged a walkout in the closing hours of the state's legislative session last month to defeat a sweeping election bill Republicans in the state were trying to pass. They met Tuesday with Congressional Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and spoke at the Senate Democrats' lunch. \"These Texas Democrats bravely fought against voter suppression,\" Schumer said. \"They must have gotten five or six standing ovations. We were really taken by their courage, their bravery and, most importantly, their mission.\" The Texas Democrats are urging their counterparts in the Senate to pass the For The People Act, a sweeping election reform bill passed by the House earlier this year. The bill would require states to overhaul voter registration systems, expand access to early and mail voting, revise campaign finance laws and reform the redistricting process. The lawmakers are also asking Congress to eventually pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to receive pre-clearance before changing voting rules.\u00a0 \"We came here because the future of Texas voting depends on action from Congress,\" Texas state Representative Nicole Collier told reporters. \"We need federal intervention. The For the People Act will be a great compliment, and start, to stopping this assault on our rights.\" The Texas lawmakers argue that the For the People Act is necessary to block Republican efforts to rewrite the voting laws in the Lone Star State. While Democrats blocked a major voting bill at the end of May, Governor Greg Abbott has pledged to call a special session to take up election reform.\u00a0 The Texas bill that was defeated last month would have set limits on early voting hours, banned drive-through voting, added new requirements for mail voting and made it a felony for public officials to send unsolicited absentee ballot applications. Republicans have said the bill is necessary to support election integrity, despite no evidence of widespread fraud in Texas' election. The focus for Democrats centers on Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who said last week that he does not support the For The People Act. Manchin did not attend Tuesday's lunch with Senate Democrats, but some of the Texas lawmakers met with Manchin's staff. \"I left there with hope and inspiration and with an invitation to come back and meet once again,\" Texas state Representative Trey Martinez Fischer told reporters. \"One thing was very clear from that meeting with Senator Manchin's office: voting practices in West Virginia are way different than voting practices in Texas.\" Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who also did not attend Tuesday's Democratic lunch, are opposed to eliminating the filibuster, which would allow bills to pass the Senate with 51 votes. Democrats currently have 50 seats in the Senate and Vice President Kamala Harris can cast any tie-breaking vote.\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said again on Tuesday that there won't be any Republicans who support the For the People Act, meaning Democrats will need every single vote. \"Think of this as exactly what it is: a partisan effort by the majority to take over at the federal level how we conduct all American elections,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"The core desire they have is to federalize all elections and try to achieve a benefit for the Democrats at the expense of the Republicans.\" The Texas lawmakers are scheduled to meet with Harris on Wednesday. President Biden recently tapped Harris to lead the administration's effort on voting rights. She told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Biden is ready to sign into law both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Georgia NAACP and voting rights organizations on Monday filed a lawsuit to block a sweeping new law in Georgia that imposes new restrictions on voting, the latest in a slew of legal battles expected to take aim at the measure. The suit was filed in the federal district court in Atlanta just days after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the GOP-backed measure into law. The law is the first to usher in new changes to voting procedures following the 2020 presidential election, which former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence was rigged against him and rife with widespread voter fraud. \"The thinly-veiled attempt to roll back the progress we have made to empower Georgians \u2014 to use their voices in the democratic process \u2014 creates an arbitrary law that does not improve voter confidence, secure election integrity nor increase access to the ballot box,\" the Reverend James Woodall, state president of Georgia NAACP, said in a statement. The coalition of groups challenging the law argue it is the \"culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color\" by the Republican-led legislature after demographic changes in Georgia led to statewide Democratic wins, most recently in the state's presidential race and two Senate races, which flipped the balance of power in the upper chamber. \"Unable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,\" the suit alleges. \"In other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end.\" These effort, the groups argue, violate the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting rules that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Georgia's elections law requires providing a driver's license or state ID number or photocopy of an ID to vote absentee by mail and limits the time people have to request an absentee ballot. It also restricts the locations of ballot drop boxes and when they can be accessed, and expands early voting on weekends. The new law also bans people from delivering food or drinks to people within 150 feet of a polling site, but allows for self-service water. The measure makes changes to the State Election Board, which the NAACP argues effectively grants the board the power to take over county election boards. While Republicans argue the voting overhaul will restore confidence in the integrity of Georgia's elections, Democrats say it restricts voting access and disproportionately harms Black and Latino voters. On Thursday, President Biden called the election bills spearheaded by Republicans in Georgia and other states in the wake of the November election \"un-American\" and \"sick.\" More than 250 bills that would restrict voting access have been introduced in 43 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Mr. Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation that would effectively counter the state-level efforts from Republicans to change voting rules and said the Justice Department is \"taking a look\" at the Georgia law. The NAACP lawsuit marks the second legal challenge to Georgia's elections law. On Thursday, a coalition of voting and civil rights groups sued Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the State Election Board in the Northern District of Georgia. The suit argues the law was \"clearly intended to and will have the effect of making it harder for lawful Georgia voters to participate in the state's elections\" and will \"impose these unjustifiable burdens disproportionately on the state's minority, young, poor and disabled citizens.\" Following the general election, Mr. Trump and some Georgia Republicans claimed there was mass voter fraud in the state's election after Mr. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992. Two recounts affirmed Mr. Biden's win and a signature audit found no widespread fraud.\u00a0 Still, Kemp said Thursday after signing the bill into law that \"significant reforms to our state elections were needed\" following the November election. The law takes another step towards ensuring Georgia's elections \"are secure, accessible and fair,\" he said. Raffensperger has defended Georgia's elections system over the claims of voter fraud mounted by Mr. Trump and rebuffed pressure from the former president to overturn the results of the presidential election. In a statement Friday, Raffensperger, too, defended Georgia's new law and shot back at critics who say the changes amount to voter suppression. \"The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring as hollow as the continuously debunked claims of 'mass voter fraud' in Georgia's 2020 election,\" he said. \"We don't have systemic voter suppression, and we don't have mass voter fraud. What we have is systemic lies for political gain that have led to a loss of public confidence in our elections.\"",

            "article_content": "The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act passed the House on Tuesday, with the 219-212 vote going along party lines. The bill, named after the late Georgia representative, would restore a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that was gutted by the Supreme Court. It would require certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the Justice Department before making changes to their voting rules.\u00a0 The bill, also known as H.R. 4, now heads to the Senate, where it faces stiff GOP resistance. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called it \"unnecessary,\" and said it would give the Justice Department too much power over states. With an evenly divided Senate, all 50 Democrats and at least 10 Republicans would need to vote for the bill for it to pass. Several House Democrats spoke after the vote Tuesday evening, with Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty saying of the bill: \"It stands for a more just society, for a better democracy and today we voted for the future of America.\" Vice President Kamala Harris issued a statement following the passage.\u00a0 \"Congressman John Lewis was an American hero who dedicated his life to fighting for our nation's highest ideals. Today, the House of Representatives honored Congressman Lewis by passing his namesake legislation, which restores and expands the historic Voting Rights Act,\" her statement said. \"This important step represents progress, but there is more work to do. The Senate must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act so it can become the law of the land and protect voters across the country.\" Several voting rights groups applauded the House vote. \"Along with the For The People Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would secure the right to vote for all Americans, prevent racist gerrymandering and move America closer to equal representation for all,\" March On for Voting Rights said in a statement. \"These bills now sit with the Senate, where they are subject to the filibuster \u2014 a Jim Crow relic that enables a minority of Senators, who represent as little as 34 percent of voters, to block legislation favored by the majority.\" When We All Vote Executive Director Stephanie L. Young wrote in a statement, \"Today the House stepped up to help rewrite the wrongs of the past by voting to restore protections for all American voters to freely exercise their right to vote. Now, the Senate must act to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act.\" Lewis'\u00a0death last year\u00a0was seen as a call by many Democrats to honor the memory of the civil rights icon and work to pass comprehensive voting rights legislation, and his death inspired some to endorse eliminating the filibuster to allow these measures to be approved by a simple majority. Such a move has been staunchly opposed by more moderate Democrats, such as Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Since former President Donald Trump lost his bid for reelection in November, several Republican-led states have sought to pass legislation limiting voting access. Advocates of such bills argue that they are necessary to counter voter irregularities \u2013 although no significant voter irregularities were reported in the 2020 election. In June, the Supreme Court\u00a0upheld voting restrictions\u00a0in Arizona, finding that\u00a0two voting rules\u00a0in the battleground state do not violate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senator Joe Manchin met with leaders of several civil rights organizations on Tuesday morning, two days after the moderate Democrat from West Virginia announced\u00a0he would not support an expansive but controversial voting rights and elections reform bill.\u00a0 Manchin's public opposition has all but doomed H.R. 1, known as the For the People Act, which the Senate will still consider later this month amid sweeping efforts by Republican-led states to pass laws restricting voting rights. Participants in Tuesday's virtual meeting included NAACP President Derrick Johnson, National Urban League President Marc Morial, and Reverend Al Sharpton; as well as representatives from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, National Council of Negro Women and National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. Manchin told reporters after the meeting that it was \"very productive\" and \"very informative,\" and that participants \"had a constructive conversation.\" He said that \"everyone's position was discussed,\" but also acknowledged he didn't believe anyone changed their stance. \"I'm very much concerned about our democracy and protecting people's voting rights, making sure that's done,\" Manchin said, adding that he was going to \"continue conversations\" with these leaders going forward. In a joint statement, the civil rights leaders who met with Manchin also called it a \"very constructive meeting,\" and said that they urged the senator to support the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore provisions in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 knocked down by the Supreme Court. \"The two voting rights bills are a top priority and essential to protect the freedom to vote. There continues to be an unprecedented partisan wave of state legislative proposals that are aimed at denying the right to vote \u2014 particularly for Black and Brown people,\" the leaders said in their statement. \"The leaders also conveyed to Senator Manchin that a minority of senators must not be able to abuse the filibuster to impede much needed progress. Congress must act so all Americans have meaningful access to the ballot.\" Manchin expressed his opposition to the bill in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0for the Charleston Gazette-Mail published Sunday, and reiterated that he would not support eliminating the filibuster, which would allow legislation to advance in the Senate with a simple majority. Sixty votes are currently required to limit debate on a bill and overcome a filibuster. As Democrats only hold 50 seats in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any tie-breaking vote, this means that most legislation needs support from 10 Republicans to advance. Many of Democrats' priorities, including voting rights legislation, are unable to garner sufficient Republican support. In an interview with CBS News after the meeting on Tuesday, Johnson said that he was \"encouraged\" by Manchin's willingness to \"have a dialogue\" and by his support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. \"We got a sense in talking to him that he understands the gravity of the moment, the urgency of the moment and his willingness to figure out a solution. Quite frankly, he's conflicted. He understands the need to protect the right to vote, but he is committed to the procedural rules of the Senate,\" Johnson said. In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Manchin said he believes Republicans will work with their Democratic counterparts to craft a voting rights bill that can pass the upper chamber with support from both parties. \"I'm going to fight for this, and I think the Republicans will fight for this and understand we must come together on a voting rights bill in a bipartisan way,\" he said. Manchin does support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, or H.R. 4, which would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. \u00a0That provision required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to receive approval, known as preclearance, from the federal government before making changes to their voting rules. This bill has the support of at least one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, but it's unclear whether she will be joined by any other GOP senators. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came out in opposition to the bill on Tuesday, indicating that it is incredibly unlikely that the bill will garner sufficient Republican support. Despite Manchin's opposition to the For the People Act, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is still expected to bring the bill to the floor for a vote at the end of June. Some Democrats have argued in favor of prioritizing H.R. 4, or slimming down the For the People Act to excise the more controversial portions. But others want to ratchet up the pressure on Manchin and other potential holdouts. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who has previously advocated for creating an exception in the filibuster for civil rights legislation, told reporters on Monday that he had spoken to Manchin about voting rights legislation. He countered Manchin's argument about the need to pass bipartisan voting rights legislation, saying \"that's an interesting thing to say in light of the fact that we are seeing all of these decidedly partisan bills coming out of state legislatures.\" \"I think that Joe Manchin understands that this is a defining moment in American history, and that our children are going to judge us, our grandchildren are going to judge us based on what we do right now,\" Warnock said. \"I'm committed as ever to make sure that we preserve voting rights in this country. And if we as Senators fail to do that, we have failed in the most fundamental way.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to Democratic colleagues on Tuesday that passing H.R. 4 was not a sufficient substitute for the For the People Act. \"H.R. 4 must be passed, but it will not be ready until the fall, and it is not a substitute for H.R. 1. Congressman John Lewis wrote 300 pages of H.R. 1 to end voter suppression. H.R. 1/S. 1 must be passed now. It would be our hope to have this pass the House and Senate in a bipartisan way,\" Pelosi said. Manchin will also continue to face pressure from voting rights activists. The voting rights group Fair Fight Action, headed by activist and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, announced a month-long campaign to help mobilize young voters of color around the For the People Act. Reverend William Barber II, who leads the Poor People's Campaign, tweeted on Monday that his organization would lead a \"Moral March on Manchin\" in West Virginia in support of the bill. Legislators in 48 states have introduced more than 380 bills that would restrict voting rights,\u00a0according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Changes to voting procedures in several states, including Georgia, Arizona and Florida, have already been signed into law, while a\u00a0bill overhauling elections in Texas\u00a0has been temporarily stalled.

            "article_content": "Mark McCloskey, a St. Louis personal injury lawyer who gained national attention after he and his wife waved guns at racial injustice protesters who marched near their home last summer, said Tuesday he will run for the U.S. Senate in 2022.  McCloskey made the announcement on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News. Earlier Tuesday, the Federal Election Commission's website showed \"Mark McCloskey for Missouri\" was registered, and a website, mccloskeyforsenate.com, was seeking campaign donations.  \"God came knocking on my door last summer disguised as an angry mob,\" McCloskey told Carlson. \"And it really did wake me up.\"  Incumbent Missouri Republican Roy Blunt announced in March he wouldn't seek a third term. McCloskey will seek the Republican nomination against two contenders with strong name recognition: Former Govenor Eric Greitens, who resigned from office amid a sex scandal in 2018, and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt. Several members of Congress are weighing runs in heavily-Republican Missouri. Five lesser-known Democrats also have announced Senate bids.  Mark and Patricia McCloskey became celebrities in conservative circles - and were vilified among Democrats - after the incident on June 28 outside their lavish home in St. Louis' Central West End.  Demonstrators were marching to the home of then-Mayor Lyda Krewson amid nationwide protests after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. The protesters ventured onto a private street that includes the McCloskey mansion. The couple, both of them attorneys in their early 60s, said they felt threatened after protesters broke down an iron gate and ignored a \"No Trespassing\" sign. Protest leaders denied damaging the gate and said the march was peaceful.  Mark McCloskey came out of his home with an AR-15-style rifle and Patricia McCloskey emerged with a semiautomatic handgun. Cellphone video captured the confrontation. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, charged them with unlawful use of a weapon. A grand jury in October indicted them on the same charge and added an evidence tampering charge. The indictment states that a semiautomatic pistol was altered in a way that \"obstructed the prosecution of Patricia McCloskey\" on the weapons charge. The McCloskey case drew former President Donald Trump's attention,\u00a0notes CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV. McCloskey, who campaigned for Mr. Trump, said he's hoping for his endorsement but added that he hasn't spoken to the former president about his candidacy. In the campaign video, McCloskey says it's time stand against \"cancel culture\" and protect Second Amendment rights. He also called systemic racism \"a lie.\"\u00a0 \"This is a country that is open to all races, all nationalities, all religions, but the point is you come here, you work hard, we all pull in the same direction and that high tide floats all boats. That's why when people say there is systemic racism, maybe that's an excuse,\" McCloskey told KMOV. The couple contended the charges against them were politically motivated. They spoke via video at last year's Republican National Convention. Republican Missouri Governor Mike Parson has said he would pardon the McCloskeys if they're convicted. Their case is due to go to trial in November, but Gardner's office won't be prosecuting it. A judge sent the case to a special prosecutor because Gardner made reference to the case in fundraising emails during her successful bid for reelection in 2020.",

            "article_content": "When Congress meets to certify presidential elections, it's normally ceremonial and smooth. Wednesday was anything but when lawmakers gathered to count electoral votes from November's balloting. The session was met with chaos as supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol, forced buildings into lockdown and infiltrated offices and chambers. As videos and images emerged of the protest-turned-riot, a picture came into focus of how the assault was handled \u2014 and how that contrasted with the management of the racial injustice protests that swept through the nation during many of the months before.\u00a0 Around 2 p.m., protesters made their way inside the Capitol building, where Congress was meeting to finish counting the electoral votes. The process was halted and the building was put under lockdown as Trump supporters broke windows and attempted to force their way inside.\u00a0 Congressional members were evacuated and soon after, demonstrators ransacked offices and the Senate chamber. Photos show many of them stealing documents and artifacts from the building, including a podium.\u00a0 It took hours for the National Guard to be deployed to the scene. At day's end, Metro D.C. police reported that four people died during the chaos, including one woman who was shot by police. She was later identified as Ashli Babbitt. Police said the employee who shot Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave pending the result of an investigation. More than 52 people were arrested, most for violations related to a 6 p.m. curfew imposed by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.\u00a0 While police did deploy tear gas and hold the line against rioters in some instances, many images appeared to show officers communicating peacefully with protesters, some even taking selfies with them, and declining to use violent tactics. As a result, they faced criticism for taking a less aggressive stance than they did towards Black Lives Matter protesters over the summer.\u00a0 Bowser on Thursday called the response from Capitol Police a failure and called for an investigation into the apparent disparity. \"We must also understand why the federal law enforcement response was much stronger during the Black Lives Matter protests,\" Bowser said. President-elect Joe Biden released a similar sentiment, saying that the rioters should not be called protesters, but \"domestic terrorists.\"\u00a0 \"No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,\" Biden said. \"We all know that's true, and it is unacceptable.\"\u00a0 Earlier Thursday, Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund defended his department's actions, saying \"law enforcement partners responded valiantly when faced with thousands of individuals involved in violent riotous actions as they stormed the United States Capitol Building.\" Hours later, he resigned, a spokesperson said.\u00a0 The siege occurred after months marked by racial injustice protests, some of which were marred by violence. At least 771 people were killed by police\u00a0in the first eight months of 2020. Roughly 21% of them were Black \u2014 a statistic that played a large part in the nationwide outrage.\u00a0 Thousands of people spent months demonstrating against racial injustice, and CBS News and its affiliates reported on dozens of instances of people getting injured, sometimes fatally, in interactions with police while doing so. Many officials criticized the protests, including Mr. Trump, who insisted some of protesters were \"thugs.\" \u00a0 Here's a look at how police responded to Wednesday's siege at the Capital and the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. On Wednesday, Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol and entered the Senate chamber, despite police presence outside the building.\u00a0 On July 26 last year, federal police pulled down a protester in Portland, Oregon, who was then arrested, according to a photographer who witnessed it. The incident occurred after 56 straight days of demonstrations in the area as people protested the death of George Floyd on May 25. On Wednesday, an officer was seen calmly coaxing back Trump supporters who had broken into the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 On June 22, 2020 in Washington, D.C., racial injustice protesters clashed with U.S. Park Police after they attempted to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson.\u00a0 A large group of Trump backers broke into the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday after growing violent as they protested the results of the presidential election. People in New York City gathered peacefully on September 24, 2020 to protest the Kentucky grand jury's decision to only charge one Louisville Metro Police officer of the several involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. At that protest, and many others, protesters kneeled to peacefully protest the decision.\u00a0 After breaking into the Capitol, Trump supporters entered the Senate chamber on Wednesday, where they searched through documents, went through desks and took photos. When protesters gathered in Rochester, New York, in a demonstration over the death of Daniel Prude roughly four months earlier, they were met with dozens of officers in riot gear. A police officer at the U.S. Capitol helped one of the protesters on Wednesday who had been impacted by chemical agents that police used to try to disperse crowds. \u00a0 In Washington, D.C. on June 22 last year, a woman holds her eyes and screams after being hit with pepper spray as U.S. Park Police stand behind her. Racial justice protesters had previously attempted to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson near the White House.  Trump supporters who took part in the siege of the U.S. Capitol stole items from the building. This man took House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern and carried it through the building's Rotunda as he smiled and waved to photographers.\u00a0 Following an incident in which a police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back, police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, set up an armed perimeter around the Kenosha County Courthouse.\u00a0 Some Trump supporters who were in Washington, D.C. on January 6 to protest the results of the election formed a mob that scaled and stormed the U.S. Capitol. Soon after George Floyd's death, police pointed guns at protesters at protesters laying on the ground. As the electoral college protest became more violent on Wednesday, Trump supporters confronted police and attempted to break through a barrier before they eventually stormed the Capitol building.  Just days after George Floyd's death, protesters in New York clashed with police during a May 28 protest. Many of the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol building\u00a0gathered in the Senate Chamber to search through desks and documents and take photos of their destruction.  In Brooklyn, New York, on May 29 last year, police officers sprayed tear gas at demonstrators who were protesting the police killing of George Floyd just days earlier in Minneapolis.

            "article_content": "That tall, amiable sheriff and his little boy, Opie, heading to a fishing hole on the outskirts of Mayberry, North Carolina, at the start of \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" were actually strolling along a backlot in Culver City, California. Ron Howard, the actor who played Opie, is now one of Hollywood's top directors. Most of the other stars \u2013 Andy Griffith; Don Knotts, who played his deputy, Barney Fife; and the actors who played Aunt Bee and Floyd the Barber \u2013 they've all passed on. After all, it's been 53 years since the show was cancelled.  So, it may come as something of a surprise to learn that Mayberry is doing just fine, even though its actual name is Mount Airy, and its only genuine link to \"The Andy Griffith Show\" is that Griffith was born and grew up here. \"Andy Griffith, God bless him, if he had not been born in this particular little town, we wouldn't be standing here having that conversation,\" said Randy Collins, president and CEO of the Greater Mount Airy Chamber of Commerce.  He's recalling when North Carolina's tobacco and textile industries had the stuffing knocked out of them: \"After the mills closed, I think a lot of the town fathers and the business owners got together and said, 'Hey, you know, what about this Mayberry thing? Maybe we can do something with it.' And businesses were born, or reinvented.\" \"It's a little bizarre, isn't it?\" asked \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel. \"It went off the air more than 50 years ago.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"It captured a reality that never was.\" \"True; Mayberry is fictitious,\" Collins said. \"Most everyone knows that! Except maybe some of the rabid fans of the show. They believe it's real.\" And, let it be said, the town isn't doing a whole lot to undermine the illusion. Stop by at Wally's filling station, and you can get a ride around town in a vintage Ford Galaxy squad car. These days there's a whole fleet of them carting tourists around town. Once a month or so, Betty Lynn, who played Barney Fife's girlfriend Thelma Lou, is brought from a nearby retirement home to the Andy Griffith Museum, where crowds of appreciative fans line up for autographs. \"I'm from Arkansas, I've been waiting to see you for 30 years!\" said one woman. \"I can die now!\" Collins said, \"We are constantly looking at other ways that we can promote the community, 'cause we know the Mayberry generation won't be here forever.\u00a0 But now with streaming television, Andy will be forever with us, and we hope a younger generation will pick it up.\" As if on cue, the Foster family, from Pomeroy, Ohio, showed up. It is no exaggeration to say that this re-creation verges, for the Fosters, on being a national monument.\u00a0  Koppel asked the Fosters, \"You watch 'The Andy Griffith Show' four hours a day?\" \"More than that,\" said Bobby Foster.  \"What do you mean, 'more than that'?\" \"It's on sometimes early in the morning,\" Sarah Foster explained.  \"Aren't you afraid that after a month or two of watching four hours or more a day, that you're gonna turn his little brain to mush?\" \"No!\" young Isaiah replied.\u00a0 \"Oh, no!\" said Sarah. \"Not when it comes to good, wholesome shows.\" \"Tell me why you like it so much?\" \"Good, clean comedy fun,\" said Bobby.  \"Yeah, good, clean comedy,\" Sarah said. \"Has morals, values. You don't see that a lot today in TV.\" Down on Main Street, where tourists peek into Floyd's barber shop or grab a bite at the Snappy Lunch diner (\"We drove from Louisiana for the famous pork chop sandwich!\" said one man), you hear the same theme. One man told Koppel, \"I think the generations now long for that simplicity of the episodes of Andy being real with his son about stealing or doing the right thing, and as a godless society that we see today is longing for simple life. Back when neighbors were neighbors, and they provided for everybody else.\u00a0  \"What do you see, Mr. Koppel? Let me flip it back on you. I know you're doing this, but what do you see?\" \"What you're saying is true of certain people,\" said Koppel. \"If you were Black in the '60s, things were not all that good for you.\" \"That's true. True.\" \"If you were a Vietnam vet coming back, things were not all that good for you.\"\u00a0  \"Spat on and hated, yeah,\" said the man.  What actually happened during the years the program first played \u2013 the Cuban missile crisis, the assassination of President Kennedy, the Vietnam War, marches by African Americans for the right to vote \u2013 those events never intruded inside Mayberry's imaginary town limits.  Mayberry is where more than 30 million Americans a week went to escape reality, which is why it's strange to find so many people half a century later searching for what made America great in a copy of a town that never was.  And, as Randy Collins of the Chamber of Commerce acknowledges, African Americans were all but invisible on \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" \"There were very few speaking parts,\" he said.  [Actually, only one: Rockne Tarkington played Opie's football coach, Flip Conroy, in one episode.]  Collins said, \"If you watch closely in the crowd scenes, I think Andy and others on the show pushed to make sure that there were people of color in the crowds, but you have to look closely.\" Maggie Rosser is in her 90s now. She and her younger brother and sister were all born here in Mount Airy, left, and returned. \"I moved back here, 1973,\" Rosser said. \"So, we wanted a sandwich. And went in our Main Street, and they served us, but we had to go out and eat.\" \"They wouldn't let you sit?\" asked Koppel. \"So, even in 1973, or a little bit after?\" \"A little bit after, yes,\" she said.  Bobby Scales, also born and raised in Mount Airy, has a clear memory of race relations in the '60s: \"Blacks knew where they belonged, and Whites knew where you belonged, too!\" he laughed. \"And everything was segregated.\" Evelyn Scales Thompson (Bobby's twin) said, \"Black people didn't exist. In making those programs, it was for basically the White population.\" She believes she understands the ongoing popularity of the program: \"It's appealing to people who are not familiar with small towns. And what Andy has projected is a quiet, peaceful town with everybody happy. Everybody's looking for peace.\" \"So, Mayberry, Mount Airy, good place to live?\" asked Koppel.  \"It's a good place,\" Thompson replied. \"If it were not home, I would not be here.\" \"Unwrap that for me! I mean, your home is where you make it.\" \"Yes, but not where you were born and your memories and family.\" \"But if your memories are mostly memories of being treated as the lesser, why would you wanna stay?\" \"Well, I wasn't treated as a lesser in my family,\" Thompson replied. \"I have family history. Our property is there, and memories of childhood is still very strong. I'm very satisfied being retired in the place where I grew up.\" \"Somehow,\" Koppel said, \"Mount Airy becomes more complex with each conversation.\" \"I bet! I bet! Yes, indeed,\" Thompson said.  Mount Airy is a place where fantasy and reality intersect.  Koppel asked Collins, \"If I wave the political thermometer across the forehead of Mount Airy, do people here believe that Joe Biden is the legitimate president?\" \"That's a good question,\" he replied. \"Our former president had a lot of support here. If you took a poll, that would probably not lean in our current president's favor.\" As for the visitors? For twenty bucks a pop, they get to ride on a trolley car tour of Mount Airy. Sometimes a fella in a deputy's uniform (who does look a little like Barney Fife) rides along. The Elvis impersonator was an unexplained bonus \u2013 as was the entire crew from \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" Koppel asked the trolley's riders, \"I know you came here to have a good time and not to talk politics. But let me just ask you, as a matter of curiosity, how many of you think we had a fair election?\" \"No way!\" said one man wearing an American flag T-shirt with the word \"Patriotism.\"  \"I saw two hands go up,\" Koppel said. \"So, is it fair to say the rest of you think that it was not a fair election?\" \"No, no. No, it wasn't. I don't think it was at all,\" said the man.  Another man said, \"I think there was a lot of voter fraud. It's never been proven. There's been people that's voted that's been dead 15 years. I think it's more the mail-in ballot stuff. You don't know how much of those that were duplicated, triplicated. The whole bit.\" A third man said, \"Look how many dead people voted for Biden.\"\u00a0  Koppel asked, \"One question, it's a serious question and I know you all will take it seriously: Tell me what you think happened on January 6 at Congress?\" The first man said, \"They showed truckloads of people that they were bringing in for this. It was all staged. And that's how it started. They even showed pictures of it on the news, about these vehicles coming in with all these BLM people.\" Another man, who believed the election was fair, called the January 6 attack, \"A disgrace on our country.\" \"Whose fault was it?\" Koppel asked. The man smiled.  One rider did blame Donald Trump, but he was in a distinct minority. A woman said, \"I think it was staged. We've been to a lot of the Trump rallies, and I don't understand why they're focusing so much on that one issue when there's so many cities that are being burned down every day by protesters. It's supposed to be peaceful. But it's all focused on holding these two people.\" \"Murder and kill everybody there \u2013 hang 'em, put 'em in jail,\" said the first man.  Another woman said, \"We don't even watch news on TV anymore. We don't feel like we're being told the truth. And we find our truth in other ways. And I won't say what those other ways are, but I feel like we're not being told the truth, because we're trying to be swayed in a direction that we know is not the right direction.\" \"I won't be offended,\" Koppel said. \"I've been a journalist all my life. When President Trump talked about the press being the enemy of the people \u2026\" \"They are!\" the woman replied. \"And I love President Trump. And I love that man. I do.\" A third woman said, \"I just hope when this airs, it won't show Southerners as a bunch of dumb idiots. Like so many parts of the country do, you know? We have a lot of love in our hearts. We love our country. We love our fellow man. And if the rest of the country felt like that, it would be a better place.\" A fourth man asked, \"Mr. Koppel, can I say something? This conversation about politics and division is what people come here to get away from. We don't care what color you are. We don't even care what your politics are. We just want to be good neighbors and treat everybody alike. And that's why they're coming here.\" The Barney Fife impersonator added, \"That's what America should be.\" And, when the script was written in Hollywood, that's the way it was. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Dustin Stephens.

            "article_content": "Some WNBA players celebrated on Wednesday after Democrat Raphael Warnock was projected to defeat incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler in a critical Senate runoff election in Georgia. WNBA players campaigned for Warnock after Loeffler, the co-owner of the WNBA team the Atlanta Dream, criticized the league's support for the Black Lives Matter movement.\u00a0 \"Woke up and just smiled remembering that one time Kelly Loeffler tried to come for the W and we helped\u00a0@ReverendWarnock\u00a0take her senate seat,\" New York Liberty player Layshia Clarendon tweeted Wednesday. \"Winning never felt so damn good.\" \"Not only is Raphael Warnock Georgia's first black senator, but also the first Black democratic senator EVER elected in the south,\" wrote\u00a0Phoenix Mercury forward Brianna Turner. \"50 years ago that was unimaginable. I wonder where the south will be 50 years from today.\" The WNBA and the Atlanta Dream made headlines with their league-wide support of Black Lives Matter during the summer with BLM warm-ups and jerseys, a statement Loeffler rejected in June and asked WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert to end.\u00a0 In a statement deriding the protest in August, Loeffler called the players' shirts a sign of cancel culture. \"This is just more proof that the out of control cancel culture wants to shut out anyone who disagrees with them,\" she said. \"It's clear that the league is more concerned with playing politics than basketball, and I stand by what I wrote in June.\" In response, the Atlanta Dream and other high ranking members of the WNBA\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Reverend Warnock, going so far as to wear \"Vote Warnock\" shirts at their games.\u00a0 A post shared by Elizabeth Williams (@e_williams_1) Atlanta Dream forward Elizabeth Williams told The New York Times that the idea for the shirts came from WNBA Seattle Storm legend Sue Bird. Bird, who shared a photo of herself in the Warnock t-shirt on Wednesday,\u00a0told Deadspin\u00a0last month that the players chose not to attack Loeffler and to support Warnock instead.\u00a0 \"We found this voice we have together is pretty powerful,\" Bird told the sports outlet. \"The size of our league allows for this, we have about 144 players in the league, but we've had to go through our careers fighting for things... So we've developed this backbone and we've learned to fight for ourselves. And now we're lending that fight to others.\" The Times also reported that the idea was discussed and approved by Stacey Abrams, who holds an advisory position to the WNBA Players Association's board. Only two days after players wore the shirts, the campaign raised more than $185,000 online, added 3,500 grassroots donors and grew Warnock's Twitter account by nearly 3,500 followers, a campaign official told CBS News.\u00a0 I am proud of these players. Thank you for connecting the dots between social justice & voting. @ReverendWarnock is one of the bright stars vying to for U.S. Senate in Georgia - he\u2019s got this. https://t.co/w6nAFG0p6K Players maintained their activism in the months that followed, serving as poll workers and\u00a0shining a light on racial justice causes\u00a0in the months leading up to Election Day. Dream player Renee Montgomery opted out of last season entirely to fight for social justice reform and voter advocacy in Georgia. Some Dream players narrated a\u00a0\"More Than A Vote\" ad\u00a0released Monday that called for people to vote in the Georgia runoff races. In the video, Williams called on her followers to vote for Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the other Democrat running for a Senate seat.\u00a0 Warnock is poised to be the first Black senator in Georgia history. Exit poll data shows he won 92% of the state's Black vote. \u00a0\u00a0 \"We were told that we couldn't win this election,\" Warnock said while addressing supporters Wednesday. \"But tonight we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible. May my story be an inspiration to some young person who is trying to grasp and grab hold of the American dream.\" While the WNBA's protest also called for Loeffler's removal, neither she nor co-owner Mary Brock have said the Dream is for sale. However, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James put his hat in the ring as a potential buyer,\u00a0suggesting on Twitter\u00a0that he wants to \"put together an ownership group\" to purchase the team. James, who leads More Than a Vote, also said he was \"proud\" of what he saw from Georgia voters on Tuesday.\u00a0 \"I'm proud of my people for getting out there and doing what they do best,\" James\u00a0told reporters.\u00a0\"And that's being heard and being seen and being powerful and being engaged.\"",

            "article_content": "The WNBA announced the sale of the Atlanta Dream to a group that includes former player Renee Montgomery on Friday. It ends co-ownership that included conservative former Senator Kelly Loeffler, who was at odds with players\u00a0last summer over their support of Black Lives Matter. \u00a0 The sale to Montgomery, Larry Gottesdiener, chairman of national real estate company Northland, and Northland president and chief operating officer Suzanne Abair was unanimously approved by the WNBA and its board of governors, the league said.\u00a0 \"With the unanimous WNBA and NBA votes, today marks a new beginning for the Atlanta Dream organization and we are very pleased to welcome Larry Gottesdiener and Suzanne Abair to the WNBA,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in statement. \"I admire their passion for women's basketball, but more importantly, have been impressed with their values. I am also thrilled that former WNBA star Renee Montgomery will be joining the ownership group as an investor and executive for the team. Renee is a trailblazer who has made a major impact both in the game and beyond.\"\u00a0 Montgomery, a two-time WNBA champion, will be the first former player to become both an owner and executive of a WNBA team, according to the league. She sat out the 2020 season to focus on social justice issues and recently announced her retirement from the league from 11 seasons.\u00a0 \"My Dream has come true,\" Montgomery said in a statement. \"Breaking barriers for minorities and women by being the first former WNBA player to have both a stake in ownership and a leadership role with the team is an opportunity that I take very seriously. I invite you to join me as the Dream builds momentum in Atlanta!\" A WNBA spokesperson told CBS News on January 20 that the team was on the verge of being sold. It also marked the same day Loeffler would be finishing out her term as senator.\u00a0 The WNBA and the Dream made headlines with their\u00a0league-wide support of Black Lives Matter during the summer with BLM warm-up outfits and jerseys. But Loeffler objected to the practice in June and asked WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert to put an end to it.\u00a0 In a statement deriding the protest in August, Loeffler called the players' shirts a sign of \"cancel culture.\" In response, the Dream and other members of the WNBA\u00a0endorsed\u00a0one of her Senate opponents, Democrat Raphael Warnock, going so far as to wear \"Vote Warnock\" shirts at their games. Loeffler was defeated by\u00a0Warnock\u00a0in a January 5 runoff election in which both incumbent Republican senators from Georgia lost to Democratic challengers, shifting the balance of power in the Senate.
